AILING GIRL GETS DEGREE IN DETERMINATION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can find the definition of courage and heart
living in a home over on Ballinger Street in the L.A. suburb of
Northridge. Find it in the body and mind of an incredible
14-year-old girl named Ashley Baim.
</P>
<P>
   She just did something that's never been done before in this
city. She went from eighth grade at Frost Middle School straight
through high school in two months _ passing the California High
School Proficiency Examination, the legal equivalent of a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   How she did it _ and why _ is the kind of story that makes you
want to stand up and cheer for this little girl. And cry.
</P>
<P>
   Because with all the wonderful things she has going for her,
there is one thing she doesn't have. Time.
</P>
<P>
   Cystic fibrosis is working its cruel, life-threatening, genetic
disorder on her young body, and the dream of every teen-age school
kid _ someday walking across a high school stage to receive a
diploma with the rest of your classmates _ was taken from her this
June when it became just too hard for Ashley to continue attending
regular school anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So she had to come home to continue school, but she wouldn't let
go of her graduation dream. If she couldn't go to high school, well
_ why couldn't high school come to her?
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Hansen looked down at the middle-school test scores of
her newest home school student, and she shook her head. The kid had
scored 12s on the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement all the
way across the line. Ashley was already testing academically at a
high school senior level.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the next page that stopped Hansen cold. Even though
there were long absences from school because of Ashley's hospital
stays, her teachers at Frost sung her praises.
</P>
<P>
   ``An outstanding worker,'' one said. ``Tremendously successful
and popular with her peers,'' wrote another. ``Never uses her
absences to shirk responsibilities, always completes makeup and
late assignments,'' said yet another.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 years of teaching home school at Carlson, she had never
seen teachers take the time to hand out compliments like this.
</P>
<P>
   So they crammed _ home teacher and student. Cutting corners on
four years of high school in two months, to make the mid-November
testing. The next test after that wouldn't be until next April _ a
long, eight months away for a kid with cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She constantly challenged me,'' Hansen said. ``We cut through
a lot of material because Ashley would tell me not to worry about
it, she could already do that. We concentrated hard on essay
writing, because there was still a lot of vocabulary and terms this
little girl hadn't had the chance to tackle yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They worked in half-hour sessions because anything longer than
that and Ashley would begin to lose focus and strength. Because of
this, the plan was to spread the testing _ which is normally done
in three-hour blocks _ over two weeks, 30 minutes a session.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it came time to take the test, Ashley was so fired
up, she finished it in two hour-and-a-half sessions,'' Hansen said.
``In 40 years of home school in the Los Angeles school district,
something like this has never been done before. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   The call from California Proficiency Testing came the day before
Thanksgiving. Congratulations, your daughter had passed the test,
the man on the line said. Ashley's high school equivalency diploma
was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Baim put down the phone, and didn't know whether to laugh
or cry. She told her husband, Larry, and they told Ashley's older
sister, Emily, and older brother, Zack.
</P>
<P>
   Then they all called Ashley into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of more pictures left on a roll in the
camera, and my mom said she wanted to get some more shots of all of
us together,'' Ashley said. ``She said I wasn't smiling enough, so
she was going to tell me something to make me smile more.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I had passed. I said: `Yeah _ right, Mom.' `No,
really,' she said. `You passed.' They just called. I let out a big
scream. I was so excited. I really wanted that diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never have done it without my family supporting me,
and my teachers at Frost who taught me so much,'' Ashley said.
``And, of course, Mrs. Hansen, who became like a granny to me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!boxes!
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a beautiful day for a high school graduation.
Dozens of cars lined Ballinger Street, as about 50 people filed
into the Baim home for the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen was there, all decked out. Her schoolbooks left at home.
Ashley's physical therapist and respiratory therapist, along with
her doctor at Encino-Tarzana Medical Center, were there. So were a
lot of Ashley's relatives and friends, including Dara Moss, her
``bestest friend,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   They all stood as ``Pomp and Circumstance'' was played on the
piano, applauding as a young, beautiful girl walked out of her
bedroom wearing a cap and gown.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the room, Ashley spotted her brother, Zack.
``Love you,'' she shouted out to her older brother, who also has
cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody smiled, and wiped away the tears.
</P>
<P>
   And then the assistant principal at Carlson, Gene Nelson, walked
to the front of the living room, presenting Ashley with her coveted
diploma, as Stephanie Hansen looked on, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, you really nailed that test,'' Nelson
said, as everyone applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley thanked him, hugged her mom and dad, and then invited
everyone to join her for a grad night party in the den.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone ate, and later took a turn belting out a song to
karaoke.
</P>
<P>
   When it came her turn, Ashley sang ``I Will Survive.''

   LOS ANGELES _ USC guard Quincy Wilder left the basketball team
for a day last week and considered transferring because he was
upset over playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder departed last Thursday but returned to the team Friday,
although he was suspended from that night's game against UC Santa
Barbara for missing classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Quincy is having some problems, like every kid who's
been a star,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``I'm sure he's not
getting the minutes he would like. Again, I don't dictate the
minutes, the players do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to play, you have to show me something. We have
five coaches evaluating who should be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, a junior college transfer from Highline Community
College in Des Moines, Wash., has averaged 5.0 points and 1.75
assists per game in 14.5 minutes of action. He is a former Mr.
Washington, who was considered the top guard in the state two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder has played point guard for the Trojans, although he
played shooting guard in high school and junior college. He
transferred to USC with teammate Brian Scalabrine, who is USC's
leading scorer (14.4 points) and rebounder (7.6).
</P>
<P>
   __ Turner returns: Forward Jarvis Turner will likely start
against Loyola Marymount on Wednesday, after being suspended with
Wilder for missing a pair of classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is you have to go to class,'' Bibby said.
``Absences have to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Thomas out: Quarterback Jason Thomas, who was expected to
play football and basketball for the Trojans, said he will not play
basketball this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to concentrate on football,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   He redshirted in football this season after undergoing ankle
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a football school: Some fans have complained about the
change in the start of last Monday's St. Bonaventure game from 7
p.m. to 5 p.m. The time change was made about three weeks before
the game, because of an ``(athletic) department scheduling
conflict,'' according to a USC spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was that football coach Paul Hackett threw a party
for his wife that evening at a downtown Los Angeles hotel, which
was attended by many athletic-department employees.
</P>
<P>
   __ Moving on up: The Trojans received 24 votes in the Associated
Press Top 25 poll this week and are tied for 38th overall. That's
twice as many votes as the Trojans received last week.

Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of

   MELBOURNE _ Just over 57 years ago, at 7.55 A.M. on Dec. 7,
1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on American forces at Pearl
Harbor in Hawaii, thrusting the United States into the crucible of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in a footnote to his memoirs, ``Pacific
Encounters,'' Marshall Green, onetime U.S. deputy assistant
secretary of state for the Far East, wrote that Joseph Grew, the
American envoy in Japan when the Pacific War broke out, believed to
the day he died in 1965 that war could have been avoided without
sacrificing any U.S. or Allied principles or interests.
</P>
<P>
   Green began his diplomatic career as private secretary to Grew.
It was, he wrote, a golden opportunity to observe at firsthand how
one of America's greatest diplomats performed under fire, including
his frequent warnings to Washington not to press too far with
embargoes unless it was prepared militarily to live with the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Green was followed as Grew's private secretary by Bob Fearey. In
the December 1991 issue of the Foreign Service Journal, Fearey
wrote an account of Grew's support for the then Prime Minister
Prince Konoye's ``fervent desire for peace, backed by the Emperor,
for a face-to-face meeting with President Roosevelt to achieve a
settlement of all outstanding issues and reverse the trend toward
war.''
</P>
<P>
   To protest Japan's activities in China and incursion into
Indochina, Washington had put an embargo on the export of aviation
fuel and iron ore to Japan, and had frozen all Japanese assets in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As these sanctions began to bite, Prince Konoye on Aug. 28,
1941, proposed a meeting with Roosevelt in Hawaii to ``solve the
unsolvable.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt countered with the proposal that the two should meet
aboard a battleship off Alaska. Prince Konoye accepted and had a
ship standing by secretly at Yokohama to convey his delegation to
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Army leaders, backed by an inflammatory
anti-American propaganda campaign, were now strongly in favor of
war against the United States. Prince Konoye knew that time was
rapidly running out.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, Emperor Hirohito presided over a
conference on Sept. 6, attended among others by General Hideki
Tojo, the war minister. The meeting decided that if diplomatic
efforts had failed by early October, Japan would determine on war
with the United States, Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Grew's repeated warnings to Washington of the dangers in putting
too much pressure on Japan were received skeptically in the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   It did not share his confidence in the outcome of a meeting
between Prince Konoye and Roosevelt, and discounted the view that
desperation would push Japan into war. The department's insistence
on agreement before the meeting on the battleship, and not at the
meeting itself, finally scuppered the plan.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-October, the United States had neither agreed to nor
rejected Prince Konoye's view that all decisions should be made at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Konoye resigned, and on Oct. 17, Tojo became prime
minister and war minister. Less than two months later, the bombs
fell on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Could the war, as Grew believed, have been averted by the
Alaskan meeting?
</P>
<P>
   Grew's optimism was based partly on a long and deeply secret
talk with Prince Konoye on the night of Sept. 6, after the
conference with the emperor. It was also based on his assumption
that since the Alaskan meeting carried the imperial imprimatur, the
army component of the Japanese delegation would accept any
concessions he made.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Prince Konoye would have been able to make real
concessions is another matter. Tojo was agreeable to the meeting
only if the Japanese side made clear to the United States that if
it failed to understand and accept Tokyo's aspirations it would
mean war.
</P>
<P>
   If Grew had been proved right, however, what then? Might we have
been spared the horrors of the Pacific war? And what of the war
with Germany?
</P>
<P>
   Hitler invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. In weeks, the
Nazi blitzkrieg had smashed its way deep toward Moscow. The Soviets
appeared all but defeated and dreaded the possibility of a Japanese
attack in the east.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months of signing a neutrality pact with Japan,
Stalin knew that Tokyo was contemplating an attack on Siberia.
Forty Soviet divisions, all of them desperately needed in the
defense of the western sector, were tied up in the east and could
not be moved while the Japanese threat remained.
</P>
<P>
   At this critical moment, a Soviet spy ring in Tokyo headed by
Richard Sorge, a German correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung,
came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge was on terms of complete trust with the German ambassador,
while Ozaki Hotsumi, his principal Japanese collaborator, was a
member of Prince Konoye's brain trust. From these sources, the two
spies drew out highly classified intelligence, which they sent to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   From Sorge, Stalin got advance warning of the planned German
attack on the Soviet Union. In May 1941, he reported that between
170 and 190 German divisions would be concentrated for the attack,
which he predicted would begin on June 20, an estimate that erred
by two days.
</P>
<P>
   The German Embassy in Tokyo at this time was doing its best to
persuade Japan to enter the war against the Soviet Union. By the
end of August 1941, however, Sorge was able to report the
encouraging news that the embassy had lost all hope of Japan
joining the war against Russia in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, with the Germany Army near Moscow, he transmitted
the intelligence Stalin most wanted to hear: Tokyo had decided to
embark on a major military campaign to the south, capturing
Singapore and attacking the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to attack to the north had been abandoned. Japan no longer
posed a serious threat to the Soviet Union. Reinforcements could
now safely be rushed across the Trans-Siberian railroad for the
defense of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   By Nov. 17, they had arrived in Moscow. Less than a month later,
Pearl Harbor was bombed. The threat to Moscow was never so acute
again.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Grew was correct in his assumption that the Pacific War
could have been averted, it is difficult to believe that the likely
alternative _ a combined German-Japanese attack on the Soviet Union
_ would not have led inevitably to a war involving the United
States, probably in circumstances that would have been far less
favorable to the Allies.  &LR;  &QL;

PROBABLY NO TROPHY FOR McNOWN MANTLE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA quarterback Cade McNown departs this week for
the Downtown Athletic Club in New York. He's not expected to return
with a certain piece of hardware in his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's Heisman Trophy candidacy was consistent this season: He
trailed Texas tailback Ricky Williams in September and he trailed
Williams in November. His brilliant performance in Miami (513
yards, six touchdowns) probably won't change the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   McNown is not expected to win the Heisman on Saturday. In fact,
he might finish third, behind Williams and Kansas State quarterback
Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the fact that people are impressed with Ricky
Williams breaking the NCAA (career) rushing record and rushing for
over 2,000 yards this season, I certainly think he's the front
runner,'' UCLA media-relations director Marc Dellins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that people waited to send their ballots in.
Anybody who saw Cade play Saturday knows why we feel he's the best
player in the country, and certainly the most valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A theory: UCLA's tackling against Miami was horrific, but the
Bruins' biggest problem was their inability to create turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 games, the defense caused an average of four turnovers
per game. That's four possessions, which translates to 10-14 points
and about 150 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was the first UCLA opponent that didn't commit a turnover.
Subtract 14 points and 150 yards from the Hurricanes' total, and
suddenly it's a typically porous _ but not pathetic _ game for
UCLA's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Just think how many points Oregon would have scored without five
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Another theory: When asked if the defense was distracted or
uninterested or simply overwhelmed, one offensive player shook his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``First play, their leader went down,'' he said. ``From there, I
could see it in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Miami's first play, senior linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, the
emotional leader and big-play maker, sprained the medial collateral
ligament in his left knee. He returned for one play, then watched
the rest of the game on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   __ The schedule: The Bruins will conduct light workouts today
and Thursday, then have full-contact practices Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They'll take next week off for final exams, then practice Dec.
18-19 and 21-23 before breaking for Christmas. They are due back in
town Dec. 26 to begin Rose Bowl preparations.
</P>
<P>
   __ Which season is this? Monday afternoon, freshmen DeShaun
Foster, Julius Williams and Ken Pritchett defeated three
upperclassmen in several hotly contested basketball games at Pauley
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got heart,'' Foster said. ``But they can't play.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ Just over 57 years ago, at 7.55 A.M. on Dec. 7,
1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on American forces at Pearl
Harbor in Hawaii, thrusting the United States into the crucible of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in a footnote to his memoirs, ``Pacific
Encounters,'' Marshall Green, onetime U.S. deputy assistant
secretary of state for the Far East, wrote that Joseph Grew, the
American envoy in Japan when the Pacific War broke out, believed to
the day he died in 1965 that war could have been avoided without
sacrificing any U.S. or Allied principles or interests.
</P>
<P>
   Green began his diplomatic career as private secretary to Grew.
It was, he wrote, a golden opportunity to observe at firsthand how
one of America's greatest diplomats performed under fire, including
his frequent warnings to Washington not to press too far with
embargoes unless it was prepared militarily to live with the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Green was followed as Grew's private secretary by Bob Fearey. In
the December 1991 issue of the Foreign Service Journal, Fearey
wrote an account of Grew's support for the then Prime Minister
Prince Konoye's ``fervent desire for peace, backed by the Emperor,
for a face-to-face meeting with President Roosevelt to achieve a
settlement of all outstanding issues and reverse the trend toward
war.''
</P>
<P>
   To protest Japan's activities in China and incursion into
Indochina, Washington had put an embargo on the export of aviation
fuel and iron ore to Japan, and had frozen all Japanese assets in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As these sanctions began to bite, Prince Konoye on Aug. 28,
1941, proposed a meeting with Roosevelt in Hawaii to ``solve the
unsolvable.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt countered with the proposal that the two should meet
aboard a battleship off Alaska. Prince Konoye accepted and had a
ship standing by secretly at Yokohama to convey his delegation to
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Army leaders, backed by an inflammatory
anti-American propaganda campaign, were now strongly in favor of
war against the United States. Prince Konoye knew that time was
rapidly running out.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, Emperor Hirohito presided over a
conference on Sept. 6, attended among others by General Hideki
Tojo, the war minister. The meeting decided that if diplomatic
efforts had failed by early October, Japan would determine on war
with the United States, Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Grew's repeated warnings to Washington of the dangers in putting
too much pressure on Japan were received skeptically in the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   It did not share his confidence in the outcome of a meeting
between Prince Konoye and Roosevelt, and discounted the view that
desperation would push Japan into war. The department's insistence
on agreement before the meeting on the battleship, and not at the
meeting itself, finally scuppered the plan.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-October, the United States had neither agreed to nor
rejected Prince Konoye's view that all decisions should be made at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Konoye resigned, and on Oct. 17, Tojo became prime
minister and war minister. Less than two months later, the bombs
fell on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Could the war, as Grew believed, have been averted by the
Alaskan meeting?
</P>
<P>
   Grew's optimism was based partly on a long and deeply secret
talk with Prince Konoye on the night of Sept. 6, after the
conference with the emperor. It was also based on his assumption
that since the Alaskan meeting carried the imperial imprimatur, the
army component of the Japanese delegation would accept any
concessions he made.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Prince Konoye would have been able to make real
concessions is another matter. Tojo was agreeable to the meeting
only if the Japanese side made clear to the United States that if
it failed to understand and accept Tokyo's aspirations it would
mean war.
</P>
<P>
   If Grew had been proved right, however, what then? Might we have
been spared the horrors of the Pacific war? And what of the war
with Germany?
</P>
<P>
   Hitler invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. In weeks, the
Nazi blitzkrieg had smashed its way deep toward Moscow. The Soviets
appeared all but defeated and dreaded the possibility of a Japanese
attack in the east.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months of signing a neutrality pact with Japan,
Stalin knew that Tokyo was contemplating an attack on Siberia.
Forty Soviet divisions, all of them desperately needed in the
defense of the western sector, were tied up in the east and could
not be moved while the Japanese threat remained.
</P>
<P>
   At this critical moment, a Soviet spy ring in Tokyo headed by
Richard Sorge, a German correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung,
came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge was on terms of complete trust with the German ambassador,
while Ozaki Hotsumi, his principal Japanese collaborator, was a
member of Prince Konoye's brain trust. From these sources, the two
spies drew out highly classified intelligence, which they sent to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   From Sorge, Stalin got advance warning of the planned German
attack on the Soviet Union. In May 1941, he reported that between
170 and 190 German divisions would be concentrated for the attack,
which he predicted would begin on June 20, an estimate that erred
by two days.
</P>
<P>
   The German Embassy in Tokyo at this time was doing its best to
persuade Japan to enter the war against the Soviet Union. By the
end of August 1941, however, Sorge was able to report the
encouraging news that the embassy had lost all hope of Japan
joining the war against Russia in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, with the Germany Army near Moscow, he transmitted
the intelligence Stalin most wanted to hear: Tokyo had decided to
embark on a major military campaign to the south, capturing
Singapore and attacking the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to attack to the north had been abandoned. Japan no longer
posed a serious threat to the Soviet Union. Reinforcements could
now safely be rushed across the Trans-Siberian railroad for the
defense of Moscow.
</P>

Pearl Harbor was bombed. The threat to Moscow was never so acute
again.
</P>
<P>

could have been averted, it is difficult to believe that the likely

_ would not have led inevitably to a war involving the United
States, probably in circumstances that would have been far less

   WASHINGTON _ Political power does wonders for self-esteem. Two
years ago, Oskar Lafontaine came to Washington as an apparently
fading star of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, his anxious
body language radiating insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he was back exuding confidence as his country's new
economic and financial supremo, arguably one of the most powerful
men in Europe. His transformation, however, is not necessarily good
news for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In his few weeks in office, he has alienated German business
with ill-conceived plans to increase corporate tax burdens and
raised questions over who really runs the country, he or the
weak-looking Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   By energetically pursuing old-fashioned socialist economic
remedies, Lafontaine has undercut Schroeder's pre-election pledge
to forge a pro-business ``new center'' in German politics, based
loosely on the ``New Labour'' policies of the British prime
minister, Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   As if to drive home the point, Lafontaine has upset Blair's
government with calls for tax standardization throughout the
European Union, to raise taxes in Britain and other countries
closer to high German levels, and by challenging Britain's
unquestioned right under EU procedures to veto his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Lafontaine has aroused fears both in Europe and
in the United States that the old unreconstructed European left is
back in charge _ aided and abetted, in Germany at least, by
dangerously woolly-minded environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The question all this raises is whether Germany's European and
American partners are right to be afraid _ or will Lafontaine's
bark turn out to be worse than his bite?
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lafontaine has somewhat muffled his bark. He has
complained, too often to be totally convincing, that his
pronouncements have been twisted to exaggerate his more extreme
views and eliminate the balancing elements.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, he went out of his way to sound reasonable. He
played down his proposal for target zones for international
exchange rates, especially for the dollar and euro, and said he was
not proposing much more than an extension of the kind of
stabilization achieved between the Deutsche mark and dollar since
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that, appearances to the contrary, he supports the
independence of the new European Central Bank, which will set
interest rates in the 11 countries introducing the euro from Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   And he promised there was no risk that Germany would breach the
European Union's stability pact by running a budget deficit higher
than 3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he said that his proposals to bolster demand through
monetary, wage and possibly fiscal measures were only part of a
policy mix that would also include supply-side structural reforms,
for example by improving Germany's social security system.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that Lafontaine is toning down his bark because he is
discovering that his bite is not going to be as sharp as he thought
_ just as the French Socialists did after unexpectedly taking power
last year.
</P>
<P>
   As Mark Howdle of Salomon Smith Barney in London pointed out,
European developments over the past 20 years, including the EU
single market, free capital flows, the stability pact and economic
and monetary union, have progressively limited the scope for
governments to adopt leftist policies.
</P>
<P>
   It seems, however, that Lafontaine's aim is to circumvent that
hurdle by establishing his policies at a European level, now that
11 of the 15 EU governments are broadly of the center-left.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are he will fail. His policies will certainly not solve
Germany's or Europe's unemployment problems. But Europe looked
safer before Lafontaine recaptured his self-esteem. &QL;

NFL RECONSIDERS INSTANT REPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The legacy of The Call might be more than just a
crushing Seahawks loss. After two weeks of high-profile officiating
gaffes that culminated in Sunday's Seahawks game against the New
York Jets, the NFL is considering a return to instant replay for
this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   League spokesman Joe Browne confirmed Monday that if the owners
approve, ``a limited form of replay for use in the upcoming
postseason is a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't help the Seahawks, who fell to 6-7 and were all but
eliminated from postseason play when the Jets' Vinny Testaverde was
given a game-winning touchdown despite being stopped just shy of
the end zone in the final seconds of Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson said he doubted instant replay
would be instituted before next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they? Oh, no,'' Erickson said. ``Instant replay will take
forever to get in. It's got to go to the owners, then it's got to
go to the league meetings, then it's got to be voted on. They can,
if they decide they want to, get it in there. ... But, again, you
won't see it until next year, if you see it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seeman, the NFL's senior director of officiating, called
Erickson Monday and admitted officials erred. But if instant replay
were in place, it's likely that phone call _ and all of this
controversy _ never would have happened. The new replay system
would likely take the form used in preseason experiments _ with
coaches given a limited number of challenges per game and referees
making the final decision from monitors on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   But it also would be what one league official called
``liberal,'' meaning that if a coach is out of challenges on a
game-deciding play, he would be allowed an additional one.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay failed by two votes last year, but several teams
that voted it down seem likely to approve it next time. The Buffalo
Bills, who were hurt by blown calls in a loss to New England Nov.
29, now say they would vote for it, and indications are San Diego
and Tampa Bay also would change their votes. The expansion
Cleveland Browns, led by instant replay proponent Carmen Policy,
likely would vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks always have voted for instant replay, and Erickson
said the reasons are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``To right wrongs,'' he said. ``I think there are too many times
that something can be changed that are critical in a game. You've
got to save it for the right time, that's part of the thing too,
but at least you can correct something that's wrong that may cause
the outcome of the game (to be affected).
</P>
<P>
   `` ... They've been voting on it every year, and the same guys
voted against it. Maybe now that they've seen some of these things
happen, they'll sit down and really look at it and decide it's
probably the best thing. Obviously, we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jets coach Bill Parcells voted against replay.
Last year, he voted yes after the Jets were victims of bad calls by
officials in the final game against Detroit that left them out of
the playoffs. But Parcells said he hates the challenge system that
was tested during the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be opposed to anything that deviates from the premise
of getting the calls correct,'' he said. `` ... There is one
objective _ get the calls right. Not some of the calls, not the
calls in the second half or the last quarter or only in the end
zone. It's to get the calls right.''
</P>
<P>
   The system tried in exhibitions involves giving coaches limited
challenges on calls _ perhaps two per half or two a game _ with the
referee making the final decision after viewing the play on a
sideline monitor.
</P>
<P>
   That would help end the objections to the system in effect from
1986 to 1991, which used a replay official in a booth and was
filled with endless challenges and endless delays, some lasting
longer than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Few pretend that replay solves everything. Steelers president
Dan Rooney said last week he thinks officials are overly managed
already, leading to indecision.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks-Jets game is an example. Phil Luckett, the referee
in that game, said that once head linesman Earnie Frantz signaled
touchdown, as he did almost as soon as Testaverde hit the ground,
the debate was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he had signaled a touchdown, so far as we're concerned
it's over,'' Luckett said.
</P>
<P>
   But NFL rules specify that if another official disagrees with
the call, the referee can reverse it. On Sunday night in Minnesota,
referee Bob McElwee reversed himself after he ruled a fumble and
other officials said Steve Stenstrom's knee had hit the ground
before the ball came out.
</P>
<P>
   The difference may be that Luckett, who is well-regarded by
coaches and players, is in his second year as a crew chief and his
eighth as an NFL official. McElwee is in his 23rd year as an
official, most of those as a referee.

   MANILA _ The Asian crisis has been a sharp reminder that for
most of the region, a thriving rural sector provides the best
underpinning of growth. Now, governments are again looking at their
agricultural policies.
</P>
<P>
   Attention in recent years has been almost entirely focused on
industrialization and investment in the urban sectors. That
generated very rapid growth but, as it turned out, overinvestment
and inefficient use of resources.
</P>
<P>
   There cannot be rapid growth without urbanization and a shift to
manufacturing, which usually brings higher valued-added. But the
move needs to be backed by rising farm productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has had an impact on the rural sector in three
ways:
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia and the Philippines, drought in some regions, a
result of the El Nino weather phenomenon, caused huge drops in
output and more suffering than the financial crisis. Recovery seems
to be rapid, however.
</P>
<P>
   Currency devaluations and rising food prices caused a huge shift
in the internal terms of trade in favor of farmers and were a
bonanza for exporters, especially palm-oil producers, who saw
soaring world prices.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, even in an Indonesia ravaged by drought and recession,
rural consumption has increased 10 percent over the past year,
according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal deficits have forced governments to rethink subsidies,
whether to keep food prices low for consumers or reduce farm input
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, the end of some commodity monopolies has also
helped farmers. Policy is generally shifting from food
self-sufficiency to maximizing farm incomes via market forces,
relying on imports to fill supply gaps.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis has also been a reminder of how well most East
Asian countries were doing down on the farm and what a stabilizing
force a strong rural sector can be at a time of financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable long-term achievement has been that of
Malaysia. Although productivity of farm workers is still only 52
percent of the average for the economy, it has been increasing at a
faster rate _ an astonishing 6 percent a year over the last 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly a result of investment in technology and partly
of replacement of rubber plantations with oil palm, which is much
less labor-intensive. It also abandoned attempts at rice
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's achievements were driven by a labor shortage. But,
according to the Asian Development Bank, China (4 percent) and
Indonesia (3.5 percent), two countries where labor is plentiful,
also have shown creditable gains in farm-worker productivity that
have underpinned urbanization, releasing labor for industry while
keeping agricultural production growing fast enough to deliver
rising living standards to a growing population.
</P>
<P>
   Land productivity for these leaders shows similar patterns, with
Malaysia (6 percent a year) at the top of the league, followed by
Indonesia (5.5 percent) and China (5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has been less successful, its increases in output being
more a result of land and labor inputs. Productivity of land and
labor has increased by only 2.5 percent a year, which helps explain
why the rural/urban income gap in Thailand is so conspicuous
despite the growth of non-farm income in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable exception to Southeast Asia's record of success
has been the Philippines, where rural infrastructure investment has
been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have had scant incentives, as most productivity gains
have been siphoned off by landlords and intermediaries. A
persistently overvalued currency has been another obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future around the region, there seem to be three
dangers: First, that a pre-crisis trend to lower investment in and
support for agriculture will continue and will undermine
productivity growth; second, that return of national prosperity
will mean the return of subsidies and other distortions, and third,
that the richer countries will follow the examples of Japan,
Europe, South Korea and Taiwan in setting high farm prices. &QL;

BLOWN CALLS DAMAGE NFL'S CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The discussion is beyond heated now. It is at full
boil.
</P>
<P>
   After another weekend of abysmal calls, NFL officials are being
lambasted as scared, pathetic weekend zebras.
</P>
<P>
   By now the most reviled man in America, Phil ``I Heard Tails, Or
Was That Heads?'' Luckett, has become a living, and we think
breathing, incarnation of a Chevy Chase character.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't so tragic watching Luckett and other henpecked
officials cower through NFL games, it would be a downright
knee-slapper.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, if you are Seahawk coach Dennis Erickson or
anyone remotely associated with the Hawks. For them, the blown call
that cost the Hawks a victory Sunday against the Jets was a joke
that rendered a perfectly excellent NFL game meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   This undeserved defeat _ the final crush for the underachieving
Seahawks' playoffs chances _ has become more fodder for a national
referendum on the state of NFL officiating. The Hawks' misfortune
is the final piece of glaring evidence that demonstrates NFL
officials need the technical support of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Until NFL owners vote again _ and there is growing indication
from the now-incensed owners that instant replay will be reinstated
_ the only thing a victimized team like the Seahawks can do is take
Sunday's travesty as a personal insult.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a Seahawk fan, coach, player, observer, bartender or
sportswriter who has not waited about four seasons for a win as
captivating, as fantastic, as deserved as the one Jon Kitna &AMP; Crew
were executing against Vinny Testaverde and The Tuna on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was, simply, a great game _ from Kitna's touchdown bombs to
Testaverde's dramatic decision to run the quarterback draw.
</P>
<P>
   But then, ``the call.'' What a rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   If Erickson has felt his entire tenure in Seattle has been
jinxed, beginning with the end of The Behring Years, what must the
coach really think about his luck now, thanks to Mr. Luckett?
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the NFL made another one of its sorry calls. Yep, the
refs blew your game, the Seahawks were told. Merry Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   On the local level, there was this intense irony to the
officials' horrendous call: It came when Erickson's entire,
embattled tenure was getting a single, if only symbolic, boost of
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   We're not suggesting that beating the Jets would have put the
Seahawks in the playoffs. Nor are we suggesting that Erickson's job
could have been irrefutably salvaged with the win Sunday _ not when
3-0 had fallen to 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   However, if there is such a thing as going down a winner, if
there is such a thing as a moral victory, the Seahawks had all but
secured that. Now, if they do go 9-7 and just miss the playoffs,
who from the NFL office will call and say sorry again?
</P>
<P>
   Some of us knee-jerk baseball fans thought American League
umpire Ted Hendry's ever-shifting strike zone was the ultimate in
officiating buffoonary.
</P>
<P>
   No. Baseball's umpiring woes, which are deeply ingrained because
baseball umps are full-timers with a mega-powerful union, are out
of sight right now, out of mind.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, with the absence of the NBA, our sporting eyes have
fallen squarely on the little juggernaut run by NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue. And for the most part, the NFL has been decent
filler.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie has starred as ``The Little Man That Could.'' Randy
Moss and Randall Cunningham have been splendid in Minnesota. John
Elway is making undefeated Denver the epicenter for NFL history.
And best of all, there is a Super Bowl brewing between the Vikings
and Broncos _ a terrific showdown that could help sell a lot of
beer and sport utility vehicles this January.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL should be licking its chops over this steady stream of
great copy and high-flying highlights. Instead, there is
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL did away with instant replay because certain owners
liked the human aspect of a game being officiated on the field.
Also, the delays that took place with review of the videotape was
seen as a monstrous drag on the action.
</P>
<P>
   Hello? Are these the same people who have failed to notice that
with a $17.6 billion TV contract through 2005, the lengths of
today's commercial-packed NFL games are longer than a Ken Starr
investigation?
</P>
<P>
   There is absolutely no logical reason for not reinstating the
one thing that can right a wrong. After the Colts were called
losers against the 49ers; after Flutie and the Bills were robbed in
Foxboro; after the Steelers' coin-toss call fell on deaf ears on
Thanksgiving, and after the Hawks were jobbed in Jersey, there is
no question.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials have lodged themselves into the top spot of
questionable competence, along with the Republican majority in
Congress, among those whom America depends on to make the right
call.
</P>
<P>
   To err is human. But to err so many times, in so many critical
games, almost certainly means that without instant replay, the
credibility of the NFL is up for grabs, to say nothing of the
competency of one Mr. Luckett.
</P>

SPACEWALKERS CONNECT ELECTRICAL MODULES &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: updated material included) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman, floating outside
the shuttle Endeavour on Monday night, successfully connected
dozens of crucial electrical power and computer signal cables
between American and Russian modules of the new international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 10 p.m. CST, Russian ground control teams radioed
commands to their ``Zarya'' power and propulsion station module,
allowing electricity generated by its winglike solar collectors to
flow into the U.S. ``Unity'' module and a pair of essential flight
control computers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good connection with good data,'' Endeavour
commander Bob Cabana informed mission control. The shuttle skipper
monitored the status of the current flow between the modules
through a laptop computer aboard Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Cabana confirmed the flow of computer signals between
the modules through the new cabling.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian crew aboard Endeavour joined the Zarya
module to Unity on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's near seven-hour excursion, the first of three planned
by the two men this week, was considered by far the most crucial.
Without the 40 cable connections by Ross and Newman, the power
generated by Zarya would not reach the computers and other
electronics aboard Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Power is essential to Unity, a 33-foot cylinder with a
half-dozen docking ports that will link future station components,
including stabilizing gyroscopes, a U.S. laboratory, an airlock and
more powerful solar collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assembly sequence stops if we can't get these avionics
(electronics) working,'' said NASA flight director Bob Castle,
before the spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalkers crawled from an airlock in the shuttle's cargo
bay shortly after 4 p.m. and never looked back as they raced
through their tasks, at one point working 90 minutes ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, oh my,'' gushed Ross, his attention momentarily drawn to
the brilliant rays of the sun setting on the Earth's horizon 240
miles below. ``We're going around the world awfully fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Unity and Zarya modules towered nearly eight stories above
the airlock, secured to Endeavour's docking mechanism for the
series of spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The pace with which Ross, Newman and their shuttle colleagues
worked reflected the more than 500 hours of ground training the two
veteran spacewalkers received to prepare them for the often tedious
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's only setback was the loss of a fist-sized, metal
tool that spacewalking astronauts can plug into station modules to
temporarily park larger pieces of equipment. The socket tool got
away from Ross and rose above the nose of Endeavour before the
astronauts lost sight of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, a 50-year-old Air Force colonel who had logged four
previous spacewalks, secured himself on the tip of Endeavour's
50-foot robot arm, which afforded a mobile platform from which to
connect the cables.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, 42, a physicist who conducted a previous spacewalk five
years ago, unstowed each of the snaking 20-foot cables bound to the
outside of the two modules at three different work sites, handing
them to his colleague in a prearranged sequence. Newman worked from
a portable mechanical foot restraint that he moved and plugged into
anchoring receptacles located around the work sites.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting them from inside the shuttle were Nancy Currie,
Endeavour's robot arm operator, and pilot Rick Sturckow, their
timekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's spacewalk called for Ross and Newman to work first at
the base of the Unity module, which was latched to the shuttle's
docking mechanism, where they connected their first eight cables.
</P>
<P>
   Each time his colleague handed him a new power line, Ross would
remove a protective cover installed before the equipment was
launched to prevent debris from lodging between the connector pins.
Using his helmet light, Ross also inspected the dozens of fragile
pins in each connector to ensure they had not been bent.
</P>
<P>
   Ross carried a ``pin straightener'' tool to correct deviants,
and in one instance he found canted plug pins that he repositioned
before making the connections.
</P>
<P>
   Cold temperatures, as low as 200 degrees below zero, had
stiffened some of the thick cables. More than once, Ross and Newman
jokingly referred to the electrical bundles as ``the octopus'' as
they wrestled them into position.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cables were plugged to a receptacle, a twist of Ross'
wrist moved a locking collar into place to prevent separation. He
also slipped a sleeve of fabric thermal insulation over each
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Newman finished their assignment by moving to the top
of Unity, where the U.S. module was joined to Zarya. There they
made the rest of the connections.
</P>
<P>
   The final half-dozen connections made it possible for the power
generated by Zarya's solar collectors to flow into Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Newman worked so quickly that they had time to install
foot restraints and handles on the outside of the two modules,
tasks they had not been slated to attempt until their second and
third spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   NASA planned to give Endeavour's six astronauts a half-day off
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   today.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's second excursion was scheduled for Wednesday.
After donning spacesuits, Ross and Newman will install a pair of
communications antennas on the outside of Unity, allowing mission
control teams in Houston to monitor activities aboard the new
station over a NASA satellite network rather than through Russian
ground stations.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
You know you've had a bad day when Steve Spurrier sends
condolences.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I really feel sad for Kansas State,'' Florida's
take-no-prisoners coach said after hearing that the just-declawed
Wildcats had slipped out of the Bowl Championship Series. ``That
game (K-State's 36-33 loss in the Big 12 Championship Game) was the
biggest thing in their school history, and now they're up there
with not much of anything but a bowl trip.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so San Antonio is hardly anyone's idea of a bad trip, but it
wasn't quite what K-State had in mind. Nor was that the only bit of
inexplicable news as college football's Judgment Saturday and
Selection Sunday created winners, losers and some strange
bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   Sit by the phone, and suddenly you were on your way to the
Fiesta Bowl. Drop the ball at the wrong time, and you were making
plans to enjoy the River Walk. Get a bad call on a fumble, and next
thing you know, you're staring daggers at a Rose Bowl rep _ just
the sort of fellow you used to love to see coming.
</P>
<P>
   Weird business, to be sure, though losses by Kansas State and
UCLA at least helped sort things out a little bit. That won't keep
the Wildcats and Bruins from feeling sorry for themselves after
redefining the term ``costly turnover,'' and Ohio State no doubt
will continue to plead its ``what about us?'' case from Bourbon
Street.
</P>
<P>
   As the BCS closes down its computer for the year, the cry for a
playoff may be louder than ever, and some of the weekend's more
absurd images just might help move the process along.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida State coach Bobby Bowden sat on his couch and took
in the war of attrition on television, Phillip Fulmer's Tennessee
Volunteers found themselves trailing Mississippi State in the
fourth quarter of the Southeastern Conference Championship Game in
Atlanta. The Vols were able to pull it out, but had they not, it's
likely Ohio State and Florida State _ two teams idle and barely
breathing at the start of the day _ would have been headed to
Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to have these championship games, I'd like to
see everyone have one,'' Fulmer said. ``It would make it a little
more fair.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the dust settled on Sunday, Phil Fulmer wasn't the
only one raising the fairness issue. Money talked, bowl officials
listened, and the sacrosanct system _ the one BCS backers are so
intent on saving _ took yet another hit in the credibility
department.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, Steve Spurrier sends his best. He'll also do so from the
Orange Bowl, where his 9-2 Gators are in for a $12 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   As for K-State? It's 11-1 and just a fumble away from Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the sights of the Alamo City, Wildcats. And when you
stroll by the river, do your best not to fall in, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a season-long theme, the talk isn't so much
about who is coming but who won't be able to make the date.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee started the season without Peyton Manning, the top
pick in the NFL draft, leaving the quarterback job to junior Tee
Martin. The successor to the legend isn't in Manning's league as a
passer, but Martin made the big plays when he had to and did so
again Saturday night in rallying the Vols past Mississippi State
with a pair of late touchdown throws.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, is running back Jamal Lewis, who injured a knee in
midseason. A televised report Sunday indicated Lewis could be back
for the Fiesta Bowl, but Fulmer dismissed that as ``extremely
doubtful, since he's just gotten off crutches.''
</P>
<P>
   And just when things were settling down a bit, offensive
coordinator David Cutcliffe was named head coach at Mississippi,
where he starts work this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll be a distraction,'' Fulmer said. ``Maybe
it'll be an advantage if we end up with a few different wrinkles
offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU knows something about changing on the fly, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles, upset early by North Carolina State, were just
beginning to roll when quarterback Chris Weinke suffered a
season-ending neck injury. Bowden expects him back next summer, but
backup Marcus Outzen gets the call in the Fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   Having wide receiver Peter Warrick as a pass-catching, running
and passing threat (he threw for a touchdown off an end-around
against Florida) to lean on should make things easier for Outzen.
So should the nation's No. 1 defense, which held rival Florida to
204 yards, the Gators' worst offensive output in more than eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   If this one comes down to a field goal, each team is
well-legged. Tennessee's Jeff Hall and FSU's Sebastian Janikowski
are two of the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar
</P>
<P>
   Folks in New Orleans expected Florida State and Kansas State in
what was shaping up as an ``alternative'' national-title game.
Instead, they get Texas A&AMP;M and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   One is delighted to be coming. The other is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a goal of winning the national championship,'' said
Buckeyes coach John Cooper. ``Sometimes, you adjust those goals on
the run.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cooper's team shows up in New Orleans with a computer chip on
its shoulder, the Buckeyes might have more than their attitude
adjusted by an A&AMP;M team that may not need a plane to make the trip.
In rallying from 15 points down to stun Kansas State in the Big 12
Championship Game, the Aggies proceeded to knock the Wildcats out
of the Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a late-season loss to Michigan State, the Buckeyes field
as much talent as any team in the country. Wide receiver David
Boston (from Humble), linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer and cornerback
Antoine Winfield are among the nation's best at their positions,
and quarterback Joe Germaine was beginning to get some Heisman
Trophy mention prior to the Michigan State loss.
</P>
<P>
   Rose
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the joy of being a Rose Bowl rep in the UCLA locker room
Saturday evening in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, don't.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of playing for the national title turned into visions of
playing a glorified home game, all because of a fumble that
apparently wasn't. Now, the Bruins will have to regroup in time to
face a Wisconsin team that will feel very differently about the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers lost to Michigan but earned a three-way tie for the
Big Ten title with the Wolverines and Ohio State. Wisconsin got the
Rose bid by virtue of having gone least recently.
</P>
<P>
   While UCLA rings up points and stats with a passing game led by
quarterback Cade McNown _ who was nothing short of brilliant in the
loss to Miami _ the Badgers grind it out, with huge Ron Dayne doing
most of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   At least this game has the Big Ten-Pac-10 tradition going for
it. It also could turn out to be an old-style Rose Bowl where the
kids from the Midwest go to California, soak up some rays _ then
spend the game chasing their quicker, faster opponents from the
coast to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes, of course, that UCLA decides to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Orange
</P>
<P>
   Gee, wouldn't Kansas State have looked good here?
</P>
<P>
   Nah
</P>
<P>
   The fix for this one was in last week, but Ohio State was the
one being squeezed in order to make room for Spurrier and the
Gators. Already saddled with 8-3 Syracuse (an automatic BCS
qualifier as the Big East champion), the Orange was determined to
add local color, and orange and blue will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Florida isn't up to snuff, as its season-long offensive
struggles attest, but this is a pretty respectable 9-2. The losses,
after all, came against Tennessee (20-17 in overtime) and Florida
State (23-12 in Tallahassee), and we know what those kids will be
up to come January.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, the Gators would be a lock in this
one, but circumstances are hardly normal in Gainesville. Defensive
coordinator Bob Stoops has taken the head coaching job at Oklahoma,
while running-backs coach Carl Franks is the new head man at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier, of course, remains. And even though his team made the
field, he remains one of the most outspoken advocates of a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other sport does it,'' he said. ``Why we can't is beyond
me.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ Several Baylor football players met with athletic director
Tom Stanton late in the season and said they were unhappy and would
consider transferring to another school if Dave Roberts were not
replaced as the Bears' coach, sources confirmed Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roberts, who had back-to-back 2-9 seasons at Baylor, was
reassigned within the athletic department Sunday. Stanton would
neither confirm nor deny the players had spoken to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into any details of my evaluation,''
Stanton said. ``The kids in the program are important to me. The
opportunity of the kids to realize their dreams is what we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be competitive in the Big 12 and go to bowl games.
In order for us to attain that and have the kids move forward and
win, I felt the right step was to change leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The man believed to be the No. 1 choice of Stanton is former
Alabama coach Gene Stallings, who led the Crimson Tide to the 1992
national championship. Stallings, 63, retired after the 1996 season
and lives on his ranch near Paris, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings was in Jacksonville, Fla., on Monday for a speaking
engagement and could not be reached for comment, but Sunday night
he said he considered a return to coaching ``slim'' but would talk
to Baylor officials if they called.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings is committed to coaching a college all-star team that
will play in Italy in July, but sources say that stumbling block
could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began the search process this morning,'' Stanton said
Monday. ``I have a list of candidates that will remain
confidential, but I feel very comfortable with that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Other names believed to be on Stanton's list include former
Auburn coach Terry Bowden, Southern Mississippi coach Jeff Bower
and former Colorado coach Bill McCartney. Also under consideration
is Highland Park High School coach Scott Smith, who could be hired
as an assistant and be groomed to take over as the head coach in
two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's announcement on Roberts came as a surprise to some
Baylor fans, but the reasons for the action became more clear with
the information about the disenchantment of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Odell James, the MacArthur product who shared time at
quarterback this season with Jermaine Alfred, was displeased with
his situation late in the year and told Roberts he wanted to change
positions, but Roberts would not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Had Roberts remained the head coach, sources say a few Baylor
players were considering transferring to Stephen F. Austin if
former Baylor coach Chuck Reedy is hired by the Lumberjacks to
replace John Pearce. No decision has been made at SFA. Reedy was
the offensive coordinator at South Carolina and a member of the
coaching staff that was fired at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sources also say Stanton had heard from disgruntled prominent
alumni who wanted Roberts out, and Stanton learned several of the
Baylor assistant coaches were unhappy working under Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of all these factors apparently played into the
decision Stanton made over the weekend to make a coaching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time reviewing and assessing where we are, as
I do at the end of every season,'' Stanton said. ``It took a little
longer than I anticipated. After the evaluation, I made a
recommendation to president (Robert) Sloan to reassign coach
Roberts. That is a closed chapter now, and we'll move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said he wants to find a new coach as quickly as
possible, but he wouldn't rush the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible, but I don't think it's likely something
will happen in the next two or three days,'' Stanton said. ``I
don't have a timetable in terms of saying something will be done in
three or four days. If it takes five days or 10 days, that's what
it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may see me as a knee-jerk-reaction guy, but I'm not. I
wanted to make sure whatever decision I made was the right decision
for our players and the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who was the offensive coordinator at Notre Dame under
Lou Holtz, was the first major hire for Stanton after taking over
as the athletic director in the spring of 1996. Stanton was asked
if he now views that hire as a bad decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fair question, but I'm proud Dave coached here and
don't look back on it as a mistake,'' Stanton said. ``I look at it
as a transition and evolution of our football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a certain set of circumstances surrounding our
football program at that time. We were looking for discipline and
wanted someone who had been involved with a big program, along with
someone with private-school experience and expertise. Dave fit the
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said it is ``business as usual'' for the assistant
coaches, but the person selected as the new head coach will have
the final say on selecting his staff.
</P>
<P>
   One assistant coach definitely will not be back. Linebackers
coach Andy McCollum, who is considered the team's best recruiter,
is expected to be named the head coach at Middle Tennessee State
today.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE last thing you need to hear today is more caterwauling about
the injustices of the Bowl Championship Series. We know it's
unfair, the same as we know war is bad, wine is good, and love can
go either way.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, one grad's anguish is another's alum's ecstasy. None of
you Farmers or Teasips is complaining this morning, are you? Thanks
to the BCS, Texas and Texas A&AMP;M have been afforded the unique
privilege of participating in the Cotton and Sugar bowls,
respectively, on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Longhorns have been playing football since 1893 and
the Aggies since 1894, such a convergence is historic. So historic
that it has never occurred before. But it could have, and probably
should have.
</P>
<P>
   Inequities, lest we forget in our interminable hand-wringing,
aren't exactly a recent phenomenon in the colleges' ever-capricious
postseason. A quick search of the A&AMP;M-Texas archives reveals one
particularly striking example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, only a couple weeks preceding Pearl Harbor, D.X.
Bible's then-10th-ranked Longhorns laid waste to Homer Norton's
second-ranked Aggies at Kyle Field 23-0 as if the visitors were
trying to reprise Germany's rout of Poland. A week later, the
'Horns destroyed Oregon 71-7.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't work. See, before thumping the Aggies, Texas had lapsed,
blowing its No. 1 ranking by tying Baylor, then losing to TCU.
Hence, No. 9 A&AMP;M went to the Cotton Bowl as SWC champion by half a
game. The Longhorns, despite having risen back to No. 4, stayed
home.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons lost to the sands of time, the Sugar selected
Fordham and Missouri (getting a 2-0 score to show for the
decision). The Orange, in turn, took TCU over Texas _ the Frogs
had, after all, upset the 'Horns _ to face Georgia. And the Rose
Bowl, snubbing UT's overtures, pitted Oregon State against Duke at
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy bowl was moved to Carolina out of fear of
possible Japanese airstrikes on California. Guess Austin wasn't
quite far enough east. But get this: Minnesota won the national
championship without going anywhere, choosing to stay home with the
whole world suddenly turned upside down. And there were, of course,
no other bowls to barter with back then. To early-1940s Americans,
a term such as ``Insight.com'' would have been as incomprehensible
as Sanskrit.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, today's jumbled BCS mess suddenly seems the stuff
of genius. Nonetheless, as evolved as our society has become, in
theory anyway, can't there exist a more effective way to identify
the national champion?
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's not a simple business to overhaul. Even an eight-team
bracket, a popular solution being bandied about as we speak, leaves
the door open for considerable error. How could you truly defend
leaving an 11-0 Tulane out of such a mix? And didn't Syracuse, a
lowly No. 15 in the BCS, lay a 53-point licking on the Miami team
that subsequently destroyed UCLA's title hopes? Neither would have
made the cut at eight.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent weekend's dramatics suggest a possibly safe
passage through the minefield. The first Saturday in December could
serve, in effect, as a round of 16 for an NCAA postseason football
tournament, with the Big 12 and SEC championship games
grandfathered into the system, serving as two of the matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Big Ten to expand to 12 members and create a title
fight of its own _ a frequent topic of conjecture _ it, too, would
be included in the mix. The other pairings would be determined by a
BCS-type system utilizing seedings not unlike March Madness' to
determine who plays whom and where. Revenues might then be shared
equally among all the qualifiers to alleviate the pressure of
worrying about who gets the home games.
</P>
<P>
   For the eight teams advancing, there would be no more football
until the New Year with the Rose, Fiesta, Sugar and Orange bowls
serving as the Elite Eight round. The break would give the athletes
the same semblance of a Christmas respite they enjoy now, and there
would be nothing to interfere with all the usual pre-bowl color and
pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   The December losers, meanwhile, would return to the pool from
which the other bowls could pick. There would be plenty of
attractive matchups, maybe more than we have at present.
</P>
<P>
   Football's Final Four would follow the second weekend in January
at two of the same four sites _ turnaround time is no problem for
stadiums during the NFL playoffs _ with a third hosting the title
game, always on the weekend before the Super Bowl, when the NFL is
dark.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation for hosting the semis and the grand finale would
work exactly as it does currently. The whopping bonus income
generated by the three additional games would more than compensate
for whatever trivial complications and difficulties are created.
</P>
<P>
   Money may not buy happiness, but we would all agree it tends to
provide a sizable down payment. Eventually, the NCAA and the big
bowls will see the light. Everyone knows there's a more logical,
more profitable way.

WEARY IACENDA TO LEAVE USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC sophomore fullback Ted Iacenda, weary over the
negative publicity and atmosphere that has surrounded his college
career, has decided to transfer to another school.
</P>
<P>
   The former Hart High School star is no longer practicing with
the Trojans and will not play in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda's departure is not football related, but stems from the
emotional rollercoaster he went through for nearly two years after
being charged _ and subsequently cleared _ of sexual assault
charges brought during his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I needed a change based on my case,'' Iacenda said. ``I
needed to get away because that's been with me since I've been
here. Every time I met with somebody, that would be the first thing
that came to their mind. The dirty looks or people speaking about
it never stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda started six games this season, and rushed eight times
for 38 yards. His biggest moment of the season came in the Arizona
State game, when he caught a two-point conversion from Carson
Palmer in the fourth quarter of the Trojans' 35-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   He started four games as a redshirt freshman before dislocating
his left shoulder. Following last season, he had surgery on both
shoulders and sat out USC's final three games this season because
of lingering soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda was one of the area's most prolific high school running
backs.
</P>
<P>
   He led Hart to the Division II title in 1995 and was a two-time
Division II Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda scored a Southern Section-record 99 touchdowns at Hart,
and had 604 points in his career, second-most in state history.
</P>
<P>
   He also rushed for more than 4,000 yards, and the Indians were
35-5 in his three years on the varsity. But he has gotten few
carries at USC, where the fullback is not featured in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda said he has not decided where he will transfer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Young to interview: Defensive coordinator Bill Young said he
will interview with the University of Hawaii possibly as early as
today for the vacancy created by the firing of coach Fred vonAppen.
</P>
<P>
   The front runners for the job are Utah coach Ron McBride,
Arizona assistant coach Duane Akina and San Diego Chargers coach
June Jones. Young interviewed for the job three years ago, before
vonAppen was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called and asked if I had an interest,'' Young said.
``I'm not sure where I rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii athletic director Hugh Yoshida called USC coach Paul
Hackett for permission to speak to Young. Yoshida had also made
inquiries last week about former USC coach John Robinson, before he
took the Nevada-Las Vegas job.

   LOS ANGELES _ Looking to reduce Medicare costs, President

more than $2 billion government payments for several drugs,

<P>
   The Clinton administration is trying to close a loophole that
lets health care providers receive significantly more money from
the government for drugs given to Medicare patients than what they
pay manufacturers for the products. The differential amounts to as
much as one-third of some providers' revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For Amgen, the proposed cuts would lower by 10 percent the
amount the government reimburses kidney dialysis centers for the
anti-anemia drug Epogen. How much Amgen actually is paid for the
product by the centers will continue to be negotiated on an
individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Epogen sales last year amounted to $1.16 billion, or about half
of Amgen's revenue, much of it paid for indirectly by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, kidney dialysis centers say they have gone years
without an increase in Medicare reimbursement for overall dialysis
care, and argue that the Epogen payments help keep them afloat. A
government panel is now considering increasing dialysis
reimbursement rates and will make a recommendation next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress failed to pass a proposal similar to
Clinton's latest last year. Should it decline to pass the new
measure in the coming legislative session, Clinton is expected to
implement the cut through Medicare regulations, which do not
require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen shares rose $1.5625 Monday to close at $80.3125.

BROWN IN TOWN FOR VISITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Right-hander Kevin Brown, the final major free
agent remaining in this record-shattering offseason, will be in
Southern California the next two days to meet with the Angels and
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, seeking at least a six-year, $72 million contract after
consecutive World Series appearances, will visit the Angels today.
He then will speak Wednesday with Dodgers president Bob Graziano
and general manager Kevin Malone at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A deal is expected to be completed by the baseball winter
meetings in Nashville, which begin Friday and run through December
15.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are coming off the sting of losing free-agent
left-hander Randy Johnson, who last week turned down a four-year
contract worth $52 million to sign with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who signed Boston free-agent first baseman Mo Vaughn
to a six-year $80 million contract, are interested in Brown but
might not have the money to swing another big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals, who faltered last season despite Mark
McGwire's record 70 home runs, are believed to be the front runners
for Brown. Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty has an excellent
working relationship with Brown's agent, Scott Boras. In the past
two seasons, St. Louis has agreed to terms with three top Boras
clients from the June amateur draft, including the controversial
J.D. Drew, who refused to sign with Philadelphia the year before.
The others were left-hander Rich Ankiel and Chad Hutchinson, the
former Stanford quarterback who was considered one of the best
right-handers in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Boras also has a strong relationship with Malone but said
recently, ``I'm not sure that will play into this. He has to do
what he has to do and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocketty said Monday the Cardinals have not made an offer for
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies also are interested in Brown. Rockies owner
Jerry McMorris balked publicly at Boras' demand for a six-year
contract, but the two have continued to talk.

PROPOSAL GIVES WELFARE TO RICH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets are fading memories to
the vast majority of Americans, even to the tiny minority among us
who closely follow the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But in Canada, the teams that recently abandoned their small,
hockey-crazed markets in the North for U.S. dollars in Denver and
Phoenix are gone but hardly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a report was released in Canada recommending tax
breaks be given to the remaining small-market teams north of the
border to prevent them from eventually relocating and becoming the
Honolulu Oilers, Biloxi Flames and Coeur d'Alene Senators.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended extending financial breaks to
players who sign with such teams as Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa
(not to mention Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver) to make up for the
disparity between the Canadian and U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   From a cultural standpoint, it's quite understandable that
Canada would want to protect the game that is such an integral part
of its national identity.
</P>
<P>
   But giving tax breaks to those who would seem to need them least
_ billionaire owners and millionaire players _ is welfare for the
rich. In the U.S., this often (though happily not in Los Angeles)
takes the form of municipalities plunging hundreds of millions of
public dollars into new arenas.
</P>
<P>
   If the NHL truly wants to smooth out the disparities between its
richer and poorer franchises, the solution ought not to be tax
dollars better spent on social services. The solution ought to be a
system of revenue sharing among the league's 27 teams.
</P>
<P>
   __ Beyond hockey: Kings goaltending coach Don Edwards had an
eventful day last week in Ottawa, with much more important things
on his mind than hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Edwards' parents were murdered in suburban
Hamilton, Ontario, by the former boyfriend of his sister. Under
Canadian law, the maximum prison sentence is 25 years and sentences
are served simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the killer of Edwards' parents can serve no more than 25
years and is eligible for parole after 15, less than eight years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings in Canada's capital city, Edwards spent his day
lobbying for a bill that would change prison sentences in that
country from concurrent to consecutive. Edwards met with members of
the broadcast and print media, and with Ontario Sen. Frank
Mahovlich, a former NHL star.
</P>
<P>
   In support of the bill, Edwards repeatedly has had to retell the
story of the tragedy that befell his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's therapeutic,'' Edwards said. ``You relive
the horror, but if you can help someone else down the line, that's
what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hot-tempered: During the Kings' loss at Ottawa last week,
center Ray Ferraro received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for
yelling at referee Dennis Larue. The only problem, he said, was
that he hadn't yelled at Larue. He'd yelled, he said, at a Senators
player who had cross-checked him to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unbelievable joke by an official that had no
business calling that penalty,'' Ferraro said. ``That is the most
paranoid official I've ever seen in my life. The guy cross-checked
me from behind, I called him a (bleep), (Larue) puts his hand up
and gives me an unsportsmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says I was yelling at him. If I'm yelling at him, I'll yell
his name. I swear on my kid's head that I was yelling at the
player. . . If I'm yelling at (Larue), I've known him for 20 years
because I used to play junior against him. If I was yelling at him,
I know his name. I would let him know it's him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ High culture: Teemu Selanne and three teammates with the
Mighty Ducks recently attended a taping of ``Jerry Springer,'' an
episode with a Thanksgiving theme (meal included).
</P>
<P>
   The players learned quickly that a front-row seat at
``Springer'' can be almost as dangerous as being on the ice during
an NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hit in the leg with a big slice of cake,'' said Finnish
rookie and food-fight victim Antti Aalto.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne said, ``I had so much fun. Some guy had a wife. But he
didn't want to eat at her table. He wanted to eat at his lover's.
What a mess it was. I can't believe they do this on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to America.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: How sickly are California's NHL teams? The IHL's
Long Beach Ice Dogs have as many victories, 19, as the Kings,
Mighty Ducks and San Jose Sharks combined. . . . Linesmen stepped
in during a recent fight between St. Louis' Tony Twist and
Chicago's Dennis Bonvie, much to the dismay of the combatants. Said
Twist, ``We weren't done yet. There were issues to be addressed. I
was looking to knock his head off.''. . . . Hurricanes goalie
Trevor Kidd on his recent haircut: ``I paid more than $25 for it. I
closed my eyes and when I opened them, I looked like this. They
needed a pick-up truck to get all the hair out.''. . . . Edmonton
defenseman Boris Mironov on playing with a sore ankle: ``I just
tape four Tylenols to it.''

CHARITY GAMES ABOUND FOR PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the giving season, so locked-out NBA players
are returning to the hardwoods this month to play not for
championships but for charities.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the beneficiaries will be children, while in New
Jersey the pros will be playing to support their favorite cause _
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers Shaquille O'Neal and Eddie Jones top a list of 11 NBA
players scheduled to play Sunday in the Chris Mills Charity Game at
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. Proceeds will go to reading programs and
the United Way via a foundation established by Mills, the former
Fairfax High standout.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Showtime announced it will televise an
agents-organized exhibition game Dec. 19 in Atlantic City, N.J.
That game will also raise money for charity, but is intended
primarily to bolster the lockout fund for out-of-work NBA players
who run short on cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at people who play professional sports, not a lot
of them are financially secure. They make a lot of money and they
also spend a lot of money,'' explained union president and Knicks
star Patrick Ewing. ``No matter how much money (some NBA players)
have made throughout their careers, if they're in need now, then
it's up to us to try and help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The event aims to raise at least $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen players, including Ewing, Karl Malone, Reggie Miller
and Mitch Richmond, are committed to play in the uncreatively named
``The Game on Showtime.'' Organizers are trying to field up to 16
players from the four Dream Teams _ the 1992 and '96 Olympic teams
and the '94 and '98 World Championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan will not play, despite the fact his agent, David
Falk, is one of the primary organizers. Jordan, still waffling on
retirement, ``wouldn't want to send the fans a sort of mixed
message by his participation,'' explained Curtis Polk, president of
Falk's agency.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, a former Dream Teamer, has not yet committed to the
Showtime game, but has confirmed his participation in Sunday's 3
p.m. charity game at UCLA _ provided organizers can find
sufficiently-wide shorts for the big man.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was supposed to play this past weekend in a Dallas-area
charity game organized by Kenny Smith, but the triple-extra-large
shorts provided by organizers didn't fit the 7-1, 315-pound center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked like biker shorts on him,'' Smith said. ``I said,
`Darn, Shaq, you must have put on weight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   An organizer told the Dallas Morning News that O'Neal abstained
because he objected to the Rawlings insignias on the uniforms
(O'Neal is loyal to his own sponsors), but O'Neal insisted that was
not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the pants, man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing Sunday are Pooh Richardson of the Clippers, UCLA
alum Tracy Murray of the Washington Wizards, former Laker Cedric
Ceballos and Boston Celtics guard Kenny Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers swingman Kobe Bryant has been invited to Sunday's game
but has a possible scheduling conflict and has not committed.
Organizers expect a response from Jordan by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ((Tickets for the Chris Mills Charity Game are available at the
door. Upper-level seats are available for $10 and a toy donation
for Toys for Tots. Lower-level seats cost $25. Information:
310-284-2090.))

SCREEN GEMS BACK AS SONY FILM LABEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sony Pictures Entertainment announced Monday that
it is dusting off the Screen Gems name to create a new label for
distributing low- and midbudget movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, which has registered middle-of-the pack performance at the
box office this year after dominating in 1997, said Screen Gems is
designed to market those films more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screen Gems will provide a haven for a type of film that falls
between those currently released by our highly valued Sony Pictures
Classics and the wide-release movies that are more traditionally
developed and released by Columbia Pictures,'' said John Calley,
the studio's chairman and chief executive officer, in written
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``By creating a new label with a targeted marketing capability
for movies that fall into this in-between category, we are in a
unique position among the larger studios,'' said Calley, who has
been credited with reviving the movie business at the Culver City
studio in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were convinced that these movies have not had the
concentrated marketing efforts needed to capture their full
potential in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Sony's rivals have registered strong performance in
specialized distribution operations aimed mostly at the youth
market: Disney's Miramax and Time Warner's New Line Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes when studios are trying to control costs by
focusing on two types of films: pricey potential blockbusters, with
high-price stars, that can draw mass audiences; and low-budget
films aimed at a specific audience, such as teen-agers. Despite
being inexpensive to make, genre films such as low-brow comedies
and slasher-horror films can be hugely profitable. Projects such as
Miramax's ``Scream'' films, Disney's ``The Waterboy'' and 20th
Century Fox's ``There's Something About Mary'' have become hits.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the horror market may have become glutted.
``Urban Legend'' and ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' two
of Sony's most recent horror films, grossed an adequate $36 million
each, while ``Apt Pupil'' managed only $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Screen Gems is expected to become operational over the next six
months. It will acquire and market films for a broader audience
than that attracted by the Classics art-house fare, such as
``Central Station'' and ``Dancing at Lughnasa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Gems name was first used in 1948 for the television
subsidiary of Columbia Pictures. In 1974, Screen Gems became
Columbia Pictures Television.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has closed down two other labels in recent years _
low-budget specialist Triumph and its mainstream TriStar arm _ to
avoid duplication of functions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
asserted Monday that his panel had built a ``compelling case'' for
the impeachment of President Clinton &UR; , &LR;  and for one last time he
called on Clinton and his lawyers to contest the evidence against
the president. &UR;  &LR;  The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., issued his
challenge on the eve of a critical two-day presentation of the
president's case before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, White House allies beseeched the president to
do something more dramatic than merely offer a legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   With sentiment in the Republican-controlled Congress hardening
against Clinton, and his fate dependent on perhaps 20 to 30
wavering moderate Republicans, a chorus of political figures called
for one more public apology by Clinton or a dramatic gesture to
reserve the momentum before the full House votes next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from talking to a number of Republicans that they need
some comfort, some assurance that he understands what he's done,''
said Rep. Peter King, a Long Island Republican who has been trying
to build support for censure instead of impeachment. ``He's got to
make some additions. He's got to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   King added: ``There's no doubt the momentum is against censure
and for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats made the same appeal, with some telling the White
House that the president had to show that he was more concerned
with the possibility of impeachment than with protecting himself
from prosecution for perjury after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good idea if the president again faced the
American people,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The White House played down the chance of such an appearance,
saying Clinton had already shown he was contrite about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky and his deceptions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is second to none in recognizing what was wrong
in his behavior and apologizing to those who he's affected and
hurt,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   As they moved into the final week of their inquiry, Republicans
on the House Judicioary Committee worked behind closed doors Monday
to refine three or four articles of impeachment against Clinton.
And the White House released the names of 14 witnesses who are to
help make Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they would extensively address both
the facts and the law in their appearance before the Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde dismissed the idea of listening once again to
constitutional scholars and legal experts who would make the case
that the founders did not envision impeachment as a punishment for
personal misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard from so many college professors that I think I'm
going to ask if we can get college credit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost two months,'' Hyde added, ``I have been pleading
with the White House and committee Democrats to present some
additional evidence that might demonstrate the president's
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde spoke at a news conference surrounded by four stacks of
legal boxes to remind viewers of the 60,000 pages of evidence sent
to the House by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats shot back that the Republicans were turning American
jurisprudence upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to someone accused of wrongdoing to prove his
innocence,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat. ``It's
up to the person who says he's guilty to prove his guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say it is inevitable that the Judiciary Committee
will report out one to four articles of impeachment against the
president by the end of the week. The committee's Republicans were
working Monday on one or two counts of perjury, a count of
obstruction of justice and a count of abuse of power. They called
the drafts a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fluid,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``It
depends on where we come out when the evidence door is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Graham and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
suggested that Republicans were even considering citing Clinton's
legalistic answers to 81 questions from the House Judiciary
Committee as an instance of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said the answers contained ``willful misstatements of the
facts'' in the way the president characterized his conversations
with his personal secretary, Betty Currie, about gifts he had given
to Ms. Lewinsky and about conversations he had with his secretary
the day after he had denied that he and the intern had an affair
during his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
``I think that he's lying in those answers,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were still debating whether there should
be one count of perjury or two. And they said they were most
divided over whether to charge Clinton with abuse of power.
``That's the one where there's some divergent views,'' said Rep.
Steve Chabot, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Gekas, R-Pa., said he had reservations about
charging abuse of power based on the president's invocations of
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats asserted that the committee was marching ahead with
impeachment even though it had never called witnesses or done
anything to settle discrepancies between witnesses who testified
before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would like the House to censure the president instead
of impeach him. But Hyde said Monday that he had not decided
whether to allow a committee vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ruled out but it's not a dead-bang certainty
either,'' Hyde said, adding that he did not think censure was ``an
appropriate sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before the House Judiciary Committee hears from Clinton's
defenders on Tuesday, it plans to vote to make public the videotape
of Clinton's deposition in the Jones case. Republicans say the vote
is intended to allow their chief investigative counsel, David
Schippers, to show parts of the tape in questioning the president's
representatives or in making his summation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also expected to seek the release of information
still under seal that they consider exculpatory or embarrassing to
the president's accusers. Both Schippers and Abbe D. Lowell, the
Democrats' chief investigative counsel, are to sum up their cases
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee expected to finish its work by Saturday,
strategists for both parties began turning their attention to the
full House. Speaker Newt Gingrich is expected to gavel the House
into session mid-week and then turn the speaker's podium over to
Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., the incoming speaker, or someone he
designates.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats and the White House on Monday began focusing on
20 to 30 Republican moderates who they believe could be persuaded
to oppose impeachment either on the merits or because their
districts voted for Clinton in 1996. ``We've got 10 days here,''
one House Democratic official said. ``There's ample time to
convince them on the politics and the facts themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of moderates is heavily tilted to the Northeast. It
ranges from Republicans who have already come out against
impeachment, like Reps. Jack Quinn of New York and Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, to those who have kept their own counsel,
like Reps. Rick Lazio and Michael Forbes, both from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also looking at Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., on the
theory that he could be vulnerable at home if he voted against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep a censure measure from the House floor,
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, circulated a letter on
Monday co-signed with Shays arguing against censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we disagree on whether President Clinton's lying
constitutes an impeachable offense, we both think every member of
Congress should make that judgment,'' the letter said. ``We oppose
establishing a new precedent _ censure _ when there is an
established method in existence and under way.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood's once-sizzling local production
activity will continue to cool off during the next two years,
officials predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Activity in the key production categories _ television, feature
films and commercials _ will probably be down 8 percent to 10
percent in Los Angeles County during the next two years compared
with its peak in 1997 but should pick up again in 2001, said Cody
Cluff, president of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.,
speaking at the Valley Industry and Commerce Association's annual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Production in county areas outside studio lots has already
slowed down by more than 5 percent this year after growing at a
supercharged 78 percent between 1994 and 1997, when total
production days hit 47,669. This year's decline came amid studios
sending crews to lower-cost locations outside California and
becoming more cautious at funding big-budget projects.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff cited continuing economic turmoil overseas. Exchange rates
that make it cheaper to send production to Canada, and that
country's cap on the number of United States workers allowed to
work there drives the price down further.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, protectionist policies in countries such as France
limit the number of screens on which American films are shown and
the amount of hours given over to U.S. television programs,
limiting demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we're in for a year of slowdown, probably two, and
we should start to turn around again by 2001,'' Cluff said after
his address at the Universal Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   The county has already seen a sharp drop in production activity
in recent months. According to statistics released last month by
the EIDC, activity by film crews shooting on local streets fell by
25.7 percent in September and 18.1 percent in October compared with
the year-ago periods. The slump was due largely to plunges of 41
percent and 44 percent, respectively, in the number of days of
movie production.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff also said employment figures should see some modest gains
this year. The motion picture and television production sector, the
fifth-largest employer in the county, is expected to grow from
235,900 employees last year to 239,200 at the end of this year. An
additional 1,200 jobs will be added next year and 3,600 in 2000,
bringing the total to 244,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not looking at significant job increases over the next
two years _ they're relatively modest,'' Cluff said in an interview
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The growth areas will be in animation and other
technology-related areas, ``which is good news, because those are
the higher-paying jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., had predicted job growth of 7,000 to 8,000 in
the industry next year, but said Cluff's less rosy prediction was
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have strong growth next year, it would be a surprise,
but you always hear rumors that foreign investors are coming in,''
Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said he believes the industry is going through a period of
closer scrutiny on the bottom line. ``Everyone is saying some
practices don't make sense, like opening a lot of high-cost films
against each other, so I think they're adopting a more rational
approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic surveys show direct expenditures generated by the
industry in Los Angeles County reached $27.5 billion in 1997,
compared with $25.5 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Encino, will hold a hearing
on the industry's economic issues Wednesday from 9:30 a.m. to 4
p.m. at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum, 7021 Hollywood Blvd.

COMING TO AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For decades, National Hockey League players
came from the small towns of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia,
and the farms of the Prairie provinces. A select few trickled in
from United States collegiate programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the face of the league has been changing. More and more, it
has taken a European look. In 1967-68, 1.3 percent of the players
were born outside North America. This season, that number is up to
23.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Players from Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union,
the Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden have become a force. Last
year, six of the top 10 scorers were European-born, including the
top three _ Jaromir Jagr, Peter Forsberg and Pavel Bure.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has truly become a reflection of the global community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society has progressed, you know more people of the world than
ever before,'' said Ducks defenseman Fredrick Olausson, who left
Sweden and joined the Winnipeg Jets in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But the transitions that European-born players go through when
they come to North America aren't always easy and are as varied as
the backgrounds of the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Las Vegas, it was really a big difference,''
said Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei of Belarus, who played a season
with the Las Vegas Thunder of the International League before being
drafted in the first round by the Ducks in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he came to the United States with Russian Vladimir
Tsyplakov of the Kings, Salei admits the the glitz and glamour of
Vegas was a bit overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all of America was like Las Vegas,'' he said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks rookie Antti Aalto's first North American season (1997-98)
was spent in the calm atmosphere of Cincinnati, but it was no
laughing matter for the native of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   He had failed to make the Ducks' final cut, didn't speak much
English and then injured an elbow, ending his season last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was ready; I didn't think it was going to be
that tough,'' Aalto admits. ``It was OK to play hockey. But it just
surprised me _ the bus trips and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was homesick after the first months, and I wanted to go home
so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the transition is much easier. The Ducks' Teemu
Selanne of Finland waited four years after he was drafted to join
the Winnipeg club, and he had no problems making the adjustment to
North American life _ on or off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing, energetic Selanne scored an NHL rookie-record 76
goals in the 1992-93 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what kind of person you are,'' Selanne said.
``Being away from home, different language _ some guys don't like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't bother me. My wife and I are both really
positive people. It wouldn't bother us if we played in Alaska. We
always find a way to live and be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Command of the language is probably the biggest obstacle for
European players. It's crucial off the ice, and certainly doesn't
hurt on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedes are way ahead in this department. They learn English
in school and most are fluent by the time they arrive. The Finns,
Czechs and Russians have a much tougher time.
</P>
<P>
   Salei learned German in school and didn't know a world of
English. He admits being envious of a player like current teammate
Johan Davidsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Johan and he came over here and speaks perfect
English,'' Salei said. ``He can communicate with everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year, I would walk in the dressing room and I didn't
know what was going on. The guys were talking about something and
I'd have to ask the other Russian guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you are losing something. . . you aren't in.''
</P>
<P>
   Salei, who has learned to speak English by watching television
and being around English speakers, said it's almost impossible to
bond with other players without a grasp of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can communicate you can go out and have a couple of
beers and talk,'' he said. ``(When you don't speak English), what
are you going to talk about? They don't understand you and you
don't understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   Salei said ``hockey is hockey,'' even when there is a language
barrier. But Kings coach Larry Robinson had trouble teaching Aki
Berg during Berg;s rookie season because the Finnish defenseman
could understand little of what Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Aalto said his improved English allowed his natural instincts to
take over this season and he made the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I had to think about everything that was said,''
said the winger, who feels last year was his worst in professional
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the adjustment to the game itself. For years,
European players were thought of as soft and unable to adjust to
the smaller NHL rinks after having played on larger surfaces at
home.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no disputing the toughness of Colorado's Forsberg,
Anaheim's Tomas Sandstrom and former Detroit defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about the Europeans anymore,'' Ducks coach
Craig Hartsburg said. ``Some of them play a lot harder than some
North Americans. If people still think that way, it's the dark
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rinks) are probably the only thing they have to adapt to and
these guys coming over are smart; it doesn't take them very long.''
</P>
<P>
   To back that up, all you have to do is look at the NHL's scoring
leaders. And some feel that the Europeans may even come to the NHL
with a more advanced game than the North American-born players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They teach you skills and skating, and I think that's a big
advantage,'' Selanne said of being trained overseas. ``For us, when
we can add some hard work and toughness here, you have a pretty
good package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a good job developing players over there,'' said Ducks
assistant GM David McNab, who has extensive experience scouting in
Europe. ``We aren't in a real rush to get them over here (after
players have been drafted). Some guys come over later, but they are
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   McNab also said today's Europeans are benefiting from the
experiences of the players who preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``First-generation players didn't know about training for the
NHL, but today's players know what they have to do,'' he said.
``There has been an evolution and they are being coached by former
NHL players.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandstrom, who played in the Stanley Cup finals with the Kings
and won a ring with the Red Wings, admits the NHL wasn't his dream
as a child. But once he was drafted in 1982, he had to find out if
he was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the New York Rangers in 1984 and, 384 career goals
later, he ranks second to Jari Kurri (601) in goals by a player
born outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky; I got a chance,'' he said. ``It probably would
have been tough to come here, not make it and then go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL is the best league in the world and you want to play
in it.''

COMPLEX `SPACE WEATHER' SURROUNDS EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists discovered in the late 1950s that
vast belts of radiation surround the Earth like giant doughnuts.
After looking a little closer, scientists said Monday that the
doughnuts appear to be throbbing.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence shows the belts seem to act like huge particle
accelerators _ grabbing subatomic bits of energized matter from the
sun as they swarm toward Earth, spinning them into orbit at close
to the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   The findings usher in a new era of forecasting what has come to
be known as ``space weather.'' Success of the International Space
Station construction effort _ as well as the fate of more
down-to-earth communications networks _ depend on making these
forecasts as accurate as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists introduced the findings Monday during a meeting of
the American Geophysical Union, which continues through Thursday at
San Francisco's Moscone Center.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation focused on the two main bands of strong
radiation, resembling inner and outer doughnuts centered thousands
of miles above Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   These invisible energy fields make up the Earth's so-called
magnetosphere plied by orbiting spacecraft. The radiation bands
also are called Van Allen belts, for physicist James Van Allen, who
discovered them in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic surges of radiation can cause abrupt swelling of the
Van Allen belts, scientists said. The belts can shrink just as
suddenly as the radiation dissipates in the magnetic winds
crisscrossing the regions outside the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly intense episode in May spawned an entirely new,
though short-lived, radiation belt, according to Daniel Baker,
director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the
University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Using color-coded three-dimensional images and video, he and
other space experts demonstrated how the radiation belts seem to
puff outward from far above Earth's polar cap, then dance toward
the equator, all in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   The radiation belts had been viewed for decades as a more or
less passive reservoir of the sun's radiation. New readings from
orbiting spacecraft create a much different picture, in which
dramatic shifts seem as commonplace as thunderstorms in the
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more dynamic than we thought,'' said Geoffrey
Reeves, space physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also have had to rethink some of the fundamental tenets
about the nature of the magnetic storms and radiation currents that
gird the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one is about to dethrone the sun as the ultimate
energy source on and around Earth, particle-bearing gusts of
``solar wind'' take on wholly different characteristics when they
near the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, scientists said, most of the magnetospheric
high-energy particle activity turns out to be of Earth's own
making.
</P>
<P>
   Transitory gusts of radiation can have devastating effects on
space-linked communications. That was a contributing factor in May,
for example, when 45 million pager customers and several big
commercial data-relay systems lost service in the Galaxy IV
satellite failure.
</P>
<P>
   Blasts of killer electrons in the near-Earth environment also
could damage the delicate control systems aboard orbiting
spacecraft. When storms get too intense, particles tend to build up
inside the vessels before they can safely dissipate, threatening
electrical explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbances in the space environment are expected to become
more frequent as radiation-emitting sunspots intensify, reaching
the 11-year cyclical peak known as the ``solar maximum'' in late
2000 or early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope to design spacecraft with the new findings in
mind, and space ``weather maps'' are in the works to guide mission
controllers through the tempests. In many cases, damage can be
minimized by powering down spacecraft or using backup systems.
</P>
<P>
   It could even lead to decisions to scrap or speed up spacewalks
in order to protect the lives of astronauts working on the space
station. But the risks of rogue electrons in space are hardly the
only dangers that must be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Space physicist Terrance Onsager of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration conjured up a scenario in which
astronauts are given a three-hour window to finish an assignment
before a storm hits.
</P>
<P>
   But if they hurry up to return to a shielded environment,
Onsager noted, they might increase the risk of ripping a glove.

BAFFLING SEISMIC FAULT SEEN IN ICY CRUST OF JOVIAN MOON 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists reading fresh messages from the
Galileo spacecraft flying past the moons of giant Jupiter are
puzzled as they discover phenomena so curious that they remain
tantalizingly inexplicable _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of researchers reading Galileo's instrument data reported
some of their puzzlement Monday at the annual fall meeting of the
American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest findings include detailed and curious new evidence
of a monstrous, twisting seismic fault that cleaves the icy crust
of the Jovian moon Europa _ a fault stretching at least 500 miles
across Europa's surface, as far as the San Andreas runs from the
Mexican border to the Bay Area. And it may be more than twice as
long, but nobody knows _ at least not yet, according to Bruce R.
(Randy) Tufts of the University of Arizona, who is one of the
Galileo mission's imaging team members.
</P>
<P>
   What's inexplicable, however, is why the fault is there at all,
Tufts told reporters, for the crust of Europa is solid ice, as
Galileo's instruments have proved, while beneath it may lie either
a global ocean of warm water many miles deep, or thick layers of
slush, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Earth's crust, however, as Tufts noted, is solid rock, and the
side-slipping motion of the San Andreas is caused by the movement
of huge crustal slabs known as tectonic plates. When the Pacific
Plate grinds past the North American Plate in a sudden jerk of the
San Andreas, watch out! It's an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fault on Europa has in the past behaved much like the
San Andreas: The fault's two sides have slipped past each other for
more than 30 miles at some time in the past in a motion that
seismologists on Earth call right lateral strike-slip. Images taken
by the Galileo spacecraft show that it has kinks or jogs along its
length just as the San Andreas system has.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Europa's fault, named Astypalaea Linea after the sister of
Europa in Greek mythology, appears inactive now, for undisturbed
ridges of ice cross it here and there _ a sure sign that no
icequakes have sundered the crust in geologically recent times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a beautiful structure,'' Tufts said in a burst of
enthusiasm, ``and I'd sure like to get to Europa to explore that
fault and trench it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufts and Torrance Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
the Galileo mission's project manager, have at least a tentative
explanation for the curious nature of the Astypalaea fault, and for
the myriad of other much shorter faults that create a strange kind
of latticework all over Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that giant Jupiter, around whose massive gaseous
body Europa flies in an elliptical orbit, must exert a powerful
gravitational tug on the icy satellite that varies in strength with
Europa's distance from the planet during its orbit. So Jupiter's
immense gravity must raise giant tides in the ocean beneath the
crust of Europa, tides as high as 150 feet churning every three
days or so beneath Europa's crust, the Galileo scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   The strange features on Europa were first observed nearly 20
years ago when the two Voyager spacecraft explored Jupiter and its
moons during their ``grand tour'' of the outer solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mysteries of the Jovian environment will be explored in
even greater detail, for scientists are already planning a mission
dedicated to exploring Europa's surface with a tiny spacecraft
weighing barely more than 40 pounds. It is due to be launched in
2003 and will examine the thickness of the moon's ice crust and
finally determine whether in fact an ocean of water _ possibly warm
enough to be hospitable for life _ lies beneath that crust.
</P>
<P>
   It's another piece of the solar system's endlessly curious
features that the robot spacecraft are tackling year after year. &LR;

NEW PROCESS TO UNIFY YOSEMITE'S PARK PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Yosemite National Park's fractured planning process will be
unified into one coherent blueprint that addresses housing,
transportation and other areas critical to the park's future,
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In setting a May deadline, Babbitt said the review will give
special consideration to the controversial trade-off between
visitor use and park protection.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Yosemite's planning process was separated into four
parts: transportation, housing, rebuilding Yosemite Lodge and the
Yosemite Falls project to convert a parking lot to a pedestrian
walkway.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt was joined at a Washington news conference by leaders of
three environmental groups: the Wilderness Society, the National
Parks and Conservation Association and the Natural Resources
Defense Council, which praised the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping back and taking a fresh look at land use, housing and
transportation issues in a unified plan is the right decision at
the right time,'' said Jay Watson, regional director for the
Wilderness Society.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have complained about a fragmented planning
process that fails to consider the ramifications of housing
decisions on transportation or other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that had been separate and had generated a lot of
confusion and a lot of unnecessary controversy,'' Watson said. The
new process, Watson also said, ``holds great promise but will
require great finesse from the park service in balancing all the
interests that care about the park, and just as important will
require an honest sense of give and take from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club was not invited to the press conference, having
earlier won a court injunction to stop the rebuilding of Yosemite
Lodge on the grounds that realigning roads and expanding the
lodging would harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Eden, speaking for the Sierra Club's Yosemite Committee,
applauded the new process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged that they're bundling these plans in a
comprehensive plan, and we are going to watch closely what's going
on,'' Eden said. ``If the proposal strays from or undermines the
general management plan of protection of Yosemite and if it
degrades the park with further development, then we will be strong
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the court injunction ``was surely a factor'' in the
decision to unify the planning process.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Klobnak, legislative liaison for the American Alpine
Club, a climbing group, questioned Babbitt about whether the new
process would take into consideration the preservation of Camp Four
at the base of El Capitan.
</P>
<P>
   The world-renowned climber's hangout was threatened by a
National Park Service proposal to build a parking lot and
motel-style units near the campsite to replace lodging lost during
the 1997 flooding. The climbers filed suit, later joined by the
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said preservation of Camp Four would be considered in
the new plan, saying he had personally visited the area with a
climbing aficionado who informed him that the place ``was a great
historic shrine comparable to Constitution Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Kevin Cann, the park service's flood recovery manager for
Yosemite, said that public comments will be considered after the
draft proposal is released in May and that a final plan should be
finished by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty excited by the secretary's level of
involvement,'' Cann said. ``His commitment to time lines is a
signal that this plan is going to get completed.''

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ The prevailing political explanation
for the latest mood swing toward impeachment, as the House
Judiciary Committee nears a vote, is that wavering Republicans have

 &HT;    Don't act like a 2-year-old _ get some `good manners'
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Good manners,'' I explained to my young son
Kristofor as I
</P>
<P>
   sat on the bottom step tying his dress-up shoes, ``is what
separates us from the
</P>
<P>
   beasts. Manners allow us all to inhabit the planet without
grabbing each other's food. So remember, no kicking, biting, or
poking with a sharp stick.'' He seemed to be catching on. He was
two.
</P>
<P>
   Then we went to Karen's birthday party. ``When you go in,'' I
instructed the
</P>
<P>
   exuberant little boy in the sailor suit, ``hand the present to
Karen and wish her a happy birthday.'' He gave me a cherubic grin
and rang the bell. Instantly, the door flew open and the birthday
girl grabbed the present from his hands and took off.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbfounded, Kristofor stared up at me quizzically and muttered,
``Her didn't
</P>
<P>
   even hug me.'' Get used to it, I thought to myself, but to the
disappointed little fellow standing empty-handed on the doorstep I
explained that she was probably so excited she'd had a momentary
lapse of what he called ``good nanners.'' He seemed content with
that and headed out in search of his buddies who just happened to
be out back damming the creek with rocks from Miss Peggy's (Karen's
mom) flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers were gathered on the back porch enjoying a warm Georgia
afternoon,
</P>
<P>
   rocking, sipping lemonade, and comparing adorable kid stories.
It was a real
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams scene. I joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments though, our bucolic reverie was shattered by a
shriek followed
</P>
<P>
   by some major caterwauling. We leaped from the porch to see who
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   We found Karen, party-dress deep in a mud puddle, screeching her
little pink
</P>
<P>
   lungs out. ``Trittipur'' (the closest she could come to
pronouncing Kristofor) it
</P>
<P>
   seems, had unceremoniously dumped her little ruffled backside in
the dirt and
</P>
<P>
   taken off with her tricycle. I caught up with him gleefully
pedaling down the
</P>
<P>
   winding drive. He seemed surprised at my annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'd you do that?'' I asked, a little out of breath and
seriously embarrassed. He told me bluntly that he had asked Karen
if he could ride the trike, she'd said absolutely not, and so he'd
pushed her off.
</P>
<P>
   I told him he'd been rude but he disagreed. ``My said pweeze,''
he explained
</P>
<P>
   indignantly, ``but her said no.'' I explained ``please'' was
indeed a magic word, but in this case it had not overridden Karen's
desire to maintain her seat on the tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   We sat on the steps and talked for a few minutes before I could
convince him
</P>
<P>
   that the gentlemanly thing to do would be to apologize to Karen.
Reluctantly,
</P>
<P>
   he agreed and went to tell her he was sorry. She bit him. He
slugged her. We went home.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for this story. I'm working my way up to a
parable on manners.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday evening the phone rang and being a relatively
curious person, I
</P>
<P>
   answered it. ``May I speak with Elizabeth Schuett?'' a chirpy
little voice asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is she,'' I responded already annoyed because I knew what
was coming. After all, it was dinnertime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Elizabeth, I'm Betty Boop of Joe Blow's Insurance in
nearby Doofustown. We hear you're having a birthday pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Silence. I can't help thinking Starr's committee isn't the only
thing that leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth, we're calling to wish you a great 65th. Aren't you
excited? Tell me Elizabeth, are you going to have a big
celebration?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm underwhelmed, bordering on fed up. Tersely, I explain that
none of this is really any of her business. Undaunted, she twitters
on. I'm thinking, this kid in addition to being rude, is demented.
But her next statement explains it all:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you considered any health insurance to supplement your
Medicare?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you, Miss Boop?'' I ask making little effort to
conceal my irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three,'' she bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're 23 and I'm 65. We have never met and yet you have the
bad manners to
</P>
<P>
   address me familiarly by my first name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just being friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not friends. You are soliciting. You are disturbing my
dinner and truth is, you really don't give a fat rat's backside
whether I have a happy birthday or not. Right?''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Boop splutters and hangs up - a momentary reprieve. But
there'll be more.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows money-grubbing is more important than manners.

 &HT;    What is the death penalty doing to us?
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ So does Martin E. Gurule's death on the run
and not at the hands of an official executioner mean we can't add
another notch to our collective
</P>
<P>
   Texas belt?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Lone Star State set a record when it executed 37
people. So far In 1998, 17 convicted killers have died from legal
lethal injection. One condemned man received a short reprieve last
week, but we have five more set to go before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Will Gurule's death become an asterisk in the state's needle
marathon? Does it count toward our mission of deterrence?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds callous, I know. But callous were the words of prison
officials who said in very frustrated tones last week that they
hoped the escapee was being eaten up by mosquitos or water
moccasins and then declared it didn't matter to them if he was
found dead or alive. Their frustration is understandable. The
escape made them look bad, and they feared for the lives of
innocents who might be put in danger by Gurule.
</P>
<P>
   What's frightening is that their harsh words are not so far from
our own lips. What's another dead guy at Huntsville?
</P>
<P>
   And still the killing continues, in the death chamber and on our
streets.
</P>
<P>
   East Texans recently learned of the violent death in Houston of
a beautiful
</P>
<P>
   young woman from Lone Star. A 25-year-old man has been charged
with capital
</P>
<P>
   murder in the kidnapping/slaying.
</P>
<P>
   After Gurule's bloated body was found in the river, his victims'
families expressed relief at his death but sadness for the
murderer's family.
</P>
<P>
   People keep dying. Their families mourn. We kill more. They kill
more.
</P>
<P>
   Our state's philosophy seems to be the more murderers it
executes, the better things will get. We may execute the wrong
person one out of seven times, but this will work, really. Trust
us.
</P>
<P>
   So how long before we get to quit locking our doors? Before we
stop having to frighten our children into being careful?
</P>
<P>
   How long before those of us who do not live behind a locked
subdivision gate can take a nighttime stroll without fear?
</P>
<P>
   How long before we are safe?
</P>
<P>
   How long before we become more like the people we are killing _
unfeeling,
</P>
<P>
   uncaring, vengeful, hard?
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty may be working in one way by permanently
removing killers
</P>
<P>
   from society, but what's it doing to the rest of us?

 &HT;    Oy vey, Mr. Governor
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The headline reads, ``Bush to clarify remarks on
Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahem, is there a speechwriter in the house?
</P>
<P>
   Cold and clammy, George Bush is jolted upright at night by a
headline he just dreamt: ``Jesus to clarify remarks on Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't dream up the controversy that accompanied him to
Israel for a trip with other Republican governors. He was having to
respond to an ill-chosen quip and some previous comments about
religion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he told of a family discussion in which he asserted that
people who didn't accept Jesus Christ as their savior cannot go to
heaven. That understandably rankled many non-Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Then recently, when asked by a reporter in an elevator what he'd
say to Israeli Jews, Bush self-mockingly said he'd tell them they
were all 'going to hell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush since has been doing the damage-control thing.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he's assuaged the concerns of Anti-Defamation League
officials, with public clarification to come. Oh, jolly.
</P>
<P>
   Too late to say, ``No comment.'' But with this blow-up in mind,
we should hope that we have in Bush a freshly baptized believer in
separating church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Comments from press secretary Karen Hughes put it correctly:
``Judgments about heaven and hell do not belong to the realm of
politics or of this world. They belong to a higher authority,'' she
said. And I trust that in ``higher authority'' she was not
referring to the Legislative Budget Board.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in saying that, Hughes may have inflamed core members
of the Texas Republican Party who believe, o ye brethren, that the
fundamental function of politics is indeed to establish old-time
religion.
</P>
<P>
   See what happens when you bring up religion in public, Governor?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can inflame so many sensibilities as religion. That's
why government should stay out of it.
</P>
<P>
   A useful phrase for your trips, Gov. Bush: Freig mir nitscht.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely, that's Yiddish for ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   This incident should serve as a beacon to Bush as he encounters
shysters of piety who want government to get hip-deep in religion.
Even in a weak-governor state like Texas, Bush can find enough to
do without distractions like this.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile you have lame-duck Alabama Gov. Fob James, recently
defeated despite his transparent appeals to the masses as one who
would impose the majority's faith on others. The James
administration was before a federal circuit court last week
challenging an injunction against majority-sponsored prayer in
school.
</P>
<P>
   While ordering the DeKalb County schools in Alabama to stop
promoting religion, a federal judge had pointed out that students
have broad freedom to practice their faith without government
involve- ment.
</P>
<P>
   How many examples do we need to know that a hands-off approach
to religion is the only way faith can flourish in a democracy?
</P>
<P>
   Can't moral majoritarians like Fob James see what it's like in
church-states overseas, and why the writers of the Bill of Rights
steered clear of that?
</P>
<P>
   What the religious right wants is candidates who pass
theological litmus tests and carry out matters of religion as
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But George Bush should have born-again zeal on this matter.
Should he run for president and be asked to clarify his beliefs on
heaven and hell for the benefit of the Christian Coalition, he
should suggest that it polish up on its Yiddish.
</P>

 &HT;    HEALTH: From shelters to cafeterias, the main concern is
nutrition
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As the people carry their trays from the serving
area at Dayton's St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, you can frequently
see flashes of green among the heaps of mashed potatoes and slabs
of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Bright boiled peas. Emerald lettuce leafs. Bits of celery
peeking from bowls of chili.
</P>
<P>
   The people who have come to this soup kitchen might be down on
their luck, but they can still have a healthy meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our common assumption is that poor people don't know what to
eat because they're poor _ and they do,'' said House of Bread
director Jean Taylor, who oversees the kitchen. ``They know very
well that they should have a varied diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who feed the poor, from the federal government to local
food pantries, are increasingly aware of the role proper nutrition
should play in their programs. Some say it is paying off in more
healthful diets for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general observation is that . . . the nutritional quality
of the foods that are currently coming through the system are some
of the best I've seen in a very long time,'' said Lisa
Hamler-Podolski, director of the advocacy group Ohio Food Policy
and Anti-Poverty Action Center.
</P>
<P>
   The change has started at the top. Fifteen years ago, the symbol
of food assistance was the 10-pound block of pale-yellow,
fat-filled, government-issued American cheese. The United States
Department of Agriculture bought surplus milk from dairy farmers,
turned it into cheese and butter, then distributed it to programs
that helped the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the agency doesn't buy food until it surveys food banks
about what they want. Cheese and butter have given way to salmon
and green beans.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA also prepares its food differently. Where it once
packed fruit in sugar solutions, it now uses natural juice. It
eliminated the use of tropical oils. It developed items such as
lower-fat beef patties and cut the sodium content in cereals.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also tries to get food stamp recipients
to eat better. While there are no restrictions on what the vouchers
can buy, the feds spend millions to educate food stamp clients.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce McDowell of the Ohio State Agricultural Extension Service
directs the state's voluntary educational programs for those who
receive food stamps. She said 102,000 recipients _ about 1 in 7 _
attended one of the sessions held statewide last year. Instructors
talked to them about reading food labels, meal preparation and food
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Extension Agent Trisha Ansley, who runs the educational program
in Miami County, said she goes to senior centers to talk about
vitamins and minerals and the importance of calcium. She goes to
Head Start classes to speak of healthy snacks and ways to stretch a
family's food budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of things with . . . using fresh fruits and
vegetables that are in season and are cheaper,'' Ansley said.
</P>
<P>
   Government-backed public school lunches _ which low-income
students can eat free or at a reduced cost _ have also gone
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton schools, where 75 percent of students get free or
reduced-price meals, cooks have slashed their dishes' fat and
sodium levels, according to Nutrition Services Director Nancy
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't fried anything to speak of in years _ except french
fries,'' she said. ``And we use olive oil to fry them.''
</P>
<P>
   Food pantries, which rely heavily on donations from the public,
frequently can't be so selective. Even so, the provisions donated
by local residents and food manufacturers have become more
healthful in recent years, according to Burma Rai of Dayton's Red
Cross Emergency Food Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting a better nutritional quality of donations, just
because the industry and the public in general are more aware of
the (importance) of nutrition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, many food pantries still have a major problem:
They don't have the facilities to accept many fresh fruits,
vegetables, or meats, some of the cornerstones of good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move it fast,'' said Lisa Walls, director of
Franklin Area Community Services. ``We don't have much storage
space, and those things are so perishable.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also expensive, which discourages many poor people from
buying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foods that are cheap are not the most nutritious foods,''
said Kim Hickock, an instructor who covers nutrition in her courses
at Wright State University's College of Nursing and Health. `` . .
. Canned foods are never going to be as nutritious as fresh and
frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is too worried about that at the House of Bread. It has
cultivated many food sources during its existence, and so on this
day some volunteers are picking the meat from turkey legs donated
by the MCL Cafeteria, while others are preparing 50 pounds of
sliced lamb delivered by a Greek Orthodox church.
</P>
<P>
   Chili and turkey soup are the main dishes for lunch, but they
are accompanied by plenty of other offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the House of Bread's director and a registered
dietician, said such variety is good for more than a person's diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give people choices here,'' she said. ``That gives
them some dignity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``I keep all my little horrors in this
suitcase,'' Sandra Manning says in the dim light of her living
room.
</P>
<P>
   The American Tourister _ bright red and solid _ keeps everything
locked up tight. She flips it open, reaches in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' she says, matter-of-factly, fingering a faded
Polaroid, ``is the monster.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a handsome man, with mahogany skin and a big white smile,
and at the moment Sandy snapped the photo, he was perched on the
edge of a park fountain, hugging his three small children. The very
image, Sandy says, of ``a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Except now, in the American Tourister, is another picture _ the
regular guy's booking mug. No big white smile, just two glassy eyes
confronting the police camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's more. Tucked beneath the mug shot are the police
reports, which detail exactly what he did to her, on the winter
afternoon she almost died.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the police reports are the court papers, which assign
Sandy Manning's monster to a brief prison term _ over, it seemed to
her, before the ink dried on the tabloid stories.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a picture of Sandy, in her hospital bed, oxygen
tubes curling up to her nose, a blue pillow resting lightly across
her chest, covering the bandages that bind the holes her husband
made when he stabbed her over and over in the marsh beyond the
railroad tracks way out on the Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The stab wounds healed.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``My children, my babies, they're everything to me. They have
been through so many traumas in their short lives. One day life was
one way, and then it was just total upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsey's 9, the oldest, she saw the most violence, so she
carries the most pain. She still dreams her father's going to stab
me, shoot me. I was in the tub one night and she came in, sat down
on the toilet seat, said, `Mommy, what will we do if Daddy Mike
kills you?' And I told her, `Only thing we can do is pray, baby,'
so that's what we did, right there on the bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mikey's 7, looks just like his daddy. When he started
kindergarten, he was real moody. Lately, he's been worse. One night
we were lying on the couch and he kept holding his breath, putting
the covers over his head, saying he didn't want to live in this
world, that it was too painful. Mikey's counselor thinks the night
terrors are tied in with the fear he's going to grow up like his
father. Mikey has told him, why does he have to have the same name
as the murderer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney's the youngest, 6. She's very withdrawn. Courtney
will not talk to you. I mean, she will not talk to you. She was not
even a year old when all this happened, but I feel like the
after-effects have gotten to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids, they're angry because they don't have normalcy like
other kids do, not by a long shot. And they worry just as much as I
do that he's going to come back. One time Lindsey thought she saw
him at the Texaco and she ran home screaming, `Mommy! Mommy! I
think I saw Daddy Mike!' She just freaked out. I know just how she
feels because sometimes I think I see him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple way to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the shorthand people use when they have talked
about something too many times, Sandy will say, in a single breath,
to dispense with it: ``My husband kidnapped me and stabbed me and
tortured me and I almost died and God knows why I didn't.'' And
unless you already know the story _ perhaps you opened the morning
paper six years ago and saw the headline, or watched the TV news
accounts _ you think surely she must be exaggerating. Because who
on Earth could survive all that?
</P>
<P>
   Other times, if she's in an upbeat mood and doesn't want to
bring herself down, Sandy will refer to ``The Incident,'' pause a
bit for emphasis, and let it go at that. Only the very curious will
inquire further.
</P>
<P>
   To really understand what happened to Sandy Manning you would
have to know 100 little things:
</P>
<P>
   That one morning after a weekend of domestic abuse, she finally
got up her nerve to flee _ straight down Interstate 95 in her pink
nightgown with nothing but her three groggy children and the
promise of shelter in a safe house.
</P>
<P>
   That a few weeks later, while living an underground life, she
went to court in the morning to renew a restraining order against
her husband, and that very afternoon he abducted her at knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   That the restraining order was on the front seat of the old
green Chrysler when he held the butcher knife to her throat and
ordered her to drive, north and west through Palm Beach County,
toward nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   That when they crossed the long, high bridge on the Beeline
where she could see the tree tops blowing in the wind like unruly
mops of hair, she thought about jumping out, but he said drive
faster, Bitch _ and she fought back tears as her chance disappeared
in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   That eventually they parked on a lonely stretch of road and he
dragged her across the railroad tracks, and it was here that he
stabbed her and held her face down in the brackish water and she
said the Lord is my shepherd until her mind went numb.
</P>
<P>
   That after he stabbed her, she pulled the knife from the spot
near her heart and nearly sliced her fingers off, and still today
she can't use her right hand to pick up a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   That afterward he dragged her back to the car, where he drank
Pepsi, and smoked Marlboro reds.
</P>
<P>
   That he wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   That he beat her with a tire iron, picked her up and kissed her
on the forehead. ``I love you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That when the cops came, he blamed the crime on two masked men.
</P>
<P>
   That throughout all of this _ for 17 ungodly hours _ Sandy
Manning felt herself slipping away. But then her three children
would visit some small, still-alive place in the back of her mind,
and she would tell herself, again and again, taking up a mantra,
``Sandy, don't you dare die. Sandy don't you dare die.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you knew 100 little things, you still would not know
the whole story, or even the most important part. Because after The
Incident there was an investigation, and after the investigation
there was a plea bargain, and after the plea bargain there was a
brief prison sentence, and after the prison sentence Mike Jones
went free, but the woman who had been his wife did not.
</P>
<P>
   After The Incident, Sandy Manning wasn't Sandy Manning anymore,
she was somebody else. Somebody who heard the monster's voice in
her head. Somebody who hid in the bathtub every time a floorboard
creaked. Somebody who three years later still could not chop fresh
vegetables for her children's dinner, because chopping fresh
vegetables means picking up a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen Sandy Manning. She is the woman staring
blankly at the cereal boxes in the grocery store; the incapacitated
soul in the welfare office trying to string together enough
benefits to keep the lights on in her small, dim apartment; the
weekly regular at group therapy, looking for magic answers when of
course there are none.
</P>
<P>
   She is the woman who drops out of the work force so he can't
find her, then fights her way back. The woman who swallows too many
pills and has her stomach pumped, and who in despair practices
holding a revolver to her temple. The woman who wants to clear out
of town because she's terrified _ and who wants to stay put because
she has a right to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be looking over my shoulder forever,'' Sandy Manning
says. ``Because that day he hurt me, he killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10, 1992. Sandy stops at her mom's house to pick up some
clothes, and there he is. He's hiding it, but he's angry. Angry she
left him, angry she took the kids and went to the safe house. Red
hot angry. They talk for a moment, and then she gets into the car,
ready to go, and suddenly he is in the seat behind her, the knife a
cold, sharp warning against her throat. Drive, he says. Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hours pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's mom, Sharon, and sister Diane know something is wrong,
so they get in the car and go _ west past the farm fields, past
Mike's old haunts, back and forth on the roads he traveled most,
where he knew the street signs, because although Sandy had tried to
teach him, he still couldn't read too well. Maybe he's holding
Sandy captive till she says she'll come back, they think, maybe
they're just holing up to talk, maybe they're making up. Maybe,
maybe, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It is 6 a.m. and everybody knows what nobody's saying when
Sandy's mom turns on the news. On the screen, at St. Mary's, a
Trauma Hawk lands, depositing a stretcher, and on the stretcher is
a woman, and before Sandy's mom can process the image, the awful
truth of it, the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, We have your daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She needs surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She says she loves you, and please, please take
care of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is 28, pretty, with the strong, broad features of her
Scandinavian ancestors, luminous green eyes and light brown hair
that picks up highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she colors it, and once you get to know her, you
realize the color says something about how she is feeling: Her hair
is a flat, dull brown when she has been depressed; it is a lighter,
brighter shade on the weeks she is successful in keeping
appointments with doctors and social workers; and on really fine
days, after the children bring home good report cards or counseling
has been particularly enlightening, it is a beautiful, soft shade
of strawberry blond.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy has had so many setbacks in life, so many secrets, you
half expect her to pull the curtains and retreat, but withdrawal is
not in her nature. She is at heart an extrovert who relishes her
connections with the world; and despite all that has happened, or
perhaps because of it, she can be uncommonly empathetic and
generous, as if she would like to give to others all the security
and comfort she has been deprived. If, for example, while driving
to the store or the doctor's she happens to intersect with somebody
carrying a white bucket to collect change for a good cause,
especially one for children, she will give the solicitor not a few
quarters but a fistful of dollars _ then thank them.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's dream, before Mike took it, was to win a music
scholarship to college. She still keeps a tattered Polaroid of
herself singing a Gloria Estefan hit at her high school talent
show. The auditorium was so dark that the picture is almost
entirely black, except for Sandy, the star soloist, up on stage,
arms spread wide, incandescent in a white dress in the last sweet
time in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, if you walk past her apartment window, you might hear
her deep, gutsy voice doing justice to a gospel tune, or coaching
Lindsey through a Mariah Carey hit. Her oldest daughter doesn't
always reach the high notes, and sometimes she forgets the words,
but like Sandy, she has a voice full of promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time, baby,'' Sandy will say. ``Be patient and
you'll get it right one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's sister Betty loves to tell the story of how Sandy won a
big dance contest sponsored by Easter Seals when she was only 7.
When Betty mentions this to a reporter, to make sure she
understands her sister had genuine talent _ that she could sing and
dance _ Sandy buries her face in her hands, mortified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Mish,'' Betty says, calling her little sister by her
childhood nickname. ``You have to tell the good things about
yourself, too. You can't just tell the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the good things?'' Sandy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Betty. ``You are a good singer, and a good
person. And you are a very good mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so much bad has happened to you, I think you forget to
take any credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Olson was 15, a lovely high school sophomore who liked to
study, when she met a 19-year-old Job Corps trainee named Mike
Jones. It was Dec. 5, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a date, exactly. Sandy had a friend who was seeing
Mike's cousin, and one night they all went out. Sandy remembers two
things about this meeting. The first is that she was glad her mom
wasn't home, because Michael is black and her mother would never
approve of an interracial relationship. The second is how sorry she
felt for Mike once she got to know him, even just a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat in the back seat and talked and talked. First it was
the easy stuff _ school, my hobbies, my favorite colors. But
Michael came from a family that had experienced extreme poverty and
violence. He told me in such detail about how his dad beat his mom
_ until she literally had to pile the kids on a bus and get out of
town _ that he just had me crying tears. I felt so sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would call me the next day, and that night I went
home and I was lying in bed thinking, `I don't want to date this
guy.' He had so many problems, I was praying he wouldn't like me.
But the next day the phone rang, and it was Michael, and I just had
this overwhelming feeling of _ I don't know _ pity.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing on Mike's part, but soon after, he and Sandy
were an item. Mike was so attentive. He brought her flowers, movie
tickets, a plastic red rose that lighted up _ even a lobster tail
from Red Lobster, where he had taken a job as a dish washer and
moved up to prep cook. They went to concerts, and, because they
loved coffee and conversation, to the doughnut shop down the street
for the $6.99 steak-and-egg special. The romance was short on
money, but Sandy thought it had a fairy tale quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the sweetest thing,'' she says. ``Back then.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she got pregnant and things unraveled. Michael and his
mother were thrilled at the news, Sandy recalls, and went out right
away to look for cribs; but her own mother and sister saw things
differently. Mike was too domineering, they said. Sandy, sweet 16,
was too young. So her sister Betty drove her to a clinic, and,
sobbing, Sandy had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at her family's urging, she hopped a plane to her old
hometown in upstate New York, to stay with her sister Diane.
Everybody she knew said better to end things now, make a clean
break, vanish until he forgets you, but Sandy had a terrible
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Once before she had tried to break up with Mike, to concentrate
on her schoolwork, and he had protested by dropping to his knees in
the middle of the street, vowing to kill himself. So what would he
do now that she had had an abortion and cleared out of town?
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, she had her answer.
</P>
<P>
   He shot himself in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messed up all his intestines,'' Sandy says. ``And instantly
this became my fault, in Michael's mind, and in mine. I felt so
guilty I took an extreme measure _ I got back together with him,
and I threw away my birth control. I know how crazy this sounds
now, but back then, I didn't care what my family thought; to make
everything right, I was going to have his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's exactly what I did _ quit school, find a job, get
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he hit her? My God, Sandy says, you don't forget
something like that. You keep it on instant replay in your head.
</P>
<P>
   She had just returned from the grocery and was running through
their townhouse calling Mike's name, so he could help unload bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him in the upstairs bathroom with a Cool Whip bowl
full of these little white things. He had a can and had scrunched
it down and made it into a pipe. Well, Mike used to smoke reefer,
but this stuff was new to me. So I said, `Is that drugs?' And he
said, `Crack.' He told me to go downstairs and start cooking.
Later, when he still didn't come out, I ran back upstairs and
opened the bathroom door, and I took the bowl and said, `I'm
throwing this in the toilet.' He got mad. Slapped me. Pushed me. I
rolled down the stairs, and then he went back and did his drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was how it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how it always starts, with a first slap or punch, then
another, and another. And so it goes for Sandy, in her 18th year.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, to try to put him in a good mood, or at least a
better one, she tucks a napkin under his neck and serves up bacon,
eggs, grits, pancakes, biscuits, sausage _ then gets the juice
thrown in her face because it isn't chilled. Nights he smashes
dirty plates on the kitchen floor. There are many accusations _
where have you been? Are you cheating on me? No. No, no, no, no. It
doesn't matter. He's hitting her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant with her first child, she runs. Her mom says, ``Baby,
come home,'' and she does. But the monster knows where she is all
the time. He follows her to the store, the bus stop, the doctor's
office. She's so scared she sleeps at the foot of her mother's bed,
with a machete. Her stepdad has an ax.
</P>
<P>
   She asks for help, and the police say get a restraining order,
so they can arrest him when he comes close _ but Mike's a magician,
good at disappearing. Sandy swears to the ominous, off-the-record
remarks of one officer, a woman: ``Honey, if he comes for you, the
only sure thing you can do is shoot him, then drag him in the house
and make it look like a break-in. Because this kind of man, he
doesn't give up until he gets what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he disappears for seven months, only to turn up at her
baby-sitting job. Come back to me, he says, or I'll kill your
family, one by one. Don't hide from me, he says, because I'll find
you. And she believes him, so, yes, she goes back. He lays off, for
a while. Then one day she makes the wrong kind of Kool Aid, and the
next thing she knows she's flying across the dining room with a
bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on like this. Except when she's pregnant with her
younger children. He wants a boy and she's afraid of what he will
do if she says no, so they have Mikey. He forces her to have sex,
and her birth control fails, so they have Courtney. When she's
pregnant, he's Superdad _ and this is deceiving. For a while, she
has hope.
</P>
<P>
   And he finds God. They go to church. Four times a week they're
bowing their heads in the pew, and she's praying, Lord, please make
things different, but afterward, back home, he hits her. Once he
calls her a devil in front of the whole congregation, and she runs
out of church to weep on the front steps. A deacon counsels him,
but it doesn't sink in.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   He hurls a coffee table at her, and the glass shatters in
glittery pools around the children's feet. He speeds down Federal
Highway, calling her names, slams the brakes so hard Lindsey flies
from her safety seat into the dashboard. In the driveway one day,
when she is sick with a kidney infection and confined to a
wheelchair, he tries to run over her with his car.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest baby is on her lap. She thinks, ``This is it.'' She
thinks, ``No more.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she drops him at his tree-trimming job and
kisses him on the cheek, so he won't suspect. And then she is
flying down I-95, her pink nightgown fluttering in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 11, 1992. Sandy is covered in blood and mud, and a tangle
of vines from the bog plugs the hole in her chest, and it is just
like this, a creature half alive, that she rises from the muck at a
gas plant near Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The place is so quiet, so damn deserted, a rescue seems
impossible _ but suddenly out of nowhere in the mist of the dawn,
two early shift workers appear at the gate. Mike says, ``Hey,
fellas, call a tow truck, I'm stuck in the mud.'' But they're not
stupid, so they call the sheriff, too.
</P>
<P>
   And Sandy hangs on. Hangs on until the cops come, and the
ambulance, and the Trauma Hawk. Hangs on until the hospital, where
a detective leans low over her stretcher, and _ safe at last, if
you can call it that _ she says in a voice surprisingly strong:
Forget about two masked men. My husband did this. His name is
Michael Anthony Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 stab wounds in all, scattered like some sick
connect-the-dots game across her stomach, her chest, her upper
arms, her ears. Her hands are like mincemeat where she grabbed the
butcher knife, and the fingers on her right hand flop around like a
marionette's. The knife pierced her lung and her breath comes in
jagged little spurts.
</P>
<P>
   When Sandy asks the doctor if she will live, he looks a long
time at her, bandaged like a mummy and lost in a jungle of plastic
tubing, and very softly, he says, ``Honey, you should have been
dead 16 hours ago.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, 1993, in Courtroom 315 of the Palm Beach County
Courthouse, Mike Jones pleaded guilty to attempted first degree
murder and false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did the crime and then confessed to it made a
speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been searching myself, wondering why things happened
the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a person of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got plenty of love in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He got eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sandy wondered aloud if that was how long she had to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``After The Incident, I held up real good. I was in this support
group for battered women, and I told them my whole story. People
thought, `Oh, this girl is wonderful!' I was like a role model for
people who were going to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, Michael plea bargained, and I just lost it. What
happened was, I met with the prosecutor and she handed me the
doctor's reports on Michael, which explained how upset he was about
the abortion and me leaving for the women's shelter and taking the
kids. The gist was that he was insane at the time he did this to
me. So the idea was, we go to trial, he might get off by reason of
insanity, and if we go for the plea, then at least we keep him in
the system for his prison term, and then 15 years' probation. So I
had 24 hours to decide, and I took the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, after Mike went to prison, I just broke down. I
started hearing his voice in my head, and one day I flipped out on
Lindsey. She was yelling at me about something, and I got it in my
head she was her father. I put my hand over her mouth and nose and
I didn't let go. Her eyes started fluttering, and then I came to
and realized this was my daughter I was trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up at St. Mary's. Three weeks of intense therapy. One
hundred different medications. They couldn't tell me if I'd ever be
well, but I took the medicine and I saw a therapist, and I just
kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then one day, at group, this old lady started talking
about how her husband had thrown her against the wall and something
in me just clicked. Because this woman reminded me of my
grandmother, and here somebody was beating the hell out of her, and
I just thought, `God, does it ever end?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, I left the meeting, screaming, and I went to the
water fountain. I had two bottles of pills with me, and I opened
them up and I took them all. I just wanted it to be over, all the
violence. I wanted out. Waking up in the hospital and realizing I
hadn't been successful _ that I hadn't killed myself _ that was
just the worst feeling in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole time, I'm doing the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because right around this time, the Nicole Simpson case broke,
and O.J. was the suspect, and suddenly domestic violence was this
really hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on Geraldo and Montel, and they said I had a real good
story.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a name for Sandy's condition. Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder. She was propped up in a psychiatric ward when she got the
diagnosis. Nightmares. Hallucinations. Anxiety attacks. Depression.
Flashbacks. Panic. Numbness. It all fit.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of the post-trauma illness as a wartime
affliction, but it can be triggered by any traumatic event: rape,
torture, child abuse, a hurricane, a flood. Or, as too many women
can testify, near-death at the hands of the men they married.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sandy got the diagnosis, she thought the wartime
explanation might be the best, after all. Hadn't she just been
through a war? Wasn't the Beeline her battlefield?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Anderson, who has 20 years' experience as a case manager at
the 45th Street Mental Health Center in West Palm Beach, tried to
help Sandy put the fragments of her life together in 1994, when she
was living in a part of town where drug shootings are not just
something you read about. He remembers how smart she seemed _ and
how scared.
</P>
<P>
   Of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of what might.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mike Jones had an eight-year sentence _ but that was just
on paper. In real life, he would be out before her youngest baby
finished kindergarten. Then what would she do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy was having visual terrors of being stabbed,'' Anderson
says. ``In layman's terms, she was having flashbacks. She was
absolutely terrified. When something like this happens, if you
don't get help, you wind up like the Vietnam vet who disappears
into the mountains and fights the war for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an irreconcilable misery to be married to the man who
almost killed you, and so, while Mike Jones was in jail awaiting
trial, Sandy did the only logical thing. Divorced him.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, she had found somebody else. You might even say
Mike Jones introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few months before The Incident, and Mike had just
dropped off Sandy at her job with an answering service in Riviera
Beach, where she worked triple shifts to pay their rent. In the
parking lot, they fought. She was still sniffling when she sat down
at her desk _ with a black eye _ and the first call came in.
Something about a leaky sink. Please beep Jerry Manning.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry called back, Sandy tried to deliver the leaky-sink
message, but she was sobbing too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry had a soft, deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   So she told him. The whole unbearable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohmigod, honey,'' he said, ``you sound like a real nice lady.
You got to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   They met for the first time three months later, after the
</P>
<P>
   Trauma Hawk deposited Sandy's ravaged body at St. Mary's. When
she opened her eyes after surgery, she saw Jerry, standing over her
bed with a teddy bear, no longer just a soft-deep voice on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy thought getting married and buying a sweet little house
together and setting up shop as a blended family, his kids, hers,
might help her start over in life, but she was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1996 when they said their vows _ and not too much later
when they broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Manning tried, but he stepped into a crowded marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry. Sandy. And her monster.
</P>
<P>
   It is high noon on a beautiful autumn day in 1997, and Sandy has
just washed her hair and put on a pretty gray shorts set for an
emergency meeting with the principal and teachers at her children's
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency is, her ex-husband is about to go free.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones' travels through the prison system were entirely
typical _ up to a point. He served 321 days in the county jail,
followed by three years in prison, and then, because Florida's
prisons were crowded and one way to empty them was to let inmates
out early, he was all set to walk out of his prison digs up near
the Georgia line _ a bus ticket south tucked in his pocket _ when
there was a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   He had no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   No job.
</P>
<P>
   No plan.
</P>
<P>
   The people in charge of monitoring his 15-year probationary term
didn't want him landing on Sandy's doorstep _ in a letter to a
judge, a Department of Corrections administrator noted that Sandy
was ``in extreme fear for her life and the safety of her children''
_ so they took the unusual step of having him assigned to a
probation and restitution center in Central Florida for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the year is up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy plops down in the principal's office. Fiddles with her
purse straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he tries to take the kids?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   The principal raises her eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he disguises himself?''
</P>
<P>
   The principal jots a note.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he has a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just her children's physical safety Sandy worries
about. Lately her kids have been doing well in school, but Sandy
remembers what happened this time last year, when Mike's prison
term expired, before the judge sent him to the probation center:
Mikey stopped focusing on his schoolwork and started obsessing
about the safety of his family. A worried old man at the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for my mom,'' he told his teacher then, and looking
into his small, round face, she knew right away his mom wasn't the
only one he was scared for.
</P>
<P>
   The principal pulls up her chair, touches Sandy's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The school, she says, will do everything it can to make sure her
kids are safe. And she and the teachers will get them extra
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy smiles. But under the table, her knees are shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says it, but everybody's thinking it:
</P>
<P>
   What about Sandy? Who's helping Sandy?
</P>
<P>
   November 1997. What is fear, undiluted, uncontrollable fear?
</P>
<P>
   It is the phone ringing and a voice you can't place hissing,
``Gonna getcha, gonna getcha.'' It is a stranger outside your
house, inexplicably snapping a picture. It is your ex-husband's
relatives finding your apartment, dropping by for the first time in
years, saying, casually, ``Just want to see how you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you're doing: A stranger cuts through your yard, you
hide in the tub. A palm frond tickles the window, you punch 911.
You pack your kids off to grandma's house, then shake like a leaf
alone in your bed. You come across his mug shot, and suddenly he's
in the room. You think you're safe working at a little
hole-in-the-wall restaurant _ who possibly could find you there? _
and then your boss gets a call from a stranger, asking too many
questions about you.
</P>
<P>
   You say his name, your scars itch.
</P>
<P>
   You go to the benefits office, the lady says, ``Why not file for
child support?'' You say no because you can just see his face the
day he opens his paycheck and it's short. You can hear him mutter,
Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   You move again. Change your phone again. Call the county clerk's
office, ask to seal your address. Use an alias. Hand out his
picture. You check with the cops, the probation officer, the
courthouse. You know what everybody says? ``Get a restraining
order.'' This seems so preposterous you laugh. You tell your kids,
``Don't walk alone, not even down the block.'' Tell your mom, ``If
anything happens to me, I want you to sue the whole damn state.''
</P>
<P>
   And then.
</P>
<P>
   He gets out.
</P>
<P>
   And you draw the blinds and lock yourself in.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's worksheet:
</P>
<P>
   During a fight, what can you do to protect yourself?
</P>
<P>
   lockdoor hide
</P>
<P>
   Who can you call to help?
</P>
<P>
   cops
</P>
<P>
   Make a plan: When I see:
</P>
<P>
   Micke call 911
</P>
<P>
   ``Read it, Mom,'' the kids say. ``Read us the story. Read it so
we know what happened. What really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper clipping is titled ``The Woman Who Wouldn't Die,''
and Sandy keeps it pinned to the back of her bedroom door, so that,
in her lowest moments, when she undresses and sees her scars _
shining like fresh white wounds _ she can remind herself that she's
tough, that she survived. That headline is her Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Read it, Mom. They already know the rough outline, of course,
but an outline is a lusterless substitute for a story in its flesh,
and they know this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did he really hurt you? Why can't we be a family anymore? Her
babies are standing shoulder to shoulder like little soldiers by
the bedroom door, and they are so insistent, so certain, so
tormented, that she gives in. But she is a careful censor, careful
about what she leaves out, about how she delivers the truth of what
their daddy did.
</P>
<P>
   When she finishes, Courtney is crying, and the corners of
Mikey's mouth turn down, the way they do when a math problem is too
hard, or a vocabulary word stumps him.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey, the oldest, stands perfectly still, then draws an
arm around her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is an accelerated reader.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been in mother's bedroom many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is sitting on her bed, wearing purple, because purple will
hide the blood.
</P>
<P>
   She has a gun.
</P>
<P>
   She puts it to her temple, then under her chin, practicing
different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey needs help in math.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's so moody.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney climbs onto my lap when she's sad.
</P>
<P>
   Under her chin. To her temple.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps five minutes, but feels much longer than that,
when Sandy tiptoes across the hall in the middle of the night to
check on the children.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every year we look at the new crop of holiday
gift books and discover all over again how wonderful so many are.
This year our enthusiastic volunteers share their favorites among
the photo books, anthologies and reference books.
</P>
<P>
   Books _ carefully chosen _ seldom disappoint. An added pleasure
is that you, the giver, can read before you wrap. Here are some

   `Celebrity Caricature in America'
</P>
<P>
   By Wendy Wick Reaves
</P>
<P>
   Yale University Press, $45
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of caricature can savor a handsome sampling from
America's golden age of that pointed art in ``Celebrity Caricature
in America,'' a hardback catalog of a wide-ranging 1998 exhibit
from the National Portrait Gallery. More than 300 illustrations and
a lively text by curator Wendy Reaves trace the art from the end of
the 19th century to the middle of the 20th, including masters such
as Al Frueh, Ralph Barton, Al Hirschfeld and, perhaps the greatest
of all, Miguel Covarrubias. It's a well-crafted collection that
captures the brilliance of the art as well as the spirit of the
times.

   `Icons of Architecture, The 20th Century'
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Sabine Thiel-Siling
</P>
<P>
   Prestel, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be an architectural expert to enjoy this
coffee table book, which takes a look at the most significant
designs of this century. Through drawings, stunning photography and
essays, readers get insight into the stories behind the buildings,
from the original ideas to the technological innovation that
created them. A few notables include the World Trade Center in New
York City, Sears Tower in Chicago, village of Seaside in Florida,
Peace Center in Hiroshima, and Guggenheim Museum in Spain. The
essays are not always flattering _ sometimes the architecture is
highly criticized _ but the buildings chosen are spectacular in
their own way.

   `American Decorative Arts and Paintings in the Bayou Bend
Collection'
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston
</P>
<P>
   Edited by David B. Warren, Michael K. Brown, Elizabeth Ann
Coleman, Emily Ballew Neff
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University Press, $90
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever toured Bayou Bend, the home of the late Miss Ima
Hogg in Houston, you will appreciate this book. But you may not
appreciate it any more than those who have never been inside but
long to know more about American furniture and art, and the
discerning taste of this unique individual. Miss Hogg, the daughter
of a Texas governor, bought her first piece of colonial American
furniture in 1920 and collected Americana for more than 50 years.
Read this richly illustrated catalog of her collection, and
discover paintings by John Singleton Copley and Gilbert Stuart,
metalwork by Paul Revere, and lovely quilts by unknown artists.
More than 1,100 items in all; a treasure.

   `DK Illustrated Oxford Dictionary'
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press $45 (after Jan. 1, $50)
</P>
<P>
   I am partial to any dictionary that does not presume I know it
all. (If I did, would I be looking up the spelling of ``potassium''
or the definition of ``knight-errant''?)
</P>
<P>
   In a world chock full of spell-check programs that do not
distinguish between homonyms, a dictionary with pictures is just
what the English teacher ordered. The 4,500 color images are very
helpful (e.g. _ a silicon crystal, Japanese quail, a lacrosse
field). There are even photos of binding knots like the timber
hitch and gastropods such as the great pond snail. This is a keeper
volume for anyone, any age.

   `Perennial Gardens for Texas'
</P>
<P>
   By Julie Ryan University of Texas Press, $27.95 (paperback)
</P>
<P>
   For gardeners who love the annual reappearance of shoots and
buds, there's nothing quite like the perennial garden. But Texas,
with its numerous climatic zones, isn't the easiest place to design
and plant a garden that will flourish year in and year out.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Julie Ryan steps in. With regional analyses,
detailed charts, beautiful photos and a wealth of description, the
Dallas writer and photographer provides high-quality guidance for
novices and green thumbs alike. It's a book that any serious
gardener would welcome warmly.

   `Cultural Atlas of Africa'
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Jocelyn Murray
</P>
<P>
   Checkmark Books, $50
</P>
<P>
   This 240-page revised edition provides the most up-to-date
geographical information on the vast continent that has undergone
several changes since 1981. The book's 96 maps are the heart of
this atlas, but there is considerable text on the 55 nations'
diverse cultures and their turbulent history through imperialism,
colonialism, independence and political strife. The book's essays
were written by a team of international experts.

   `America's Lost Treasure'
</P>
<P>
   By Tommy Thompson
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Monthly Press, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the California Gold Rush madness, a mighty ship
loaded with fortune sank off the Carolinas in a nasty hurricane.
The 1857 tragedy, which claimed 425 lives, was America's worst
peacetime sea disaster. It also swallowed the contents of a gold
mine, impossible to recover.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985, engineer extraordinaire Tommy Thompson assembled a
crew of scientists, engineers, explorers and historians determined
to reclaim the national treasure. Thirteen years later, Thompson
has captured the eerie beauty of a golden harvest in 8,000 feet of
water with the newest photographic technology. Loaded with more
than 250 photos and illustrations, Thompson's accounts of the
successful mission should appeal to a diverse audience, whether
they read the best-selling ``Ship of Gold'' or not.

<P>
   `The Complete Bible Handbook'
</P>
<P>
   By John Bowker
</P>
<P>
   DK Publishing, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   No other text has had so great an influence in the world as the
Bible, says John Bowker, professor of divinity at Gresham College
in London. In addition to being a source of religious history, the
Bible has been an inspiration for literature, music and art. Yet,
for all its popularity, it is not easy to understand. Hence the
need for for commentaries like Bowker's handbook, an impressive
500-page book packed with 500 color illustrations and glossaries of
people and places.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into Old and New Testaments and references, with an
extensive bibliography, the nondenominational book is succinct,
easy to use and attractively designed. In addition to commentaries
of familiar biblical passages, there are specific discussions on
birds and plants in the Bible, women in ancient Israel, burial
practices, trade and travel in New Testament times, and maps of
biblical sites as they are today.
</P>
<P>
   `Bruce Springsteen: Songs'
</P>
<P>
   By Bruce Springsteen
</P>
<P>
   Avon Books, $50
</P>
<P>
   Fans will be delighted with ``Songs,'' which holds the complete
collection of Springsteen's recorded album lyrics over 25 years. At
the beginning of each section, Springsteen writes about the
thoughts and experiences that led him to create his works of art.
He discusses searching for tone, the atmosphere in the studio and
being inspired by authors (Flannery O'Connor) and film (Terrence
Malick's ``Badlands''). Plenty of personal photographs dot the
book, as well as reproductions of handwritten sheets where he
drafted songs or titles.
</P>

   `Ancient Mexico: The History and Culture of the Maya, Aztecs and
other Pre-Columbian Peoples'
</P>
<P>
   By Maria Longhena
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $60
</P>
<P>
   In this book, the author presents the glory and collapse of
several civilizations that flourished in Mesoamerica between the
middle of the second millennium B.C. to the 16th century. It
includes not only the Olmecs, Mayas and Aztecs, but also several
other cultures that developed highly sophisticated art forms,
writing systems and complex mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the illustrations that are the forte of this coffee
table book. With beautiful images of archaeological sites and
findings, the pleasure of flipping through the pages is
indescribable. The drawings that reconstruct cities and temples
provide an insight into these people who left us with an incredible
wealth of artifacts that assure us of their significance in
history.

   `Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary _ The Ultimate Guide to Star
Wars Characters and Creatures'

   By David West Reynolds
</P>
<P>
   DK Publishing Inc., $19.95
</P>
<P>
   `Star Wars: Incredible Cross-Sections _ The Ultimate Guide to
Star Wars Vehicles and Spacecraft'
</P>
<P>
   By David West Reynolds
</P>
<P>
   DK Publishing Inc., $19.95
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars fans can't wait until May, when ``Episode I: The
Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas' newest film in the series, opens.
Until then, they have to satisfy themselves with the trailer for
the film _ or with these two books. Looking like children's books
but probably aimed at adults, the shiny, glossy, slim volumes are
packed with photographs and diagrams fans will adore.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that band playing in the cantina in ``Star Wars?'' You
can find out the name of the band _ Figrin D'An and the Modal Nodes
_ as well as the names of all their instruments (ploong sounder,
peel rod, fanfar, kloo horn). And anybody who used to play with
X-wing fighters as a kid will like the cross-section of the plane,
containing everything from the proton warhead to the laser cannon.

   `Values of the Game'
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Bradley Artisan, $30
</P>
<P>
   Forget the NBA lockout. Forget the selfishness and greed that
has crippled the best players of the sport. In ``Values of the
Game,'' ex-Knicks star Bill Bradley explains why basketball still
matters. In 10 essays complemented with photographs of past and
present NBA legends, Bradley reflects on such values as teamwork,
discipline, passion, courage and imagination. His musings mix the
insight of a two-time NBA champion with the eloquence befitting a
Rhodes scholar and former U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world full of unrealized dreams and baffling
entanglements, basketball seems pure,'' Bradley writes in his
introduction. ``We know, of course, that it isn't. It has its own
share of greed, violence and obsession with the culture of
entertainment. Yet even in the midst of these distractions, there
is still the game.'' Amen.

   `Lewis &AMP; Clark, Voyage of Discovery'
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen E. Ambrose
</P>
<P>
   Photographs by Sam Abell
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Society, $35
</P>
<P>
   This book is outstanding both in text and illustrations.
Ambrose, author of ``Undaunted Courage,'' provides a shorter, but
informative, text about the Lewis and Clark expedition from St.
Louis up the Missouri River to the mouth of the Columbia River, and
return. There are reproductions of Karl Bodimer paintings of the
Indians, copies of maps by William Clark and others, and perfectly
composed and lighted photographs of scenes along the explorers'
route in 1803-1806. A treat for the mind and the eye.

   `Paintings that Changed the World: From Lascaux to Picasso'
</P>
<P>
   By Kraus Reichold and Bernard Graf
</P>
<P>
   Prestel, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   The ability to translate a vast array of feelings and emotions,
state of mind and sensibilities through the arrangement of colors,
brush strokes and shapes is the gift of the artist. Since time
immemorial people have painted on cave walls, tree bark, house
walls, paper, canvases.
</P>
<P>
   In this book, Kraus Reichold and Bernard Graf review the history
of painting, and to some extent the history of ideas, through
representative art works. The authors provide an opportunity to art
lovers and history aficionados alike to appreciate the importance
of the artwork and its creator. Spanning the history of art from
cave paintings to Andy Warhol, this coffee table book is a
beautiful source of entertainment and information.

   `The World of William Steig'
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Lorenz
</P>
<P>
   Introduction by John Updike Artisan, $50
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between cartoon and fine art lies the weird and quirky
world of William Steig. You can witness his evolution as an artist
in this volume, which reproduces more than 400 illustrations in
black-and-white and color from Steig's 70-year career. (He's
currently 90.)
</P>
<P>
   I loved his New Yorker covers and cartoons, sent Christmas cards
made from his designs, and read to my children ``Sylvester and the
Magic Pebble,'' for which he won the Caldecott Award. I find the
pictures in this book endlessly entertaining, the text interesting.

 &HT;    Gift of investment keeps on giving
 &HT;    MONEYTALK: Investments are the gifts that keep on giving
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 13, Justin Oberste already has started saving for
his long-term needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Powder Springs, Ga. eighth-grader puts a third of his
allowance each week into a savings account. As soon as he gets
together $100, he moves the money into a growth stock mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   His father got him started with a cash gift that opened the
accounts three years ago. Between market appreciation and his own
contributions, he now has about $7,000 squirreled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is really important to me,'' Justin said. ``I know
I'll be able to get into college and get a good education. I'm just
glad my dad thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His story might be an inspiration to other parents and
grandparents this holiday season. Beyond all the toys and other
gifts, it is possible to give presents that will make a long-term
difference to young people.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of an investment may not be as welcomed as toys or as
exciting as something in basic green, but it has different kinds of
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of gift is going to last a lifetime,'' said Wendy
Rausch, a representative of the Stein Roe mutual fund group. ``It
grows along with the child, and it's a valuable educational tool,
teaching about money and investments and how to make them work for
the rest of their lives. I don't know that Barbie or G.I. Joe
necessarily does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things to think about if you want to make gifts of
stock, mutual funds or the traditional U.S. savings bonds:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a lid on transaction costs. If you're going to give $100
worth of stock, you don't want to get whacked with a sales
commission of, say, $25.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at no-load mutual funds, shares in companies that
sell directly to the public, or the very low cost Internet
brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stick with companies your kids can recognize. Don't expect
your child to show much interest in some obscure biotechnology
company, writes analyst Charles B. Carlson in his book, ``The
Individual Investor Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Industries known to kids include fast food, retailing, toys,
entertainment, some communications and technology companies, and
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Explain the gift. Author Neale S. Godfrey suggests you treat
this as an act of parenting, not just giving. You can explain you
are investing in your children's future, she advises, and you can
build in occasions to keep track of the growing value of the
child's investments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select the method you prefer. One is to make an actual gift.
Under the provisions of the Georgia Transfer to Minors Act, you can
make yourself the account custodian. When your child turns 21, he
or she is the owner and can do anything with the money.
</P>
<P>
   A second method is to set up a joint account, or a separate
account you own but earmarked for your child. That way you can
maintain control of how the money is spent. For either method,
remember you'll need your child's Social Security number to open an
account.
</P>
<P>
   If stocks are your choice, direct investment plans are one way
to keep the costs down. About 500 companies now sell their shares
to the public, skipping the stockbroker middleman.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a list of companies with direct purchase plans on
the Internet at http://www.netstockdirect
</P>
<P>
   .com. You might also check libraries or bookstores for Charles
B. Carlson's DRIP Investor newsletter or for his several books.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the shares is easy enough. Usually you call a toll-free
telephone number and ask for information. When it comes in the
mail, you simply fill out a form and write a check.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks. A big one is some of the interesting
companies require high minimums to open an account. For McDonald's,
the opening investment must be at least $1,000. You could buy into
Procter &AMP; Gamble, Tandy or Wal-Mart for $250.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to shop carefully: Some of the companies want
direct investors but only big accounts. ``Some of them have
implemented onerous fees,'' said Carlson. ``It pays to make sure
you read what the company sends and find all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   A second possibility is to buy your shares through a discount
broker on the Internet. There are plenty of them, and fees can run
less than $10 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another method is to transfer to your child shares you
already own. Your broker can tell you about the costs involved.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund shares are also a good gift. To control costs, I
recommend no-load funds _ those that do not charge an upfront sales
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for investors' dollars is fierce these days,
which is why there are nearly 10,000 mutual funds in the
marketplace. Perhaps it's no surprise at least three of them
concentrate on kid-friendly stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They are Stein Roe Young Investor fund (1-800-338-2550), USAA
First Start Growth (1-800-382-8722) and IDS New Dimensions
(1-800-328-8300). All invest in large, growth-oriented companies.
Stein Roe and USAA have no upfront fee. At IDS, ask for ``B''
shares, which have a sales charge only if you sell them within six
years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Savings Bonds are the easiest to buy. Just go to your bank
and write a check. Series EE bonds currently pay 4.6 percent
interest. Inflation-adjusted bonds are paying 5.05 percent right
now. For details, go to http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov
</P>
<P>
   /sav/sav.htm on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback is the low payout. For long-term investments, you
may want to go for the higher returns of stocks, despite their
higher volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For the Oberste family, the choice was the Stein Roe fund.
Justin's father picked it, and Justin likes to check out the
periodic statements he gets in the mail. For him, they mean a
college education, probably at Arkansas State. ``My dad always
wanted me to go there,'' he said. ``He showed me the campus, and it
was just beautiful.''

 &HT;    Santa's Nintendo 64 and PlayStation picks
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Things would be different if I were Santa.
First, I'd introduce a more fit, sleeker Santa. One who didn't
smile as much. I would take advantage of modern fabrics and be more
of a Gore-Tex Tommy Hilfiger meets Calvin Klein kind of jolly old
elf. Reindeers would be replaced by a natural gas-powered,
atmosphere-friendly magic sleigh. Lastly, I wouldn't ever deliver
another PC game again.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. This Santa would go totally console. If the kids
wanted video games for Christmas, hello Nintendo 64 and
PlayStation, goodbye PC and Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages are clear. With a new PC costing at least $2,000
(and most new PCs souped up solely so we can play games on them),
the $130 price point for both consoles is very attractive. Even if
you have a computer, a microchip or RAM update, which is required
if you want to play the newest and coolest games, costs about $500.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with Nintendo 64 and PlayStation there is no crashing of
the system, no updates to make and no $100 joysticks to buy. The
consoles have even taken away the headache of having to check
gaming sites daily for patches so that your game works properly.
With Nintendo and PlayStation, all you do is drop the game in,
attach to your television and play. Easy.
</P>
<P>
   So with that in mind, this Santa has made his list, checked it
twice, picked all the games that I think are nice. Console Santa is
coming to town!
</P>
<P>
   Best all-around games
</P>
<P>
   These are for the best of the best girls and boys. But note: Not
all of these games are for kids. Console Santa says check out the
ratings on the back before buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metal Gear Solid'' _ If I were really Santa, Christmas might
not happen because of this game. I have spent an embarrassing
amount of time on this title. Konami's two-disc game has a deep,
addictive story line. You are Solid Snake enlisted by a top secret
government agency to stop the launch of a nuclear missile. While
this is a shooter game, it is also about stealth. PlayStation,
$49.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' _ One of the most
anticipated titles for the Nintendo 64 since, well, the last
``Zelda.'' I actually saw a grown man throw a tantrum in a
videogame store because they had sold out. You are Link and must
save the peaceful land of Hyrule from the King of Thieves. This is
very immersive, time consuming and makes a great gift if you never
want to see your kid again. Nintendo 64, $59.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddworld: Abe's Exodus'' _The sequel to the freaky ``Oddworld:
Abe's Oddyssey.'' This latest version boasts a two-disc adventure
in which you, as the ``so ugly he's cute'' Abe, must stop the
Glukons from using your people's tears for beer. It's an odd world
indeed. PlayStation, $49.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parasite Eve'' or ``Xenogears'' _ You can't go wrong with
either of these games from the makers of ``Final Fantasy.'' Both
are incredibly cinematic role-playing games. While the fighting
takes place in a semi-boring turn-based environment, both games are
``must haves'' for any good gamer boy or girl. PlayStation, $49.99
(for each). Best shooter games There's been a lot of talk about
violence being inspired by videogames. One look at a couple of
these games and that revelation is not surprising. But hey, what
can Console Santa say? They're fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turok II: Seeds of Vengeance'' _ This is one of the most
advanced, goriest shooters for the Nintendo 64. You are Turok and
with an arsenal including a grenade launcher, shotgun and chainsaw,
you wreak havoc on dinosaurs and people alike. Nintendo 64, $64.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'' _Ever thought of yourself as a
Jedi warrior? Well, now you can prove yourself to the Alliance.
``Rogue Squadron'' puts you to the test in this first-person
shooter. In this game you'll fly in your X-Wing and battle the
nastiest of the At-At Walkers. Nintendo 64, $54.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenchu: Stealth Assassin'' _Not a shooter in the truest sense
of the word but stands up to all the others in this category. In
``Tenchu,'' you are a ninja using every traditional weapon possible
to attain your honor. Throwing stars, crossbows and poison rice
balls are just a few of the tools you'll use as you take on the
title of a stealth assassin. PlayStation, $49.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colony Wars: Vengeance'' _ The new incarnation of Psygnosis'
hit space shooter adds a complex story line and more detailed
graphics. In the game, you must defend your home planet from a band
of savvy, bloodthirsty marauders. The game remembers your actions
and, as a result of them, plays one of six endings. PlayStation,
$44.99. Best sports games
</P>
<P>
   A great gaming alternative for kids are the sports games. The
only violence you'll find in these titles is the occasional
``roughing the passer'' call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool Boarders 3'' _ For all the ``sweet shredders'' out there.
``Cool Boarders'' includes competition and trick modes along with a
wide selection of boards and gear. This game is definitely the best
snowboarding simulator available and should appeal to any and all
fans of skiing down a mountain on one wide board. PlayStation,
$44.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``NFL Quarterback Club '99'' _ This definitely has the best
graphics of any of the football games. With its sharp players, you
get to see every bone-jarring, earthshaking hit. Season modes and
head-to-head are both available. Nintendo 64, $64.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBA Live '99'' _ Electronic Arts once again proves it still
makes the best sports games out there with its rim-ringing ``NBA
Live.'' One highlight of this game is the facial expressions the
computer-animated players have when they foul or get fouled. You
can watch Dennis Rodman blow his stack as he commits the fifth
foul. Cool. PlayStation, $44.99, Nintendo 64, $59.99. Best kids
games
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for games that are fun for everyone, this is
Console Santa's best for the little ones and the big ones alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glover'' _ What do you get when you cross a wizard's magic
with the Hamburger Helper glove? You get cute little Glover,
everyone's favorite hand covering. Of course, with the good comes
the bad. As Glover, you must battle your evil twin brother (an evil
glove) as you try to bring peace to your kingdom. Nintendo 64,
$59.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' _ Based on the hit movie. You are the
haphazard, quick-witted Flik, the ant. In the game you are trying
to save your anthill from spiders, grasshoppers and other crawly
critters. The game contains some of the best graphics anywhere and
includes parts of the movie. PlayStation, $44.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crash Bandicoot: Warped'' _ Crash is back with another
mind-twisting adventure. In this latest installment, you are able
to fly planes, get extreme on Jet Skis and ride on the back of
tigers. Join him as you travel through time and help him solve the
nail-biting problem of how to stop Dr. Cortex once and for all.
PlayStation, $44.99.

 &HT;    The woman who wouldn't die
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``I keep all my little horrors in this
suitcase,'' Sandra Manning says in the dim light of her living
room.
</P>
<P>
   The American Tourister _ bright red and solid _ keeps everything
locked up tight. She flips it open, reaches in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' she says, matter-of-factly, fingering a faded
Polaroid, ``is the monster.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a handsome man, with mahogany skin and a big white smile,
and at the moment Sandy snapped the photo, he was perched on the
edge of a park fountain, hugging his three small children. The very
image, Sandy says, of ``a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Except now, in the American Tourister, is another picture _ the
regular guy's booking mug. No big white smile, just two glassy eyes
confronting the police camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's more. Tucked beneath the mug shot are the police
reports, which detail exactly what he did to her, on the winter
afternoon she almost died.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the police reports are the court papers, which assign
Sandy Manning's monster to a brief prison term _ over, it seemed to
her, before the ink dried on the tabloid stories.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a picture of Sandy, in her hospital bed, oxygen
tubes curling up to her nose, a blue pillow resting lightly across
her chest, covering the bandages that bind the holes her husband
made when he stabbed her over and over in the marsh beyond the
railroad tracks way out on the Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The stab wounds healed.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``My children, my babies, they're everything to me. They have
been through so many traumas in their short lives. One day life was
one way, and then it was just total upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsey's 9, the oldest, she saw the most violence, so she
carries the most pain. She still dreams her father's going to stab
me, shoot me. I was in the tub one night and she came in, sat down
on the toilet seat, said, `Mommy, what will we do if Daddy Mike
kills you?' And I told her, `Only thing we can do is pray, baby,'
so that's what we did, right there on the bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mikey's 7, looks just like his daddy. When he started
kindergarten, he was real moody. Lately, he's been worse. One night
we were lying on the couch and he kept holding his breath, putting
the covers over his head, saying he didn't want to live in this
world, that it was too painful. Mikey's counselor thinks the night
terrors are tied in with the fear he's going to grow up like his
father. Mikey has told him, why does he have to have the same name
as the murderer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney's the youngest, 6. She's very withdrawn. Courtney
will not talk to you. I mean, she will not talk to you. She was not
even a year old when all this happened, but I feel like the
after-effects have gotten to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids, they're angry because they don't have normalcy like
other kids do, not by a long shot. And they worry just as much as I
do that he's going to come back. One time Lindsey thought she saw
him at the Texaco and she ran home screaming, `Mommy! Mommy! I
think I saw Daddy Mike!' She just freaked out. I know just how she
feels because sometimes I think I see him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple way to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the shorthand people use when they have talked
about something too many times, Sandy will say, in a single breath,
to dispense with it: ``My husband kidnapped me and stabbed me and
tortured me and I almost died and God knows why I didn't.'' And
unless you already know the story _ perhaps you opened the morning
paper six years ago and saw the headline, or watched the TV news
accounts _ you think surely she must be exaggerating. Because who
on Earth could survive all that?
</P>
<P>
   Other times, if she's in an upbeat mood and doesn't want to
bring herself down, Sandy will refer to ``The Incident,'' pause a
bit for emphasis, and let it go at that. Only the very curious will
inquire further.
</P>
<P>
   To really understand what happened to Sandy Manning you would
have to know 100 little things:
</P>
<P>
   That one morning after a weekend of domestic abuse, she finally
got up her nerve to flee _ straight down Interstate 95 in her pink
nightgown with nothing but her three groggy children and the
promise of shelter in a safe house.
</P>
<P>
   That a few weeks later, while living an underground life, she
went to court in the morning to renew a restraining order against
her husband, and that very afternoon he abducted her at knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   That the restraining order was on the front seat of the old
green Chrysler when he held the butcher knife to her throat and
ordered her to drive, north and west through Palm Beach County,
toward nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   That when they crossed the long, high bridge on the Beeline
where she could see the tree tops blowing in the wind like unruly
mops of hair, she thought about jumping out, but he said drive
faster, Bitch _ and she fought back tears as her chance disappeared
in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   That eventually they parked on a lonely stretch of road and he
dragged her across the railroad tracks, and it was here that he
stabbed her and held her face down in the brackish water and she
said the Lord is my shepherd until her mind went numb.
</P>
<P>
   That after he stabbed her, she pulled the knife from the spot
near her heart and nearly sliced her fingers off, and still today
she can't use her right hand to pick up a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   That afterward he dragged her back to the car, where he drank
Pepsi, and smoked Marlboro reds.
</P>
<P>
   That he wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   That he beat her with a tire iron, picked her up and kissed her
on the forehead. ``I love you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That when the cops came, he blamed the crime on two masked men.
</P>
<P>
   That throughout all of this _ for 17 ungodly hours _ Sandy
Manning felt herself slipping away. But then her three children
would visit some small, still-alive place in the back of her mind,
and she would tell herself, again and again, taking up a mantra,
``Sandy, don't you dare die. Sandy don't you dare die.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you knew 100 little things, you still would not know
the whole story, or even the most important part. Because after The
Incident there was an investigation, and after the investigation
there was a plea bargain, and after the plea bargain there was a
brief prison sentence, and after the prison sentence Mike Jones
went free, but the woman who had been his wife did not.
</P>
<P>
   After The Incident, Sandy Manning wasn't Sandy Manning anymore,
she was somebody else. Somebody who heard the monster's voice in
her head. Somebody who hid in the bathtub every time a floorboard
creaked. Somebody who three years later still could not chop fresh
vegetables for her children's dinner, because chopping fresh
vegetables means picking up a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen Sandy Manning. She is the woman staring
blankly at the cereal boxes in the grocery store; the incapacitated
soul in the welfare office trying to string together enough
benefits to keep the lights on in her small, dim apartment; the
weekly regular at group therapy, looking for magic answers when of
course there are none.
</P>
<P>
   She is the woman who drops out of the work force so he can't
find her, then fights her way back. The woman who swallows too many
pills and has her stomach pumped, and who in despair practices
holding a revolver to her temple. The woman who wants to clear out
of town because she's terrified _ and who wants to stay put because
she has a right to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be looking over my shoulder forever,'' Sandy Manning
says. ``Because that day he hurt me, he killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10, 1992. Sandy stops at her mom's house to pick up some
clothes, and there he is. He's hiding it, but he's angry. Angry she
left him, angry she took the kids and went to the safe house. Red
hot angry. They talk for a moment, and then she gets into the car,
ready to go, and suddenly he is in the seat behind her, the knife a
cold, sharp warning against her throat. Drive, he says. Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hours pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's mom, Sharon, and sister Diane know something is wrong,
so they get in the car and go _ west past the farm fields, past
Mike's old haunts, back and forth on the roads he traveled most,
where he knew the street signs, because although Sandy had tried to
teach him, he still couldn't read too well. Maybe he's holding
Sandy captive till she says she'll come back, they think, maybe
they're just holing up to talk, maybe they're making up. Maybe,
maybe, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It is 6 a.m. and everybody knows what nobody's saying when
Sandy's mom turns on the news. On the screen, at St. Mary's, a
Trauma Hawk lands, depositing a stretcher, and on the stretcher is
a woman, and before Sandy's mom can process the image, the awful
truth of it, the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, We have your daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She needs surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She says she loves you, and please, please take
care of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is 28, pretty, with the strong, broad features of her
Scandinavian ancestors, luminous green eyes and light brown hair
that picks up highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she colors it, and once you get to know her, you
realize the color says something about how she is feeling: Her hair
is a flat, dull brown when she has been depressed; it is a lighter,
brighter shade on the weeks she is successful in keeping
appointments with doctors and social workers; and on really fine
days, after the children bring home good report cards or counseling
has been particularly enlightening, it is a beautiful, soft shade
of strawberry blond.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy has had so many setbacks in life, so many secrets, you
half expect her to pull the curtains and retreat, but withdrawal is
not in her nature. She is at heart an extrovert who relishes her
connections with the world; and despite all that has happened, or
perhaps because of it, she can be uncommonly empathetic and
generous, as if she would like to give to others all the security
and comfort she has been deprived. If, for example, while driving
to the store or the doctor's she happens to intersect with somebody
carrying a white bucket to collect change for a good cause,
especially one for children, she will give the solicitor not a few
quarters but a fistful of dollars _ then thank them.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's dream, before Mike took it, was to win a music
scholarship to college. She still keeps a tattered Polaroid of
herself singing a Gloria Estefan hit at her high school talent
show. The auditorium was so dark that the picture is almost
entirely black, except for Sandy, the star soloist, up on stage,
arms spread wide, incandescent in a white dress in the last sweet
time in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, if you walk past her apartment window, you might hear
her deep, gutsy voice doing justice to a gospel tune, or coaching
Lindsey through a Mariah Carey hit. Her oldest daughter doesn't
always reach the high notes, and sometimes she forgets the words,
but like Sandy, she has a voice full of promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time, baby,'' Sandy will say. ``Be patient and
you'll get it right one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's sister Betty loves to tell the story of how Sandy won a
big dance contest sponsored by Easter Seals when she was only 7.
When Betty mentions this to a reporter, to make sure she
understands her sister had genuine talent _ that she could sing and
dance _ Sandy buries her face in her hands, mortified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Mish,'' Betty says, calling her little sister by her
childhood nickname. ``You have to tell the good things about
yourself, too. You can't just tell the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the good things?'' Sandy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Betty. ``You are a good singer, and a good
person. And you are a very good mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so much bad has happened to you, I think you forget to
take any credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Olson was 15, a lovely high school sophomore who liked to
study, when she met a 19-year-old Job Corps trainee named Mike
Jones. It was Dec. 5, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a date, exactly. Sandy had a friend who was seeing
Mike's cousin, and one night they all went out. Sandy remembers two
things about this meeting. The first is that she was glad her mom
wasn't home, because Michael is black and her mother would never
approve of an interracial relationship. The second is how sorry she
felt for Mike once she got to know him, even just a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat in the back seat and talked and talked. First it was
the easy stuff _ school, my hobbies, my favorite colors. But
Michael came from a family that had experienced extreme poverty and
violence. He told me in such detail about how his dad beat his mom
_ until she literally had to pile the kids on a bus and get out of
town _ that he just had me crying tears. I felt so sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would call me the next day, and that night I went
home and I was lying in bed thinking, `I don't want to date this
guy.' He had so many problems, I was praying he wouldn't like me.
But the next day the phone rang, and it was Michael, and I just had
this overwhelming feeling of _ I don't know _ pity.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing on Mike's part, but soon after, he and Sandy
were an item. Mike was so attentive. He brought her flowers, movie
tickets, a plastic red rose that lighted up _ even a lobster tail
from Red Lobster, where he had taken a job as a dish washer and
moved up to prep cook. They went to concerts, and, because they
loved coffee and conversation, to the doughnut shop down the street
for the $6.99 steak-and-egg special. The romance was short on
money, but Sandy thought it had a fairy tale quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the sweetest thing,'' she says. ``Back then.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she got pregnant and things unraveled. Michael and his
mother were thrilled at the news, Sandy recalls, and went out right
away to look for cribs; but her own mother and sister saw things
differently. Mike was too domineering, they said. Sandy, sweet 16,
was too young. So her sister Betty drove her to a clinic, and,
sobbing, Sandy had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at her family's urging, she hopped a plane to her old
hometown in upstate New York, to stay with her sister Diane.
Everybody she knew said better to end things now, make a clean
break, vanish until he forgets you, but Sandy had a terrible
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Once before she had tried to break up with Mike, to concentrate
on her schoolwork, and he had protested by dropping to his knees in
the middle of the street, vowing to kill himself. So what would he
do now that she had had an abortion and cleared out of town?
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, she had her answer.
</P>
<P>
   He shot himself in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messed up all his intestines,'' Sandy says. ``And instantly
this became my fault, in Michael's mind, and in mine. I felt so
guilty I took an extreme measure _ I got back together with him,
and I threw away my birth control. I know how crazy this sounds
now, but back then, I didn't care what my family thought; to make
everything right, I was going to have his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's exactly what I did _ quit school, find a job, get
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he hit her? My God, Sandy says, you don't forget
something like that. You keep it on instant replay in your head.
</P>
<P>
   She had just returned from the grocery and was running through
their townhouse calling Mike's name, so he could help unload bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him in the upstairs bathroom with a Cool Whip bowl
full of these little white things. He had a can and had scrunched
it down and made it into a pipe. Well, Mike used to smoke reefer,
but this stuff was new to me. So I said, `Is that drugs?' And he
said, `Crack.' He told me to go downstairs and start cooking.
Later, when he still didn't come out, I ran back upstairs and
opened the bathroom door, and I took the bowl and said, `I'm
throwing this in the toilet.' He got mad. Slapped me. Pushed me. I
rolled down the stairs, and then he went back and did his drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was how it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how it always starts, with a first slap or punch, then
another, and another. And so it goes for Sandy, in her 18th year.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, to try to put him in a good mood, or at least a
better one, she tucks a napkin under his neck and serves up bacon,
eggs, grits, pancakes, biscuits, sausage _ then gets the juice
thrown in her face because it isn't chilled. Nights he smashes
dirty plates on the kitchen floor. There are many accusations _
where have you been? Are you cheating on me? No. No, no, no, no. It
doesn't matter. He's hitting her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant with her first child, she runs. Her mom says, ``Baby,
come home,'' and she does. But the monster knows where she is all
the time. He follows her to the store, the bus stop, the doctor's
office. She's so scared she sleeps at the foot of her mother's bed,
with a machete. Her stepdad has an ax.
</P>
<P>
   She asks for help, and the police say get a restraining order,
so they can arrest him when he comes close _ but Mike's a magician,
good at disappearing. Sandy swears to the ominous, off-the-record
remarks of one officer, a woman: ``Honey, if he comes for you, the
only sure thing you can do is shoot him, then drag him in the house
and make it look like a break-in. Because this kind of man, he
doesn't give up until he gets what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he disappears for seven months, only to turn up at her
baby-sitting job. Come back to me, he says, or I'll kill your
family, one by one. Don't hide from me, he says, because I'll find
you. And she believes him, so, yes, she goes back. He lays off, for
a while. Then one day she makes the wrong kind of Kool Aid, and the
next thing she knows she's flying across the dining room with a
bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on like this. Except when she's pregnant with her
younger children. He wants a boy and she's afraid of what he will
do if she says no, so they have Mikey. He forces her to have sex,
and her birth control fails, so they have Courtney. When she's
pregnant, he's Superdad _ and this is deceiving. For a while, she
has hope.
</P>
<P>
   And he finds God. They go to church. Four times a week they're
bowing their heads in the pew, and she's praying, Lord, please make
things different, but afterward, back home, he hits her. Once he
calls her a devil in front of the whole congregation, and she runs
out of church to weep on the front steps. A deacon counsels him,
but it doesn't sink in.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   He hurls a coffee table at her, and the glass shatters in
glittery pools around the children's feet. He speeds down Federal
Highway, calling her names, slams the brakes so hard Lindsey flies
from her safety seat into the dashboard. In the driveway one day,
when she is sick with a kidney infection and confined to a
wheelchair, he tries to run over her with his car.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest baby is on her lap. She thinks, ``This is it.'' She
thinks, ``No more.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she drops him at his tree-trimming job and
kisses him on the cheek, so he won't suspect. And then she is
flying down I-95, her pink nightgown fluttering in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 11, 1992. Sandy is covered in blood and mud, and a tangle
of vines from the bog plugs the hole in her chest, and it is just
like this, a creature half alive, that she rises from the muck at a
gas plant near Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The place is so quiet, so damn deserted, a rescue seems
impossible _ but suddenly out of nowhere in the mist of the dawn,
two early shift workers appear at the gate. Mike says, ``Hey,
fellas, call a tow truck, I'm stuck in the mud.'' But they're not
stupid, so they call the sheriff, too.
</P>
<P>
   And Sandy hangs on. Hangs on until the cops come, and the
ambulance, and the Trauma Hawk. Hangs on until the hospital, where
a detective leans low over her stretcher, and _ safe at last, if
you can call it that _ she says in a voice surprisingly strong:
Forget about two masked men. My husband did this. His name is
Michael Anthony Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 stab wounds in all, scattered like some sick
connect-the-dots game across her stomach, her chest, her upper
arms, her ears. Her hands are like mincemeat where she grabbed the
butcher knife, and the fingers on her right hand flop around like a
marionette's. The knife pierced her lung and her breath comes in
jagged little spurts.
</P>
<P>
   When Sandy asks the doctor if she will live, he looks a long
time at her, bandaged like a mummy and lost in a jungle of plastic
tubing, and very softly, he says, ``Honey, you should have been
dead 16 hours ago.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, 1993, in Courtroom 315 of the Palm Beach County
Courthouse, Mike Jones pleaded guilty to attempted first degree
murder and false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did the crime and then confessed to it made a
speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been searching myself, wondering why things happened
the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a person of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got plenty of love in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He got eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sandy wondered aloud if that was how long she had to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``After The Incident, I held up real good. I was in this support
group for battered women, and I told them my whole story. People
thought, `Oh, this girl is wonderful!' I was like a role model for
people who were going to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, Michael plea bargained, and I just lost it. What
happened was, I met with the prosecutor and she handed me the
doctor's reports on Michael, which explained how upset he was about
the abortion and me leaving for the women's shelter and taking the
kids. The gist was that he was insane at the time he did this to
me. So the idea was, we go to trial, he might get off by reason of
insanity, and if we go for the plea, then at least we keep him in
the system for his prison term, and then 15 years' probation. So I
had 24 hours to decide, and I took the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, after Mike went to prison, I just broke down. I
started hearing his voice in my head, and one day I flipped out on
Lindsey. She was yelling at me about something, and I got it in my
head she was her father. I put my hand over her mouth and nose and
I didn't let go. Her eyes started fluttering, and then I came to
and realized this was my daughter I was trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up at St. Mary's. Three weeks of intense therapy. One
hundred different medications. They couldn't tell me if I'd ever be
well, but I took the medicine and I saw a therapist, and I just
kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then one day, at group, this old lady started talking
about how her husband had thrown her against the wall and something
in me just clicked. Because this woman reminded me of my
grandmother, and here somebody was beating the hell out of her, and
I just thought, `God, does it ever end?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, I left the meeting, screaming, and I went to the
water fountain. I had two bottles of pills with me, and I opened
them up and I took them all. I just wanted it to be over, all the
violence. I wanted out. Waking up in the hospital and realizing I
hadn't been successful _ that I hadn't killed myself _ that was
just the worst feeling in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole time, I'm doing the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because right around this time, the Nicole Simpson case broke,
and O.J. was the suspect, and suddenly domestic violence was this
really hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on Geraldo and Montel, and they said I had a real good
story.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a name for Sandy's condition. Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder. She was propped up in a psychiatric ward when she got the
diagnosis. Nightmares. Hallucinations. Anxiety attacks. Depression.
Flashbacks. Panic. Numbness. It all fit.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of the post-trauma illness as a wartime
affliction, but it can be triggered by any traumatic event: rape,
torture, child abuse, a hurricane, a flood. Or, as too many women
can testify, near-death at the hands of the men they married.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sandy got the diagnosis, she thought the wartime
explanation might be the best, after all. Hadn't she just been
through a war? Wasn't the Beeline her battlefield?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Anderson, who has 20 years' experience as a case manager at
the 45th Street Mental Health Center in West Palm Beach, tried to
help Sandy put the fragments of her life together in 1994, when she
was living in a part of town where drug shootings are not just
something you read about. He remembers how smart she seemed _ and
how scared.
</P>
<P>
   Of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of what might.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mike Jones had an eight-year sentence _ but that was just
on paper. In real life, he would be out before her youngest baby
finished kindergarten. Then what would she do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy was having visual terrors of being stabbed,'' Anderson
says. ``In layman's terms, she was having flashbacks. She was
absolutely terrified. When something like this happens, if you
don't get help, you wind up like the Vietnam vet who disappears
into the mountains and fights the war for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an irreconcilable misery to be married to the man who
almost killed you, and so, while Mike Jones was in jail awaiting
trial, Sandy did the only logical thing. Divorced him.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, she had found somebody else. You might even say
Mike Jones introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few months before The Incident, and Mike had just
dropped off Sandy at her job with an answering service in Riviera
Beach, where she worked triple shifts to pay their rent. In the
parking lot, they fought. She was still sniffling when she sat down
at her desk _ with a black eye _ and the first call came in.
Something about a leaky sink. Please beep Jerry Manning.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry called back, Sandy tried to deliver the leaky-sink
message, but she was sobbing too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry had a soft, deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   So she told him. The whole unbearable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohmigod, honey,'' he said, ``you sound like a real nice lady.
You got to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   They met for the first time three months later, after the
</P>
<P>
   Trauma Hawk deposited Sandy's ravaged body at St. Mary's. When
she opened her eyes after surgery, she saw Jerry, standing over her
bed with a teddy bear, no longer just a soft-deep voice on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy thought getting married and buying a sweet little house
together and setting up shop as a blended family, his kids, hers,
might help her start over in life, but she was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1996 when they said their vows _ and not too much later
when they broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Manning tried, but he stepped into a crowded marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry. Sandy. And her monster.
</P>
<P>
   It is high noon on a beautiful autumn day in 1997, and Sandy has
just washed her hair and put on a pretty gray shorts set for an
emergency meeting with the principal and teachers at her children's
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency is, her ex-husband is about to go free.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones' travels through the prison system were entirely
typical _ up to a point. He served 321 days in the county jail,
followed by three years in prison, and then, because Florida's
prisons were crowded and one way to empty them was to let inmates
out early, he was all set to walk out of his prison digs up near
the Georgia line _ a bus ticket south tucked in his pocket _ when
there was a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   He had no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   No job.
</P>
<P>
   No plan.
</P>
<P>
   The people in charge of monitoring his 15-year probationary term
didn't want him landing on Sandy's doorstep _ in a letter to a
judge, a Department of Corrections administrator noted that Sandy
was ``in extreme fear for her life and the safety of her children''
_ so they took the unusual step of having him assigned to a
probation and restitution center in Central Florida for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the year is up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy plops down in the principal's office. Fiddles with her
purse straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he tries to take the kids?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   The principal raises her eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he disguises himself?''
</P>
<P>
   The principal jots a note.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he has a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just her children's physical safety Sandy worries
about. Lately her kids have been doing well in school, but Sandy
remembers what happened this time last year, when Mike's prison
term expired, before the judge sent him to the probation center:
Mikey stopped focusing on his schoolwork and started obsessing
about the safety of his family. A worried old man at the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for my mom,'' he told his teacher then, and looking
into his small, round face, she knew right away his mom wasn't the
only one he was scared for.
</P>
<P>
   The principal pulls up her chair, touches Sandy's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The school, she says, will do everything it can to make sure her
kids are safe. And she and the teachers will get them extra
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy smiles. But under the table, her knees are shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says it, but everybody's thinking it:
</P>
<P>
   What about Sandy? Who's helping Sandy?
</P>
<P>
   November 1997. What is fear, undiluted, uncontrollable fear?
</P>
<P>
   It is the phone ringing and a voice you can't place hissing,
``Gonna getcha, gonna getcha.'' It is a stranger outside your
house, inexplicably snapping a picture. It is your ex-husband's
relatives finding your apartment, dropping by for the first time in
years, saying, casually, ``Just want to see how you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you're doing: A stranger cuts through your yard, you
hide in the tub. A palm frond tickles the window, you punch 911.
You pack your kids off to grandma's house, then shake like a leaf
alone in your bed. You come across his mug shot, and suddenly he's
in the room. You think you're safe working at a little
hole-in-the-wall restaurant _ who possibly could find you there? _
and then your boss gets a call from a stranger, asking too many
questions about you.
</P>
<P>
   You say his name, your scars itch.
</P>
<P>
   You go to the benefits office, the lady says, ``Why not file for
child support?'' You say no because you can just see his face the
day he opens his paycheck and it's short. You can hear him mutter,
Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   You move again. Change your phone again. Call the county clerk's
office, ask to seal your address. Use an alias. Hand out his
picture. You check with the cops, the probation officer, the
courthouse. You know what everybody says? ``Get a restraining
order.'' This seems so preposterous you laugh. You tell your kids,
``Don't walk alone, not even down the block.'' Tell your mom, ``If
anything happens to me, I want you to sue the whole damn state.''
</P>
<P>
   And then.
</P>
<P>
   He gets out.
</P>
<P>
   And you draw the blinds and lock yourself in.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's worksheet:
</P>
<P>
   During a fight, what can you do to protect yourself?
</P>
<P>
   lockdoor hide
</P>
<P>
   Who can you call to help?
</P>
<P>
   cops
</P>
<P>
   Make a plan: When I see:
</P>
<P>
   Micke call 911
</P>
<P>
   ``Read it, Mom,'' the kids say. ``Read us the story. Read it so
we know what happened. What really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper clipping is titled ``The Woman Who Wouldn't Die,''
and Sandy keeps it pinned to the back of her bedroom door, so that,
in her lowest moments, when she undresses and sees her scars _
shining like fresh white wounds _ she can remind herself that she's
tough, that she survived. That headline is her Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Read it, Mom. They already know the rough outline, of course,
but an outline is a lusterless substitute for a story in its flesh,
and they know this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did he really hurt you? Why can't we be a family anymore? Her
babies are standing shoulder to shoulder like little soldiers by
the bedroom door, and they are so insistent, so certain, so
tormented, that she gives in. But she is a careful censor, careful
about what she leaves out, about how she delivers the truth of what
their daddy did.
</P>
<P>
   When she finishes, Courtney is crying, and the corners of
Mikey's mouth turn down, the way they do when a math problem is too
hard, or a vocabulary word stumps him.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey, the oldest, stands perfectly still, then draws an
arm around her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is an accelerated reader.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been in mother's bedroom many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is sitting on her bed, wearing purple, because purple will
hide the blood.
</P>
<P>
   She has a gun.
</P>
<P>
   She puts it to her temple, then under her chin, practicing
different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey needs help in math.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's so moody.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney climbs onto my lap when she's sad.
</P>
<P>
   Under her chin. To her temple.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps five minutes, but feels much longer than that,
when Sandy tiptoes across the hall in the middle of the night to
check on the children.
</P>

PETER FONDA'S UNEASY RIDE TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>

 Color slides and black and white photos of Peter Fonda and
Katherine Heigl in ``The Tempest.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    At 59 Peter Fonda has finally emerged on the Hollywood scene as
the most famous of the famous Fondas. It's taken him a long time.
 &HT;    He struggled for decades to emulate his dad Henry, Hollywood's
rock-solid attraction, who died in l982.
 &HT;    Then it was Jane's turn to become the hot Fonda: Fonda the sex
symbol, and the Oscar winner. Today Jane has taken herself out of
movies _ concentrating on her latest role as devoted wife to
entertainment mogul Ted Turner.
 &HT;    Then Bridget, Peter's daughter, had her flurry with fame and is
still going strong with her latest film ``A Simple Plan.''
 &HT;    But today it's finally Peter's turn. At last Hollywood regards
him as a star in his own right.
 &HT;    He started of course with a humdinger: He was ``Easy Rider'''s
wild Captain America in the '60s, riding a motor bike in black
leather and shades, popping LSD with cohorts Dennis Hopper and a
callow Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    His role as the maverick biker in the l969 film mimicked his
real attitude to America in that era of Vietnam. Moviegoers around
the world loved it; Hollywood gave him the cold shoulder.
 &HT;    He continued to work in low-budget movies like ``Outlaw Blues''
(1977) and the cult film ``Love and a .45'' (1994). None of them
put him into Hollywood's actor's A-league.
 &HT;    ``I became an outsider. I moved to a ranch in Montana and did
the few films that were offered to me. I never thought I'd have a
chance to come back to the fold.''
 &HT;    Now he's an elder statesman, almost as respectable as his dad.
Last year he wrote a book about Henry Fonda called ``Don't Tell
Dad.'' Earlier this year also, he won praise and an Oscar
nomination for his role in ``Ulee's Gold.'' Jack Nicholson went
home with the best actor statuette but suddenly Hollywood was
paying attention to the former black sheep of the Fonda family.
 &HT;    Back in the early days when I interviewed him, he was troubled
young actor, caught up in the drug scene with a career as erratic
as his own behavior. But times have changed _ and so has Peter.
 &HT;    Now he's about to show up in another eye-catching serious role,
in special effects extravaganza, ``The Tempest,'' (airing on NBC
Dec. 13) an inventive retelling of Shakespeare's magical tale of
love, betrayal and freedom.
 &HT;    This time they've set the story on a mysterious isle in a
Mississippi bayou during the Civil War. Fonda plays Gideon Prosper,
who has abdicated his position as overseer of the family
plantation, choosing instead to devote his time to magic and
sorcery. The movie co-stars John Glover as Gideon's scoundrel
younger brother and Katherine Heigl Prosper's devoted daughter.
 &HT;    At 59, in blue jeans and cowboy boots with as much silver as
brown in his hair, his face handsome but leathery from long days in
the Montana Big Sky country, he sits in a suite at a ritzy hotel in
Pasadena, Calif., happily talking about his latest role and his
path in life.
 &HT;    ``I know Shakespeare's 'Tempest' and this is fairly on target
but set in a different time. It deals with deceit, brother against
brother. The special effects are really cool.''
 &HT;    It sometimes seems that Peter's acting career might have been
programmed into his DNA?. ``This is nothing genetic,'' he insists.
``The fact that my father and my sister, myself and my daughter are
all actors has nothing to do with genes. Had it something to do
with genes, I would have been manipulating them a long time ago.
But as I grew older people were saying, 'You look like your dad.'
In fact my bone structure is the same as his, but I really look
more like my mother around my eyes.''
 &HT;    Many in Hollywood said his part in ``Ulee's Gold'' _ playing a
grizzled, ex-Vietnam veteran turned beekeeper coping with his
grandkids _ was the role that has reestablished him as a leading
Hollywood star. And most also agree it was a typical Henry Fonda
role.
 &HT;    For a long time Peter might have resented that kind of talk. Not
anymore. ``I don't think of getting out from underneath the shadow
or the identity of being Henry Fonda's son. It hasn't been
something bad for me,'' he now observes.
 &HT;    ``It's an honor to be compared to his style of acting. And it's
interesting that the last thing he was seen doing was basically `On
Golden Pond' _ with a downturned mouth, grizzled and wearing wire
rimmed glasses, just like my character in `Ulee's Gold.'''
 &HT;    Growing up as a Fonda was never an easy ride for Peter. In many
ways his life was a constant struggle to win his father's approval.
The only problem was it wasn't winnable and even if it had been his
father couldn't have told him so. ``My father was a very shy man.
He didn't know how to communicate with anyone _ but particularly
with his children.''
 &HT;    Yet he was all they had. Peter and Jane were raised by their
father after their mother, socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw Fonda
committed suicide in l950 in a rest home where she was recovering
from a nervous breakdown.
 &HT;    ``My father never told Jane and I that mother had taken her own
life. We had to learn that from magazine and newspaper stories. I
know now he didn't do it to be cruel. He just didn't know how to
find the words to tell us.''
 &HT;    And just hours after his wife died Henry stepped on stage to do
a Broadway performance. That so upset Peter, who was 10 at the
time, that he shot himself through the kidney and liver with a
.22-caliber pistol.
 &HT;    Their father eventually remarried three times and with each
marriage he became further estranged from his two oldest children.
 &HT;    Peter remembers his dad as a tightlipped man who could never
express his emotions and bottled them up in a mask of disapproval.
``His silence was always a factor in our relationship. At the
dinner table not a word would be spoken.''
 &HT;    Peter and Jane, he says, thought their father was, ``this madman
who wouldn't smile or anything.''
 &HT;    In l979 Fonda was preparing to direct a low-budget film called
``Wanda Nevada.'' There was a small role in it perfectly suited to
his dad.
 &HT;    ``I literally had to cajole him into taking the role and he was
miserable the whole time. But then he sent me another of his famous
letters to tell me it had been one of the best experiences of his
41 years in the business.''
 &HT;    Peter says he worked hard to mend fences with his dad. And his
book about the man who was one of Hollywood's legends was softer
than most thought: ``I didn't have to tear his memory to shreds
because we had made our peace before he died.''
 &HT;    In ``Ulee's Gold'' he found a role that told the world that
Peter Fonda has finally grown up.
 &HT;    Now Peter has only one regret: That his dad isn't alive to see
his return to the mainstream: ``I think it would have amused him
greatly, that I have _ even in some small way _ become him. The
wonderful thing about having had Henry Fonda for a father is that
he is always within reach. I have just to turn on the TV _ and he's
there. It's a great legacy he's left me and the world.''

   SEOUL, South Korea _ The intrusion of a couple of strangers --
one, a foreign woman taking pictures -- caused an angry stir among
the homeless people camped in a city park in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving their cluster of tents, they started toward us through
the trees.
</P>
<P>
   My translator, an unemployed stock analyst, thought we ought to
cut and run. I thought the tent people would calm easily. They did,
and a few hung around to talk.
</P>
<P>
   These, after all, were not fugitives hunted by police or people
with scarred lives who belonged in mental institutions. They didn't
babble or draw knives or curse at passers-by. Nor were they
inheritors of debilitating discrimination, because they were not an
ethnic or racial minority.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homeless South Koreans we met, these were
middle-class people whose world had gone topsy-turvy when the rug
was pulled out, when their country's economy failed. Their stories
were not even terribly dramatic, though most were certainly sad.
</P>
<P>
   These homeless people were impossibly clean, literate and
hopeless, at least for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   They were the most puzzling aspect of my recent visit to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   They were unlike any such homeless group I've encountered
elsewhere, from Bombay to Chechnya to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Often homeless people are stranded through entrenched poverty or
personal affliction, mental or physical. Or they are victims of
disaster, whether natural or man-made.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans fit none of these categories.
</P>
<P>
   Seen walking the streets, they never would be pegged as
homeless. They wore clothes from the middle-class lives they had
departed just months earlier. And somehow they kept everything
immaculate, even those living rough in the park.
</P>
<P>
   They also were embarrassed. Often, they blamed themselves for
landing in bad straits.
</P>
<P>
   I think that is why few wanted to tell their stories and often
refused to give their names if they did talk.
</P>
<P>
   At an all-male shelter run by a Buddhist order, the director
placed one condition: no pictures. People felt humiliated to be
there, he said, explaining that losing a job in Korea had been
rare. These people assumed they must have done something awfully
wrong to wind up on the street.
</P>
<P>
   One man who agreed to talk there identified himself only as Mr.
Oh. He refused to reveal the kind of small business he ran or to
detail its bankruptcy and the subsequent loss of his apartment. I
wondered why he was bothering to talk with me.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Mr. Oh plumbed a bruised emotional depth. He wanted me
to know that personal consequence underlies the faceless economic
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here I traveled all over the country. Sometimes,
I slept in a tent, sometimes in a cheap boarding house. I traveled
to forget every miserable failure,'' he said. ``I found stability
in my heart, a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Oh, who had cleaned up for the communal dinner after doing
cemetery maintenance work, wore a spotless navy blue track suit and
cranberry sweater. Speaking with the same stoic bearing as the
American actor he remarkably resembled, Charles Bronson, he spoke
of a daughter and son who are both university graduates, whom he
had not seen since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to show myself to my children, because I feel I'm
in a miserable condition,'' said Mr. Oh, closing his eyes,
clenching his jaw and falling silent.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the tent camp at Sosomun Park, the hostility had
evaporated fast. But there, too, people demanded no pictures of
themselves, only the bright-colored tents filled with the
possessions that were their hold on former lives.
</P>
<P>
   After the camera was capped and our talks had lasted nearly an
hour, almost everyone had returned to their routines -- playing
cards, checking the clothesline strung between trees, policing the
grounds for the few stray scraps or cigarette butts dropped by lax
campers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last to leave was a man in his mid-30s, wearing
pinstripe pants and a button-down shirt. He hadn't said a word,
just listened.
</P>
<P>
   As we got ready to depart, I saw him sitting in his tent
cross-legged, reading one of the books he picked from the neat
piles by his sleeping bag.

STATE PROGRAMS TO GET GETTY FOCUS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For years, the entire world has been their oyster.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as if the Getty's educational strategists may be
casting their nets in less-far-flung waters.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Rountree, executive vice president of the J. Paul
Getty Trust, said that, in the future, the Getty plans to
concentrate its educational development and outreach programs in
the Southern California area.
</P>
<P>
   While the Getty Trust, Museum and arts-related institutes will
continue to maintain a national and international focus, Rountree
said the Getty would be playing a more active role in shaping local
and state educational policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're definitely going to see an engagement of the
Getty with issues of school reform, and the importance of education
in the arts and humanities, and a greater concentration on Los
Angeles and the Southern California region, trying to use our
resources closer to home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the fall campaign, Gov.-elect Gray Davis identified
education as his top priority. Davis' first cabinet-level
appointment, whom he named last Monday, is former state Sen. Gary
K. Hart as education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Munitz, president and CEO of the Getty Trust, is leading
Davis' transition team. Hart previously worked with Munitz as
co-director of the California State University Institute for
Education Reform while Munitz was chancellor of the Cal State
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're going to see us focus a lot more on our back
yard and trying to develop initiatives in Southern California,
because we think every opportunity and every problem exists here,''
Rountree said. &QL;

A YEAR OF CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ask Barry Munitz about his leadership style, and
he'll slyly insist, ``I'm a pussycat.''
</P>
<P>
   Few who know the president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust
would likely share that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that has spanned academia, big business and six
years as chancellor of the California State University system,
Munitz has acquired a reputation as a smart, tough-minded
negotiator whose behind-the-scenes diplomacy is matched by his
steely resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Munitz, 57, has described himself as ``a political
animal in the most profound and intense sense, not just a partisan
political sense.'' That helps explain why California Gov.-elect
Gray Davis recently tapped Munitz to head his transition team in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever sort of animal he may be, Munitz appears well on his
way toward transforming the Getty Center _ the 800-ton leviathan of
the art world _ into a different sort of beast: Less insular and
self-sufficient than in years past, more corporate-minded and
competitive, and as consumed with teaching the public about art as
it once was obsessed with acquiring priceless objets.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, the Getty Center unveiled its new $1 billion
Brentwood headquarters amid a flurry of international press
coverage, a flood of traffic along Sepulveda Boulevard _ and a
paucity of public toilets. (The Getty plans to add more facilities
next year.)
</P>
<P>
   By January 1999, officials estimate, some 1.9 million visitors
will have flocked to the Getty's travertine marble campus to
inspect its Old Master paintings, world-class photography
collections and IMAX-caliber views of the San Gabriel Mountains,
the L.A. basin and the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   That's roughly one-third more than the 1.2 million originally
projected. The average Getty visitor stays 4{ hours, a virtually
unheard-of length for a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, as the crowds have tapered off and phone
parking-reservation waiting times have dwindled to an average of
five minutes, Munitz's administration has begun to take shape,
succeeding that of his more understated, avuncular predecessor,
Harold Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And, as often happens under a new regime, there have been a few
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Since Munitz took over last January, three of the five directors
of the Getty's arts-related institutes have resigned. One Getty
affiliate, the Information Institute, will formally cease to exist
by June.
</P>
<P>
   These swift changes have raised concerns both inside and outside
the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like (baseball manager) Kevin Malone with the
Dodgers,'' observed Bill Lasarow, publisher of Art Scene, a monthly
digest of the visual arts in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early to tell whether all the trades and the
cutbacks and the add-ons are going to add up to a better operation
or is going to take away from what Mr. Williams built up. You sort
of have a situation where the Getty won the World Series last year.
You almost wonder why they'd be toying around with this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Munitz said he regarded some
high-level staff turnover as ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   He was hired by the Getty's board, he said, not to sit on a $4.7
billion endowment but to analyze how the Getty's various programs _
previously spread throughout several buildings _ could be better
integrated now that they have a common address.
</P>
<P>
   Munitz concedes that agenda has created some stress and
uncertainty, as well as opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some, it's very exciting and fulfilling. To some, it's
scary. To some, it's distressing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make me happy to pick up the paper ... and see the
headline (about a staff member's departure)? Of course not. ... My
assignment is to look forward. We have to recognize now we're open,
we're very public. I mean, we have a bunch of people who haven't
worked in big, public programs before. And my assignment is to put
a leadership team together for the board that's collaborative,
that's public-oriented, that focuses on advocacy and policy and
education. And I'm just going to have to do it as patiently, but as
firmly, as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Getty's 1,200 employees sharing space with 36,000
visitors every week, Munitz said his priority is to make the Getty
operate more publicly than before and to forge partnerships with
corporations and other museums, both in and outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Getty is cooperating with the Huntington
Library, on an upcoming show about how different portraitists
depicted the famous 18th-century British actress Sarah Siddons.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty also agreed to offer an exhibition on Sigmund Freud,
organized by one of its own curators, to the nearby Skirball
Cultural Center, with the Getty picking up the $300,000 tab.
</P>
<P>
   Some local arts officials say the Getty has brought not only
cash to L.A., in the form of cultural tourism, but cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many groups that have been coming through town that
probably would not be coming had it not been for the Getty,'' said
Henry Hopkins, former director of the UCLA Armand Hammer Museum of
Art and Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   Art for art's sake no longer defines the Getty's central
mission, if it ever did. Munitz has sought to give education an
institution-wide focus by recruiting Ted Mitchell, former dean of
the Graduate School of Education at UCLA, to serve in the
just-minted post of vice president for education and special
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   New acquisitions, besides fleshing out the collections'
art-historical continuum, also will be evaluated by what they can
teach about a particular genre or period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to be more selective,'' said Deborah Gribbon,
deputy director of the Getty Museum. ``In terms of paintings, in
particular, we are trying to go for the best examples of the best
artists in the best condition. And when you've done that, a priori,
you have an object that can be a platform for many different kinds
of programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Munitz and his board also have considered the idea of
instituting a membership program for a small group of upper-level
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in very good shape financially,'' Munitz said. ``But for
me, that just continues to make the point that you can't run a
place of this complexity on one source of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   You begin to grasp the Getty's changing personality when you
ride its trestled tram car with a load of energetic high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   From 9 to 11 a.m. every weekday but Monday, schoolchildren and
their teachers are the only visitors admitted to the Getty, giving
them a chance to study objects closely, work at making art with
Getty instructors, and delve into themed, interdisciplinary study
programs designed by their teachers with support from Getty staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good program, because I was here, like, three
times with my family, and I was bored after an hour. Now it's a lot
more interesting,'' said Jocelyn Landgraf, a sophomore at
Louisville High School in Woodland Hills, during a recent trip with
her class.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Getty staff estimates, 25,000 students will have
visited the center and taken part in its arts education programs,
including a contingent of 700 from Cleveland High School in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Brigham, who runs the Getty's education department, at
first wasn't sure how her colleagues would react to the daily
presence of hundreds of adolescents, far more than the Getty Villa
in Malibu could accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   But she says the reaction has been positive. Some staff members
say the crowds have energized and humanized Richard Meier's
abstract architectural collage of angles and arcs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having thousands of people up here all the time makes me feel
more connected to the city than I would've thought. I really was
afraid about moving up here and being isolated,'' said Michael S.
Roth, associate director of the Research Institute, the Getty's art
think tank, and head of its Scholars and Seminars Program.
</P>
<P>
   Once referred to by a Getty official as a ``secular monastery,''
the Research Institute offers several examples of how the Getty is
attempting to make the public feel like guests rather than
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, it liberalized its policy on admitting readers to its
research library stacks. Now, anyone with a simple college ID can
gain access to a substantial part of the library's collection of
700,000 volumes of books, serials and auction catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the first time, the institute is using an open
nomination and application process for its senior visiting research
scholars, who previously were selected by committee.
</P>
<P>
   Roth sees these changes as part of an ongoing effort to
``demystify'' Getty scholarship and make it as transparent as the
institute's glass shell.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal significance, Roth said, the new ``Friday Nights at the
Getty'' performance series has attracted a more diverse crowd than
typically came to Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many visitors hail from the same college-educated, upwardly
mobile demographic as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my friends came here for a visit, and when he got off
the tram he said, `My God, I wasn't wearing black! I didn't think
they'd let me on!' '' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Getty is taking steps to attract new adult
constituencies. When the Research Institute hosted a lecture this
year by a group of African-American photographers, Roth said, it
rented buses to bring people without transportation to the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials concede that the Getty stills needs to be made
more user-friendly, with less concern for quiet good taste and more
signage telling people where to find the restrooms or Van Gogh's
``Irises.''
</P>
<P>
   A sheltered canopy and benches have been provided for walk-in
visitors waiting in line. A taxi dispatcher works the main parking
structure. Future plans call for adding a taco bar and a children's
menu to the Getty's culinary offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Getty has turned down numerous requests to use
its site for weddings, bar mitzvahs, film productions, corporate
planning sessions and fund-raisers, which are closely restricted by
the facility's conditional-use permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've said yes only to those things that are
directly tied to Getty activities,'' Munitz said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Getty enters the new millennium, its mission will
continue to be defined by a tension between the scholarly and the
public, elitism and accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, those themes probably will figure in this
week's four-day Governor's Conference on the Arts at L.A.'s Hotel
Inter-Continental. Titled ``Beyond the Millennium: Redefining the
Arts for the 21st Century'' and co-sponsored by the Getty Trust,
the conference will wrap up with a Thursday afternoon bus trip to
the Getty, where Munitz will deliver welcoming remarks.
</P>
<P>
   With delegations from academia, government, Silicon Valley and
the worlds of art, entertainment and philanthropy, the conference
symbolizes a crossroads of power and culture where the Getty now
sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very pleased to see the appointment of Dr.
Munitz overseeing the transition (at the Getty),'' said Barbara
Pieper, director of the California Arts Council, another conference
co-sponsor. ``I think that's a signal of a confluence of education,
creativity and industry issues that are coming together in what I
would call the New California.''
</P>
<P>
   Munitz may be no pussycat. But neither is he a bull in a china
shop. It remains to be seen how the New Getty _ let alone the ``New
California'' _ will respond.

   &UR; By SALMAN RUSHDIE &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Distributed by New York Times Special Features &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Man is by nature a political animal, said Aristotle, who argued
further that the public life of a ``good'' society must reflect the
nature of its members. Many of the great Macedonian's assertions _
that the slave is ``naturally'' inferior to his master, the female
to the male, the ``barbarian'' to the Greek _ now seem absurd. And
yet Aristotle's basic proposition still rings true. The present
travails of three leading political figures - Bill Clinton, Saddam
Hussein and Augusto Pinochet - reveal how deeply we believe in
natural justice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's probable escape from his domestic pursuers
can be ascribed in part to his foes' astonishing folly. He has been
lucky in his enemies: the sex-crazed, mealy-mouthed Kenneth Starr
and his backers on the Christian Right, who remind us that
``fundamentalism'' is a term born in the USA; Newt Gingrich, who
overplayed a winning hand and lost his shirt; and Linda Tripp, the
wicked witch of the wire, who, like Nixon, didn't understand that
by bugging herself she would only prove her own villainy, even with
the expletives deleted.
</P>
<P>
   When an ancient force _ puritanical fanaticism _ combines with
the contemporary tabloid dogma that public figures have no right to
privacy, and when the Washington political and media elites work
themselves up into a mighty pompous froth, even the President rocks
on his throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton survives, because he has human nature on his side.
Human nature distinguishes between sexual dalliance and political
misconduct. It can be brutal; asked to take a view about Monica and
Paula, the American people replied that they just didn't care. They
have come to know Bill Clinton far more intimately than they
normally know their leaders, and he, of course, has always known
them better than any other politician. Clinton is winning his fight
because he is like his people; because, you could say, he's a
natural.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Iraq, however, the US administration's
understanding of human nature has been deficient, to say the least.
The notion that bombing raids might provoke a coup against Saddam
was always an improbable hypothesis. On the whole, people do not
see as allies those who are dropping large quantities of high
explosives on them from the sky. Like Yossarian, the hero of
``Catch-22,'' they take the bombs personally.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to bomb and then not bombing has the advantage of
killing fewer people, but the disadvantage of making oneself look
silly. Apparently some Iraqis seriously believe that Paula Jones
and Monica Lewinsky were pawns in an international Zionist
conspiracy designed to make Clinton bomb Baghdad. The recent
aborted American-British attack may demonstrate the declining
international influence of these two ladies, but otherwise plays
right into Saddam's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices advocating a rapid end to sanctions, and a
subsequent opening up of the Iraqi market to Western goods and
ideas, may not find much favor with America's military analysts,
but an Iraq freed from the privations of the embargo and the threat
of aerial attack is more likely to think of the West as a friend.
The best way to topple Saddam Hussein may be to help bring into
being an Iraq in which his tyrannies are not only hateful but also
anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the month's other ``unnatural'' figure ought to be
getting easier. Pinochet, after all, has earned the right to be
called the most evil man now alive on earth. (Sorry, Saddam.) The
British law lords have decreed that he is not immune from
extradition. The crucial principle of universal accountability has
thus been upheld. Atrocity is not to be excused by the occupancy of
high office. All this has become very clear in the past days.
</P>
<P>
   Why then has the British Home Secretary asked for extra time to
decide Pinochet's future? The ex-tyrant was well enough to hang out
with Lady Thatcher just the other day, but now claims that the
pressure he's under has provoked a stress-related mental ailment.
The families of the dead must be disgusted by this ruse. Pinochet
must not escape on such flimsy ``compassionate'' grounds. Jack
Straw should confirm at once that for the mass murderers of the
world, there can be no compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature exists, and it is both deep and highly
structured,'' writes Edward O. Wilson, the biologist and writer
whom Tom Wolfe calls ``a new Darwin.'' If it did not _ let us be
clear _ then the idea of universals _ human rights, moral
principles, international law _ would have no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fact of our common humanity that allows most of us to
forgive Bill Clinton his faults, that will not allow us to agree
that bombing innocent Iraqis is the right way to punish Saddam
Hussein, and that makes us want to see Pinochet brought to justice.
A world that hounded Clinton but turned a blind eye to Pinochet
would indeed be a world turned upside down.

</P>
<P>
   Man is by nature a political animal, said Aristotle, who argued
further that the public life of a ``good'' society must reflect the
nature of its members. Many of the great Macedonian's assertions _
that the slave is ``naturally'' inferior to his master, the female
to the male, the ``barbarian'' to the Greek _ now seem absurd. And
yet Aristotle's basic proposition still rings true. The present
travails of three leading political figures - Bill Clinton, Saddam
Hussein and Augusto Pinochet - reveal how deeply we believe in
natural justice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's probable escape from his domestic pursuers
can be ascribed in part to his foes' astonishing folly. He has been
lucky in his enemies: the sex-crazed, mealy-mouthed Kenneth Starr
and his backers on the Christian Right, who remind us that
``fundamentalism'' is a term born in the USA; Newt Gingrich, who
overplayed a winning hand and lost his shirt; and Linda Tripp, the
wicked witch of the wire, who, like Nixon, didn't understand that
by bugging herself she would only prove her own villainy, even with
the expletives deleted.
</P>
<P>
   When an ancient force _ puritanical fanaticism _ combines with
the contemporary tabloid dogma that public figures have no right to
privacy, and when the Washington political and media elites work
themselves up into a mighty pompous froth, even the President rocks
on his throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton survives, because he has human nature on his side.
Human nature distinguishes between sexual dalliance and political
misconduct. It can be brutal; asked to take a view about Monica and
Paula, the American people replied that they just didn't care. They
have come to know Bill Clinton far more intimately than they
normally know their leaders, and he, of course, has always known
them better than any other politician. Clinton is winning his fight
because he is like his people; because, you could say, he's a
natural.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Iraq, however, the US administration's
understanding of human nature has been deficient, to say the least.
The notion that bombing raids might provoke a coup against Saddam
was always an improbable hypothesis. On the whole, people do not
see as allies those who are dropping large quantities of high
explosives on them from the sky. Like Yossarian, the hero of
``Catch-22,'' they take the bombs personally.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to bomb and then not bombing has the advantage of
killing fewer people, but the disadvantage of making oneself look
silly. Apparently some Iraqis seriously believe that Paula Jones
and Monica Lewinsky were pawns in an international Zionist
conspiracy designed to make Clinton bomb Baghdad. The recent
aborted American-British attack may demonstrate the declining
international influence of these two ladies, but otherwise plays
right into Saddam's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices advocating a rapid end to sanctions, and a
subsequent opening up of the Iraqi market to Western goods and
ideas, may not find much favor with America's military analysts,
but an Iraq freed from the privations of the embargo and the threat
of aerial attack is more likely to think of the West as a friend.
The best way to topple Saddam Hussein may be to help bring into
being an Iraq in which his tyrannies are not only hateful but also
anachronistic.

REAL E-MAIL, IMAGINARY FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when nothing came between Brooke Shields and her
Calvins?
</P>
<P>
   What if you could have e-mailed Shields back then? Would you
have asked her any questions? About modeling maybe? Or her family
life? Calvin Klein is betting on it.
</P>
<P>
   In an innovative new ad campaign for his cK one fragrance, the
fashion designer has set up Internet addresses for the three
characters depicted in his print, radio, and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is, the characters are make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. When consumers send e-mail _ any kind of message _
to these nonentities (Tia, Robert, and Anna), the characters will
respond with vivid details about their imaginary lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's an on-line soap opera. And a smart interactive marketing
tool to connect consumers to the product, which was launched in
1994. ``The next cK one generation has different values and
communicates in a very modern way,'' says Klein.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is a new kind of intimacy that's really a
paradox _ people all over the world are more in touch than ever,
but they're doing it one-to-one on e-mail and the Internet. When we
take this new campaign to e-mail, it makes it very personal. People
are sharing more and they want to know more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company _ which sells 10 fragrances along with
clothing _ reports that the public has always been interested in
the models in its ads. ``I think the images really strike a chord
with our consumers,'' says Diana Lin, a spokeswoman for Calvin
Klein Cosmetics Co., a licensee of Calvin Klein Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, previous ads have had real people in them, like Kate
Moss and Marky Mark. One has to wonder, do consumers really want to
spend time writing to phony individuals? There's Anna, a
13-year-old schoolgirl; Tia, a TV advertising producer in her 20s
who just relocated to New York from Seattle; and Robert, a married
30-something director of TV commercials who _ at the moment _
thinks he might be in love with Tia, whom he just met in London
while shooting a dog food commercial.
</P>
<P>
   People love drama, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a professor of
advertising at Boston University. ``Is this any more pathetic than
weeping as Jimmy Smits dies on `NYPD Blue'? This is an actor on TV
and people are sobbing as this guy expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good way to tap into all the cyber stuff that is hot
at the moment. . . . It's a pseudorelationship. All you get back
are preprogrammed little messages. . . . But look how many people
live for chat rooms and who knows who you're chatting with?''
</P>
<P>
   More important than the e-mail, of course, is the question _
will consumers buy the fragrance? To date, Klein has sold more than
$390 million of the light unisex scent in the United States, making
it Klein's best-selling fragrance, and clearly, this campaign will
only attract more attention. Says Berkovitz, ``All that really
matters to the marketer is: Does the audience get involved?'' So
even if people don't buy the fragrance and instead send hate mail,
the campaign will still be a success because, he says, ``they're
responding.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the campaign started in mid-November and it will hit
TV and radio airways in Boston Thursday. Print ads have already
debuted in the December issues of various magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who've written to tia(at)ckone.com,
robert(at)ckone.com, and anna(at)ckone.com have learned a lot about
the trio. During Tia's first week on the job, for example, she was
sent to London, which annoyed Jason (another character), back in
Seattle. ``Never mind that this is the biggest opportunity I've
ever had in my life, all he can think about is how it affects
him,'' she complains, while also noting that a guy named Ian
``hasn't quit hitting on'' her since she arrived in London.
</P>
<P>
   Robert has revealed that his life is ``quite literally, going to
the dogs. I have been sequestered in London for the past week,
logging in 18-hour days and slowly but surely losing my grasp on
reality. And to what end? A bloody dog food commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna's communication is much more vague, but she has mentioned
her ``life is ruined'' and that the party was a bad idea. ``I can't
talk now because I've got too much to do trying to figure out if
there's any possible way to save my life before my mom gets back.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters' e-mail arrives sporadically, just as real e-mail
does. Once a consumer sends an initial message, the characters will
keep writing to them regardless of whether the consumer writes
back. To stop the chatter from the Klein characters, consumers just
have to send the message ``get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin says the company will introduce seven new characters in
1999. While models will be used in TV and print ads, the dialogue
from the characters will come from employees at the New York ad
agency Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   So can consumers expect the characters to talk about cK one all
the time? No, promises Lin. ``There's nothing promotional at all,''
she says. ``These are real voices.'' In cyberspace at least.

FINISHING OFF A DINNERTIME DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At many Thanksgiving gatherings, the accepted way to announce
that one has eaten one's fill is a low, resonant moan, the sound of
satisfaction liberally seasoned with regret. But at the celebration
Natasha Bello took part in, the grateful diners had enough energy
left over to debate whether ``I am finished'' was more correct than
``I am done.'' ``Who's right?'' she wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm not sure Miss Manners would condone either choice.
Unless someone is asking for the rest of your pumpkin pie, there's
no need to declare that you're not going to eat any more; your
companions will surely notice, if they're interested. And when
offered more, you say ``No, thank you'' _ not, please, ``I'm
stuffed!''
</P>
<P>
   And when it's waitpersons who are asking if you are finished,
``May I take your plate?'' is a more discreet inquiry than either
``Are you finished?'' or ``Are you done?'' (Though almost anything
is better than ``Are you still working on that?'' _ an appalling
expression that manages to imply both that you're doing a chore,
rather than enjoying yourself, and that you're not doing it fast
enough.)
</P>
<P>
   But I digress; this was a usage question, and my favorite usage
chroniclers offered plenty of answers. According to the
Merriam-Webster usage arbiters, I'm done (or I am done) seems to
have moved in on the traditional form, I have done, during the 19th
century. Following the usual historical pattern, traditionalists
responded by spending the first half of this century preaching that
I'm done was improper usage, and demanding that we say I'm finished
instead.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, I'm finished had only a slightly longer pedigree,
for it too was moving from the I have to the I am construction. As
recently as 1985, the M-W usage dictionary can point to an English
teacher _ albeit in a German classroom _ who was insisting that
students use I have finished, and marking I'm finished wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The real surprise, though, is that I'm through _ which took root
around the same time as I'm finished _ somehow sneaked under the
radar of the word wardens. A few tiny skirmishes at the border, a
Bing Crosby hit song, and I'm through was one of the family, while
I'm done is, obviously, still struggling for respectability in some
circles. Most of us can give thanks, however, that if we want to
say it, we can say it any way we like: We're through, we're
finished, we're done.
</P>
<P>
   Doom and gloom
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite done. My explorations of auxiliary-verb
territory reminded me of an earlier query from Marie Masse of
Topsfield. Why, in an October column, had I written ``our doom is
come'' rather than ``our doom has come''?
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure why, aside from the fact that it sounded right,
but the association that first surfaced from the subconscious was
Tennyson. ``My doom is come upon me'' _ isn't that what the Lady of
Shalott said, more or less? But I hadn't read the poem in many a
year, and in fact, the lines I was misremembering go like this:
</P>
<P>
   The mirror crack'd from side to side;
</P>
<P>
   ``The curse is come upon me,'' cried
</P>
<P>
   The Lady of Shalott.
</P>
<P>
   Did I read a bowdlerized version, long ago, or simply edit it
unconsciously in the years since? In any case, Tennyson would
probably have written it my way, back in 1830, had he known that
100 years later, the curse would have a meaning that would make
schoolgirls giggle at his poor bewitched beauty.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it's curse or doom, why is it is come upon me, not
has come? It's because come, along with a few other English verbs
``of motion and position,'' can be conjugated with the original
auxiliary, be, as well as with the later have. ``He is gone is
still used to express resulting state,'' explains the OED, ``while
he has gone expresses action.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare does it, of course: Richard II says Bolingbroke ``is
come to open / The purple testament of bleeding war.'' The King
James Bible, too: ``Behold, he is come out to fight.'' This is not
a usage we're likely to have much need of, but its immediacy gives
it a drama lacking in the has form of the verb. To return to the
table, Dinner is served has an obvious advantage over the equally
grammatical and accurate dinner has been served _ except for guests
who prefer cold turkey.

ON THE RECORD FOR BUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There is the myth of white flight, he says, the notion
that when the buses rolled to desegregate the Boston public
schools, white parents suddenly flooded out to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   There is the myth that busing could have included the ring of
suburbs around the city and been less disruptive and more fair.
</P>
<P>
   And a myth, too, he deems the notion that the remedy to
desegregate Boston's schools somehow failed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years after his court order desegregating Boston
schools, with anger toward him still fresh among many parents, many
of the same issues still unresolved, and the Boston Latin School
case being appealed to the nation's highest court, Judge W. Arthur
Garrity, Jr. is trying to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   That record is in 60-odd boxes of Garrity's papers on the case
that were donated this week to the University of Massachusetts at
Boston: eight crates full of correspondence, much of it death
threats and hate mail, another filled with dozens of doctoral
theses on the case. It includes the dockets to the 17 appeals to
his decision, and Garrity's point-by-point refutation of factual
errors he says he found in the chapter entitled ``The Judge'' in
Common Ground, the late J. Anthony Lukas's best-selling and
Pulitzer Prize winning chronicle of Boston desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   For those who sift through the files, Garrity promises, there is
also the demographic data debunking the notion of white flight as a
result of the busing order, the memos and reports proving that he
carefully weighed and reasoned through different remedies for
desegregation, and attendance records, by race, for every single
school day in Boston between 1974 and 1990, when the case was
officially closed.
</P>
<P>
   For such a public case, Garrity says, it is only appropriate
that the historical record be on public display at a public
university. But for the judge, it is also a way of showing the
facts behind what he sees as the myths that still persist, of
countering his common portrayal as an aloof theoretician playing
social engineer from his comfortable home in Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   And in a wide-ranging interview at his office overlooking Boston
Harbor from the new federal courthouse, Garrity, now 78, continued
to defend his decisions in the Boston case, which landed on his
desk by judges' lottery in 1972. If he has regret, it is mostly
that the desegregation solution for which he was so reviled has
come unraveled with the challenge to race-based admissions at
Boston Latin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with certain solutions, and damn,'' he says,
shaking his head. ``It was working quite well, really. That's all
been undone, and something's going to have to be proposed. So you
go out and come up with a lot of surrogate concepts, but I just
don't know if any of those are going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so much the target of vitriol and death threats after his
June 21, 1974 decision that he had two US marshals outside his home
for nearly four years, from September 1974 to February 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he says in reflection, was that the city's leaders
and parents never signed on to the essential mission of the court
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question has been whether it's a race case or an education
issue,'' he said. ``You try to make it both, but before you got to
improving education, you had to give the black students and parents
the same opportunities you did others. That was the constitutional
part of it. The constitution does not have any requirement for
education, that's left to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was first a race case. We tried to make it an education
case as well. The parents and the city leaders have never looked
upon the case in that fashion. They think of it principally as
being a schools, an education case, and incidentally a race case.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls the story of a breakfast meeting with businessmen
downtown where one prominent banker buttonholed the judge and
insisted that his organization would do anything to help Boston
public schools. But desegregate the schools? Count him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you started to talk about giving one race any remedy for
past injustice, that was not something he wanted to talk about,''
Garrity said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even trying to improve the racial climate,'' Garrity
added. ``I was trying to vindicate constitutional rights of some
black students who were being bused past white schools, who were
going to schools with all white faculty, schools that had leaking
roofs and facilities that were being absolutely neglected, had
inferior, if any, textbooks. The thing was absolutely horrible when
I came in. It was horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-mayor Kevin White and others argued that the plan should
have included the city's suburbs. But Garrity continues to insist
that that would not have worked _ with the papers at UMass
outlining his argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that Brookline is surrounded by Boston, you
couldn't convert Brookline schools reasonably into the Boston
school system because you don't have authority or jurisdiction to
make orders against persons who are not in some fashion responsible
for the wrong that's being righted. You can't go out and drag in
anyone you feel like.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the case provoked disruption, he insists that it has
had benefits. Restructuring the system made it possible for people
without political connections to be hired as teachers.
</P>
<P>
   While the percentage of white students dropped from nearly half
to less than a fifth of the public school population, Garrity says
that white flight from busing was a myth. One third of the families
with children under 18 left the city between 1970 and 1980,
according to the census. But the records at UMass, he says, show
that the same pattern of whites moving to the suburbs started in
the 1950s, and was no more true in Boston than it was in the rest
of eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity refuses to comment on whether his plan has been a
success. He acknowledges that the issue of race and education has
changed. He himself overturned a system of quotas at Boston Latin,
arguing that court decisions required the remedy for desegregation
be more tightly tailored to past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, he said, whether the Supreme Court will
entirely abandon affirmative action in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked and tried to answer truthfully, would I have
done anything differently,'' he said. ``Looking back to the
circumstances confronting me at the time, I would not have done
things any differently. I thought I did what I had to do, I did
what I thought was reasonable.''

LET'S TALK ABOUT PETER LYNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His close and casual friends say that Fidelity mutual fund
legend Peter Lynch is a difficult man to dislike. True enough, but
I've come to the point where I'm more than willing to try.
</P>
<P>
   He is everywhere. His long, gaunt visage, his scrubby salt and
pepper locks, appear on national television countless times each
day. He is riding on airplanes with Don Rickles. He is waiting in
line at the Registry of Motor Vehicles. He is running on a bucking
treadmill aside Lily Tomlin. He stares out from billboards, from
glossy magazine advertisements, from the Internet, uttering such
pseudo-sage, oversimplified pablum as ``Know what you own and why
you own it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has arguably become the most visible Bostonian in America,
emblematic of too much of what this booming city has become. It
used to be that Boston was more about compassion, about livability,
about knowledge, about things that transcend the singular pursuit
of wealth. Over the last couple of years, it is gliding towards a
boutique version of New York, too money-crazed, too morally craven.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is everywhere. The average immigrant family can't
afford a decent apartment in even the most downtrodden
neighborhoods of the city. Back Bay condominiums are selling for
upwards of $400 a square foot. Swiss chocolates on Newbury Street
fetch $1.50 a bite. A 40-yard line ticket to the Patriots is $50,
and that's not enough to keep them from leaving town. The financial
district is crammed with young men in French blue shirts talking on
cellular phones about vacation plans to Bali.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Boston has become a city that kneels at the
altar of the almighty dollar, the metropolitan equivalent of John
Updike's most famous character, Rabbit Angstrom, rolling around his
bed on a pile of gleaming Krugerrands. Don't get me wrong. I love
money. I think about it all the time. I'm thinking about it right
now. But there has to be something more.
</P>
<P>
   I just spent 2 1/2 years in a national capital obsessed with
oral sex, only to arrive in a provincial capital obsessed with
itself. To be sure, some of that self-importance is good. Parks are
better. The city is cleaner. The harbor is beautiful, and the
bounty of construction cranes is the harbinger of even better times
to come.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side is complacency. No more arguments on the haves
and have nots. Rather, the debates are about skyscrapers and
stadium luxury boxes, the political satisfaction found in the
flowers planted on Blue Hill Avenue, never mind the hopelessness of
those who look out on them.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Peter Lynch. His business legend is well
deserved, especially judging from the type of hard numbers by which
Boston now judges itself. In 13 years as a money manager, he racked
up a cumulative gain of 2,700 percent, taking the Magellan Fund
from $20 million in assets to over $14 billion. He was the premier
stock picker in the nation, his golden touch making it possible for
millions of Americans to buy houses and send children to college.
``He is the Walter Cronkite of financial services,'' said Fidelity
executive Paula Polito.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he is described by his friend, Boston advertising
titan Jack Connors, as ``an enormously decent guy.'' He donates
swaths of time to charity _ two full days a week, by his own
estimate. He is a tireless philanthropic fundraiser, a major and
valued patron of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in reality, at Fidelity, there are signs that Lynch is
allowing the legend to overtake the man. He lacks, if you will,
that elusive quality of duende, and his television presence invites
the use of the remote control. One Fidelity president recently
bristled to Globe business columnist Steven Syre, ``What fund does
Peter Lynch run?'' None, actually. Lynch, semi-retired and
fabulously wealthy, hasn't managed any Fidelity money in nearly
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, other critics have questioned the elementary
investment advice he espouses in his two best-selling books and in
the Fidelity advertising campaign _ counsel such as, if you like
L'eggs pantyhose, invest in its maker, Hanes. With that kind of
advice, I'd own the Capital Grille, and that stock has been flat
for years. ``It is simplistic,'' says Tobias Levkovich, a senior
analyst for Smith Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues whisper that he treasures the publicity, and
without fresh accomplishment, reaches into his past for
contemporary fame. Allies argue he does it for the good of his
company. Lynch himself says he does it as a public service, because
people should know more about investing. But will they, really,
with Lynch slogans like ``Do your homework'' and ``Understand the
market?'' Which leaves only the Lynch-like question, ``What is he
doing and why is he doing it?''

THE FRUSTRATIONS OF AN UNDECIDED GOP HOUSE MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Call me a CUHR.
</P>
<P>
   As a Composite Undecided House Republican, I hate the box I'm
in, and I get no comfort from the fact that for once this box is
not of my own, squishy-minded making but is entirely President
Clinton's doing.
</P>
<P>
   I know what the wise guys are saying, that Acting Speaker Tom
Delay of Texas is spreading the message that the next 10 days or so
is purely for TV and that he already has a 10- to 15-vote margin in
favor of at least one perjury-based impeachment article. But I know
different, because Delay's message _ just like the
Gingrich-Livingston speakership _ forgets about the 30 to 35 of us
who like to make up our own minds. And on this one, animus and
party are not enough; this vote goes in my obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a bunch of things bother me about this mess, but
eight in particular stand out:
</P>
<P>
   --This is another government shutdown in the making, longer and
more traumatic than what Newt put us through pointlessly in 1995.
If no one can tell me there is even a chance that Clinton can
actually get thrown out of office by the Senate, then a yes vote
can come back to haunt me; people will say I helped put the country
through another wringer for no purpose whatsover.
</P>
<P>
   --Worse, I do not want to have to answer to bankers, business
guys, and investment types in my district who yell at me that I'm
putting the financial markets and the economy at risk. The prospect
of instability made them nervous last summer; they're getting itchy
again, and I can't come up with a reason to justify making the
United States look like Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   --I hate it when my so-called leaders take a hike and leave my
rear end exposed. I can't believe Bob Livingston is having Delay
front for him on the biggest issue next to war any of us faces. If
he ducks on the big ones, who cares what he does on appropriations
bills?
</P>
<P>
   --Even worse, for people asked to make tough decisions, it
doesn't help when the stand-in leaders tell you things that aren't
so, like Delay's bull-bleep about censure. We now know it has a
larger presence in American history than impeachment does, and we
know there is nothing even remotely violative of the Constitution
about it. To the contrary, it is an entirely legitimate option.
</P>
<P>
   --But that's not all. Delay is actually trying to rig the
impeachment issue's time on the House floor so that we are
forbidden to discuss censure, forbidden to consider it, and
forbidden to vote on it. My leaders know and all my colleagues know
that if the House is permitted to work its will, around 20
Republicans will vote for some form of censure and then vote
against impeachment. That being the case, some of us will have to
think hard about refusing to be put into an either-or box by our
so-called leaders.
</P>
<P>
   --But Delay and his henchmen are going even further. Their
latest maneuver, and it is proof that they know they have yet to
assemble a hard majority for impeachment, is that they are trying
to change the meaning of impeachment. He and Henry Hyde acolytes
like Bill McCollum of Florida are actually telling me that
impeachment can be censure, that it doesn't have to be followed by
a Senate trial, and that incompetent McCollum had the gall to say
impeachment could be a ``scarlet letter'' for Clinton to wear
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Well phooey on them. Elliot Richardson was right when he said a
vote to impeach means a vote to have a trial and remove him from
office, period.
</P>
<P>
   --And it might help if the case were in evidentiary shape for
such a momentous vote, but it isn't. Some of us remember what
Hyde's guy, David Schippers, promised two months ago, noting, for
example, that Monica Lewinsky's credibility could be legitimately
questioned. Schippers then promised that ``at an appropriate stage
of the proceedings that credibility will of necessity be assessed
together with the credibility of all other witnesses in the light
of all the other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   --Finally, we know that there are at least two unexploded bombs
out there before we are asked to put our reputations on the line
and cast votes. One is Hillary Rodham Clinton; the other is her
husband, who everyone knows could change this atmosphere utterly by
being a little more contrite and a little more forthcoming (say by
changing the word ``mislead'' to ``lie'').
</P>
<P>
   That's why we are undecided, and that's why we are worried.
</P>

AT LAST A NATIONAL SCOREBOARD OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CULLEN MURPHY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Secular soothsayers in recent years have deployed a variety of
well-known tools _ not just opinion polling but also various
economic auguries and social indicators _ to divine the public's
mood and perhaps even to illuminate what lies a few steps ahead.
Often, these tools are useful.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we could monitor, on a day-to-day basis, the
shifting prominence of specific words in the collective American
consciousness? Wouldn't such a Semantic Observation System (as we
might call it) yield important clues to the public mind?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that we have such clues at our fingertips, thanks
to the electronic version of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
Dictionary (www.m-w.com).
</P>
<P>
   The notion that words offer a key to social circumstances is a
hoary one. Scholars have spent a great deal of time trying to
infer, on the basis of vocabulary alone, the cultural and
environmental milieu of the first ``proto-Indo-European'' people _
that is, the people who spoke proto-Indo-European, the
reconstructed language that is presumed to be ancestral to most of
the languages spoken today in a vast swath from Europe to India.
</P>
<P>
   To give one example: The Indo-Europeans had no generalized word
for sea, prompting scholars to speculate that they were originally
a landlocked people.
</P>
<P>
   Linguistic work usually requires years of painstaking effort.
What the online Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary makes
possible is a form of instantaneous ``lexicographie verite.''
Individuals consult the online dictionary to look up more than 6
million words a month. (Merriam-Webster Online is probably the most
widely used English language online dictionary in the world, and
the service is available at no charge.) Merriam-Webster designed
the dictionary with a kind of see-through-mirror function:
Observers at the company can ``watch'' which words are being looked
up in real time; they do not, of course, know who is looking those
words up.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster also keeps cumulative track of the incoming
traffic, word by word, and company executives can review a Top 100
list at any moment. The number of daily hits required for a word to
reach the No. 1 spot varies according to day of week and time of
year; it has been known to exceed 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, words are flung onto that list by current events.
Paparazzi, princess, and cortege briefly surged as high as No. 17,
No. 36, and No. 60, respectively, in September 1997, in the
aftermath of the death of Princess Diana. Au pair reached No. 10
during the trial in the fall of 1997 of Louise Woodward, the young
British nanny who was accused of shaking to death a baby left in
her care. The recent 60 Minutes broadcast, which showed video
footage of Dr. Jack Kevorkian putting a patient to death, prompted
a short-lived upward blip of euthanasia to No. 102.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, during the first nine months of 1998, words
associated with President Bill Clinton's travails regularly made
their way onto the Top 100 list. Online-dictionary usage first
registered the Clinton scandals in mid-January, when people began
looking up the words suborn, perjury and proffer in unusually large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As winter gave way to spring, interest in these words was
replaced by interest in impeach, impeachment, and character. By
August, when Clinton submitted to a four-hour deposition with the
independent counsel and then made his semiconfessional speech to
the nation, the ascendant words included contrite, contrition and
mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, on the weekend when Kenneth Starr made
public the full text of his report, the No. 1 word on the
Merriam-Webster list was salacious, with sordid at one point
cresting to the No. 34 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicographically, salacious represents the Clinton scandal's
point of furthest semantic advance. Impeachment attempted a
comeback, reaching its all-time high (No. 3) Oct. 8 but, for weeks
thereafter, no scandal-related terminology showed any sign of
significant strength or staying power on the Merriam-Webster site _
an obvious bellwether of the public's sudden loss of interest. (At
one point in November, integrity registered an anemic No. 98.)
</P>
<P>
   John M. Morse, president of Merriam-Webster and a professional
lexicographer who has studied the diurnal fluctuations closely,
observes, ``From approximately early October onward, Monica-related
words virtually ceased to appear on any day's Top 100 list. What
was evident from our site was that the public had tired of the
whole issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Words such as salacious and paparazzi, thrust briefly into
prominence, must be seen against a background of what constitutes
ordinary dictionary traffic, which for the most part is inertial
and humdrum _ the dictionary equivalent of junk DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving out sexually oriented and offensive words (which people
seem as prone to look up in online dictionaries as they do in print
ones; f**k is by far the most-looked-up word in the online
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary on any given day), what
follows is the cumulative Top 40 list for the first six months of
this year:
</P>
<P>
   1. paradigm; 2. love; 3. thesaurus; 4. ubiquitous; 5. HTML; 6.
effect; 7. gry; 8. affect; 9. home; 10. dog; 11. help; 12. time;
13. oxymoron; 14. Internet; 15. computer; 16. serendipity; 17. web;
18. etymology; 19. mail; 20. esoteric; 21. home page; 22.
genealogy; 23. pedantic; 24. ensure; 25. synergy; 26. hubris; 27.
hello; 28. marijuana; 29. metaphor; 30. resume; 31. dictionary; 32.
heuristic; 33. caveat; 34. eclectic; 35. information; 36. epiphany;
37. weight; 38. acquiesce; 39. pragmatic; 40. egregious.
</P>
<P>
   The Semantic Operating System remains in a relatively primitive
state of development, but clearly the future holds more, not less,
of this sort of thing. The statistical analysis of language was,
after all, a primal urge even before the days when electronic tools
made it easy, and some of the most compelling statistical data
emerged from the pre-microchip Age of the Linguist-Drudge.
(Examples would include the fact that 12 specific syllables account
for a quarter of all the English speech you hear, and the fact that
the 50 most frequently used words in English account for 45 percent
of the total volume of all words used.) So we can expect
refinements and advances.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Merriam-Webster's tabulation of online consultations
will continue. Take note: In recent days, one word has been coming
on very strong _ censure, which, at this writing, holds the No. 5
position among the Merriam-Webster Top 100.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, the most revealing news offered by the
Merriam-Webster data has nothing to do with individual words or
current events. It is the fact that ordinary people are so eager to
take the trouble to look things up. America cherishes a myth of
itself as a land of practical folk who evince a zest for
self-improvement _ even as they pursue some sort of quest for
definition. Some 6 million times a month, the myth turns out to be
the truth.

RAGE OF THE ENTITLEMENT QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  By KATE AURTHUR 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was quoted in the Los Angeles Times
saying that she and her girlfriend, actress Anne Heche, had fired
their agents and publicists and were leaving Hollywood _ they were
sick of the homophobia they'd experienced since coming out as
lesbians last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that I ever feared happened to me,'' DeGeneres
said. ``I lost my show. I've been attacked like hell. I went from
making a lot of money on a sitcom to making no money.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem here?
</P>
<P>
   Heche got better reviews than the heterosexual Harrison Ford in
last spring's hapless comedy ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' and today
she reprises Janet Leigh's role in ``Psycho'' as the most notorious
murder victim in film history.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres has two movies coming out (one a Ron Howard comedy)
and is set to do a standup tour later this winter.
</P>
<P>
   I do feel sympathy for Ellen. To come out of the closet and
begin a new relationship under such intense public scrutiny is
unimaginable. I'm happy that my own period of playing the gay
megaphone, which took place on campus at age 19, wasn't staged for
Diane Sawyer, Oprah, and President Clinton. And you have to admit
that the professional pressure on DeGeneres was fierce, even if her
dilemma was notable mostly for its irony: Could an sitcom get
decent ratings if an out lesbian was played by out lesbian?
</P>
<P>
   But if DeGeneres feels that her subtleties as a performer are
being overshadowed by her status as a lesbian, she's the one who
set it up that way. She used her sexuality as a crutch throughout
the long feud with ABC that dominated the troubled last season of
her show. She should have copped to the fact that after a single
luminous, thought-provoking and joyful coming-out episode in the
spring of 1997, Ellen got lost in awkwardly orchestrated, unfunny
plot developments about parents and first girlfriends. Instead, she
called her network a bunch of homophobes.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think DeGeneres was funny, and I loved Anne Heche in
the little indie film ``Walking and Talking'' back when she was
just an alumna of the soap opera ``Another World.'' Now I think of
them as entitlement queens who whine while their careers steam
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Watching them make out in front of President Clinton was hard to
take, but I'm sure he didn't mind. Watching Ellen screech,
``They're killing us!'' upon the death of gay student Matthew
Shepard turned my stomach. Faced with an actual tragedy, the least
she could have done is realize how fortunate she was.
</P>
<P>
   The day after DeGeneres made her announcement, Variety ran an
interview with the couple's publicist, who claimed that their
comments were taken out of context. (What context would that be?)
He added they should have been taken as ``wistful,'' rather than
literal.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the two actresses are really dropping out,
Variety writes, ``They don't have the agent, still have the
publicist and the house, and Heche was last seen driving through
Burbank.'' Whatever they wind up doing, I'm adopting a ``don't
ask/don't tell'' policy about it.

NAPA VALLEY FIGHTS GANG THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ When the seventh, eighth and ninth teenagers hit
the ground with gunshot wounds as they waited for their morning
bus, the illusion of an idyll fell with them.
</P>
<P>
   The incongruous reality is that lush Napa County, along with its
celebrated vineyards, quaint downtown and cozy B&AMP;Bs, has a gang
problem it can no longer ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety is high. Both the people who live in the neighborhoods
that two rival gangs claim as their own and the people who depend
on wine-tasting tourists for their livelihoods worry they will be
harmed.
</P>
<P>
   High school senior Yissel Lopez says her mother has taken to
insisting she stay indoors at night. A car cruising with its
headlights off now causes Francisco Lopez , no relation, to flinch
reflexively. The former amateur boxer with aspirations to the
ministry says he fears being caught in the cross-fire on his way
home from junior college.
</P>
<P>
   In the four weeks since nine people were shot in 72 hours,
locals who were shaken by the city's first-ever drive-by killing
last April have flocked to community forums to insist something be
done to keep Napa County from becoming another Detroit or Los
Angeles. The district attorney's office has created a new full-time
position: gang prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem that is not going to go away,'' said Napa
Police Chief Dan Monez , who now has two officers charged with
keeping tabs on gang members and potential gang members full-time.
``It's a phenomenon that is very, very difficult to deal with, but
we have some hope here that at least we can manage it and minimize
the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence _ which, until this year, mostly took the form of
clubbings, beatings and the occasional stabbing _ has not been
limited to any single neighborhood or ethnic group in this
predominantly Hispanic city of 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 year old facing attempted murder charges in the bus stop
shootings is white and from a middle-class family and a suspected
gang affiliate, police said. One of five people being prosecuted
for the drive-by fatality is also an Anglo. No suspects have been
pinpointed in the other multiple shooting in an apartment complex
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But the two gangs causing the majority of trouble identify
themselves by their ties to Mexico, even if not every member is
Mexican. Affiliates of the Surenos, Spanish for southerners, tend
to be relatively recent immigrants. The more Americanized Nortenos,
or northerners, come from families who have been in the states for
two generations or longer. The Nortenos wear red, the Surenos blue.
Police estimate that the gangs may have 300 members between them,
although no more than two dozen willing to war with more than spray
paint or sneers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this year alone, police have had to respond more than
half a dozen times to reports of gunshots, sometimes bullets fired
in the air, sometimes at a house, said Napa Police Sgt. John
Kostelac . It is uncertain whether those shootings were
gang-related, he added, but with back-and-forth retaliations
becoming common occurrences, the suspicion is that they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't random,'' said Lars Christensen(cq), principal of
Napa High School, whose 2,200 students are forbidden from wearing
gang colors or flashing gang signs on campus. ``It started six
months ago with a feud involving adults and young people. . .And
some very petty arguments have ended in some catastrophic
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangs, as local authorities and residents explained it, have
gained a foothold in Napa County, population 120,000, for the same
reasons they have in large urban areas more readily associated with
violence. Some pointed to an increase in single-family homes,
leaving youths unsupervised. Others said too many Hispanics in the
poorer sections of town have too little to look forward to, since
they perform most of the menial, low-paying tasks in the wealthy
wineries that have made Napa world famous.
</P>
<P>
   Here as elsewhere, gangs can give youths a sense of recognition
and belonging, however misbegotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at that age, it was all about acceptance,'' said
Daniel Fiske , teen director at the Napa Boys &AMP; Girls Club and
himself a former Norteno. ``It was cheap to be a gang member _ all
you needed was a pair of Dickies and a white T-shirt. It was
something to do, and there's not enough for kids to do around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Word around town is that the latest shootings, which gravely
injured a 14-year-old boy in a poorer neighborhood known as
Westwood, date back to the deadly April drive-by. That fight began
when a group of Nortenos who were changing a flat tire traded
insults with a group of Surenos who happened by in a car. When the
argument was over, a 17 year old lay dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, there has been an escalation of violence,
culminating in the bus stop ambush beneath a highway overpass, just
past a muted mural of Our Lady of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here to get away from it, but you can't get away
from it anymore,'' said Manuel Alvarez, 18, who shuns the gangs but
worries that Surenos will hassle him because he has relatives who
are Nortenos. ``I guess for some kids around here that means a lot
more pressure to pick a side.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides, in fact, have been drawn for some time now in this
town tucked into the mountains north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Napa police and politicians first confronted a gang problem in
1992, after noticing graffiti and an increase in fighting. A task
force of sorts was formed, but fell apart within months, said Scott
LeStrange, chief deputy of Napa County's District Attorney's
office. People did not believe the problem was deep-seated, he
said, adding that ``we do now, because the bullets are flying.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mayor Ed Henderson put it, ``We thought we had it under
control. We learned that you can't just sit back when the numbers
go down. . .We're jumping on it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials from around the country now meet
regularly to coordinate their efforts. Father John Brenkle of St.
Helena Catholic Church said one group he belongs to, the
Sonoma-Napa Action Project, has decided to take on street violence.
One of their long-range goals is to persuade businesses in Napa,
where unemployment is a low 4 percent, to create better-paying jobs
for youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a choice: We can divert these kids to healthy
programs and or to Juvenile Hall,'' said Father Brenkle. ``But if
you don't get jobs for these kids, you're kind of spitting in the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Howard, executive director of the Napa Valley
Conference and Visitors Bureau, said no public officials have yet
called asking for help combatting gangs with jobs or internships.
No tourists, and 5 million of them visit Napa County annually, have
called with concerns about the gangs either, he said. The gangs, he
said, are not an issue for them.
</P>
<P>
   To Fiske, the former Norteno turned teen director, any lack of
urgency on the part of Napa's elite means the county is unlikely to
triumph over gangs while it can. He pointed to a concrete symbol of
the crisis: the club's new center sits empty and unfinished for
lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame the gangs on the parents; you can't blame it
on any one thing,'' said Fiske, 22, who got out five years ago in
part because he was maturing, in part because his friend was shot.
``You have to blame it on the community. These are our kids and
it's our problem. Everyone's. Now let's do something about it.''

PUERTO RICANS IN US FEEL A STAKE IN ISLAND VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The street signs surrounding the brick-faced Villa
Victoria complex are a constant reminder of the country they left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Paseo Borikn. Paseo San Juan. Paseo Aguadilla.
</P>
<P>
   In this slice of the South End, the oldest Puerto Rican
neighborhood in Boston, residents are preoccupied with Sunday's
plebiscite in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should become a state,'' said Nelson Rios, 43, as
he walked past Escuelita Borikn, Spanish for ``little Puerto Rican
school.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, 65-year-old Jorge Flores shook his head. ``The
young people want statehood; I say keep it the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, always heated, has divided Puerto Ricans since US
troops seized the Caribbean island in 1898. For years, most Puerto
Ricans favored remaining a US commonwealth. Now, as many wonder if
this plebiscite will propel Congress to allow Puerto Ricans to
decide their own fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long do we have to wait?'' asked Federico Sierra, the
owner of Sierra Travel on Tremont Street in the South End. ``It's
been so many years that we've been living in limbo. The people have
the right to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3 million Puerto Ricans live in the continental United
States. In Massachusetts, the 1990 Census counted more than 151,000
Puerto Ricans, the largest Latino group in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the Puerto Rican barrio that existed in the South End
30 years ago dispersed to Jamaica Plain, Mattapan, Roslindale, and
Roxbury during urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In those neighborhoods, bodegas stock El Vocero and other Puerto
Rican newspapers. Daily stories on ``el plebiscito'' are splashed
on the front pages. On local Spanish radio and TV programs, the
plebiscite dominates the news.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Arroyo, the director of the Egleston Square Neighborhood
Association and a member of the Boston School Committee, said he
checks the El Nuevo Da Web site several times a week to read the
latest on the plebiscite. He phones his father and daughter, who
live in separate Puerto Rican towns, asking for the latest.
</P>
<P>
   He said he feels politically exiled because he, and other Puerto
Ricans living on the mainland,can't vote on an issue he has been
talking about since he was a child in Arecibo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, my father was for commonwealth, my
mother for statehood. I wanted independence,'' said Arroyo, who
still is an independentista.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plebiscite results are not binding, many believe
the vote will push Congress into action _ especially if there is
overwhelming support for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   But Arroyo wonders if Washington lawmakers will listen to the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can ask to be free. We can ask to become a state, but
Congress has the ultimate decision,'' he said. ``I wonder what we
are doing. Is this just an exercise?''
</P>
<P>
   Big turnout expected
</P>
<P>
   The plebiscite is the brainchild of Governor Pedro Rossell, a
statehood proponent who plans to lobby Congress to take action.
Last March, the House of Representatives passed, by one vote, a
bill authorizing a US-backed plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate version of the bill died, mostly because Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott opposed it. The Senate did, however, for
the first time in history, pass a resolution in favor of an
island-led vote.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the eligible voters on the island are
expected to cast ballots Sunday, _ a huge turnout by US standards.
Most either favor statehood for the island and its 3.9 million
residents or want to remain a US commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   But the ballot offers three other choices, which are expected to
dilute votes of the main camps: becoming a free associated state,
becoming an independent nation, or none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very concerned about what's going to happen,'' said
Tony Molina, publisher of El Universal, a Spanish weekly he
publishes from his Jamaica Plain home. Molina says he gets about 35
letters a week on the subject and twice as many phone calls. ``Many
people are upset that they can't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   While they are US citizens, many Puerto Ricans are rankled by
their lack of political clout. Puerto Rico has one delegate to the
US House, but that member cannot vote on the floor. And Puerto
Ricans cannot vote in US presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Congress continues to pass laws that affect Puerto
Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to remain second-class citizens,'' said Carlos
Linera, director of the regional office of the Puerto Rico Federal
Affairs Administration in Boston, who said political
representation, not economic issues, drives him to want statehood.
</P>
<P>
   He considers Puerto Rico a modern-day colony. ``When you have a
Congress that has plenary powers over you and you have no voice in
that Congress, you're a colony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Linera says economics is not fueling the debate, many
disagree. Often it is what Puerto Ricans bring up most.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say if it becomes a state the cost of living will go up,
but I don't know about that,'' said Dalia Rodriguez, a 53-year-old
Salvation Army worker who was sitting under a hair dryer at
Elegance Beauty Salon on Tremont Street. ``It's expensive to live
there and if we become a state and have to start paying taxes, it's
really going to hurt the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Puerto Ricans living on the mainland, she plans to
retire on the island. And like many in Massachusetts, she's
listening to Spanish radio programs, watching Telemundo and
Univision, and reading Puerto Rican newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Gender gap cited
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodrguez's sentiments are typical among older residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who favor commonwealth status are the (Luis) Munoz
Marin crowd,'' said Molina, the newspaper publisher, speaking of
those who came of age when Munoz Marin became the first elected
Puerto Rican governor in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statehooders are a younger crowd, a new generation. More
progressive,'' Molina said. He said everyone goes through an
independence phase during their high school or college years.
</P>
<P>
   For Giovanna Negretti, 27, it's not a phase.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show little support for independence, she hopes
to change a few minds the day of the vote. She plans to fly to the
island to let her voice be heard the only way she says she can _
through protest.
</P>
<P>
   Negretti, of Jamaica Plain, is the interium president of the
Massachusetts chapter of the National Congress for Puerto Rican
Rights, a group that advocates ``decolonization,'' although the
group isn't pro-independence.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is angry the governor pushed for the plebiscite at
a time when families are still rebuilding after the destruction
caused by Hurricane Georges and when hundreds of homes in the
mountainside still don't have electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans think they can't survive without the United
States, she said, but they are mistaken. She said the island could
survive on money from tourism, trade with Latin America, and from
charging the United States to keep its military bases there.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the main reasons she wants independence is so Puerto
Rican culture does not die.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it becomes a state, our identity will be lost,'' Negretti
said. ``It will be like Hawaii and my grandchildren will have to
look up arroz y habichuelas (rice and beans) in the dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Dec. 13, she plans to meet friends somewhere in Puerto
Rico and protest, waving a Puerto Rican flag and wearing a bandana
on her head. ``I want to look really radical to scare people,'' she
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Linera, is, like many Puerto Ricans,
hoping for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, 1998, about to turn the millennium, and the US is
still in this situation,'' he said. ``It's ridiculous that Puerto
Ricans, who have been American citizens since 1917, have to beg for
an opportunity to define our political status.''

RESEARCHER SAYS COLD WAR SHAPED WARREN COMMISSION CONCLUSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ In his 1991 movie, ``J.F.K.,'' Oliver Stone
tried to raise grave concerns about US officials' complicity in
John F. Kennedy's assassination. But the question it left with Max
Holland was not one that the conspiracy-minded director had
intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Could the American government possibly have been
that organized as to participate in a cover-up and do everything
else that Stone suggested?' '' Holland recalled in his office at
Brown University. ``I really believed it couldn't . . . so I set
out to find out for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland's skepticism led him to embark on one of the most
exhaustive examinations ever conducted into the Warren Commission's
investigation of Kennedy's death. And his conclusions in a book to
be published next year offer a comprehensive, strikingly intuitive
explanation of events that continue to generate debate 35 years
after a bullet took Kennedy's life.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Holland argues that previous examinations have
resulted in erroneous conclusions and faulty conspiracy theories
because they failed to take into account sufficiently the pervasive
political context in which the key players of the time operated:
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Holland found, for instance, that Warren Commission members
learned early in their process that there was no foreign plot to
kill the president. But they could not reveal that information
without jeopardizing sources, which were classified intercepts from
Communist governments discussing the assassination and its
perpetrator, Lee Harvey Oswald.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Holland, 47, faults Chief Justice Earl Warren, a
liberal, for his insistence that the final report not fuel already
heated anticommunist sentiment and thereby risk creating another
McCarthy era. As a result, references to Cuba and the Soviet Union
were eliminated or blurred, even though Oswald evidently
sympathized with the Kremlin and was driven, in large part, by his
anger at the American government's hostile policies toward Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Warren felt justified in his decision because the commission
found no operational links between Oswald and any communist state,
according to Holland. But, by effectively robbing Oswald of an
ideological motive, Warren left a critical question unresolved and
provided fodder for conspiracy theorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very vain man,'' Holland said of Warren. ``He did a
great deal of good, of course, but he also tended to believe he
didn't just administer justice, he embodied it. If Earl Warren says
this is what happened, you just had to accept it . . . and that was
a mistake we've been paying for ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland agrees with previous researchers that the CIA, the
Justice Department, and other agencies withheld from the commission
significant data and were otherwise uncooperative. But in his book
he maintains they did so to prevent leaks about American moles,
wiretaps, and other clandestine resources in Cuba and the Soviet
Union, not to hide any role by US agents in Kennedy's death or to
alter the course of the commission's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were given such high-level information on the Warren
Commission that it never occurred to them that there was stuff they
weren't getting,'' said Holland, a contributing editor of The
Nation magazine and the Wilson Quarterly, who is completing a
fellowship at Brown to finish his 650-page book, ``A Need to Know:
Inside the Warren Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   While he generally defends the commission and its conclusions,
Holland agrees it had major problems, both of its own making and as
a result of obstacles placed in its path.
</P>
<P>
   So he faults Robert F. Kennedy, then the attorney general, for
blocking access to information that ranges from US plans to kill
Fidel Castro to his brother's autopsy photographs, which Robert
Kennedy feared would find their way into tabloid newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Holland's thesis fits neatly into other recent examinations of
Kennedy's death. For instance, ``Live by the Sword: The Secret War
Against Castro and the Death of J.F.K.,'' a new book by
investigative journalist Gus Russo, chronicles Oswald's outrage at
US actions against Castro and suggests the American cover-up was
fueled by Robert Kennedy's fear that this secret US policy might
become public.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, 47, said that previous researchers also have not given
enough weight to the strong personalities that shaped the Warren
Commission's final report. In his most startling example, he traces
discussion of the ``second-bullet'' theory, proferred by critics
who maintain there was another gunman, to John Connally, the former
Texas governor who rode with Kennedy in his limousine through the
streets of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Connally's ego was so oversized, said Holland, that he could not
accept the notion that he was injured by a bullet that struck him
only after leaving Kennedy's skull. The author quotes commission
staff members as saying that Connally had come to the panel's
office one day with a complaint to the effect of: ``I want my own
bullet, and I'm going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of books have been written about the Warren Commission,
with thousands more about the assassination of the 35th US
president, but Holland's effort appears to break new ground in its
detail, its explanations of the interactions between prominent
panel members, and its fresh historical perspectives. Holland based
his conclusions on interviews with more than a dozen commission
staffers, as well as former president Gerald R. Ford and other
commission members.
</P>
<P>
   Most pointedly, Holland attempts to show that the Warren
Commission, long derided as ineffectual or manipulated, and more
concerned about appeasing the public than obtaining the truth, did
its job pretty well and, most importantly, reached the correct
conclusions about what happened in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become part of our popular culture that the Warren
Commission was a joke, and that's not the case,'' said Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was trying to rewrite the commission's history, he
replied: ``The problem really has been that there is no history
here.'' Too many past probes of the investigation of Kennedy's
death, he said, ``dissolve into whodunits.''

Y2K WORRY LEADS SOME TO SURVIVAL PREPARATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKESIDE, Calif. _ The hut was junk-pile crude: lawn chairs for
the frame, plastic scraps and frayed blankets for the walls, and
everything from cotton rags to shredded cardboard to palm fronds
for filling in the holes.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be survivalists _ a doctor, a school nurse and a
computer programmer among them _ built the shelter-for-one in a
matter of minutes and pronounced it both habitable and homeworthy.
They also hoped they would never have to live in one like it.
</P>
<P>
   But the half-dozen or so students at a recent Southern
California survival seminar want to be ready for the worst come
Jan. 1, 2000. That's when doomsday scenarios have computer networks
going haywire, resulting in no power, no water service, no fuel, no
ATMs, and delayed food distribution. Survivalists warn that only
optimists and idiots will approach the next century unprepared for
an unnatural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just conspiracists and crackpots who are preparing
for the possibility of the end of the world as we know it. Although
the numbers are understandably uncertain, it appears that tens of
thousands of Americans are steadily stockpiling food, squirreling
away cash and even putting down payments on remote, Y2K-proof
developments. The Internet is littered with Web sites, chat rooms
and bulletin boards devoted to surviving the coming century.
Manufacturers of hand-held water filters and freeze-dried food
report soaring sales from first-time customers. And land owners and
developers from northern New Hampshire to central Colorado to Moose
Pass, Alaska, are marketing safe havens for the savvy and scared.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that time to fix the software glitch known as the
Millennium Bug is running out, plenty of computer specialists are
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that milk won't get to market and the hungry will riot,
Steven E.C. Sroczynski is shopping for a 42-foot sailboat. He plans
to spend New Year's 2000 on it, and remain on the water until order
is restored. Srocyznski is an executive with Visionet Systems Inc.,
a Princeton, N.J., software provider which also helps companies
identify and correct their Y2K woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a believer that there will be a breakdown in society,''
said Sroczynski, noting that his two sons and former wife will be
spending the turn of the century in a well-stocked cave outside
Birmingham, Ala. ``. . .We could end up with martial law, which I
expect will happen at least regionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry Snyder, who does similar Y2K-related work with
Sophisticated Systems Inc. an hour north of Detroit, plans on
having at least $30,000 cash on hand, just in case the banks are
forced to close. His pantry will be packed, and there will be extra
gas to run a back-up generator. ``I don't know what will go
wrong,'' he said, ``but I'm not one of those guys who says there's
no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who need somewhere to escape to, Russ Vorhees is
developing Heritage Farms 2000: 500 lots priced at $10,000 for a
five-year lease. The development in Arizona's White Mountains
promises water from a spring-fed lake, continuous power and a
``21st Century'' communication system. Already his Web site has
received thousands of ``hits,'' Vorhees said, with half of the
serious inquiries coming from telecommuters and computer
specialists ``who want an insurance policy in a rural area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of life and death; that's the way we see
it,'' said Susan Conniry, who, with her husband Tom Beasley, runs
Conniry's Native Skills and Wilderness School in the hills just
northeast of San Diego. ``I don't like to be negative, because we
could still pull it out of the hat. But we could also find
ourselves in big, big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Conniry and Beasley live on eight acres, and have gardens and a
well for water. But come 2000, they won't be home. Instead, after
teaching their students how to collect and filter water, build
fires from scratch and forage for food, the longtime naturists plan
to put civilization even further behind them.
</P>
<P>
   For those who plan to do likewise, they recommended carrying
Katadyne hand-held water filters, which cost upwards of $200. But
San Diego-based Suunto USA, which distributes the Swiss-made
filters, is already sold out for 1998; even with the factory
working three shifts, new orders cannot be filled before March,
said President Henri Syvanen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this Y2K thing goes all the way,'' Beasley said, as he
sifted water through sand and charcoal, ``it could go to the Stone
Age. I don't anticipate that happening, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Few but religious extremists anticipate such an apocalypse.
Still, no one is certain exactly what will happen when the clock
strikes midnight, ending one millennium and starting the next. The
fear is that the computers will read 2000 as 1900, touching off a
series of crashes that could halt everything from the stock market
to stop lights to payroll checks. Alarmists warn that prison
security systems could crash along with the computers. Utilities
could be disrupted. Depending on the forecaster, electricity and
water is not expected to be restored for days, weeks or months _
though the utilities themselves express confidence there will be no
such disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   As David Hall, a senior consultant with Cara Corp., an Oak
Brook, Ill., company that developments Y2K risk-management programs
for corporate clients, put it: ``People really believe in Y2K
trouble or they really don't.'' For his part, Hall plans to spend
New Year 2000 in New Mexico at one of his daughter's ``just in
case,'' although he is upbeat that most companies can overcome
their software problems before then.

 LAKESIDE, Calif.: ... before them.

<P>
   Based on a study of 15,000 companies worldwide, the
Connecticut-based GartnerGroup consulting firm estimated that 23
percent have have no plans or resources in place to address their
Y2K issues. Computer failures could hit 15 percent of US companies
hard enough to keep them from performing their primary missions, at
least briefly. Among the least prepared were businesses with 2,000
or fewer employees, including local governments and the health-care
and oil and gas industries. Among the best were financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The GartnerGroup report concluded: ``a bomb shelter mentality is
not called for,'' but prepare for an outcome similar to a major
storm. That includes having at least two week's salary in cash,
along with a five-day supply of medication, food and fuel. Even
optimists suggest keeping flashlights and spare batteries on hand,
along with paper copies of financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unprecedented event in the history of the planet,''
said Richard Hunter, the firm's vice president and director of
research. ``That may sound hyperbolic, but it's a simple statement.
. .Overall it's not going to be a disaster, but it certainly may be
unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, computer programmers are working frantically to
find the problematic chips and fix the software flaws. But as the
deadline approaches, they say the challenge will go unmet by many
industries and municipalities. Compounding the urgency are
computers whose clocks will tick over in 1999 as new fiscal years
get under way, jump-starting sporadic Y2K trouble even before 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As Kyle Anderson, marketing manager for a young Chicago area
firm that develops software for the aircraft industry, sees it,
that's reason enough to make preparations. His family, his
brother's family and his grandmother _ 11 people in all _ will
start 2000 at his parents' home in a relatively rural part of
Illinois. They hope to be celebrating; they plan to be prepared.
With a well and a generator already on the property, Anderson said
he will spend several thousands of dollars gathering food and other
essential supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time to convince my family that this is
something they should pay attention to, that I'm not some kind of
Internet wacko,'' he said. ``It has that flavor of a conspiracy.
But it's not the reality. It's not about people sitting in a dark
star chamber plotting the demise of the world. There's evidence to
support some pretty scary theories.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular is that, with the electricity out, homes
unheated and people unprepared to feed their families, mass rioting
will break out. Looting will ensue. Those who have will be forced
to flee by those who do not. As a result, a high level of paranoia
exists among some survivalists, who refuse to divulge the locations
of their new communities.
</P>
<P>
   Pete, whose group included a computer programmer, a nurse and a
small-business owner before it began falling apart in recent weeks,
would say only that he continues to look for land several hours
north of Phoenix. Still hoping to put together a community of 12
families, he did not want his last name used and declined to
specify how they would defend themselves against marauders if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't get specific about any of our plans,'' said Pete, who
sells medical rehabilitation supplies. ``We're looking to be away
from the city and to make sure we're safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gallegos is offering the people who buy into his community
another sort of safety: guaranteed power and communications. High
Valley Cyber Development is being built especially for companies
that want to ensure continuity of business. A 60,000-square-foot
mall will provide office space, with 120, $120,000 homes located an
easy walk away. Construction is expected to begin early next year
in south central Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reasonable alternative to the survialist
mentality,'' said Gallegos, High Valley's chief operating officer.
``It recognizes there will be problems but doesn't run away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Y2K was barely a blip on anyone's computer
screen, Peter de Jager was considered a prophet of doom. Now the
Canadian computer expert and internet author worries that the panic
has gone too far. It is not, he stressed, ``the end of the world.''
People need not stockpile weapons and hide in the woods. Still,
even his he anticipates thousands of computer failures. Four-to-six
weeks of ``chaos'' can be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other word for it. . .,'' de Jager said. ``My
message has always been the same: The code is broken. We have a
deadline. The consequences could be nasty. Let's fix it. . . &UR;  &LR; Today
a tremendous amount of work has been done. Are we going to get it
all done? No.''
</P>
<P>
   De Jager went on to recommend having a month's worth of food,
water and fuel on hand. Anything more, he said, is overkill.
</P>
<P>
   The group Edward Thompson is heading up from Hot Springs,
Montana, feels otherwise. It is stockpiling four years worth of
food. Thompson said the group _ which so far includes his family,
his daughter's family, and at least three unrelated families _ also
plans on building an underground shelter that can hold as many as
50 people. In case they can't locate enough affordable land to the
north in time, he noted that they have identified caves where they
can live out any trouble for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe in being prepared,'' said Thompson, a disabled
mechanic who is a state leader for an internet group known as
Intentional Communities for Surival and Y2K Preparedness. ``I've
looked at all the scenarios and if you believe in the worst, you
many as well go sit in church because it's all over. But I am
expecting there will be major changes in the way we live.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, Eric Johnson, a Phoenix computer programmer,
said he doesn't know how much damage to expect. He too had
considered relocating to a rural area, then decided that running
away would be wrong. So he's been peppering his local utilities
with questions about their preparedness and assessing his family's
own needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are going to get hurt because there
are going to be severe disruptions. . .,'' Johnson said. ``What I'd
really love is to look foolish on Jan. 1. I'd love to stand up and
let everyone have a good laugh at my expense. Unfortunately, that's
not in the cards.''

COMMENTARY: `A LONG SHADOW'   (JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 Rerunning for all needing  By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hardly anyone realizes it yet. But this country may
spend the first months of 1999 _ as many as six months _ with the
president on trial before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For six days a week, under the rules, the 100 senators would be
in their seats on the floor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would
preside. Congress, the president and the Supreme Court would be
seriously disabled.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the right-wing Republicans who are effectively
running the impeachment process in the House are taking us. Most
Americans do not want to go there. Indeed, they assume that
impeachment is a dead issue. But the House may vote next week to
impeach the president. How can that be?
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde, who as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is the
formal manager of the process, is widely respected in the House.
Moreover, he has a strong feeling for our political institutions.
Yet he is driving toward an impeachment that would damage the
presidency and arouse public contempt for Congress. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Some who know Henry Hyde well say that, on partisan issues, he
does not like to stray from the Republican line. And the line on
impeachment is being set by the Republican right. With
Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston silent, the commanding voice is
that of Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, a hard-line
conservative. Other forceful figures are Bill McCollum of Florida
and Bob Barr of Georgia, who has been demanding President Clinton's
impeachment on one ground or another for years.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives have a visceral dislike for Bill Clinton.
They reason that, even if he was acquitted in the Senate,
impeachment would mark him as not even President Nixon was marked.
McCollum said the other day that impeachment would satisfy those
who ``believe the president should be branded and given the scarlet
letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The right is affirmatively opposed to what many people favor:
censure instead of impeachment. It would rather lose on impeachment
and then use the negative votes of moderate Republicans to try to
purge them in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates are under heavy pressure from the right.
When Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana let it be known that he might
consider censure rather than impeachment, the far-right magazine
Human Events denounced him as ``pro-perjury.'' His office got
thousands of calls.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates are also said to have been put off by what DeLay
called ``lawyerese'' in Clinton's reply to 81 questions from the
Judiciary Committee. Anyone facing a prosecutor who wants to put
him in prison _ as Kenneth Starr plainly does the president _ will
be advised by his lawyer to say as little as possible. Even so,
Clinton could no doubt have been more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   But what should be in the minds of the Republican moderates _
and for that matter conservative Democrats _ is history.
Specifically, the two notorious impeachments in our history: of
Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 and President Andrew
Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist published a book in 1992 on those two impeachments and
trials, ``Grand Inquest.'' Both, he said, were highly political.
President Jefferson and his supporters went for Justice Chase
because they did not like his judgments. Johnson was attacked by
the Radical Republicans of his day because he wanted to temper
harsh policies toward the South after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   If either had been convicted, Rehnquist wrote, ``a long shadow
would have been cast'' over the independence of the courts and the
presidency. But enough Jeffersonians in the Senate voted to acquit
Chase. And Johnson was acquitted by a single vote _ that of a
Republican senator from Kansas, Edmund Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was ostracized and impoverished because of his vote. But
John F. Kennedy listed him in ``Profiles in Courage,'' saying his
``heroic'' act ``may well have preserved ... constitutional
government in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusers of Bill Clinton have abandoned all the potentially
serious charges: Whitewater, campaign finance, Filegate. What
remains, however ingeniously framed, is lying about sex. To impeach
him for that would trivialize a grave constitutional process and
cast a lingering shadow on the presidency.

`BIG D' MEANS THE DOLOMITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIE A SCILIAR, Italy _ In your face _ the Big D of Italy!
</P>
<P>
   They are the Dolomites, suddenly appearing as the road nears
Bolzano. Popping up from pine forests in all their Alpine splendor.
Loaded with double dips of vanilla on some crests, a confection
much to the taste of skiers. Can't you hear Pavarotti lip-synching
John Denver on ``Rocky Mountain High''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' says another passenger, Ron Sampson. ``I'd say
it brings to mind _ or ear _ another great tenor, Rene Kollo, in
Eugene D'Albert's rarely-performed opera, `Tiefland.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is that ``Thiefland,'' I wonder. An opera about Ali Baba ... or
Congress? ``No, no. `Tiefland.' German,'' he replies patiently.
``The hero, a shepherd named Pedro, approaches his craggy habitat
after some time in the valley, crying out joyously, melodically:
`Up to the mountain tops! To life and freedom!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to hear it in the original German?'' A
Whiffenpoof emeritus, Sampson is an aria capable guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' says friend Aurelio, who is driving. ``But what
happens to Pedro?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the usual. He kills the villain, a wolf that has been
plaguing the flocks, and gets the girl, Marla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My kind of opera,'' says she, who has been pursued by a few
wolves herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd understand it around here,'' says Sampson, ``where so
much German is spoken and sheep are numerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolomites are her kind of mountains, too. ``Big D _
dazzling, domineering, dangerous, daunting, delightful, daring. Not
that high. In the 6,000- to 7,000-foot neighborhood. But
distinctively shaped, divinely sculpted. The dynamite Dolomites are
delicious to the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dishy, as I recall,'' says Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. This journey to Pedro's mountaintops had begun with
a stack of dishes in a small, nondescript Umbrian town, Deruta.
Recently, chauffeur Aurelio targeted Deruta on learning that the
protean Santa Fe (N.M.) artist Ford Ruth-ling has allowed a local
pottery baron, Ubaldo Grazia, to use his designs. She covets
Ruthling dinnerware, and knew she could get it much more reasonably
at the factory than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the stunning array of hand-painted ceramics in a showroom
of the aged, dusty Grazia-Deruta plant were some dinner plates
emblazoned with imperious, snow-hugged peaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very cool scene,'' observed Sampson. ``Presumably for hot
weather use. Say, a summer pudding. A complete chill-out without
air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's how you feel,'' said proprietor Grazia with a smile,
``we've got something for every season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An Amazonian jungle? To warm up a December luncheon in
Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, Boston? I know it. I have dealt with Shreve's and other
fine stores. Well, look around ... explore,'' suggested the
middle-aged Grazia, a leading citizen of his town, not far from
Perugia. ``I think you'll be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We _ the Grazias _ have been at this for a while. Twenty-six
generations. When my daughter, Chiara, takes over from me, the 27th
generation will move into the 21st century. Our family came from
near Milan to Deruta in the 15th century because of the excellent
clay in this valley. We were the first, but we were not alone for
long in high quality. In this town of 7,000, there are 250 ceramics
firms.''
</P>
<P>
   He assigned an assistant, Sara Chiucchiu, to lead the way, show
us the potters at their wheels, the kilns, the painters, and three
crowded floors of finished product.
</P>
<P>
   ``There,'' pointed Chiucchiu, ``is some of Mr. Ruthling's
work.''
</P>
<P>
   A skilled painter, Simonetta Ventura was studiously copying his
drawing of a swarm of bees onto a plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a honey,'' deadpanned Sampson. ``But, what are birds
without bees?''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said she would also be duplicating Ruthling's beguiling
butterflies on other plates.
</P>
<P>
   I was afraid Sampson would raise a Lieutenant Pinkerton vocal
from ``Madame Butterfly,'' but he was engrossed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Grazia said Aurelio's order of both bees and butterflies would
arrive in Boston in about six months, and wondered if she wanted
some of the snowy mountain plates, too. No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're our wonderful Alps called the Dolomites. Unique. If
you don't want to eat off them, you should at least see them,
experience them. Just up the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Andiamo. Let's go!'' Aurelio was quickly at the steering
wheel. Having gotten clay out of the way, she was in the mood for
mountains. And just up the road, all right, about 300 miles into
the northeast zone of Italy, they began to peek at us above the
Adige Valley. This territory, known as the Alto Adige or the South
Tyrol, depending on your bloodlines, was amputated from Austria as
a World War I prize for Italy, a victor in that one. Road signs
appear in German and Italian, and as much of one language as the
other strikes the ear.
</P>
<P>
   Bolzano, a relaxed, clean city, is the springboard to the
Dolomites, and the home of Giorgio Grai, renowned as a man about
wine _ an oenologist supreme. Thus, he is often praised by his
Boston friends, importers Mark and Christopher Tosi, brothers who
operate Pastene Co. Mark has said, ``Giorgio is a big hitter, the
Mark McGwire of wine-tasting and testing, a vintner himself, a
blender and consultant to vintners throughout Europe. You should
meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as easy as passing off grape juice as merlot. Known as
``L'ombra'' (the shadow), Grai is even more elusive. He runs, of
all things, a no-name ice cream parlor on Piazza Walther, where we
luckily, accidentally bump into him and his charming daughter,
Katja. She, a schoolteacher, is helping out, making sodas _
``undoubtedly with a rare bouquet,'' says Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Boston connection is established, Grai is courtly,
helpful. A man of wide international experience, well and
conservatively dressed, obviously shrewd, he sends us into the
mountains with recommendations. Those include a small, splendid
inn, the Parc Hotel Miramonti at Fie, where the peaks are beginning
to shoulder the clouds for space.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find the Dolomites different,'' says the hotel's
genial, obliging owner, Kersten Muller. ``The shapes are quite
spectacular. The roads among them are good, and the walking trails
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right on all counts. Into the jaws and maws of the mousy
gray but arrogant limestone guardians of the landscape we plunge _
and are regurgitated on roads that wind like intestines. Up and
down. Through passes and gorges. Beside turquoise streams. Over
ramparts and across frozen tarns, menacing rock fields and lovely
Alpine meadows dotted with balconied stone farmhouses whose second
and third stories are of wood.
</P>
<P>
   Jagged and spiky walls here. Assemblages of ridges and towers
that seem mysterious amber cities there. A spooky five-fingered
hand reaches for us at the next turn. Then a gigantic horned rhino
looks impassable. Buttes and ranges that evoke the Himalayas
stretch on the horizon. Clusters of pyramids blot out the sky.
Rumpled peaks and bouldered beaks demand attention. Haughty heights
and stuck-up pinnacles parade vainly. In stony gangs or solo
majesty, they are ....
</P>
<P>
   ``Dramatic,'' says Aurelio, sighing. ``Big D dramatic.''
</P>

ARENA LEAVES BIG SHOES TO FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Arena's first game in charge of D.C. United in April 1996
gave only a hint of the team's potential. United lost to San Jose
in the inaugural Major League Soccer game, but Arena immediately
made drastic personnel changes, showing that he recognized talent
and was resourceful enough to acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   What Arena proved over the next three years was just as crucial
_ he could manage a team, mix various personalities and talents. He
remained faithful to his beliefs and to his tactical schemes. These
qualities helped engender faith and respect from his players.
</P>
<P>
   Arena's work culminated in a victory by D.C. United over Vasco
da Gama of Brazil for the InterAmericana Cup title Saturday night
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. This could prove to be a historic
accomplishment as FIFA prepares to launch a World Club Championship
tournament next year.
</P>
<P>
   The InterAmericana Cup, contested between North and South
American champions, has had an uneven history since its start in
1969. It meant so little to Vasco da Gama that the club was willing
to extend its road trip to nearly a month and play the second leg
in Florida instead of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Vasco's players clearly suffered a letdown after having lost to
Real Madrid in the Intercontinental Cup in Tokyo during the week,
but United's victory adds an important dimension to future
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had won, everyone would have given little importance to
the title,'' Vasco da Gama defender Mauro Galvao said. ``Now the
competition becomes important. This is football. This is why the
people always have to come to see what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Arena takes over the US national team on a full-time basis.
He leaves United to Thomas Rongen, a succession which is baffling
to many involved with the Revolution. Rongen failed to leave a
positive stamp on the Revolution after guiding them for nearly two
years and was quickly forgotten after being succeeded by Walter
Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   Rongen failed to capture the imagination of the public in the
Boston area. Players had very mixed evaluations of him. Many
defended his methods and expressed belief in his tactics, even
after having clearly lost faith by the middle of last season.
Others became serious critics of Rongen, and he became involved in
an ugly dispute with David Nakhid, who accused him of creating a
racially insensitive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Revolution somehow been able to hire Arena after the
1996 season, it is difficult to believe the team would have
followed the path of the last two years. But the Revolution were a
rebuilding project, while United is a maintenance project. General
manager Kevin Payne and Arena, who retains his office and a strong
influence on D.C. United, believe in Rongen enough to have given
him a two-year contract worth about $200,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he wanted a coach who was ``grounded in American
soccer'' and had also considered former US national team coach Bob
Gansler.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Rongen fit the requirements, though he is Dutch. This
shows some of the problems with typecasting coaches and players and
the semantics of designating domestic and foreign players in a
country with anything but a homogeneous population. Former D.C.
assistant Bob Bradley would have been the natural successor to
Arena. Bradley proved himself by guiding Chicago to the MLS Cup,
though with only a utilitarian influence from US-born players. Also
considered was Ivo Wortmann, the Brazilian who revamped the Miami
Fusion and became an Arena assistant on the national team. But both
Bradley and Wortmann were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Rongen's favor are his espousal of tactical schemes
similar to Arena's and his ability to collect and manage the
diverse talent of Tampa Bay in winning the 1996 MLS regular-season
title.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United must believe it is getting the Rongen of that '96
regular season, when his tyrannical tendencies were balanced by
general manager Farrukh Quraishi. Rongen won only 17 of 60 games in
regulation with the Revolution, and only six of those were
accomplished without Zenga in goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo helps
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hermosillo was expected to lead the Los Angeles Galaxy to
the MLS Cup final in October. But the Galaxy fell to the Chicago
Fire, and Hermosillo returned to Mexico. Now Hermosillo has helped
Necaxa to the Mexican League final by scoring twice in a 3-2
victory over Atlas Sunday. Atlas's defeat prevented an all-Tapatio
final, since CD Guadalajara won the other semifinal against UNAM
Pumas, thanks to a Luis Garcia bicycle kick, which he sent past
Jorge Campos . . . Inter coach Gigi Simoni's job was on the line
two weeks ago, but his team defeated Real Madrid (3-1) in the
Champions League and Salernitana (2-1) in a Serie A match. That was
not enough, though, and Simoni was fired. His replacement, Romanian
Mircea Lucescu, has failed to win in his first two matches, and
during a 1-1 tie with Vicenza Sunday, Nigerian defender Taribo West
tossed his shirt at Lucescu after being replaced. West had
performed well under Simoni, who indulged West's regular absences
from preseason training because of sometimes outlandish excuses.
But West changed positions under Lucescu and now could be headed to
England. Lucescu will have to gain control over the situation
quickly _ Inter visits Sturm Graz in Austria in the Champions
League Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Respite for good reason
</P>
<P>
   Celtic has expanded its horizons in recent years, employing
Albanian, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Polish, Portuguese,
and Scandinavian players. The Glasgow club has had great success
recently with Slovakian midfielder Lubomir Moravcik. But one of the
latest additions, Croatian-Australian Marko Viduka, left the team
and will be missing indefinitely. There is a good reason for
Viduka's absence. He is apparently the victim of post-traumatic
stress relating to the civil war in Yugoslavia. ``It was only after
I arrived in Glasgow last week that I started to realize how much I
had been affected by events in Zagreb over the last few months
where I had been under enormous personal pressure,'' Viduka said.
``I just hope everyone realizes this is not easy for me and
appreciates my honesty.'' . . . Rumor of the week, according to the
News of the World: Paul McCartney could become the owner of
Everton, the Liverpool club which is about to be purchased by
theater impresario Bill Kenwright, McCartney's former schoolmate.

BOSTON BUSTLES AT CHRISTMASTIME

<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston's holiday season is in full swing, and will culminate
with the grandest and most festive First Night anywhere _ after
all, it is the first of the First Nights.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The season offers one of the grandest and most varied holiday
``strolls'' anywhere. Begin, say, in the historic Faneuil Hall
Marketplace filled with colorful shops, eateries, music, and
decorations along its cobblestone walkways, then amble down to
Downtown Crossing with its huge department stores along with
specialty shops, then head along Tremont Street to Boylston, with
its unique collection of stores, then into Copley Place, where you
can enter an indoor wonderland of lavish shopping, and continue
across an enclosed walkway into the Prudential Center for even more
variety. Now open in the Prudential Center is Marche Restaurant,
the largest restaurant in the city; it offers a fantasy island of
dining rooms where diners go to food stations, pick the ingredients
they want, then watch the Marche cooks go into action. It's just
about a two-mile dazzling showcase of holiday ideas.
</P>
<P>
   To really celebrate properly, spend a night or two in the city
at special holiday rates and enjoy enchanting festivities. At the
Four Seasons, there are Teddy Bear Teas; the Ritz-Carlton has
Nutcracker brunches; the Boston Park Plaza offers a Sugarplum
Festival and lunches; and the Fairmont Copley Plaza provides gift
wrapping in its ornate lobby (proceeds go to charities). For
information on packages and special events, call 888-SEE BOSTON or
visit www.bostonusa.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among holiday happenings is a visit to the Enchanted Village,
filled with animated figures, teddy bears, and more in a miniature
New England village of the past. The attraction used to be found in
Macy's (the former Jordan Marsh) and now graces City Hall Plaza in
a great white pavilion. Meanwhile, ``Black Nativity'' is on at
Tremont Temple; Boston is ``Nutcracker'' happy with the annual
holiday treat from the Boston Ballet on at the Wang Center, and
just across the street The Ballet Theatre of Boston is offering its
version at the Majestic Theater. Also, you can try out the ice
skating pond on Boston Common; catch the Christmas Revels at
Sander's Theater in Cambridge; take one of the nightly Holiday
Trolley Tours from Old Town Trolley; or join in the 225th Boston
Tea Party reenactment Dec. 13 at 5:30 p.m. at Old South Meeting
House and follow the ``Indians'' to the waterfront for the dumping.
More festivities: a Nutcracker luncheon at the Four Seasons on Dec.
12; a Christmas concert at Old North Church on Dec. 13 at 4 p.m.;
and the ``Messiah'' at Trinity Church in Copley Square also Dec. 13
at 7 p.m.

nuts, perhaps a small gift or two _ that was a Coolidge
Christmas,'' said William Jenney, site administrator. The Plymouth

WHAT IN THE WORLD IS NEW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing you can almost count on when you revisit Walt Disney
World is that something new and nifty will have sprung up. Here are
a few examples of what's ahead or has just arrived at the
ever-expanding Florida resort:
</P>
<P>
   --``Fantasmic.'' Dancing waters, flashing lasers, shooting
comets, swirling stars, and lots of other special effects combine
in this 25-minute production, now playing at the new Hollywood
Hills Amphitheater at Disney-MGM Studios. The production has Mickey
Mouse in a dream battle against assorted villains. We bet we know
who wins.
</P>
<P>
   --Test Track. This long-delayed ride comes to Epcot in early
1999. It will be the fastest, longest thrill attraction at Disney
World as visitors ``test-drive'' the latest in spiffy vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   --Cirque du Soleil. Anyone who has seen this blend of acrobatics
and special effects knows just how special it is. Seventy-two
artists will perform in a custom-made theater in Downtown Disney
West Side, beginning Dec. 23. Tickets ($56.50 plus tax for adults
and $45.20 plus tax for children 3-9) are already on sale.
</P>
<P>
   --Asia. The newest theme park, Animal Kingdom, expands its
attractions this spring with an area devoted to the rain forests
and wild creatures of southern Asia, and includes a white-water
rafting journey. Until then, you'll just have to content yourself
with the park's African safari ride, its 1,000 animals, 4 million
plants, 500 acres, six restaurants, Dinoland (which includes a
dinosaur-dominated thrill ride), and four stage shows, including
the ``Festival of the Lion King,'' a musical production that gives
you a taste of just how spectacular the Broadway show must be.
</P>
<P>
   --The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster. Coming to Disney-MGM Studios in
the summer, this wooden coaster will be the first Disney World ride
featuring a high-speed launch and head-over-heels twists and turns,
all to the blare of rock 'n' roll from speakers within the
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   --The All-Star Movies Resort. This will be the third of Disney
World's value-priced resorts ($74-$89), with a decor that revolves
around Disney movies. The first phase of the 1,920-room resort
opens next month.
</P>
<P>
   --More good stuff. Other attractions include two new miniature
golf courses in the spring, and three Magic Kingdom attractions:
the return of the Main Street Electrical Parade this summer; ``Buzz
Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin,'' which is already spinning; and a
ride based on the adventures of that bumbling bear, Winnie the
Pooh, opening this summer. All that you need to see everything is
time and money. But save some of each because you can be sure there
will be even more new attractions in the next millennium.

   Travel Trivia: Where in the Walt Disney World resort will you
find make-believe snow? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``Welcome, friends, distinguished guests, and those of
you wearing funny animal hats.'' _ Robin Williams, as the voice of
the robot guide in Walt Disney World's ``Timekeeper'' attraction at
the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a name: The petting zoo at Walt Disney World's new Animal
Kingdom theme park is known as the Affection Section.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Disney animals: The Animal Kingdom isn't the
first time animals have appeared in a Disney park. When
California's Disneyland opened in 1955, a circus was to be one of
the attractions. But once a herd of llamas got loose and thundered
through the park. Another time, a panther and a tiger broke through
a partition and engaged in a death battle inside their cage during
a parade on Main Street, USA. The circus plan was quietly dropped.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right: From a letter sent to the Orlando tourism people:
``Please send me four Disney World tickets _ I'll send you the
money later.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hit the road, toad: The Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World has
an attraction coming to Fantasyland next summer called ``The Many
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,'' and the park promises ``one hunny
of a ride.'' Undoubtedly it will be, but, alas, it replaces
``Mister Toad's Wild Ride.'' Sure, the special effects in ``Toad''
were primitive by today's theme-park standards, but many nostalgic
parkgoers held the attraction so dear to their hearts that an
Internet-based campaign to ``Save the Toad'' drew a response from
thousands of fans. But the ride has closed, and we are among those
who shed a tear for the toad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advice to go: A robot at Walt Disney World's
``Extra-TERROR-estial Encounter'' advises: ``Please gather all your
belongings, including smaller carbon-based life forms.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showtime: ``It's Tough to Be a Bug'' at Walt Disney World's
Animal Kingdom is a thoroughly entertaining, eight-minute 3-D
presentation, with a host of surprising special effects. What's
more, this is one attraction that's fun well before it begins. For
starters, the path to the theater winds beside the 145-foot-high
Tree of Life, which overflows with detailed images of more than 325
animals. And in the theater lobby are colorful posters for such
buggy Broadway productions as ``Beauty and the Bees,'' ``Web Side
Story,'' ``The Grass Menagerie,'' ``Barefoot in the Bark,'' ``My
Fair Ladybug,'' ``Little Shop of Hoppers,'' and ``A Cockroach
Line,'' billed as ``one singular infestation.'' Why, you'll even
hear hits from those musicals being played by an insect orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did you guess it? You'll find ``snow'' at the Blizzard Beach
water park and, during the holiday season, on a Christmasy street
at Disney-MGM Studios. Also, one of the two aforementioned
miniature golf courses will have a snow theme. Both will open in
spring as part of Disney's Winter Summerland, adjacent to Blizzard
Beach.

   NEW YORK _ The actor who is gracing GQ's December cover and

<P>
   ``I don't like carrying bags, so when I get to a place I just
buy clothes there,'' he says. ``Jeans, T-shirts, maybe a suit to go
out in.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the contradictions in the life of one of Hollywood's
fastest rising stars, an actor who says he doesn't care a wit about
fashion but has twice been nominated for VH1 Fashion Award's ``best
personal style.'' (He lost out to Will Smith in'97 and Chris Rock
in '98.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered that they consider me to have style,'' Vaughn
says. ``But it's just not where my focus is. I don't spend a lot of
time on how I look or what's cutting edge. I just pick out clothes
I like and are comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers coddling Vaughn with trunkfuls of clothes, beware.
Still the fashion industry shouldn't take it personally. He feels
the same way about cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars aren't my thing, fashion's not my thing,'' he said. ``I
couldn't tell one type of car from another, but I could tell you
which one I like. In the same way, I couldn't tell you a Calvin
Klein from an Armani suit, I could just tell you which one I like
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his devil-may-care attitude, it's little wonder that he
arrived for his interview wearing an untucked, rumpled, brown
checked buttondown shirt, black jeans and black shoes.
</P>
<P>
   He actually looked fairly bleary-eyed. Sliding into a chair at
the Cupping Room restaurant in New York City's Soho district,
Vaughn was quick to note that his fatigue had nothing to do with a
late night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been up all night reading scripts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, but a Los Angeles
resident, at least Vaughn's not pulling all-nighters in strange
hotel rooms. While in New York wrapping up publicity for the
release of ``Psycho,'' he's been staying with his girlfriend,
actress Joey Lauren Adams (``Chasing Amy''), in her new Soho
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been tired, but Vaughn was prepared for the
inevitable question _ why remake a classic Alfred Hitchcock film?
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was freaky, but the thing that interested me was
the chance to work with Gus Van Sant (``Good Will Hunting,''
``Drugstore Cowboy'') because I like his films,'' Vaughn said. ``I
didn't think it would be disrespectful to Mr. Hitchcock, or to
Anthony Perkins. Those who were involved in Hitchcock's film,
including the original scriptwriter and Hitchcock's daughter, were
all very supportive and excited about it. They gave their
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Pyscho'' is a classic, Vaughn has only seen it twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once as a kid, and when I found out I'd be playing the part,''
he said. ``My thing was not to go and mimic Anthony Perkins. I
don't think that would be respectful to him. Instead, I decided to
approach it as a play, like something powerful you see once on
stage and then take the material and interpret it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of attacks from critics about the remake, Vaughn
is armed with his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to writing, music or film, people tend to think
of them as sacred things,'' he said. ``But the material is written
to be interpreted, and whenever you're afraid to do something like
this, you're missing the opportunity to grow and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Vaughn's learning these days is how to get accustomed
to his celebrity. Hiding behind the stubble of an unshaven face,
the 6-foot-5-inch actor said it's becoming more difficult to go
unnoticed in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get recognized more now than I used to,'' he said. ``I like
to go out and have fun with friends, but when people recognize you,
it gets to be more work than play. It's nice, but draining in
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had better get used to recognition _ and fast. As soon as
fans see him in the role of film's most infamous killer, avoiding
stargazers won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   In wasn't until ``Swingers,'' the '96 surprise-hit independent
film, that Vaughn was catapulted from a relatively unknown actor to
a recognizable name in the cast of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   After playing the part of Trent, a slick but lovable Los Angeles
swinger, Vaughn went on to land roles in a series of films,
including Steven Spielberg's ``The Lost World,'' ``The Locusts,'' a
drama co-starring Ashley Judd, ``Return to Paradise,'' with Anne
Heche, ``A Cool, Dry Place'' and ``Clay Pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Although dressing up may not be his thing, Vaughn had a little
fun with clothes in the past _ the same kind of fun a kid might
have dressing up for Halloween. For his role as the serial killer
Lester in the comedy noire ``Clay Pigeons,'' Vaughn picked his
entire wardrobe. An avid fan of country-music star/actor Dwight
Yoakam, Vaughn chose outfits inspired by Yoakam's style, like
Lester's black leather pants and fringed suede shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has had enough with psychotic killers for the time being
and is moving on to his next projects, two Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, written and directed by Yoakam, Vaughn will star
with Billy Bob Thornton, Peter Fonda and Paul Reubens.
</P>
<P>
   The second, written by Vaughn's friend and ``Swingers'' writer
John Favreau (``Favz'' as he is known to Vaughn), is about a
Western gunfighter who happens to be an Hasidic Jew.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear from his frequent references to friends and family
that, celebrity status aside, Vaughn's not lost sight of the days
when he played the role of an admiring fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember one time I asked for autographs,'' he said. ``I
was a kid, and I asked two Chicago Bears players, Doug Plank and
Walter Payton. But after I got them I wondered, what the hell am I
gonna do with these?'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The actor who is gracing GQ's December cover and
reprising the role of Norman Bates in the remake of ``Psycho''
doesn't give fashion much thought. But he does have an unusual
penchant for shopping sprees.
</P>
<P>
   When Vince Vaughn, 28, travels to various film locations, he
goes baggage-free. Upon arrival, he embarks on a daylong shopping
expedition, or he sends his girlfriend, to pull together whatever
it takes to get him through his time on the road.
</P>

   ``I don't like carrying bags, so when I get to a place I just

THE FRUSTRATIONS OF AN UNDECIDED GOP HOUSE MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Call me a CUHR.
</P>
<P>
   As a Composite Undecided House Republican, I hate the box I'm
in, and I get no comfort from the fact that for once this box is
not of my own, squishy-minded making but is entirely President
Clinton's doing.
</P>
<P>
   I know what the wise guys are saying, that Acting Speaker Tom
Delay of Texas is spreading the message that the next 10 days or so
is purely for TV and that he already has a 10- to 15-vote margin in
favor of at least one perjury-based impeachment article. But I know
different, because Delay's message _ just like the
Gingrich-Livingston speakership _ forgets about the 30 to 35 of us
who like to make up our own minds. And on this one, animus and
party are not enough; this vote goes in my obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a bunch of things bother me about this mess, but
eight in particular stand out:
</P>
<P>
   --This is another government shutdown in the making, longer and
more traumatic than what Newt put us through pointlessly in 1995.
If no one can tell me there is even a chance that Clinton can
actually get thrown out of office by the Senate, then a yes vote
can come back to haunt me; people will say I helped put the country
through another wringer for no purpose whatsover.
</P>
<P>
   --Worse, I do not want to have to answer to bankers, business
guys, and investment types in my district who yell at me that I'm
putting the financial markets and the economy at risk. The prospect
of instability made them nervous last summer; they're getting itchy
again, and I can't come up with a reason to justify making the
United States look like Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   --I hate it when my so-called leaders take a hike and leave my
rear end exposed. I can't believe Bob Livingston is having Delay
front for him on the biggest issue next to war any of us faces. If
he ducks on the big ones, who cares what he does on appropriations
bills?
</P>
<P>
   --Even worse, for people asked to make tough decisions, it
doesn't help when the stand-in leaders tell you things that aren't
so, like Delay's bull-bleep about censure. We now know it has a
larger presence in American history than impeachment does, and we
know there is nothing even remotely violative of the Constitution
about it. To the contrary, it is an entirely legitimate option.
</P>
<P>
   --But that's not all. Delay is actually trying to rig the
impeachment issue's time on the House floor so that we are
forbidden to discuss censure, forbidden to consider it, and
forbidden to vote on it. My leaders know and all my colleagues know
that if the House is permitted to work its will, around 20
Republicans will vote for some form of censure and then vote
against impeachment. That being the case, some of us will have to
think hard about refusing to be put into an either-or box by our
so-called leaders.
</P>
<P>
   --But Delay and his henchmen are going even further. Their
latest maneuver, and it is proof that they know they have yet to
assemble a hard majority for impeachment, is that they are trying
to change the meaning of impeachment. He and Henry Hyde acolytes
like Bill McCollum of Florida are actually telling me that
impeachment can be censure, that it doesn't have to be followed by
a Senate trial, and that incompetent McCollum had the gall to say
impeachment could be a ``scarlet letter'' for Clinton to wear
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Well phooey on them. Elliot Richardson was right when he said a
vote to impeach means a vote to have a trial and remove him from
office, period.
</P>
<P>
   --And it might help if the case were in evidentiary shape for
such a momentous vote, but it isn't. Some of us remember what
Hyde's guy, David Schippers, promised two months ago, noting, for
example, that Monica Lewinsky's credibility could be legitimately
questioned. Schippers then promised that ``at an appropriate stage
of the proceedings that credibility will of necessity be assessed
together with the credibility of all other witnesses in the light
of all the other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   --Finally, we know that there are at least two unexploded bombs
out there before we are asked to put our reputations on the line
and cast votes. One is Hillary Rodham Clinton; the other is her
husband, who everyone knows could change this atmosphere utterly by
being a little more contrite and a little more forthcoming (say by
changing the word ``mislead'' to ``lie'').
</P>
<P>
   That's why we are undecided, and that's why we are worried.

WYMAN-GORDON FINDS ITSELF IN A STOCK TAILSPIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of those nose dives, fast and steep, that might make
oxygen masks fall from a jet cabin's ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But it was shares of Wyman-Gordon Co. that fell hard last week,
plunging by about a third within days. Problems at Boeing Co., a
big customer and leading indicator for the aircraft industry, sent
Wyman-Gordon into a stock tailspin, from 16 on Nov. 27 to 10 13/16
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer surprising when a small or midsize stock falls
out of favor and gets chopped by 30 percent or 40 percent in a day.
But that kind of punishment is usually reserved for the high
fliers, not an industrial company that makes its money forging
metal into high-precision parts.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders haven't had much to cheer about since Wyman-Gordon
was named the Globe 100's company of the year in May, based on a
strong gain in 1997 sales and profits. The stock is down about 47
percent since then, slumping with the rest of the market over the
summer, rallying in the fall, and giving the gains back last week.
The stock hit a three-year low of 10 1/2 last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts think the reaction to the latest Boeing news _
48,000 layoffs by the end of &UR;  &LR; 2000 and lower aircraft production
plans _ punished the stocks of many suppliers too severely. The
percentage decline of Wyman-Gordon shares was nearly twice that of
Boeing itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the news certainly is not positive, this is a cyclical
business and many (related) businesses were factoring in the cycle
peaking in 1999,'' said analyst David Pizzimenti of Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the world's largest aircraft maker, said it was on
schedule to produce 550 aircraft this year and expected to build
620 more next year. But production now is expected to fall to 490
in 2000. Analysts had already forecast a production decline in
2000, but the new target was slightly lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 cents of every Wyman-Gordon sales dollar comes from
the aerospace business, and Boeing is a huge customer. Wyman-Gordon
forges landing gear and other airframe components for Boeing's 727,
747, 757, 767, and 777 aircraft. Even more of its precision parts
find their way into Boeing jets, through engines made by General
Electric Co., Pratt &AMP; Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and CFM International.
</P>
<P>
   One plus hidden in the weaker aircraft production schedule:
replacement-part demand for jet engines already in service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the people are overlooking is that it's not just about
how many aircraft are being built,'' said analyst Thomas Lewis of
C.L. King &AMP; Associates. ``It's about how many are being flown. . .
. The number of aircraft that take off and land each day keeps
going up.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Boeing's bad news to filter into Wyman-Gordon's
results in the near future. The company said it was in general
agreement with analysts' earnings forecasts of about 40 cents per
share for the company's fiscal second quarter, to be reported Dec.
17. Ditto predictions for earnings covering the full fiscal year,
which are in the range of $1.60 per share.
</P>
<P>
   That means Wyman-Gordon shares are trading very cheaply, at
slightly less than seven times expected earnings for the current
year. So why are investors so skittish?
</P>
<P>
   They flinch at any sign of decline in the cyclical aerospace
business because the last one was so severe. The long and tough
slide, coupled with cuts in defense work through the first half of
the 1990s, was torture for smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wyman-Gordon shares lost about two-thirds of their value over
1990 and 1991, and remained stuck there for another three years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the news is not nearly so dark this time for
the North Grafton, Mass. company. For one thing, they believe the
coming decline will not be as severe as the one suffered at the
start of the decade. For suppliers like Wyman-Gordon, circumstances
are a lot different.
</P>
<P>
   Wyman-Gordon bought out its leading competitor in 1994, and has
made other arrangements that would ease the effects of a downturn,
like its joint venture this year combining titanium casting
businesses with Titanium Metals Corp. Analysts also point to more
strategic relationships between suppliers like Wyman-Gordon and
their biggest customers, avoiding cycles in which each took turns
gouging each other.
</P>
<P>
   Wyman-Gordon continues to talk about diversification and its
interest in making acquisitions to help broaden business. But
aerospace has become a bigger part of the company's sales in each
of the last three years, expanding to 81 percent from 73 percent.
Sales to the second-leading industry, energy, have increased nearly
25 percent in the last three years, but make up a slightly smaller
slice of the total sales pie.

CHARITY _ NBA STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER May  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to the NBA players to stage a charity game in a city
with legalized gambling, with seats costing $1,000, and with the
biggest name of all still doing his Hamlet thing and staying on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, can't you see NBA fans turning on Showtime cable, or better
yet, rushing to the Atlantic City Convention Center Dec. 19 to
watch all those real-world-challenged individuals do the benefit
thing for _ and we are not making this up _ NBA players in
financial need? Thirteen players apparently have committed;
together, they earned almost $90 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame there wasn't a laugh track accompanying Monday's
announcement of the game. If we've learned one thing from this
idiotic lockout, it's that neither side has engendered an ounce of
sympathy from the people who pay the freight. The players arrive
for negotiations in stretch limos. They wear Italian suits, caucus
between cell phone calls, wear sunglasses that cost more than most
people's wardrobes, and think a proposal to evenly split revenues
with their employers amounts to indentured servitude.
</P>
<P>
   This latest development, ``The Game on Showtime,'' is the work
of those two earnest Men of the People, agents/henchmen David Falk
and Arn Tellem. You may recall that these two individuals tried to
decertify the union a few years ago because it agreed to a deal
with the league that made their clients, and themselves,
multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The game, if it can be called that, is being billed as a matchup
of players who've represented the United States on various ``Dream
Teams'' over the last six years, although Larry Johnson and Derrick
Coleman, those two bastions of high society, apparently weren't
invited. The game may indeed click with the high rollers on the
Boardwalk and the nitwit celebrity hangers-on. They'll probably be
there to be seen by each other and the Showtime cameras.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Jordan won't play because, his handlers feel, it
might send the wrong message to his legion of fans. They really
said that, apparently with straight faces and noses that didn't
grow. But they also said he might be there, which has to be
comforting to those who plunk down $1,000 for those precious
courtside seats.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, of course, doesn't do anything that doesn't benefit
Jordan. If he feels it's worthwhile to be there, he'll be there.
The reason he was in New York last week for those unproductive
bargaining sessions was for personal business, not union
solidarity. And, lest we forget, you could paper the United Center
with reprints of his quote that he would never, ever, ever play for
a coach not named Phil Jackson. But he's still playing the
Consummate Tease.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, who earned around $20 million last season and $18
million two years ago, made the stunning admission that he is
financially secure. But others, he said, aren't so fortunate. These
``others'' work in a league where the average salary is more than
$2 million _ and rising; where the minimum salary is $272,000 _ and
rising; and where untested rookies get three years _ guaranteed _
and half of them still don't belong in a diluted league.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning earned around $11 million playing for a team
which lost in the first round of the playoffs mainly because he
couldn't control his temper. The next ``big'' game Mourning wins
will be the first, but he's one of the richest players in the game.
He was out there Monday speaking for those like him who have, well,
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a lot of expenses,'' Mourning said. ``Everybody's
hands are out, and you try to help as many people as you can. And
this game right here is a way to support the guys who are
struggling financially at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for that.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to help the so-called ``struggling'' NBA players is
for these self-absorbed, delusional individuals to accept the fact
that the league is not going to continue to operate a system where
the tail wags the dog. It's as simple as that. That won't be done
at any charity game or ensemble news conference, but in a room with
the very people who have agreed to pay them those modest wages that
are now in such dispute.

A COMMITMENT TO HIS MARLBOROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Why's everyone giving the tobacco companies such a hard time?
I, for one, am squarely behind my Marlboros. Since I fired up my
first cig back around age 12, I've never been separated from my
Marlboros for longer than 15 to 20 minutes _ except while sleeping,
of course. Philip Morris has done nothing but right by me. It makes
a fine product, a good puff, and I'll defend the company till the
day I die _ probably earlier than most.
</P>
<P>
   And I've got my work cut out for me. That settlement the tobacco
companies signed recently with 46 states is the biggest test yet of
my commitment to my Marlboros. Under the agreement, the companies
will have to cough up $206 billion over 25 years. That money isn't
going to come from nowhere. Tobacco firms have never meant me any
harm. And so I feel obligated to do my part in return for the many
years of pleasure they have given me. In other words, I gotta get
puffing.
</P>
<P>
   I don't make a lot of money. In fact, I barely get by. I work at
one of the hospitals here cleaning up the place. If you had to see
what I see, you'd smoke, too. Especially if you got a glimpse of
the lung cancer patients. All the experts say it's lower-income
people like me who will carry the load for the tobacco companies.
All our heavy puffing is financing the payout. I accept it as an
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the settlement was signed, the tobacco companies
announced they were jacking up prices. I'll pay. Whatever it takes,
sign me up. I'm working out a plan on how I can keep puffing for
Philip Morris _ no matter what the cost. I have a clunker of a car
that's worth a few hundred bucks. I'm ready to unload it when a
pack of Marlboro gets up around that level. My old man, who also
trusted in his Marlboros, left me his little house when he died,
prematurely. It's gotta be worth several thousand bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case I run out of things to sell, I got me a little gun.
I have no qualms about robbing, even murdering, for the cause.
Let's not forget, all those honest lawyers who drew up the
settlement also have to get paid. They worked hard to get the
government off the backs of the tobacco companies. Now all they
want is their fair nickel or two: altogether, they'll divide $1.25
billion right off the bat then get about $500 million a year. That
works out to about $40 million for each lawyer. I really gotta get
puffing.
</P>
<P>
   My mind's at ease knowing I couldn't devote myself to a finer
company than Philip Morris. Why, just yesterday I opened a magazine
and saw the most inspiring ad. On one page was a big photo of a
rugged-looking man displaying a box of succulent peaches. He's a
volunteer at the Houston Food Bank. On the opposite page, in big
lettering, are the words: ``I help hungry people get fresh and
wholesome food. And that just feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad explains that Kraft Foods and its parent Philip Morris
support the food bank. ``It's just a part of our commitment of
giving to people in need,'' Philip Morris says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure when the time comes Philip Morris will set up a
cigarette bank for poor, good folks like me who may not be able to
afford their Marlboros anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad this settlement came along. It finally proved something
once and for all. Now I know beyond a doubt that I am committed to
my Marlboros, or dare I say addicted?

WHICH WAY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the numbing complexity of the issue, on the table as the
White House pursues an evaluation of Social Security, are two new
proposals and one old one.
</P>
<P>
   The first new proposal is associated mainly with conservatives.
It is to abolish Social Security as we know it now _ a safety net
for the elderly involving large transfers from the well-to-do to
the poor _ and replace it with a system of mandatory individual
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The second new idea is asssociated with some liberals. It is to
beef up Social Security's funding and invest a large portion of its
burgeoning reserves in the stock market. A new semi-independent
agency would be created to oversee the government's big new stake
in Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar old proposal is to do again what a small bipartisan
panel of politicians and bankers led by Alan Greenspan did in 1982:
keep the present system and adopt some combination of modest
benefit cuts and slightly higher taxes to preserve its balance over
time.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of clarity emerges from a new study by a panel of
experts that quietly appeared last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evaluating Issues in Privatizing Social Security'' was issued
by the National Academy of Social Insurance. A panel of 20 experts,
led by Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and Michael Boskin of Stanford University, worked for 30 months to
achieve a relatively high degree of consensus about the underlying
economics of various plans while permitting participants to differ
about political value judgments. A three-quarters majority was
required for the panel to make any particular recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the report was marred by the late-stage resignations of
four members, including co-chairman Boskin, who had served as chief
economist to President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the NASI report still stands well above any others as a
dispassionate analysis of the basic issues. Even when it stacks its
own deck, as it does in one critical respect, the report
illuminates more than it obscures. (The full text can be found on
the Internet at www.nasi.org/evaliss/front.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   The report identified three broad questions at the heart of the
matter:
</P>
<P>
   1. Should there be more advanced funding of Social Security? The
panel recommended yes _ to strengthen national savings and foster
growth. That would mean some combination of benefit cuts and tax
increases, sooner rather than later, to minimize the adjustments
necessary to achieve the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   2. Should Social Security funds be invested in the stock market,
either by the government or individuals? The panel found that the
financial risks of investing in stocks would be worth the rewards,
but differed sharply on how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the panel estimated that a low-cost, low-service
plan for individual accounts overseen by either by Wall Street
firms or a government agency would cost $25 to $50 per participant,
as opposed to the $16 per-person cost under the Social Security
Administration. On the other, the panel suggested that if the
government itself took the plunge, a semiindependent agency modeled
on the existing 401(k) plan for government employees could limit
political interference in investment decisions and corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   3. Should the system remain a single collective plan that
guarantees everybody a certain level of support (a defined benefit
plan)? Or should it create individual accounts and require only
defined contributions, expecting that some would do better than
others in managing their funds? The panel divided sharply on the
question.
</P>
<P>
   The single most controversial aspect of the report _ the respect
in which it stacks the deck from which it deals, by giving short
shrift to the alternative _ is the unqualified recommendation that
the government foster investment in stocks instead of bonds. Never
mind that a good deal of work exists now to show that the lavish
rates of return to stocks promised by various advocates of
privatization are illusory.
</P>
<P>
   With the global stock markets fluttering near record highs,
after an almost uninterrupted 16-year bull market, the experts
propose to bet the integrity of the national pension system _ of
the political stewardship of the economy itself _ on the likelihood
that the world has seen its last sustained bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound prudent to you?

WITH JOHNSON GONE, MOORE IS MR. RELEVANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Marty Moore, a k a Mr. Irrelevant, is
becoming The Man On The Way Up.
</P>
<P>
   He is the hot topic of conversation, as much as Scott Zolak was
when it was speculated he might start in place of Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   After Ted Johnson had his arm ripped up by Jerome Bettis on the
second play of the Patriots' 23-9 win over the Steelers Sunday, the
middle linebacker ran off the field, spotted Moore on the sideline
chatting with special teams coach Dante Scarnecchia, and shouted,
``Marty!''
</P>
<P>
   In a burst, Moore was out on the field just as the Steelers were
breaking the huddle. He called the play and was ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   He flowed into that play, called the defensive signals for the
remainder of the drive, then trotted off the field to find he was
in there for good because Johnson had torn his right biceps tendon
and is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Ted was just nicked up or something and he'd be
right back in there,'' said Moore, ``but then I was told he was
out. So I took a deep breath . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   As did most of Patriots Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Moore now in the regular defense, but he was doing
that in addition to his special-teams assignments.
</P>
<P>
   He needed the breath because he knew he wouldn't have many more
to take. Playing all out on special teams is one of the most
exhausting jobs on the football field. Add middle linebacker
responsibilities to that and what you have is one tired hombre.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday against the St. Louis Rams, Moore will get some
help. Todd Collins is expected to shift to the middle and play a
lot there. Tedy Bruschi will also get in, but Moore will get his
share of time, and that should not be alarming to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, now in his fifth year, has defied the odds since he was
the 222d _ and last _ player taken in the 1994 NFL draft after his
career at the University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Most players taken last don't stay in the league for five years,
but Moore carved out a niche for himself as a special-teams cover
player the Patriots couldn't live without.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has seen me play linebacker,'' said Moore when asked
about the fans' uneasiness over this development. ``I do it in
preseason, but that doesn't really count. I know people are
wondering, `Can Marty Moore play in the regular season?' That's
where self-motivation comes in, and showing everyone I can play
every-down linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-motivation is what Moore's career is about. Down-to-earth
and humble, he is the kid who always sits up front in class and
listens to every word the teacher says. He does that to prepare for
times like this. He's done that ever since the Mr. Irrelevant
designation _ which goes to the last draft pick each year _ became
a point of interest around the country. There is even an annual
event to salute the pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember people telling me after that event in California
that guys who are picked last never make it in the NFL,'' said
Moore. ``That started to give me the motivation to prove people
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mr. Irrelevant thing doesn't bother me because I think
it's a good accomplishment on my part. When you look arund the
league, there aren't too many guys around drafted last. For me to
say I've been here for five years and done things that last picks
have never done . . . for me, that's an accomplishment I'm proud
of.''
</P>
<P>
   It hurts to see his friend Johnson out for the season, but he
said, ``It's something I've been preparing myself for. I haven't
had the opportunity to play the last three years because Ted has
stayed healthy and played so well, but this is my job. I have to do
the job when I'm called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who missed three weeks with a groin pull, will have to
play the inside position. Back when Bill Parcells used the 3-4
defense, Collins was an inside linebacker, but when the alignment
was changed to a 4-3, he became an outside man to take advantage of
his speed, which always has been his major attribute.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll said Collins may be starting, though all three
linebackers will be used in a rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a lot of adversity on this team, but guys
keep stepping up and doing the job,'' said Collins. ``I don't think
we've had our team together all year. The years I've played with
Ted, you know how good he is. But you want to use positive energy
and say, `Boy, if we can overcome this one, it makes your team
stronger.' You can't use injuries as an excuse. You rely on
everyone on your roster. They have to be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins isn't awed by the assignment. He knows he won't be in
the middle the entire game. He knows he'll be more involved in
nickel situations than he has been all season, but he says it's
just a matter of ``doing a little more studying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising something like that would happen to Ted,''
said Collins. ``It's been that kind of a year when everyone is
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the chief signal-caller on defense, but Collins has
performed that duty over the years as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted and I both make the calls from the sidelines,'' he said.
``It's not going to be different other than moving over a couple of
feet. We'll be fine. I'll be giving Marty a breather every now and
then. Tedy will be in there. I just hope I can give Tedy more of a
breather. When I was out, he was out there for 75 plays a game. We
just have to bond together. This could be a trap game for us if we
let it. But I think everyone knows what's at stake, and we all want
to rise to the occasion. We don't want to make any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be irrelevant.

CARROLL SUDDENLY OFF THE HOT SEAT _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Winners and losers. Men on the way up and
men on the way down. One day you're on the Butch Hobson Highway to
Oblivion, then suddenly, you own a home in Pigskin Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   It is the way of professional sports, and Patriots coach Pete
Carroll has lived on both sides of the line in the last three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kraft won't admit it, but Carroll no doubt was on the firing
line after the Patriots fell to 5-5 with the loss at Buffalo last
month. The owner expects this team to go deep into the playoffs,
and there was no postseason on the horizon after the Rich Stadium
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots have been born again in the last three weeks,
and no one has made a bigger comeback than Carroll. This might be
local sports' greatest rescue since the 1988 Red Sox ripped off 19
of 20 to solidify the standing of ``interim'' manager Joe Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Drew Bledsoe saved his coach's job with the
back-to-back miracle finishes against the Dolphins and Bills. Kraft
wouldn't have pulled the plug during the season, but there can be
little doubt that Pompon Pete was gone if this team finished .500
and out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks like Carroll has qualified for a third year of that
five-year contract. Barring an 0-3 finish, the Patriots are a lock
for the playoffs, and that should be enough to prevent Kraft
(believed to be the man who invented the T formation) from
admitting a mistake and finding another coach.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was relaxed at his day-after press gathering Monday.
There were no hard questions about his future or the Tuna. No
attack-dog journalists pinned him up against the wall. Even the
weather cooperated. The record-setting 79-degree December day no
doubt was delivered by the Grid God to make California Pete feel at
home.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about Marty Moore, Chad Eaton, and Terry Glenn. He
talked about Ted Johnson's biceps and Bledsoe's finger. He was calm
and composed. He was the embodiment of Coach Light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for it,'' he said. ``I like the intensity this
team shows. I like the confidence we're showing now. I feel
strongly about our chances to build momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this team understanding the way I approach them? I think
they are. They're responsible enough to hang in there when things
are tough. That's not to give away the power of being the leader,
but I think it empowers them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the Carroll way. He will not smack his players upside the
head. He thinks of himself as one of the guys and hopes his players
are mature enough to ``get it done'' without being bullied. When
the Patriots play well and win, his system is applauded and all is
well in Foxborough. When the Patriots get skunked by the Jets,
Dolphins, and Falcons, Pete is too soft.
</P>
<P>
   There is still much about which to be concerned. The Patriots
have no running game. And they are still making too many September
mistakes _ illegal motion, delay of game, cheesy holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had five penalties in seven or eight plays,'' said the
coach. ``We were going in the tank for a while. It was an
opportunity for us to fall apart. We had some noise problems. The
offensive linemen have to hold their position. We can't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   If sloppy mistakes foil this team, the coach will be held
accountable. And let us not even contemplate the horror if the
Patriots go to New Jersey two days after Christmas needing a win
against the (gulp) Jets to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying this for a while,'' Carroll said. ``We're
gonna get better. We can be stronger than we were at the finish of
last season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have the talent. They are supposed to win most of
their games. They are supposed to beat the Bills, Dolphins, and
Jets on the strength of their roster. When they lose to these
teams, we look at the coach. When they win, we cite their superior
talent. This puts Carroll in a no-win position.
</P>
<P>
   But he has won the last three. And the fire has been
extinguished. He's secure. For at least another week.

AXELSSON EARNS CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ P.J. Axelsson can't wait to get to the rink these days.
That's how well the Bruins are doing, as reflected in their 7-1-4
record the last 12 games. Everything is fun again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing pretty good right now,'' said the Bruins'
third-line left wing, who has Rob DiMaio and Tim Taylor skating
with him for the second consecutive season. ``We're playing
together and we're staying with the game plan. We're making the
right decisions. Now we always want to play games, of course. It's
the same as last year, where we always want to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps, of course, that Byron (Dafoe) is doing so well back
in goal for us. He's been awesome, just as he was last season, too.
He wins plenty of games back there for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson's game is about checking. That's his specialty despite
his build _ 174 pounds on a 6-foot-1-inch frame, about 4 or 5
pounds more than he weighed last season. He plays against the other
team's top scoring and makes them work for their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the offseason, when I go back home to Gothenborg,
Sweden, I lift weights about four times a week, as well as doing a
lot of running and biking,'' said Axelsson. ``Frankly, I need all
the weight I can put on my body, especially when I get in the
corner. I like that part of the game, the hitting. I'm not a big
guy, but I do like to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to do the same stuff as last season, and
that's best done by keeping everything simple. That's the fun part
of the game for me, checking. That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a price to pay for that role. Axelsson suffered two
concussions in a week earlier this season. The first was against
Montreal when Dave Manson elbowed him in the head. A week later,
Buffalo's Matthew Barnaby was the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson, who played his 100th NHL game against Montreal Nov.
27, missed a total of four games because of the concussions, ending
his streak of 97 consecutive regular-season and playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   His parents first put skates on P.J. when he was 3 years old.
``I live about 200 yards from the rink,'' said Axelsson, who lifts
weights twice a week during the season to maintain his
conditioning. ``I also played soccer, but hockey was always my
favorite sport. The fact that it's such a fast game is what turned
me on about it most.''
</P>
<P>
   There might even be a Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL's best
defensive forward in Axelsson's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to go
out and play.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Earl Phalen graduated from Harvard Law School in 1993, his
classmates went on to jobs that typically paid $67,000 a year. Not
Phalen. He started a nonprofit organization to boost the academic
skills of inner-city black children, and his parents helped pay his
bills.
</P>
<P>
   People assumed Aaron Lieberman would become a lawyer, like his
dad, when he graduated from Yale in 1994. Instead, Lieberman went
into preschool education like his mom and founded a nonprofit group
that links college-student tutors with Head Start youngsters to
help the children get ready for kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Katya Fels was a blue-haired, multi-earringed, into-Gothic-punk
teenager who grew up to graduate from Harvard in 1993 with a degree
in biology, and instead of going to medical school she founded a
daytime shelter for homeless women.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever decided that Generation X is apathetic and cynical never
met 31-year-old Phalen, whose Bell Foundation President Clinton
recognized last year with a President's Service Award. They never
met 27-year-old Lieberman, who started planning Jumpstart in his
dorm room with a friend and now heads the $4.2 million-a-year
organization with sites in six cities. They never met 27-year-old
Fels, whose On the Rise in Cambridge serves women ill-served by
more traditional programs.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lieberman sees it, ``Generation X should stand for
Generation Extra.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not idealistic baby boomers out to change the world at
a time when the government declared a war on poverty and young
people mobilized to stop a war in Southeast Asia and the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 was still new. They don't remember Martin Luther
King Jr. and John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   No. They're idealistic Gen Xers who came of age when many
perceive government as the problem, not the solution, and national
heroes are people who play ball or died decades ago, and the world
the boomers vowed to change is no paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idealism of the baby boomers set the stage for us to say
what you're saying isn't really happening,'' says Lieberman. ``It'd
be worse if nobody ever said this country should be about equality
of opportunity. That's what we owe the baby boomers. They put the
idea out there. We're trying to make it real.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his peers call themselves social entrepreneurs.
They marry their youthful passion with the practical experience of
their years of student volunteerism and the private sector panache
of an era when a whole new industry is springing from the ideas of
young cyber-savvy entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   They count among them early graduates of the service learning
movement of the past decade, and that pipeline is only growing. The
Corporation for National Service now funds service learning
programs for a million young people annually from elementary school
through college. The four-year-old AmeriCorps has enrolled 100,000
members, and it claims roots in the youthful enterprise of two
26-year-olds who founded Boston-based City Year in 1987 as they
graduated from Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's Jumpstart began as a college tutoring program.
Likewise, Phalen's Bell Foundation was originally a tutoring
program at Harvard Law School, and both now rely on cadres of
college tutors to help low-income children. Fels learned about
running programs for the homeless when she managed a shelter headed
by Harvard's service-oriented Phillips Brooks House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come out of college discontent with just serving,'' says
Christine Kwak of the Michigan-based WK Kellogg Foundation, which
over the past half dozen years has funded a growing number of young
social entrepreneurs. ``Many were seized with the notion that they
would create something new and different that might tackle the
problem in a way that works. They combine an entrepreneurial spirit
with the impatience of being younger and saying, `we want to make a
bigger difference now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Youthful idealism is said to make something sound trite,''
says Fels. ``Society loses a lot by not tapping into what 20- and
30-year-olds have to say and tapping into our energy. Often our
ideas may be heretical and challenge what's out there. People who
haven't been in the system for a long time come in with different
eyes. If you come in without preconceived notions, you may be able
to come up with something that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jumpstart, whose downtown office displays lists of
quarterly goals like ``complete assessment road trips'' and
``launch process for family involvement.'' Lieberman sounds like a
businessman when he says, ``Everything is driven by the school
success outcomes,'' and ``We're right on track'' to meet the goal
of 1,000 corps members helping 12,000 children by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The small and growing number of funders who give seed money to
young social entrepreneurs also use the language of the private
sector to liken themselves to venture capitalists. Of 300 social
entrepreneurs given fellowships by the New York-based echoing green
Foundation in its nine years, 23 are in Massachusetts, more than
any state but California and New York. Three of 18 funded by the
three-year-old Fund for Social Entrepreneurs at Youth Service
America are from the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our peers in the '60s were coming out of school and saying `I
want to work for the government' and `I want to work for the Peace
Corps,' '' says 33-year-old Vanessa Kirsch, who calls her
Boston-based New Profit, Inc., a venture capital fund for social
entrepreneurs in the Northeast. ``This generation of leaders are
focused not so much on being part of a movement but on building
institutions that will last for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Phalen sees the Bell Foundation. He entered law
school aiming some day to be mayor of a city, but now he sees
building his organization as the way he'll have the most impact.
``It's hard to build a business from scratch. Last year I said,
`given all the things I'm blessed with, am I doing enough to impact
our community?' '' he says. ``After a lot of quiet time I said yes.
The Bell Foundation is the vehicle to provide strong leadership in
the black community. But if I'm 35 years old and the Bell
Foundation is serving 500 children, then I will feel like I've
failed because it's just not enough kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime activist Hubie Jones, who ran the Roxbury Multi-Service
Center in the 1960s and now is special assistant to the chancellor
for urban affairs at University of Massachusetts in Boston, calls
these social entrepreneurs ``spectacular'' people with ``this
extraordinary set of skills.'' But at a dinner he hosted for 30 of
them, he challenged them to reach outside their organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically said to them, `you've done terrific work but
you're really disconnected from the challenges going on in this
city beyond your organization,' '' Jones says. `` `I didn't have
that luxury at your age. I was doing what I was doing in the middle
of a civil rights revolution. If I was disconnected my organization
would be irrelevant. There are major things going on in the
community, whether it's the South Boston seaport, whether it's the
schools, whether it's gentrification, and you folks are
disconnected from the conversation. You have no collective voice
around the challenges facing the city and you need to get one
because you are the leaders of the future.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Sazama was one of Jones's dinner guests. She cofounded
the Somerville-based Youth on Board, which since 1994 has trained
over 5,000 teens and adults in over 30 cities to enable youths to
participate in organizations affecting their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely agree with him,'' says Sazama, 33. ``But I don't
want to blame us. Our generation hasn't had the civil rights
movement, the women's movement, the Vietnam War. There's not been
anything for us to rally around. There's a piece of hopelessness
our generation carries about real change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation is set up to be individualistic. In Hubie
Jones's generation there was more encouragement to do community
organizing,'' she adds. ``Our generation hasn't figured out how to
start that. But I think we're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Bell Foundation tutors working with more than 60
after-school ``scholars'' at the Lee School in Dorchester, or
Jumpstart corps members mixing paint on waxed paper with
preschoolers at South End Head Start, or On the Rise offering a
quiet space where a homeless woman can read the Koran, these are
ventures created with the energy and attitude of youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would be doing this at age 40,'' says Fels, of
On the Rise. ``I'd be far more jaded and cynical and I'm pretty
cynical now. We're all people who had ideas and said I'm not going
to change how I do it because you have $5,000 or you're older and
you say so. We'll change if there's a reason, but not just because
someone older says so.''

RED SOX GIVING UP ON NAEHRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was a member of the Red Sox organization longer than
Mo Vaughn and signed his first Sox contract 17 days before John
Valentin signed his.
</P>
<P>
   He has worn a Red Sox uniform longer than any player on the
current roster, electing to stay here two winters ago for less
money when he could have gone to the World Series with the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fan favorite, on and off the field, and when healthy, a
productive player, though most of his working parts broke down at
one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, on a procedural technicality, Tim Naehring's
decade-long career with the Red Sox essentially came to an end.
Because he was a free agent, the Sox either had to sign him to a
new deal or offer him salary arbitration by midnight Monday night;
otherwise, they would lose the right to re-sign him until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox did not take either step, and Monday night Naehring's
agent, Greg Clifton, said the infielder, who has not played since
undergoing reconstructive surgery on his throwing elbow 17 months
ago, will not wait until May for the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have never heard from the Red Sox _ we have
had no dialogue on a contract for Tim Naehring,'' said Clifton,
though he acknowledged the Sox might have bypassed the agent to
contact the player. ``As of midnight, Tim will no longer be a
member of the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox did not offer arbitration to any of their six free
agents, including 44-year-old reliever Dennis Eckersley, who last
month had said he was leaning toward a return for another season,
but only with Boston. The Sox also passed on pitchers Steve Avery,
Butch Henry, and Pete Schourek and second baseman Mark Lemke.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that the Sox did not offer arbitration to
Avery, who was paid $3.9 million last season, or Lemke, whose
career was placed in jeopardy after he sustained another in a
series of concussions last May in a collision with White Sox
catcher Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who missed almost all of last season after tearing the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, apparently had better
offers elsewhere. The Red Sox were attempting to re-sign Schourek
Monday night, but according to spokesman Kevin Shea, the team was
not hopeful of reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox lost short-time reliever Dario Veras, who was claimed on
waivers by the Kansas City Royals. Veras, 25, made seven
appearances for Boston after being acquired from the San Diego
Padres in the Jim Leyritz trade.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Naehring, who turns 32 Feb. 1, received a one-year,
nonguaranteed major league contract offer from the Cincinnati Reds,
his hometown team. According to Clifton, the deal had a low base
salary but was loaded with incentives. And in the event Naehring is
unable to resume playing because of his injury, Clifton said, the
Reds have offered him a position in their front office if he elects
to retire. The Cardinals also have expressed strong interest,
Clifton said.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain whether Naehring, who is working out and throwing
under a program set up by Alabama orthopedist Dr. James Andrews,
will be able to play again. He's a long shot at best to return
regularly to third base, which is where he was playing when he tore
ligaments in his right elbow while making a throw from foul
territory in Toronto. His best chance to return may be as a utility
infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Naehring broke in at shortstop in 1991, the first Sox rookie to
open the season at short since Rico Petrocelli in 1965. He later
moved to second and became the team's regular third baseman in 1997
when Nomar Garciaparra took over at short and Valentin moved to
second. He made just three errors in 87 games at third before his
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Naehring's best year with the Sox was 1995, when he played a
career-best 126 games, hitting .307 with 10 homers and 57 RBIs. He
also hit an 11th-inning home run that should have won the first
divisional playoff game against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But he was always dogged by injuries. He was on the disabled
list seven times in his eight major league seasons with back,
wrist, shoulder, ankle, and hamstring injuries in addition to his
elbow problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tim Belcher, a free agent pitcher who has drawn
interest from the Red Sox, was not offered salary arbitration by
the Royals, meaning the Sox would not have to surrender any draft
choices as compensation if they elect to sign him. Belcher is
believed to be seeking a three-year deal in the neighborhood of $16
million and has also received inquiries from the Seattle Mariners.
The 37-year-old righthander was 14-14 last season for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Another name has surfaced as a potential replacement for Vaughn
at first base. Seth Levinson, agent for free agent Gregg Jefferies,
has called the Sox, telling them of his client's desire to play for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gregg Jefferies has serious interest in playing for the Red
Sox,'' said Levinson of the switch-hitting Jefferies, who batted
.301 in 144 games last season for the Phillies and Angels.
Jefferies played left field almost exclusively last season but
played first base for parts of four seasons with the Cardinals and
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies, 31, is a two-time former National League All-Star who
has hit .285 or better in six of the last seven seasons, four times
over .300 (the exception being 1997, when he batted .256). He is
not a power hitter _ he had just nine home runs in 555 at-bats last
season _ but could be a potent No. 2 hitter behind Jose Offerman if
the Sox wanted to drop Valentin lower in the order.
</P>
<P>
   At best, Jefferies, like Will Clark, would represent a
short-term answer for the Sox, who are expected to pursue trade
possibilities at baseball's winter meetings, which begin Friday in
Nashville.

ONE RULING ON OFFICIATING: OUT OF BOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enough with the officials already.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything else in American sport today, the mounting
complaints about NFL officiating have gone from fair criticism to
absurd blather. They have gone from making good points to beating a
dead horse. It all has gotten absurd, as about everything in sports
seems to become after a week or two of the media overdosing on the
topic of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving Day Lions-Steelers coin flip mistake that
started it all was roundly and rightly mocked, and the erroneous
calls at the end of the Patriots' victory over the Buffalo Bills
Nov. 29 were duly noted and dissected.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have the touchdown mistakenly given to the Jets' Vinny
Testaverde Sunday that lifted New York to a 32-31 victory over the
Seattle Seahawks. The level of noise surrounding this issue has
become as grating to the ear as a Metallica concert in barely 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Two readers wrote to the Globe about this issue last week and
made good points. One quite rightly claimed that making NFL
officials full-time would not solve the problem of inconsistency or
pure folly on the part of the men in charge of NFL law enforcement,
as major league baseball's umpires and the NBA's referees regularly
have proven.
</P>
<P>
   The other letter raised an even more salient point.
</P>
<P>
   ``President William Jefferson Clinton lied under oath before a
grand jury and everyone thought it was OK and no big deal,'' the
reader wrote. ``An NFL official makes a couple of mistakes during a
football game and everyone is terribly upset. Am I missing
something?''
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we all?
</P>
<P>
   It is fine and well to criticize NFL officials when they're
wrong, which we welcome the opportunity to do every time it
happens. But Sunday in Pittsburgh, for example, a ball was ruled
trapped that made nearly every ``expert observer'' in the press box
groan. All had clearly seen a catch made and said so.
</P>
<P>
   Then the replay came up, and it was just as obvious that the
receiver had indeed lost control of the ball, pinning it against
the ground, which happens to be illegal. No one made note of that
in the next morning's papers because the call was right, not wrong.
</P>
<P>
   What had happened there was the same thing that happened at
Giants Stadium Sunday when Testaverde was awarded a touchdown he
was a half-yard short of reaching. The official who made the call
never saw the ball. He saw only Testaverde's helmet break the plane
of the goal line and assumed it was a score.
</P>
<P>
   He had a bad angle, just as the men and women in the press box
in Pittsburgh had a bad one on that trapped ball. So get over it.
</P>
<P>
   Although instant replay is an important tool capable of
reversing some officiating errors the NFL unwisely is choosing to
ignore, it will not solve all the problems and correct all the
mistakes. Nor should it.
</P>
<P>
   Sports were meant to be played by human beings and officiated by
them. That, by its very nature, implies mistakes will happen. Some
of them, like Bill Buckner's error or Johnny Pesky's alleged
double-clutch throw, become part of the lore of the games we love.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally _ as with the phantom roughing-the-passer call on
Ray Hamilton years ago in a Patriot playoff loss to the Raiders _
an official's call becomes part of the lore, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is as it should be, unless we want the games to be played
by robots and the outcomes to be written in stone before they're
played. Mistakes are part of sport, so they are part of officiating
as well. When the call is bad enough, we have every right to talk
about it and argue over its importance. That's part of the fun of
being a fan.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic of NFL officiating costing teams games and
championships has grown absurd. On Sunday, the Seahawks gave up 32
points to the Jets and blew a 15-point lead. Had they stopped the
Jets from scoring on any one of their other drives, Testaverde
could have run that quarterback sneak to Connecticut and it
wouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   So the officials didn't lose that game. The Seahawks did.
</P>
<P>
   Same with the Bills. Was the interference call that gave New
England the ball at the 1 pivotal? Absolutely. Did it mean a Bills
linebacker then had to bite on a terrible play-action fake by Drew
Bledsoe and leave Ben Coates wide open in the rear of the end zone
for the winning score with no time on the clock?
</P>
<P>
   I think not.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be happening is that mistakes and inconsistencies
by NFL officials have become the life raft for players who haven't
played well enough to win. That is not to say such errors should be
tolerated or that all the technology possible for correcting them
shouldn't be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that I'm tired of hearing that a football game of 130
or 140 plays turns on one errant flag or missed call at the wrong
moment. The fact is, games are won and lost by players more than by
any other factor. More than coaches who one week are called
geniuses and the next week called idiots, and far more than
officials, even the ones who stink.

23,000 people just across the Alabama border, she has learned much

GIVING KIDS GIFT OF LASTING VALUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the season of temptations _ too much food, too much
drink, and if you're a child, everything you've ever wanted for
Christmas is in your face.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it may seem, financial education experts say this is an
opportunity to teach your kids about sound money management by
demonstrating discipline in this time of excess.
</P>
<P>
   They are not suggesting a miserly Christmas, just a time when
you teach your children to spend within their means by establishing
a holiday budget to help them decide what they afford for
themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can show them about planning and making a list,'' said
Paul Richard, director of education at the National Center for
Financial Education in San Diego, a nonprofit education
organization that teaches consumers personal finance skills. ``If
they run out of money, have them create `service cards' and have
them earn the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial illiteracy is a big problem today. Look at the record
numbers of personal bankruptcies by people who think that credit
cards, like Santa Claus, have endless financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   This dangerous lack of knowledge explains why a group of
education and financial leaders throughout Texas are trying to
start a statewide group of the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal
Financial Literacy. The nonprofit group, based in Washington, D.C.,
is trying to raise personal finance knowledge among students so
that they will be financially competent when they graduate from
high school.

REALITIES VS. ADS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a time when television is bombarding them with holiday
advertisements, some cost comparisons help kids realize that they
can't have everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a family, you may set joint priorities _ for instance,
buying a real tree or taking in a performance of `The
Nutcracker,''' said Sharon McLean, executive director of operations
at Consumer Credit Counseling Service of the Gulf Coast Area in
Houston, which helps consumers with credit problems. ``Demonstrate
how you have to cut the budget in other places to allow for these
special events.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for ways to let your children know how much it costs to
celebrate Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point out all of the expenses associated with the season, from
decorations to entertaining to presents,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, take your children shopping with you and use
the trip as a lesson on comparing prices and quality. If they spot
something that's more expensive than you can afford, remind them of
the spending limit you had set, and how important it is to stick to
it.
</P>
<P>
   When they hit financial limits, rather than giving them the
money, show them how to economize.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest that your children make gifts instead of buying them.
This will help you teach them the true spirit of Christmas, which
isn't about seeing how many presents you can get or give, but about
enjoying family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas time is a time to remember people for the nice
things they did for you, not a time to be showered with gifts,''
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   When you do give gifts, don't go overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start family traditions and focus on really enjoying the
holidays together, rather than spending your time at the mall
trying to hunt down an impossible-to-find toy,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   With so much temptation for greed and excess during the
holidays, this would be a good time to teach your children what the
spirit of giving is really all about by giving back to the
community through volunteer service or by donating goods or money
to a charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to do so is to appeal to children's passions,''
McLean said. ``If your child is fond of animals, consider donating
to an animal shelter or zoo. Choosing charities your children can
connect to emotionally will help sow the seeds for a lifetime of
giving.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PARENTS MUST SET EXAMPLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to be in the forefront of their children's
financial education because home is where young people say they
learn the most about managing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mom and Dad aren't savers, don't expect the kids to save,''
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   If your children get money as holiday gifts, have them use some
of the money to set up a savings or investment account, rather than
spending it all at once. That way, their money will last longer for
them and even grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal finance has evolved into a very complex life skill
that if we are not educating our children in, by the time they
graduate from high school, they are going to make mistakes,'' said
Dara Duguay, Jump$tart executive director.

MASSIVE BLACKOUT HITS SAN FRANCISCO AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A massive power failure brought San Francisco to
a standstill at the height of the morning rush hour Tuesday,
freezing traffic, stranding commuters in dark tunnels, and
otherwise creating havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout, which also affected other parts of the San
Francisco Bay area when a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric power plant in San
Mateo shut down, began at 8:17 a.m. and still had much of the
region blacked out hours later.
</P>
<P>
   A PG&AMP;E spokesman said more than 372,000 customers were without
service during the height of the outage.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Corey Warren said power was being restored
station by station, with manual switching required to restore
electricity city block by city block.
</P>
<P>
   According to PG&AMP;E spokeswoman Mary Rodrigues, the center of the
problem was a PG&AMP;E substation in San Mateo. The substation takes
high-voltage power from transmission lines and lowers it to a
voltage that can be used by consumers. She said an unexplained
problem still under investigation caused the substation to shut
down. At that point, automatic switches were triggered to isolate
the area supplied with electricity by the substation.
</P>
<P>
   Without the switches, all of Northern California could have lost
power. Power authorities said it would take up to five hours to
repair the substation.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of people were evacuated from subway tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco International Airport, flight operations
continued using separate power but some flights were diverted to
Oakland and San Jose to reduce traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency power lighted the airport terminals but computers were
not working, making it impossible to check in passengers, airport
spokesman Ron Wilson said. Airport personnel used bullhorns to
alert travelers to flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights at intersections throughout the city were off and
some electric buses were stuck in the intersections, blocking
traffic. The police and parking control officers directed traffic
at others.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown urged people to remain calm. His spokesman,
Ron Vinson, urged people to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The police reported no looting or other problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the Macy's department store on fashionable Union Square,
security guard Dennis Avant said he used a crowbar to rescue people
from elevators on the first and seventh floors. People were still
stuck at mid-morning on some floors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Stock Exchange stopped trading as computers failed.

THE VOICE OF CALM AND ASSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes, when I really want to scare myself, I
imagine turning on the radio after an earthquake and finding
silence where KCBS-AM should be.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever would I do? Probably go insane, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   For people like me _ people for whom there has been no such
thing as a ``little'' earthquake since Oct. 17, 1989 _ KCBS radio
is like an audio American Red Cross. It rescues us at the height of
our crisis and gives us shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when a particularly sharp 4.1 quake on the Hayward
Fault shook the whole San Francisco Bay area at 4:16 a.m., I could
not get out of bed and turn on 740 on the AM dial fast enough. If
20 seconds lapsed between my realization of ``Uh-oh, quake!'' and
the sound of anchorman Larry Chiaroni's voice, I'd be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the longest 20 seconds I've spent in months.
</P>
<P>
   When tectonic plates grind and shift beneath us, people like me
experience a major adrenaline rush and get pretty scared. People
like me who live alone stay scared for a long time. Whomever is
behind the microphone at all-news KCBS becomes our surrogate Mom
and Dad, reassuring us just by being there that everything is going
to be all right, honey, really it is.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark, cold hours of early Friday morning, Mom/Dad was
Chiaroni, God bless him. Sequestered with four other staffers in
the KCBS studios, he had ridden out plenty of earthquakes before,
but this was his first from the 32nd floor of a building.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he got Pat Jorgenson from the U.S. Geological Survey
on the horn, he asked her straight out to tell us there was nothing
to panic about. And she did, reminding everyone that there was no
reason to think this quake was a harbinger of a big one to come any
minute.
</P>
<P>
   As other KCBS staffers started calling in _ mandatory station
policy immediately after a quake _ Chiaroni seemed as pleased to
hear from them as I was.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Mike Colgan, thanks for checking in. What's up, Terry
Conway? You're in the city, right? Woke you too, eh, Ron Lyons?
And, as amped as Chiaroni and I might have been, we knew we were
way better off than Tracy Romine; he was calling from inside a Bay
Area Rapid Transit train frozen on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with the ritual of Bay-area earthquake response, lots of
regular folks called in too and spoke on the air about what the
quake felt like in Berkeley or Palo Alto or San Anselmo. The
popular reaction: ``Violent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dory Culver, KCBS's assistant news director, the
station received ``easily 200 calls Friday morning _ and that's a
conservative guess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 10 or 11 lines and they were all busy for most of
the morning,'' she said. ``Right after a quake lots of people turn
on their radios and think, `I just want to call somebody,' so they
call us because they feel like they know us. Our job is to keep the
information coming, calmly, on the air and keep answering the
phones. A lot of times you have to keep in mind that you're talking
to people who are not only afraid but who just woke up; they say
the strangest things.''
</P>
<P>
   Like veteran anchor Al Hart, Culver started getting dressed for
work as soon as she felt Friday's quake in her Cole Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the raccoons _ they were digging up the back yard _
so I knew I'd better head in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the sun came up and everybody calmed down, Culver said
KCBS started to get the usual thank you calls: ``People just want
to tell us how grateful they are that we're there and we didn't
scare them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know. Lying in bed, fully dressed except for shoes _ and
wearing radio headphones _ I finally chilled out enough to go back
to sleep about dawn. Maybe I could have done it without KCBS, but I
doubt it. And, frankly, I don't even want to think about it. I've
had enough scaring for awhile.

   IMPEACH-COLOR _ WASHINGTON _ Outside the hearing room where
President Clinton's lawyers were presenting his impeachment defense

of strangers _ one, a foreign woman taking pictures _ caused an
angry stir among the homeless people camped in a city park in
Seoul. Leaving their cluster of tents, they started toward us
through the trees. My translator, an unemployed stock analyst,
thought we ought to cut and run. I thought the tent people would
calm easily. They did, and a few hung around to talk. These, after
all, were not fugitives hunted by police or people with scarred
lives who belonged in mental institutions. These homeless people
were impossibly clean, literate and hopeless, at least for the

tortured me and I almost died and God knows why I didn't.'' And
unless you already know the story, you think surely she must be
exaggerating. Because who on Earth could survive all that? This is
an incredibly emotional journey through one woman's life,
near-death and rebirth. (Evans, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

HARK: IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL AT YULETIDE OFFICE PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATE GURNETT  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the holidays you might prefer a free turkey, a gift
certificate or, if you're especially lucky, a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, your boss is throwing an office party. And charging
admission.
</P>
<P>
   As precious shopping time ticks away, you'll be stuck in a dark
ballroom, balancing hard cubes of cheese and rubbery broccoli on a
napkin, making dull chitchat. It's like work.
</P>
<P>
   It is work, business etiquette experts say. And for those who
value their job, attendance is mandatory. ``It's not really
optional,'' said Barbara Pachter of Cherry Hill, N.J., co-author of
``The Prentiss Hall Complete Business Etiquette Handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you can't escape, you can get through. Experts offer tips
to guide you through the potential hell of the holiday fete. You
may not like them, but they are good etiquette!
</P>
<P>
   First, don't relax. As we said before, this ain't no party. Not
really. Your role here is to network.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not there to talk to people you know,'' said Ann Marie
Sabath of At Ease Inc. in Cincinnati. ``The way you act is going to
affect your next promotion. If you mix and mingle, they might
connect you with larger clients who mix and mingle. It's as
important as how you act at that second or third job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   What, no noisemakers? No flirting? No fun? Not these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known as economic insecurity,'' said M. Thomas Inge, a
humanities professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va.
``Everybody's scared to death they're going to lose their job. And
jobs are hard to get in all this economic downsizing. You can be
the best salesman, and tomorrow, through no fault of your own, you
could be out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the office party was known to be a rather wild
affair, Inge said. ``People did certain things they'd be
embarrassed about the next day, but there was a certain allowance
given. It was like the old-fashioned Mardi Gras _ the beggar was
king for a day. No matter what your status in life, it was a nice
relief from the pressure to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when ``the guy who had his eye on the
secretary all year finally went up to her, with a couple of drinks
under his belt, and said what he felt,'' Inge noted.
</P>
<P>
   Today that spells sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just in insecure times. Look what's going on in the
White House. This has frightened everybody,'' he added. ``You can't
just let your hair down _ or your pants as well.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there are cocktails at the office party, ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business/social event, and business rules apply. You
may be out of the office, but your behavior will come back to haunt
you,'' Pachter said.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you do it _ and stay sober? Talking to strangers is
often the last thing on most people's Christmas list. The dread
will disappear once you learn how to socialize, said Pachter, who
teaches interactive skills.
</P>
<P>
   See it as a challenge, she said. Meet three people you didn't
know before. And greet people like old friends _ with a warm smile
and handshake. Speaking of handshakes, guys, grasp the woman's hand
firmly. The days of the three-fingered wimpy pinch are over. To
make conversation, experts say, ask lots of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you from?'' is a good start. ``How about that
game?'' is another. ``Read news magazines,'' Pachter said. ``There
are appropriate topics _ not sex, religion, politics. Don't even go
there. Talk entertainment, the weather, what people are doing over
the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't hurt to toss out a few compliments. ``Gee, you really
know your stuff.'' Or something as simple as ``You look nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks remember compliments fondly. Snideness and sarcasm prompt
fantasies of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People perceive you as interesting if you are sincerely
interested in them,'' said Sabath, author of ``Business Etiquette:
101 Ways to Conduct Business with Charm and Savvy.'' The true bore
is someone who talks too much, not too little.
</P>
<P>
   If you're trapped by a dullard who drones on endlessly, pull out
your previously practiced exit lines. Such as: ``Excuse me, I've
got to get some broccoli.'' Or: ``It's been a pleasure talking to
you.'' Or: ``Well, I'll see you at work!''
</P>
<P>
   And if talk turns troublesome? Ignore rude remarks or
inappropriate jokes, experts advise. ``Just move along. And
certainly don't waste your time or energy discussing it,'' Sabath
said. Treat even those people you really can't stand with respect.
And don't pick a fight.
</P>
<P>
   For the times when a spouse makes an uncouth crack, Miss Manners
offers this solution: ``Say with affectionate shock (raised
eyebrows but warm, almost-patronizing smile), `Brandon! That came
out wrong! They'll think you meant to be insulting!'''
</P>
<P>
   It helps to prepare your date or spouse by noting whom they will
meet and what is expected of them. Your companion's behavior ``does
represent you,'' Sabath said. Also, dress appropriately.

   Hilka Klinkenberg, managing director of Etiquette International
in New York, recalled a young investment banker on the fast track
who arrived at an office party in ``a very short, very tight, very
sexy, low-cut clinging black lace dress over a nude underslip,''
prompting office gossip for three subsequent weeks. ``It became
about her being a hot young chick as opposed to her being a
competent young professional,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While different industries tend to have somewhat different
cultures, the bottom line is that people are making assessments
about you, said Klinkenberg, author of ``At Ease ...
Professionally.''

COMPANIES FIND WAYS TO MANAGE DELUGE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Electronic mail is increasingly becoming the
preferred mode of correspondence. But for some businesses, e-mail
has become too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are deluged daily with hundreds of messages they can't
possibly respond to in a timely fashion, if at all. As a result,
customer service can lag and business opportunities can slip away.
</P>
<P>
   To counteract these potential losses, some companies have
created internal systems that use software designed to sort, direct
and answer e-mail queries automatically. Others are contracting
with companies in the growing e-mail call center industry to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Brigade Solutions Inc. is set up like a traditional call center,
employing 50 ``cyber representatives'' in San Francisco and in
India _ where lower-cost, highly skilled labor is plentiful _ who
read e-mail questions sent to businesses and shoot back answers,
usually within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Brigade was launched in February with $300,000 in seed money
from its founders, Brian Jeffries and Russ Cohn. The company is now
awaiting an infusion of about $2.5 million from a venture capital
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Fortune 500 companies out-source customer service,'' said
Jeffries, 32, the president and chief operating officer of Brigade.
``It's a pain not to out-source what's not the core of your
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company so far has three corporate clients, including San
Francisco-based Intellipost Corp., an on-line direct marketing
company. For confidentiality purposes, Brigade would not name the
other two customers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Brigade started percolating a few years ago when
Jeffries and Cohn were working as management consultants in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian and I built call center operations for large telecom
firms,'' said Cohn, 28, the chief executive. ``We saw the Internet
as a way to do this better, faster and cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurs said Brigade charges clients significantly
less to sort, direct and answer e-mail than it would cost if the
customer had its own system.
</P>
<P>
   For answers to simple e-mail inquiries, Brigade charges between
$1 to $2 per response. This compares with about $4 per response
using an internal system, according to Forrester Research Inc., a
market analysis company in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Brigade representatives start by writing answers to the most
frequently asked questions received by a client. Then those
responses go into a ``knowledge base.'' Jeffries said about 70
percent of the responses can be answered through the knowledge
base, with minimal tweaking. The remaining 30 percent of e-mail
requires more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Using Chevron Corp. as a hypothetical client, Jeffries said,
``Chevron might get e-mails about where the closest service station
is. That doesn't take a rocket scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more technical question about how Chevron gasoline is
formulated, he said, a Brigade representative would need to forward
it to an appropriate Chevron manager.
</P>
<P>
   Brigade is targeting large companies, those that receive at
least 3,000 electronic inquiries a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to build a small number of very large accounts,''
Cohn said. ``The death of many service companies is that they have
too many customers, and not enough services. We're not following
the FedEx model. We're not stamping out parts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cohn notes that one of Brigade's largest accounts right
now is Intellipost, he sees opportunities outside the technology
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pretty big market for us in any industry,'' Cohn
said. ``High-tech companies get the most e-mail, but banks and
airlines should care the most.''
</P>
<P>
   John McCormick, an analyst with Frost &AMP; Sullivan Inc., a
technology research company in Mountain View, Calif., said Brigade
likely would capture a small segment of the growing e-mail call
center industry.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said industry sales are about $11 million. He
predicted that by 2002, sales will jump to $103 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at live services,'' he said, referring to
companies such as Brigade. ``I think it's going to be a niche
market because they're much more expensive than automated
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Automated solutions are the handful of software companies that
sort, direct and answer e-mail queries. McCormick said the one-time
cost of acquiring this software could run from $900 to about
$14,000 _ much less than the $1 million annual revenue stream
Brigade is looking for from each customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies don't really like recurring costs,'' McCormick said.
``If you buy automated solutions, you can take the hit up front.
It's like buying a house or renting.''

NERVE DISEASE OFTEN LEADS TO FRUSTRATION FOR SUFFERERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Cathy Sharp thought her feet hurt because she
stood all day at her bank teller job.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor diagnosed a bone spur, then neuromas or nerve tumors.
When the pain returned, Sharp was told she had a condition that is
similar to carpal tunnel syndrome but in the feet.
</P>
<P>
   After three surgeries, Sharp, now 51, was optimistic. Then the
pain came back. ``When I got back on my feet, there was immediate
burning,'' she said. ``My feet were on fire. The longer I'd be on
my feet, the worse it would become.''
</P>
<P>
   That was more than five years ago. Since then, Sharp lost her
job at the bank in Greenwich, N.Y., spent a lot of her savings and
almost gave up trying to find the cause of her pain. A New York
City neurologist finally gave her an answer at the end of 1996:
peripheral neuropathy.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 million people in the United States suffer from this
condition, a little-known disease of the peripheral nerves. They
are the nerves that connect the central nervous system, including
the brain and spinal cord, to the muscles, skin and internal
organs.``It's not a designer disease,'' said Bill Shankland, who
lives in Gloversville, N.Y., and was diagnosed with the condition
seven years ago. ``If somebody has multiple sclerosis or muscular
dystrophy, they immediately understand. People have just never
heard of peripheral neuropathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most often the symptoms appear in the hands and feet, with
burning, itching, numbness and intolerance to heat and cold. The
disease can also affect balance or the ability to walk, by
interrupting nerve signals between the central nervous system and
the feet. Some people with neuropathy need to use a wheelchair and
many use canes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who has neuropathy has a different story, but it's
basically the same story of going from doctor to doctor. It's
really a battle,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge is that the neuropathy may be caused by
one of 200 other problems, including diabetes, thyroid problems,
alcoholism, HIV, cancer and the autoimmune condition of
Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, doctors are unable to determine a specific
trigger. In those cases, the disease may progress as the body's
antibodies mistakenly attack the peripheral nerves. The damage may
be to the nerve covering, known as myelin, or to the nerve itself,
known as the axon.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure. There are treatments, however, like regular
infusions of immunoglobulin or chemotherapy and steroids, that may
slow the deterioration in some patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding of peripheral neuropathy is not where it
needs to be,'' said Dr. Neil Lava, a professor of neurology at the
Albany Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there are so many different causes, what helps you may
not help somebody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shankland, a retired New York state worker, had numerous
problems just getting a diagnosis. ``I got the runaround,'' he
said. ``I went from doctor to doctor. They talked about gout,
bursitis, arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your legs prickle and sometimes you feel like there's a bug
bite and you need to itch it. You get a lot of prickling and a lot
of pain. It's excruciating.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's still walking, thanks to monthly infusions of
immunoglobulin. During one of his treatments, he met Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time we had talked to anyone who had it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two have since started a support group, the Northeast
Neuropathy Association, for others with the condition. Over the
past year, they've had five meetings and recruited 60 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to your body, you have to be your own advocate
or you're all done,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>

Association, based in New York City, at 800-247-6968.)

COMMENTARY: `A LONG SHADOW'   (JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 Rerunning for all needing  By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hardly anyone realizes it yet. But this country may
spend the first months of 1999 _ as many as six months _ with the
president on trial before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For six days a week, under the rules, the 100 senators would be
in their seats on the floor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would
preside. Congress, the president and the Supreme Court would be
seriously disabled.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the right-wing Republicans who are effectively
running the impeachment process in the House are taking us. Most
Americans do not want to go there. Indeed, they assume that
impeachment is a dead issue. But the House may vote next week to
impeach the president. How can that be?
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde, who as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is the
formal manager of the process, is widely respected in the House.
Moreover, he has a strong feeling for our political institutions.
Yet he is driving toward an impeachment that would damage the
presidency and arouse public contempt for Congress. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Some who know Henry Hyde well say that, on partisan issues, he
does not like to stray from the Republican line. And the line on
impeachment is being set by the Republican right. With
Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston silent, the commanding voice is
that of Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, a hard-line
conservative. Other forceful figures are Bill McCollum of Florida
and Bob Barr of Georgia, who has been demanding President Clinton's
impeachment on one ground or another for years.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives have a visceral dislike for Bill Clinton.
They reason that, even if he was acquitted in the Senate,
impeachment would mark him as not even President Nixon was marked.
McCollum said the other day that impeachment would satisfy those
who ``believe the president should be branded and given the scarlet
letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The right is affirmatively opposed to what many people favor:
censure instead of impeachment. It would rather lose on impeachment
and then use the negative votes of moderate Republicans to try to
purge them in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates are under heavy pressure from the right.
When Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana let it be known that he might
consider censure rather than impeachment, the far-right magazine
Human Events denounced him as ``pro-perjury.'' His office got
thousands of calls.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates are also said to have been put off by what DeLay
called ``lawyerese'' in Clinton's reply to 81 questions from the
Judiciary Committee. Anyone facing a prosecutor who wants to put
him in prison _ as Kenneth Starr plainly does the president _ will
be advised by his lawyer to say as little as possible. Even so,
Clinton could no doubt have been more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   But what should be in the minds of the Republican moderates _
and for that matter conservative Democrats _ is history.
Specifically, the two notorious impeachments in our history: of
Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 and President Andrew
Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist published a book in 1992 on those two impeachments and
trials, ``Grand Inquest.'' Both, he said, were highly political.
President Jefferson and his supporters went for Justice Chase
because they did not like his judgments. Johnson was attacked by
the Radical Republicans of his day because he wanted to temper
harsh policies toward the South after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   If either had been convicted, Rehnquist wrote, ``a long shadow
would have been cast'' over the independence of the courts and the
presidency. But enough Jeffersonians in the Senate voted to acquit
Chase. And Johnson was acquitted by a single vote _ that of a
Republican senator from Kansas, Edmund Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was ostracized and impoverished because of his vote. But
John F. Kennedy listed him in ``Profiles in Courage,'' saying his
``heroic'' act ``may well have preserved ... constitutional
government in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusers of Bill Clinton have abandoned all the potentially
serious charges: Whitewater, campaign finance, Filegate. What
remains, however ingeniously framed, is lying about sex. To impeach
him for that would trivialize a grave constitutional process and
cast a lingering shadow on the presidency.

THE LATEST CELEBRITY SCENT IS A PIGLET OF A PERFUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even Miss Piggy is getting into the perfume act,
joining the ranks of Cher, Linda Evans (remember Cristal?), Joan
Collins and Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Topper Schroeder, president of Gendarme Fragrances
in West Hollywood, Calif., who pitched the idea to Henson
Productions, home of the porcine princess, ``I figured, hey, if
Elizabeth Taylor can do it, why can't she?''
</P>
<P>
   There's only one drawback to having the ditzy diva tout her own
scent _ you're not going to find her making in-store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder describes the scent as ``lighter than Pleasures''
(last year's runaway best-seller from Estee Lauder), ``and it lasts
a lot longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Developed for Gendarme by International Flavors and Fragrances
(IFF) by Jean-Claude De Ville (who formulated Wilkes Bashford's
eponymous new scent, plus Tresor for Lancome and Eternity for
Calvin Klein), Moi is officially a floral chyphre, that is: flowers
and wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted something that was very romantic,'' Schroeder says.
``But I am allergic to everything and wanted a fragrance that
didn't make me sneeze.''
</P>
<P>
   The top note is a dewy tangerine and mandarin; the floral heart
is zinnia, hydrangea and rose petal. And the dry-down is sensual
and unique, Schroeder says, because it includes hazelnut. ``Miss
Piggy likes to eat hazelnuts and loves the smell of them. So they
are in the base along with warm blonde wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, blonde. ``You've got to play it pretty straight when
you do satire,'' Schroeder says.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's has the exclusive on Moi, which retails for $24.
A limited edition fragrance _ there were only 50,000 bottles
produced _ each bottle is numbered. ``We're not going to get rich
on this one,'' laughs Schroeder, who says that his deal with Henson
isn't about licensing fees.
</P>
<P>
   Gendarme, by the way, has two more Henson-based fragrances in
the works, one for Animal and one for Kermit. Can Oscar the Grouch
be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New on the market from Francois Nars, that adorable French guy
whose makeup looks were featured on the recent Marc Jacobs and
Darryl K runways, is Lip Lacquer, nine new pots of lip color that
are more than a gloss and less than a lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Nars likes to name his products for classic movies, so there is
Cabiria (sheer copper), Baby Doll (cotton candy pink), Butterfield
8 (sueded brown) and Tiffany (cinnamon), to name a few. Slicked on
the lips, they give shiny, sheer, but intense color. That's a nice
combo that works well for spring with the season's new glistened-up
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Find it at Saks and Sephora for $19 a pot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While you're in your local Victoria's Secret buying Christmas
lingerie and other pretties, check out the flashy new makeup
display with what seems like hundreds of products. There are 10 lip
products, from conditioning balm and plumper to lip pencils, two
glosses and four kinds of lipstick (matte, long wear, creamy,
intense color and sheer color).
</P>
<P>
   Packaged in shiny silver and clear compacts, the Vicky's line is
priced just under Clinique and is very high quality. The colors are
amazing. My favorite: Torch, a blue red.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the products are innovative, like the Trick Stick
Concealer Crayon, which comes with its own sponge smoother, and
Dash Me a Line eye pencils created in a no-drag formula. They slide
on like silk, don't pull the eyelid, and smudge like crazy, if
that's the way you like it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Vicky's, Stephanie Seymour, the supermodel who
sports the Angels line along with Tyra Banks, has just written a
book called ``Beauty Secrets for Dummies'' ($19.99), a collection
of tips about skin care, beauty emergencies, discovering a personal
style and sussing out beauty bargains.
</P>
<P>
   The book itself, a large paperback, is quite a bargain, just as
Stephanie is quite the dish. But if you're looking for something
simple and understandable, this isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   For everything you've always wanted to know about face lifts,
there is Joan Kron's new book, ``Lift: Wanting, Fearing and Having
a Face-Lift'' ($23.95).
</P>
<P>
   Kron is a former New York Times and Wall Street Journal reporter
who has covered plastic surgery for Allure and has had a couple of
lifts herself. She writes in a comfortable, conversational style
and addresses many of the fears and concerns of plastic surgery
candidates _ like where do you hide the scars, does it really hurt,
how long does a lift last and how to choose a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   This 264-page volume might be a handy desk reference before you
make the cut.

   SCOTLAND-PHEASANTS (Tarves, Scotland) _ Late autumn is the time
of year in northern Scotland when the dreamy pace of country living
picks up. The start of the November-to-February pheasant-shooting
season is cause for real excitement. Workers on the 9,000-acre
Haddo Estate here have spent months getting ready for the moment,
and scores of well-dressed shooters have pursued their sport here
from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the United

   NY-MENU-PRICES (New York) _ Some numbers rise to the level of
poetry. The 35 that's attached to the dollar sign that's attached
to the leek and potato soup at Lespinasse is one of them. In the
same way that the Chrysler Building is more than a building the $35
soup, teeming with white truffles and langoustines, is more than a
soup. It is a symbol, a beacon, a shiny new prototype in the grand
factory of Manhattan restaurant dining. By William Grimes.

   VEGETABLE-PHOTOS (San Francisco) _ They were stuffed into an old
trunk in the Bermondsey antique market in London, south of the
Thames, when an Irish collector and historian named Sean Sexton
came across them one morning in 1981. His eye, more practiced than
most, told him immediately that he had stumbled upon a rare visual
harvest _ a cornucopia of hundreds of ravishing photographs of
fruits, flowers and mundane vegetables, magically transformed into
art by one Charles Jones. But exactly who was this Jones? And when
had he lived? By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>

   ICE-CREAM-TASTER (Undated) _ Somehow, in my fantasy of the

taker, professional ice cream taster _ I never thought the latter
would include lab coats, cubicles and green lights. But it does
here at Ben &AMP; Jerry's Headquarters, where I'm being trained by

THE YEAR OF SEX, LIES, CLICHES AND EUPHEMISMS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The year is coming to a close, and it's time to
revise the Dictionary of Distraction. In the last year we've been
driven nuts by euphemisms and cliches.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, we have new euphemisms for sex that have made the
national agony more agonizing. It just isn't the same as 25 years
ago when expletives were deleted, and the constitutional crisis was
about a president who tried to subvert his enemies with federal
agencies and his own goons.
</P>
<P>
   The following are the catch phrases of 1998, and their true
meanings:
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutional crisis.'' Oral sex, according to House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inappropriate.'' Oral sex, according to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury.'' Lying about oral sex. Used by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misled.'' Lying about oral sex. Used by Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton legacy.'' Oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oral sex.'' Not as much fun as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bipartisan.'' Sane Americans don't buy any part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica.'' 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the press has been awash in the above words, American
business has been busy making the language safe for monopolies,
profit and lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the New York Times had the following sentence on its
front page: ``The downsizing is coming just when a strong job
market, mainly in the service sector, offers new jobs, softening
the blow considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Learn to make a half-caf cappuccino, and you can
make half the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   True, some of these terms are not new in 1998, but have been
accepted into usage by newspapers instead of plain English. We live
in a country where no one is fired anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downsizing.'' You, too, can have a new job in America's
booming economy. As in: ``Would you like to super size those
fries?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Private industry'' or ``private sector.'' Where bureaucrats
could earn more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service sector.'' The part of the private sector that pays
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian crisis.'' Something happening over there. Replaces
``Pacific Rim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate culture.'' Self-canceling phrase, often employed
with verb ``clash.'' Used when a North Carolina bank, say, takes
over a California bank and engages in uncultured behavior like
firing female executives or not promising to make loans to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merger.'' Monopoly in the making. Two banks, computer
companies or oil companies become one bigger one, thus allowing
higher profits and fewer workers. According to big business'
biggest friend, Bill Clinton, mergers are good if they lead to
``lower prices and higher-quality services.''
</P>
<P>
   See ``misled.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychology and medicine are always growth areas in the language,
and this year has been no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients' bill of rights.'' When in the course of HMO events,
it becomes necessary to be billed, thou shalt be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Road rage.'' The jerk in the other car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intensity.'' A compliment to say about yourself when you've
acted like a jerk. As California Assemblyman Kevin Shelley said of
15 aides who've quit or been fired: ``My intensity in my job is one
of the reasons I've been successful, but that same intensity
creates an environment that is unduly stressful for a number of
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Assisted suicide.'' Self-canceling phrase. Cancels self.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra.'' A great medical advance, but a bigger advance for
Internet joke Web pages. Replaces ``Prozac.'' You take it orally.
For sex.

   SCOTLAND-PHEASANTS (Tarves, Scotland) _ Late autumn is the time
of year in northern Scotland when the dreamy pace of country living
picks up. The start of the November-to-February pheasant-shooting
season is cause for real excitement. Workers on the 9,000-acre
Haddo Estate here have spent months getting ready for the moment,
and scores of well-dressed shooters have pursued their sport here
from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the United
States. By Warren Hoge.

   NY-MENU-PRICES (New York) _ Some numbers rise to the level of
poetry. The 35 that's attached to the dollar sign that's attached
to the leek and potato soup at Lespinasse is one of them. In the
same way that the Chrysler Building is more than a building the $35
soup, teeming with white truffles and langoustines, is more than a
soup. It is a symbol, a beacon, a shiny new prototype in the grand
factory of Manhattan restaurant dining. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLE-PHOTOS (San Francisco) _ They were stuffed into an old
trunk in the Bermondsey antique market in London, south of the
Thames, when an Irish collector and historian named Sean Sexton
came across them one morning in 1981. His eye, more practiced than
most, told him immediately that he had stumbled upon a rare visual
harvest _ a cornucopia of hundreds of ravishing photographs of
fruits, flowers and mundane vegetables, magically transformed into
art by one Charles Jones. But exactly who was this Jones? And when
had he lived? By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ICE-CREAM-TASTER (Undated) _ Somehow, in my fantasy of the
world's greatest jobs _ professional sleeper, professional vacation
taker, professional ice cream taster _ I never thought the latter
would include lab coats, cubicles and green lights. But it does
here at Ben &AMP; Jerry's Headquarters, where I'm being trained by
Shawna Parizo, the company's Sensory Analyst, the person whose job
it is to decide how the ice cream tastes _ and how to keep it that

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WHY I WRITE: THOUGHTS ON THE CRAFT OF FICTION &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Will Blythe (Little, Brown, $23)
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers when they're writing live in a spooky, clamorous
silence, a state somewhat like the advanced stages of prayer but
without prayer's calming benefits,'' Joy Williams says. ``A writer
turns his back on the day and the night and its large and little
beauties, and tries, like some half-witted demi-urge, to fashion
other days and nights with words. It's absurd. Oh, it's silly,
dangerous work indeed.'' Amy Hempel borrows a thought from Tom
Waits on the difficulty of sitting down at a keyboard and trying to
say something in a new way: ``Your hands are like dogs, going to
the same places they've been.'' Ann Patchett admits that one of the
reasons she became a writer was the cachet of the writing life. And
Rick Moody and his mom, Margaret F.M. Davis, offer separate views
on his childhood and how it produced an adult who writes. We are
happy to report that this collection of essays pays as much
attention to the drudgery as to the rapture, and consequently to
the soul of the craft. Among the other contributors: Barry Hannah,
Jim Harrison, Robert Stone, Mark Richard, Jayne Anne Phillips,
Terry McMillan, Denis Johnson, Thom Jones, Richard Ford, Rick Bass,
Mary Gaitskill and Lee Smith. And here is James Salter: ``In the
end, writing is like a prison, an island from which you will never
be released but which is a kind of paradise: the solitude, the
thoughts, the incredible joy of putting into words the essence of
what you for the moment understand and with your whole heart want
to believe.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; EVERYTHING AND A KITE &QL; 
 &UR; Ray Romano (Bantam, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   You know how we feel about the recent glut of books by
comedians, a veritable conga line of failed humor. Imagine our
surprise when we learned that Romano feels the same way. He spends
a whole chapter lamenting his lack of talent as a writer (``Talking
and writing are totally different,'' he says. ``In conversation I
can feign intelligence.''). This gives rise to an obvious question
_ why, Ray, why? _ and an obvious answer: Someone paid him to try
to be funny for 200 pages, and he spent the advance, so he couldn't
back out. Reason to rush out and buy it, don't you think? We have,
and we are here to tell you that Romano does not earn your dollar.
He is personable (a leg up on Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Paul
Reiser and other pioneers of the comedian-book genre), and he tries
mighty hard, but he is not funny. Just richer. Our advice: Go buy
Steve Martin's book, and have a better time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MAY THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN &QL; 
 &UR; Lynn C. Franklin (Harmony, $24)
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Franklin gave her newborn son up for adoption. She was
19 and unmarried. Her parents were supportive, but there was never
any thought that Franklin could raise the baby alone, no
possibility that she might keep him. And so, she writes, ``I had
five days in the hospital to shower upon my baby all the maternal
love I would be allowed for the next 27 years.'' In April 1993,
Franklin was reunited with the son she had given up. She describes
here both the separation and the reunion, and she uses her own
experience to explore the changing face of adoption _ its
practical, emotional and legal issues as seen from the perspective
of birth parents, adoptive parents and the children they share.
It's a thought-provoking look at a process that is full of joy and
sorrow and that is changing as it is demystified. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANCIENT MEXICO &QL; 
 &UR; Maria Longhena (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $60)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, bigger is better. Text takes second billing to
visuals in this handsome coffee-table book, which opens with a
stunning succession of two-page photographs. There are aerial views
of the great stepped pyramids of Pre-Columbian cultures, and
close-up, nose-to-nose photographs of extraordinary masks (the most
impressive is a funerary mask carved from jade and covered with a
mosaic of turquoise, pyrite and shell _ it is presented in such
size and proximity that you almost imagine expression in its eyes).
Longhena traces the mosaic of civilizations that flourished in
Mesoamerica between the second millennium B.C. and the 16th
century. Included are the Olmecs, the Zapotecs, the Teotihuacan
culture, the Maya and the Aztecs, as well as minor cultures that
contributed to economic and artistic development. The book also
offers site plans, reconstructions of temples and cities, and the
remarkable artworks of these ancient peoples. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; DEVASTATION! &QL; 
 &UR; Lesley Newson (DK, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   What, no quicksand? There's not much else missing from this
survey of dreadful things. It covers earthquakes, floods, volcanic
eruptions, tornados and hurricanes, lightning storms, droughts,
famines, fires, avalanches, plagues, epidemics and _ we are not
making this up _ locust swarms (the ``pest'' category also includes
rats and beetles, but the locust pictures are better). This is a
book version of those television specials that show us unfathomable
things. Boats deposited on rooftops. Ocean waves crashing through
windows. A huge cloud of volcanic dust and gas pursuing a truck
full of fleeing people. An airplane dangling from a tree. And
water, lots of water everywhere. Our Most Horrifying Photograph
Award goes to that of France's rampaging Ouveze River, which in
1992 sent a 50-foot-high wall of water through the town of
Vaison-la-Romaine, killing 38 people. It's so terrible that we
cannot look away. &QL;

Values of the Game 
Bill Bradley (Artisan, $30) 
 
 By BILL HILL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be normal for any presidential candidate to spend much
of his time writing position papers. Serious thoughts on foreign
policy, global warming, Social Security. Really weighty issues.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Bill Bradley _ who left the U.S. Senate in
1996 after representing New Jersey for eight years and who,
although still an undeclared Democratic candidate for the White
House, formed an exploratory committee on Dec. 4 that can raise
money for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has spent his ``time off'' teaching at Stanford and
Notre Dame. And, he has written a book about basketball. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Values of the Game'' is actually a collection of 10 essays
about virtues, about lessons learned through basketball that can be
applied to everyday life. However, be forewarned: The game that
Bradley remembers and loves so dearly rarely resembles the
run-and-gun or shoot-the-trey style now marketed by the NBA (when
the owners and players aren't at odds over who should be the Kings
of Greed).
</P>
<P>
   Bradley knows of what he speaks. He was an All-American at
Princeton and an Olympian who delayed his pro career for two years
to attend Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. He then spent 10
years with the New York Knicks, two of which culminated with his
team's winning the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 essays are titled: Passion, Discipline, Selflessness,
Respect, Perspective, Courage, Leadership, Responsibility,
Resilience and Imagination. They are a collection of Bradley's
thoughts, as well as those of people who have influenced him and
the game. A couple of examples, attributed to UCLA coach John
Wooden: ``Failing to prepare is preparing to fail,'' and ``It is
what you learn after you know it all that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout the 160-page book are nuggets of advice
that any aspiring athlete would do well to read, such as this one,
which influenced Bradley's intense work ethic as a youngster: ``If
you're not practicing, just remember _ someone, somewhere, is
practicing, and when you two meet, given roughly equal ability, he
will win.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the lessons Bradley seeks to teach seem elementary,
until you stop and think about how the game is being played and
marketed in this era. As Bradley writes, ``The game is struggling
to keep its integrity alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which also has more than 100 classic basketball photos
of many of the game's greatest players, is meant to be more than a
sermon on how to succeed on a basketball court. It is intended to
make us think about how things such as passion, discipline and
selflessness can be be watchwords for success in life. And most of
the time, Bradley succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   A choice example comes from his essay on selflessness:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can learn more about people by playing a three-on-three game
with them for 20 minutes than I can by talking to them for a week.
I once hired a news director for my U.S. Senate offices in New
Jersey. I liked him, but it wasn't until I played basketball with
him that I knew I'd made the right choice. I found out he was a
hard worker (he went for the rebound), competitive with a fierce
desire to win (he played close defense), and unselfish (he screened
away from the ball).''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. It would be a good guess that Bradley, if elected
president, won't be interviewing too many of today's ``stars'' for
Cabinet positions. &QL;

<P>
   BOOKS Open Scott Berg's biography of Charles Lindbergh at any
point, and you will find it instantly interesting, no matter that
you already know the story of the handsome young aviator. A Q&AMP;A
with the author puts to rest the notion that an authorized
biography tells less than an unauthorized one. WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS
-- Postmodern theorists made fools of themselves, appropriating
words and ideas from sciences they scarcely understand and
bankrupting what intellectual integrity they can still claim. WITH:
REVIEWS -- As Phillip Lopate practices it, the personal essay is a
dramatic form. He rebels against the notion of the essay as ``a
mild tea cozy.'' WITH: NY Times Best Sellers List.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (Available by 2 p.m., Thursday, Dec.10) Like a
pile of gaudily wrapped gifts during the December holidays, this
film season will likely contain plenty of surprises -- both good
and bad. Here's a peek at what Hollywood is putting out in the next
several weeks to pull folks into movie theaters. WITH: REYNOLDS Q&AMP;A
-- A discussion with actor Burt Reynolds, who stars and directs in
TNT's latest film project, ``Hard Times.'' To no one's surprise,
Reynolds plays a hard-edged cop framed for a street killing.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS (Available by 2 p.m. Friday, Dec. 11) It will be a grim
Christmas this year for the residents of the poor nation of
Honduras. It's been over a month since Hurricane Mitch rampaged
through Central America, leaving 11,000 people dead and hundreds of
thousands homeless. In Honduras alone, a country of 6 million
people, more than 1 million have lost everything they owned. The
storm is over, but reconstruction may take years. Many relief
organizations are working around the clock to bring aid to this
shattered country, but it's an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD The perfect Christmas cookie: it has just a few ingredients
-- easy to find and not too difficult to mix or to bake. It might
be crunchy, but it isn't necessarily chocolate. And most of all, it
is more delicious than any other. WITH: COOKBOOK -- Holiday bakers
who want to add a new cookie or two to their perennial favorites
are in for several treats from this year's batch of cookbooks.
WITH: SKUBE ON BEER -- Winter beers aren't just for Christmas eve.
These are beers for firesides on cold evenings throughout the
winter -- heartier and stronger than what you'd drink at a summer
picnic.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY Let your fingers do the walking this holiday
season. Why not join the millions of shoppers doing their holiday
shopping online? You can shop at 4 in the morning or 11 at night,
and you never have to worry about finding a place to park.
Electronic commerce -- known to most consumers as online shopping
-- is rapidly becoming a booming business. WITH: DIGITAL DIVIDE:
Schools with computers are now facing training their teachers on
how to use them in the classroom. WITH: TECH BRIEFS -- Try going
online for mortgage shopping; innovative Web site for clothing
store acts like a fitting room. WITH: TECHNOBUDDY -- A UPS device
offers cheap insurance against damage from power surges. WITH:
TECHTOOLS -- The 1999 Grolier multimedia encyclopedia has its share
of problems, but on the whole it is a very useful reference work.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH AIDSVAX -- Dan Flinchum doesn't much like
needles, but he is about to become the first volunteer in Atlanta
to be inoculated with AIDSVAX, the first vaccine for the AIDS virus
to be widely tested in the United States. This is not the end of
AIDS. The vaccine may not work. Even if it does, it will take years
of further testing and tweaking before it is approved for
widespread use. WITH: AIDSVAX-TESTS -- HIV vaccine researchers know
they will need luck if they are to meet President Clinton's goal of
developing a working HIV vaccine by 2007 -- a goal some believe is
impossible. WITH: HEAD LICE -- Come to school right away. Your
child has head lice. What's the big deal, you wonder? It's a simple
matter of giving them a shampoo treatment and running a load or two
of laundry. Think again. WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS -- A study released by
the Texas Department of Health found that 43 percent of high school
students and nearly a third of middle schoolers chewed tobacco or
smoked it on at least one day in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL Button up your overcoat. It's time for chestnuts roasting
on an open fire in the Big Apple. Here are 10 fantastic ways to do
the holidays up right while staying in New York City; and there's
plenty to see and hear, smell and taste as December rolls on toward
1999. WITH: TRAVEL NOTES --Increasing emphasis on on-time
performance has led many airlines to draw a harder line against
oversized carry-on luggage. WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS -- Temporarily
vacant private homes in London can be a reasonably priced and
comfortable alternative to the city's hotels, others.
</P>
<P>
   WHEELS The '99 Grand Cherokee retains the menacing grille with
seven vertical slots and the big tire-accommodating trapezoidal
wheel openings. But most everything else -- notably the interior --
has been reworked to make it more appealing visually and more
comfortable physically. WITH: THE MECHANIC -- When thinking about
gifts this holiday season, why not consider automotive accessories;
you can make it practical yet personal.

SAN FRANCISCO MAY SEEK NEW BANKING PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city's treasurer vowed there would be a
``shake-up'' in the relationship City Hall has with BankAmerica
since the bank's merger with North Carolina-based NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Susan Leal said Monday she was seeking bids for
services and discounts on fees that she believed San Francisco was
entitled to as Northern California's largest banking customer.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica handles some 90 percent of San Francisco's banking
business, moving millions of dollars in payroll and payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at who can best take care of the money, but
you also look at who is headquartered in the city and who is going
to be a good corporate citizen,'' Leal said. ``There will be a
shake-up, and I think there is definitely a strong feeling in the
city to move away from Bank of America.''
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica has struggled in recent weeks with what it says are
unfair perceptions that the merger of Charlotte-based NationsBank
and BankAmerica Corp. of San Francisco has resulted in a flight of
women executives, an ambiguous commitment to lending to minorities
and a loss of interest in California business.
</P>
<P>
   Two City Hall sources said Hugh McColl Jr., the BankAmerica
chairman and former chief executive of NationsBank, had talked in
the past several days to Mayor Willie Brown, apparently to allay
concerns that the bank's commitment to community development and
philanthropy had lessened.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's press secretary, Kandace Bender, would not confirm
details of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   McColl is scheduled to deliver two speeches to reassure
California customers: one at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco
on Jan. 12, the other at Town Hall in Los Angeles on Jan. 13. He
also will meet with state and city officials in San Francisco and
Los Angeles ``to say we are unwavered in our commitment to the
community, both on the lending side and the philanthropy side,''
said BankAmerica spokesman John Keane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to assure them that (the management team) has the
resources to accomplish our mission in California,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   Leal said she was concerned about perceptions of a cultural gap
between the Charlotte-based management team and the more liberal
politics of the Bay area. Regardless of whether such a gap existed,
she said, she is inclined toward beginning relationships with other
banks because it makes economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what is good for the city,'' Leal said.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica has handled almost all the city's business for some
80 years. NationsBank acquired BankAmerica in September, sending
many of the merged corporate functions to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo is the only other major bank that complies with the
city's requirement of providing benefits to unmarried couples and
some other prerequisites for municipal contracts.
</P>
<P>
   However, Leal said, Wells Fargo would have to resolve its
differences with organized labor before being considered. Wells
Fargo is a major lender to Oregon Steel, which has a facility in
Pueblo, Colo., that has locked out 1,000 employees in a contract
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, including City Attorney Louise Renne, last week
criticized BankAmerica for demoting or replacing its women
executives, calling it unfair and unprofessional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Keane said since the merger, women were playing a greater
role on the board of directors.

 &HT;    MAGAZINE UNVEILS RANKINGS OF BEST COLLEGES FOR BLACKS
 &HT;    With BLACK-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Black students struggling to balance academic
excellence and cultural diversity gained a new tool Tuesday as
Black Enterprise magazine unveiled a ranking of the top 50 colleges
for African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Historically black institutions, such as Spelman College and
Morehouse College in Atlanta, dominated the top spots. Stanford
University in California was ranked No. 10, the highest of any
predominantly white institutions.
</P>
<P>
   While college rankings are nothing new, educators and
administrators said the new list fills a niche that others
overlook. Many also said they hoped the rankings, to be published
every two years, would help colleges compare themselves to one
another and show the schools where improvement is possible.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted for the magazine by Thomas LaVeist, an
associate professor at Johns Hopkins University and CEO of DayStar
Research, a public opinion firm.
</P>
<P>
   DayStar compiled a list of 987 accredited four-year schools that
either had black enrollment of at least 1.5 percent or that were
judged to have significant interest for black students.
</P>
<P>
   The firm then asked 1,077 African American presidents, faculty
members and administrators of the schools to rate their schools on
the academic and social environments for black students.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire results, plus data on black enrollment and
graduation rates, were run through a weighted formula _ which the
magazine did not release _ to produce the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their high black enrollment, historically black
colleges and universities were analyzed separately for the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was important that the list evaluate HBCUs and
major institutions of higher learning according to the
conduciveness of their environments to the ability of
African-American students to succeed and achieve,'' said Marjorie
Whigam-Desir, a senior editor of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings should help students and parents make ``more
informed decisions about the best college to attend from both an
educational and nurturing perspective,'' said Earl G. Graves,
publisher and CEO of Black Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   High school students of all races often place prestigious and
challenging schools at the top of their wish lists. Minority
students, however, often balance those wishes with the need to feel
included in campus activities, to have mentors and to receive
career counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Vania Smith, a graduate student at George Washington University,
said the rankings will be a powerful tool in helping students
choose a college where they will receive a quality education and
feel most at home.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she thinks George Washington, ranked No. 36, made the
list because it actively recruits minorities and creates an
environment where black students feel comfortable participating in
social and leadership activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' said Smith. ``My younger sister is applying
to schools now, and she can use it as a cross-reference to narrow
her search. The big challenge is deciding on environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the main ranking of national colleges, the magazine
listed the top five schools in four other categories that exclude
HBCUs: national liberal arts colleges, regional universities,
regional liberal arts colleges and national universities.

JUPITER'S MOONS APPEAR TO HAVE OCEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In close-up photos, the many moons of Jupiter
appear eerie and alien. But scientists believe that three moons
probably have something in common with Earth: ice-covered oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a giant fault like the San Andreas Fault in California has
been discovered on one of the icy moons, Europa. The 500-mile fault
has a large, 30-mile-plus displacement similar to that along the
San Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparisons between this ... fault (on Europa) and faults on
Earth may generate ideas we can use in studying earth movements
here on our planet,'' University of Arizona space scientist Randy
Tufts said Monday at the American Geophysical Union conference
here. He displayed the photos taken by the Galileo space probe.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's measurements of the magnetic field of one Jovian moon,
Ganymede, indicate it contains electrical conducting layers
characteristic of an ocean, said Margaret G. Kivelson, a space
scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by
robotic space probes, scientists said at an all-day seminar on the
latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, ``when I'm saying `oceans,' I'm not specifically
getting out my surfboard,'' Kivelson said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, scientists and engineers at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration hope to launch a robotic probe
to the Jovian moon Europa. The lander would settle on the icy
surface, then melt its way through to the hidden ocean. That ocean
might contain life forms warmed by undersea volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jovian moon Callisto also probably contains an ocean, based
on theoretical studies of its known composition, said space
scientist David J. Stevenson of the California Institute of
Technology. He estimates the ocean is roughly 60 miles deep and
lies under about 90 miles of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system
_ has earthlike aspects. Lightning and auroras are among them, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter even has super-lightning. The most energetic bolts are
1,000 times as powerful as the average terrestrial bolt, Caltech
space scientist Andrew P. Ingersoll said. And Jupiter's hurricanes
are mammoth _ as big as Earth itself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these slight similarities to Earth, Jupiter and its
moons are far stranger than anything seen on this planet. Jupiter
has faint rings, for example. Joseph Burns, a space scientist at
Cornell University, said the Jovian rings are formed from dusty
debris knocked off moons by meteoroids.
</P>
<P>
   And Jupiter's little moon Io _ where ferocious volcanoes spew
lava night and day _ may have a weirdly shaped magnetic field, said
Gary A. Glatzmaier, a space scientist at the University of
California at Santa Cruz. Because of Io's hot, bubbling interior
and its gravitational and electromagnetic interactions with
Jupiter, the moon may have four magnetic poles, Glatzmaier said.
Earth has just two magnetic poles.
</P>
<P>
   Hence a traveler carrying a compass around Io would tend to get
lost.

JUST DON'T LOOK FOR THE DIXIE CHICKS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Fiddlin' John Carson to Crazy Water Crystals, the recently
published Encyclopedia of Country Music attempts to be a complete
tell-all of eight decades of country music. It's ``the greatest
compendium of information about country music ever produced,''
proclaims the dust jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Gosh, let's sit down for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, all right. It's dry. It's thorough. You probably have
relatives who'd love it. Cost is $49.95, through Christmas, at
least. Then it becomes $55.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-pound book contains 634 pages and 1,300 entries that are
recent enough to include the dates of death for Tammy Wynette and
Roy Rogers (but not Gene Autry or Jerry Clower).
</P>
<P>
   It took 137 authorities to write the thing, including many
Texas-friendly writers such as Kevin Coffey, Rick Mitchell, Don
McLeese, Guy Logsdon and Charles R. Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, this very Nashville-focused effort is pretty
complete in its cataloging of western swing and cowboy music
pioneers, and even in its coverage of modern Texas-music icons.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't wait to find out who made the cut, and who was left
out.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Texas-music fans, there are entries for Junior Brown, Guy
Clark, Lyle Lovett and Nanci Griffith. Tommy Duncan, Steve Earle,
Butch Hancock, Don Edwards, Joe Ely, and the Flatlanders all made
it in, but then again, so did the Four Guys and our own Ricky Lynn
Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   Also in: Don Walser, Delbert McClinton, Chris Wall, Leon Rausch,
and West Texas dance legend Hoyle Nix. Tommy Duncan and the Chuck
Wagon Gang are in there. Ditto Dale Watson and Wayne Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Alvin Crow or Clay Blaker or Terry Allen, though.
No Dixie Chicks, no Lloyd Maines, no Old 97's.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Willis is listed, and her marriage to Bruce Robison
mentioned, but there are no listings for either Bruce or brother
Charlie Robison.
</P>
<P>
   The very-alive Bill Mack is duly noted. But the equally kicking
Johnnie High isn't, though he certainly has started enough
Nashville careers.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas, entry (glaringly, there isn't one for Fort
Worth) offers this: ``Austin's prominence as a country music
capital has declined since the 1980s, partly because the city never
built a recording complex that could augment its numerous live
performance venues.'' Thank you, Bill C. Malone. We Texans know
it's all our fault.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, writer Don McLeese of Austin does the balanced
``Austin City Limits'' entry that immediately follows.
</P>
<P>
   Some entries are wickedly anecdotal, others miss the good stuff.
Robert Earl Keen is listed, his ``Picnic'' album noted, but there
is no word about the incendiary car incident itself at Willie's
picnic.
</P>
<P>
   That's odd, considering that Ty Herndon's entry actually begins
with his Fort Worth arrest in 1995 on indecency and drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Lawrence's conviction on spousal abuse this year also made
his entry. Heh-heh.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas recording pioneer Jim Beck is noted, along with the sad
tale of his death by recording chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Cowboy'' gets an explanatory listing. So do the
``Louisiana Hayride'' and the ``Big D Jamboree.''
</P>
<P>
   One very fine entry explains conjunto. Gene Fowler explains
border radio. Someone even attempts to explain line dancing.
</P>
<P>
   You want obscure? Read up on Diesel Only Records, a '90s label
out of Brooklyn, N.Y., that only issues 45s on vinyl. There's even
a listing for Crazy Water Crystals, a Mineral Wells-based early
sponsor of country acts.
</P>
<P>
   Gilley's has a listing. Why doesn't Billy Bob's Texas, or Gruene
Hall? Staying in business must be less folkloric than being
torched.
</P>
<P>
   That opens up an entire category of whys. Why, why, WHY does the
small-time '90s group Boy Howdy merit an entry, when it lasted only
six years and never had a hit? Why is George Ducas in there, when
Walter Hyatt is not?
</P>
<P>
   Why Cledus ``T.'' Judd?
</P>
<P>
   And why on earth is Billy Ray Cyrus' entry as long as that of
legendary Sun Records?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that's right: The acknowledgments say entries were included
``based on their impact on country music.'' It's as clear as a big,
refreshing glass of Crazy Water Crystals.

CHEFS JOIN EFFORT TO LABEL ENGINEERED FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the belief that chefs have a vested interest in potential
hazards in the food supply, Greenpeace has joined forces with Chefs
Collaborative 2000 in an effort to persuade consumers to fight for
the labeling of genetically engineered food. Their first move is a
campaign to collect 10,000 signatures to petition the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the insertion of genes from one species of animal
or vegetable into another, permanently altering its genetic code.
Many Europeans are furious about the technology, but most Americans
have only the vaguest idea of what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Both industry and government continue to assure consumers that
genetic engineering, like the use of rBGH, or bovine growth
hormone, in cows is not only safe but will also increase the food
supply and reduce the need for pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a coalition of consumer groups, chefs and
scientists filed a lawsuit against the FDA demanding labeling and
safety testing. Now the 1,000-member Chefs Collaborative, which was
founded in 1993 to support organic farming and sustainable
agriculture, is getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chefs are interested in environmental sustainability,''
said Charles Margulis, a genetic engineering issues specialist with
Greenpeace, an environmental group, ``and I think they are the
people who would be able to convince Americans that there is an
intimate connection between what we eat and how we choose to grow
the food that we eat.''
</P>
<P>
   New York restaurateurs who are in the collaborative and have
signed the petition include chefs at Le Bernardin, Daniel,
Chanterelle, Union Square Cafe, Aureole, March and Savoy. Chefs at
Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., Frontera Grill in Chicago and
Olives in Boston are also among the 140 signatories in the drive to
get names on the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs instinctively mistrust the genetic engineering of
food. Eric Ripert of Le Bernardin said: ``I don't want a cow gene
in my cabbage. It's like Frankenstein. I don't know exactly what
they are doing but at least everyone has the right to know and then
they can decide if they want to eat the food.'' He is passing out
brochures to customers, along with a form letter to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs, like Peter Hoffman at Savoy, worry about unintended
consequences. ``Biotechnology is like DDT was,'' he said.
``Everyone thought it was a miracle. No one ever thought what it
would do to birds and fish. It took 20 years to see that Rachel
Carson was right: DDT was not a cost-free miracle. And neither is
biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   Already 40 percent of the soybeans and 20 percent of the corn in
this country and 60 percent of the canola oil from Canada have been
engineered either to produce their own pesticides or to withstand
herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists worry about the effects of bioengineering not
only on human health, but also on the environment. There have been
no long-term studies but some consequences are already showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Genes inserted in seeds to make them resistant to herbicides can
transfer from crops to weeds through pollen, creating superweeds.
Insects feeding on crops implanted with insecticide genes can
eventually become resistant to those insecticides, creating
superbugs.
</P>
<P>
   In Scotland in 1995, pollen from genetically engineered
herbicide-resistant rape-oil seed fertilized untreated plants one
and a half miles away. A similar case affected corn in Germany this
fall. And in laboratory work, some insects have already shown
resistance to plants containing insecticide genes.
</P>
<P>
   But Margulis said that in the long run, the biggest worry is
about biodiversity. A crop grown from several varieties of seeds is
a protection against disease and pests that may attack one variety
but are unlikely to attack all the varieties at one time.
</P>
<P>
   If a farm relies on only one variety, as genetic engineering
would promote, one pest or disease could wipe out an entire crop.
``This is a way of getting diversity out of the hands of farmers
and into the hands of a few companies who control these seeds, and
that makes me nervous,'' Michael Romano, the chef at Union Square
Cafe, said. ``Our history has been that when we turned over crops
to the agricultural industry, it leads to overdevelopment of one
crop and that leads to depletion of soil and increase in certain
pests that leads to using more pesticides just to keep the crop
going. This doesn't happen with diversity and rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   The genetic engineerying industry thinks differently. Val
Giddings, vice president for food and agriculture of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade association, said the
use of biotechnology to create herbicide-tolerant crops offers
``enviromental benefits that are dramatic and of global
significance,'' reducing the use of pesticides and increasing
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his membership supports FDA policy, which requires
labeling if a bioengineered food presents a potential health
impact. ``It is good policy based on sound science and enjoys the
support of people who understand it,'' Giddings said.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, protests have included destruction of fields where
bioengineered crops have been planted, rallies, petitions,
referendums and protest marches. Americans have limited their
activism to telling polltakers they support labeling: one biotech
industry survey showed that 93 percent agreed that genetically
engineered food should be labeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All issues of actual scientific safety aside,'' Romano said,
``I just think the public has a right to know.''

STIR-FRIED BUT STIRRED LESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stir-frying is one of the fastest cooking methods possible,
especially if you have the same kind of high-powered wok burner as
your neighborhood Chinese restaurant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course you don't. But if you keep ingredients and,
ironically, stirring to a minimum, keep the heat high and forget
about a wok, you can keep the cooking time for a good stir-fry to
just about five minutes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You don't want a wok because home stoves, unlike the large
pit-burners in Chinese restaurants, are flat-topped. For best heat
distribution, you want a flat-bottomed skillet, the larger the
better and preferably nonstick.
</P>
<P>
   The heat must be kept high to insure nicely browned _ even
slightly charred _ meat and vegetables; for the same reason,
stirring should be minimized. The final key is to keep it simple:
too many ingredients slow you down and eventually overload the
skillet, so that browning becomes impossible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For speed and simplicity, I often use hoisin sauce when
stir-frying. Since it is made from fermented soybeans, chili,
sugar, ginger and garlic, it contains pretty much the same
ingredients that you may spend an extra 5 or 10 minutes measuring
and preparing.
</P>
<P>
   And because it usually contains flour or cornstarch, it
automatically glazes and thickens the dish. (When you buy hoisin
sauce, look for a brand whose first ingredient is fermented
soybeans rather than sugar or water: the flavor will be more
intense. And avoid those with artificial ingredients if possible.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many stir-fry dishes made at home, hard vegetables like
broccoli or asparagus need to be parboiled, or precooked. So in
this super-fast stir-fry, I stick to bell peppers, onions or both;
they turn tender and sweet in three or four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If you cut the chicken _ or beef, turkey, lamb or pork, if you
like _ in small cubes or thin slices, the cooking time for it is
even less. I include nuts for flavor, texture and speed _ I don't
chop them at all.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this stir-fry is so fast that the first thing you need
to do is start a batch of white rice. In the 15 or 20 minutes it
takes to cook, you will be able not only to prepare the stir-fry,
but also to set the table and have a drink. &QL;

   1 cup halved walnuts, whole cashews or other nuts
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons hoisin sauce. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the oil in a large, nonstick skillet (12 inches is
best), and turn the heat to high; a minute later, add the
vegetable(s) in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until they
begin to char a little on the bottom, about 1 minute. Stir and cook
1 minute more.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the meat, and stir once or twice. Again, cook until the
bottom begins to blacken a bit, about a minute. Stir and cook
another minute; by this time the vegetables will have softened and
the meat will be done, or nearly so (cut into a piece if you want
to check). Lower the heat to medium.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stir in the nuts and the hoisin sauce. Cook for about 15
seconds, then add 2 tablespoons of water. Cook, stirring, until the
sauce is bubbly and glazes all the meat and vegetables. Serve
immediately, with white rice. &QL;

CELEBRATING A BRILLIANT MASTER OF THE SHORT STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 17 years of its history, the Library of America has
commemorated scores of bygone native authors, from Charles Brocken
Brown in the late 18th century to masters of our own time window _
William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and James Baldwin among them.
</P>
<P>
   Now the series focuses for the first time on an author still
living. She is Mississippi's Eudora Welty, honored in her 90th year
with two volumes _ one containing her five novels, the other
collecting her short stories, essays and autobiographical writings.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, much of my reading time has been given to
Library of America titles. The series has been a humbling
revelation, identifying blind spots in my reading activity. I am
less well-read than I supposed, and these volumes containing the
works of our writers anointed with greatness help fill the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   There's some gap-filling to be accomplished in the matter of
Eudora Welty. I supposed, too, that I had a clear handle on her
fiction, but there's much catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   I first heard her name mentioned in a college course on the
American novel. Along with other English majors, I ridiculed behind
his back our fatuous, effeminate professor, but hindsight assures
me he was a fine teacher. He urged us to read Welty's 1946 novel
``Delta Wedding,'' and I did, with appreciation, and from that
point I wrongly considered Welty a novelist.
</P>
<P>
   I had a chuckle festival reading ``The Ponder Heart'' soon after
its 1954 publication, and chuckled some more a few years later when
David Wayne starred in its dramatization on Broadway. Then there
was a long wait for another Welty novel, until 1970, when ``Losing
Battles'' appeared. Two years later came ``The Optimist's
Daughter,'' which snared the Pulitzer Prize that I interpret as
valedictory for Welty's body of work. I rate both the long-ago
``Delta Wedding'' and ``Losing Battles'' as superior to the prize
winner.
</P>
<P>
   All along, I was ignoring Welty's short stories, even while
reading in critical essays that the short form is her true
strength. I was familiar with the oft-anthologized ``The Wide Net''
and ``The Bride of Innisfallen,'' and that was about it _ until
1980, when ``The Collected Stories of Eudora Welty'' appeared, and
I began to sense what I had been missing.
</P>
<P>
   Welty surely deserved the Pulitzer for her collected stories,
after Katherine Anne Porter, Jean Stafford and John Cheever all
won, in turn, for their volumes. But 1980 was the year of John
Kennedy Toole's ``A Confederacy of Dunces,'' and Pulitzer jurors
climbed on the bandwagon for posthumous tribute. Besides, Welty
already had a Pulitzer ... and that's how literary politics works.
</P>
<P>
   So here I am, having read all of Welty's novels and not nearly
enough of her stories; that's pleasure to be accomplished. Yet most
prospective readers want novels, as Welty's publishers did, and I
offer a brisk report.
</P>
<P>
   The larkish ``The Robber Bridegroom,'' technically her first
novel (1942), isn't so much novel as distended fable; ``Delta
Wedding'' must be considered her full-length debut. It's a subtle,
sympathetic view of genteel Southern society in modern transition.
``The Ponder Heart'' is a short story in design, stretched to
novella length with a trim of fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Battles'' is set in the 1930s and is effective as a
sociological period piece, as a proud family strives to preserve
its way of life (and loses the battle). ``The Optimist's Daughter''
is high-class soap opera, a triangle affair between a daughter, her
father and his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   Welty's fiction combines elements of the abnormal and grotesque,
but she's milder than Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers, and
closer in psychological substance to Katherine Anne Porter. Of them
all, she has the best ``ear,'' finding the key to character in the
way people speak.
</P>
<P>
   In Eudora Welty's world, no life lacks drama, no life lacks
value.

ENNOBLING CAULIFLOWER FOR A HOLIDAY SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the first of eight columns by Alfred Portale, the executive
chef and an owner of Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan. His
collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan.

<P>
   While I know that there are just four seasons, I cook as though
there were 12. For me, each month has a certain feel to it, and
it's the feel, as much as the foods that are available in the
market, that inspires me to create new dishes.
</P>
<P>
   On my culinary calendar, December is luxury season, a time to
drink Champagne and eat oysters, foie gras and cauliflower soup _
at least this cauliflower soup, lavished with sea scallops and
osetra caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Cauliflower, a stalwart in make-do cooking, might not leap to
mind as the stuff of luxe holiday fare. But when I saw it in the
Greenmarket, I remembered its virtues, which I learned working with
Michel Guerard at his spa in France.
</P>
<P>
   There, we used pureed cauliflower to thicken soups and sauces
that would normally take cream. Pureed, cauliflower's mild flavor
and voluptuous texture make it ideal for this sleight of hand.
</P>
<P>
   But cauliflower is a chameleon; left whole, its flavor is
stronger, its texture firm. I knew that using it both ways in one
dish, as I do in this soup, would be exciting.
</P>
<P>
   I took hot vichyssoise as my reference and replaced the starchy
potatoes with the cauliflower, but kept the leeks for sweetness. To
build in more flavor and texture, I decided to caramelize a few
florets, so that the soup would taste of cauliflower both subtle
and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Then, looking for something that would make the dish not just
delicious but also celebratory, I hit upon diver scallops, whose
season has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   These scallops are pristinely fresh and hand-harvested in Maine,
but they can be hard to find; don't hesitate to use regular sea
scallops. The scallops' clean sweet taste and silky texture made
them cauliflower-friendly, but their hint of brininess was a tease
that left you wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the spirit of the season, I added caviar. The combination
is perfect _ if served right.
</P>
<P>
   First, construct a minitower in the center of the bowl. Start
with the sliced leeks, proceed to the caramelized florets, then the
scallops and, finally, top it all with the caviar. At the table,
ladle soup around the towers, keeping the caviar cool and dry on
its scallop cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everyone _ including me _ is tempted to eat the
caviar solo. But show restraint. If you break down the tower and
swirl the caviar into the soup, you'll be rewarded with a little of
every luxurious flavor in every spoonful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAULIFLOWER AND LEEK SOUP WITH SEA SCALLOPS AND OSETRA CAVIAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, peeled and finely diced
</P>
<P>
   2 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, cut into
rounds, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   1 large head cauliflower, cored and cut into florets
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 large sea scallops, preferably diver-harvested
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce osetra caviar.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a stockpot over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of
oil. Add onion and leeks, and saute until vegetables soften but do
not color, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cauliflower and stock, and bring to
a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 3 minutes, then spoon out 3
large cauliflower florets and 12 rounds of leek. Set leeks aside;
slice cauliflower into [-inch-thick slices; reserve for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   2. Simmer soup until cauliflower is tender, about 18 minutes.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Working in batches, puree
soup in a blender or food processor; set aside, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat
remaining 1 teaspoon of oil. Season reserved cauliflower slices
with salt and pepper to taste. Saute until lightly browned on both
sides, then set aside and keep warm. Season scallops with salt and
pepper, and add to pan. Saute until golden brown on the outside and
medium-rare inside, about 2 minutes a side.
</P>
<P>
   4. Reheat soup if necessary, and swirl in the butter. Divide
leek rounds and cauliflower slices among four warm soup bowls,
mounding vegetables in center of each bowl. Ladle soup around
vegetables. Top each mound with a scallop and a spoonful of caviar.
Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Bad taste at Sunday lunch
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ What with my wife out of town, I stopped by one
of the nice family restaurants hereabouts for Sunday lunch. I
arrived just in time to join the church crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time, too, as it turned out, for a sermon. The fellow in
the group next to my table was well into his message of the day. I
couldn't help but listen, try as I might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got friends _ good friends _ who are on their way to
hell, no two ways about it. I keep telling them and telling them.
And they keep saying that one of these days they'll do something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well.'' Here he paused for effect. ``One of these days it's
gonna be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a general murmur of agreement all around. But
something about the fellow's tone bothered me. It was not so much
one of concern as an impending I-told-you-so.
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along ...
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the church might have thought I'm a racist 'cause I
objected to that black boy coming to our services. Well (pause)
they thought wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the fact he was coming to church that bothered me.
No-sir-ree. It was THE REASON he was coming that bothered me. And
that reason, as we all know, was to get to meet white girls.''
</P>
<P>
   I was just picking at my food at this point. I couldn't imagine
what in the world had happened to my appetite.
</P>
<P>
   The next part of the sermon heartened me, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those Baptists. Just look at the mess they've gotten
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a Baptist, I was glad to hear that he wasn't one of us. As
for the mess, who knows what he was referring to. Baptists are in
one or another so often it's difficult to keep count.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ecumenical critique continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why the Catholics can't ever get anything
accomplished? I could tell 'em if they asked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked but he went on anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is, they need to stop praying to the Virgin Mary and
start praying to the Man upstairs instead, uh-huh, and then maybe
they'd get somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing, I attend vespers on occasion with Catholic friends.
I've yet to hear a prayer offered up to Mary. But maybe I'm not
paying good attention.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this closing word, which I caught only in passing:
</P>
<P>
   ''... and for the life of me I don't know how those Jehovah's
Witnesses can stand themselves. All they ever do is go around
criticizing other religions.''
</P>
<P>
   By then I'd finished my meal and was on my way out when I
realized I'd forgotten to leave a tip. I arrived back at my table
just in time for the benediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heresy, heresy,'' he was declaring, for whatever reason I
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Under my breath, I couldn't help from joining in:
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen, brother. Amen!''

   Using gingerbread, rather than granite, anyone can be a Donald
Trump or even a Stanford White this season. And many are trying.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, just for fun, employees of the World
Monument Fund have built a landmark building in gingergread. Last
year, it was Hagia Sofia in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the Municipal Art Society, the group has asked
15 teams of architects and designers to create structures like the
arch in Washington Square, the Chrysler Building and a 1713 Russian
Orthodox church, Kizhi Pogost in northern Russia, with 21 onion
domes.
</P>
<P>
   The models were sold at a benefit auction Tuesday night. Some of
them will remain on display all week at the Municipal Art Society,
457 Madison Avenue (51st Street).
</P>
<P>
   Chefs have also taken up gingerbread architecture. A team of
Restaurant Associate chefs, with Susanna Lazzari of La Guli Pastry
Shop in Astoria, Queens, have reproduced five 18th- and
19th-century New York region churches in gingerbread, including the
1873 First Methodist Church in Red Bank, N.J., and the 1863
Riverdale Presbyterian Church, designed by James Renwick.
</P>
<P>
   They will be on display through New Year's weekend at the
American Festival Cafe, 20 West 50th Street, from 7:30 a.m. to 11
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Winston's Fifth Avenue town house has been reproduced in
gingerbread by Jacques Torres of Le Cirque 2000 and decorated with
a $2 million diamond wreath necklace. It's on display at the
jewelry shop, 718 Fifth Avenue (56th Street). The necklace will be
sold to the highest bidder (gingerbread included). A portion of the
sum will go to a charity selected by the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street), is selling
gingerbread birdhouses, each about 12 inches high, for $65. And
Coco Cafe, 7 East 59th Street, has gingerbread ornaments for the
home. They are $5.50 each or $30 for six.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want gingerbread houses that look like their own
homes, Rebecca Russell will create them, with the help of a
photogra0h, starting at $200. She also has prefabricated houses
starting at $25. Her number is (212) 255-7530.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in making a gingerbread house can buy a kit at
Eli's Manhattan, 1411 Third Avenue (80th Street), and at the
Vinegar Factory, 431 East 91st Street, for $14.99. And a roll of
Maury's gingerbread, with enough dough to slice and bake a
10-by-15-inch sheet, is $4.99 at City Bakery (22 East 17th Street)
and in some supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Three rolls make a modest cottage. After making it, you get to
nibble away at it. It will bring out your inner termite.

TOM ROBBINS IS ANYTHING BUT HALF ASLEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Tom Robbins, author of ``Another
Roadside Attraction''?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.B., Keller, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Robbins is working on a new novel, his first since 1994's
``Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas,'' but neither a publication date nor
title has been announced. The 62-year-old writer has taken up to
six years between new novels since his first, ``Another Roadside
Attraction,'' was published in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Robbins read excerpts of his new book at a Washington
writers' conference. Robbins, who begins his novels without knowing
where they will end, had written more than 500 pages at the time of
the reading.
</P>
<P>
   To send him a letter, write to Tom Robbins, Union of Mad
Scientists, Box 338, LaConner, WA 98257. You also can send e-mail
to Robbins in care of his publisher, Bantam Doubleday Dell, at
bddweb(at)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did ``Grace Under Fire'' go off the air?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.R., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The ABC sitcom ended production in February after five
seasons. Only 14 of a planned 25 episodes had been completed for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace Under Fire,'' led by stand-up comedian Brett Butler, was
a Top 10 show for most of its first three years. It fell to No. 62
in its last year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the blame for the show's abrupt demise was placed on
Butler, who had sought drug treatment during a previous season,
according to reports in USA Today and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to suspend production on `Grace Under Fire' so
that Brett may have time to resolve personal issues,'' the show's
production company, Carsey-Werner, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Stanford's mascot a Cardinal with no ``s'' instead of
the Cardinals?
</P>
<P>
   _ W.D., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Cardinal is singular because it refers to a color rather than
birds or Catholic Church officials.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford adopted Cardinal as its athletic nickname in 1972 to
replace Indians. The change was prompted by concerns that the
Indians name and a mascot caricature were insensitive to Native
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford teams were called the Cardinals until 1930. The
school's mascot now is The Tree, which has been a symbol of the
school since its founding.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLES PRESERVED IN A VICTORIAN'S LENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They were stuffed into an old trunk in the
Bermondsey antiques market in London, south of the Thames, when an
Irish collector and historian named Sean Sexton came across them
one morning in 1981. His eye, more practiced than most, told him
immediately that he had stumbled upon a rare visual harvest _ a
cornucopia of hundreds of ravishing photographs of fruits, flowers
and mundane vegetables, magically transformed into art.
</P>
<P>
   Posed against neutral backgrounds, squashes and celery and
potatoes sat for their portraits at the turn of the century,
captured on glass plates by the camera of Charles Jones. His name
or initials and the precise names of each variety were recorded on
the backs of the gold-toned prints _ fine Dickensian names like
Veitch's Autumn Giant cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   But who was Jones? And when did he live?
</P>
<P>
   Sexton hadn't a clue, but he bought the lot for a pittance.
Eventually, a small part of his trove was shown on British
television, and Shirley Sadler, Charles Jones' granddaughter, saw
the program and came forward with a few scant biographical details.
Jones was a professional gardener, born in 1866 in the grimy
Midlands borough of Wolverhampton. He worked most of his life for
wealthy landowners, notably at Ote Hall, in Sussex, and died in
1959.
</P>
<P>
   None of his negatives appear to have survived; Mrs. Sadler
recalls having seen as a child some of the plates in his garden,
propped up like little tents to protect tender plants from the
early-spring cold.

   Jones' prints are beginning to enter museum collections, and
dealers in New York (the Pace Wildenstein MacGill Gallery) and
London have sold some to private collectors. This fall, a selection
of images _ sharp, spare, almost supernaturally detailed,
reflecting long exposure times _ was on show at the M.H. de Young
Memorial Museum here, and they will be appearing at other museums
around the United States as soon as arrangements can be completed,
according to Robert Flynn Johnson, the curator of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jones' fervent latter-day admirers is the restaurateur
Alice Waters, whose unceasing search for pristine produce helped to
define her Berkeley establishment, Chez Panisse, as a shrine of
California cooking. In a book published to accompany the de Young
show, ``Plant Kingdoms: The Photographs of Charles Jones''
(Smithmark, $24.98), she writes, ``Any cook with a passion for pure
and fresh ingredients must be grateful that these photographs have
been rescued from obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the stars of the book and exhibition are a pair of pods
full of peas as opalescently beautiful as any pearls, plump melons
whose veins trace patterns as complex as spiders' webs,
strawberries so voluptuous that you expect them to start dripping
juice at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Grand Duke plums arranged so that they reminded
me of the medals on a duke's tunic, currants shimmering alluringly
in cunningly contrived light, seven runner beans drawn up at
attention, turnips and beets and radishes trimmed and scrubbed to
within inches of their young lives, and a humble Brown Globe onion
invested with all the nobility of a Cezanne still life.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, like the onion, only one fruit or vegetable is
shown. But often Jones arranged geometrical groups: a trio of leeks
stout as oaks, pyramids of cabbages and cauliflowers, an octet of
dark strangely forbidding tomatoes. Sometimes he arranged his
homely subjects in bold diagonals to add drama, as in his portraits
of clusters of long-stemmed turnips.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly simple, even naive, the pictures were in fact staged
with the instinctive guile of a modern merchandiser who knows
whether to display a single striking object, a shelf-full or an
entire cabinet-full.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the curator, was introduced to Sexton, and hence to the
work of Charles Jones, by a dealer in another London antique
market, the one on Portobello Road. In an interview, he theorized
that Jones had made the photographs in the hope of selling them for
use on seed packets and, rebuffed, had put them aside and gone back
to work with rake and trowel.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that they were made at the turn of the
century, two generations before the American Edward Weston and the
Czech Josef Sudek, among others, began focusing their lenses on the
striking shapes and patterns in the fruits and vegetables that we
eat every day, usually without the slightest thought for where they
came from or their natural beauty.

 &HT;    Williamsburg puts on finery with celebration fit for 1774
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Va._ Christmas arrived in the Colonial capital on
a beautiful July day _ or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   As 18th-century-style troubadors sang of wassailing on
snow-covered ground, temperatures peaked near 80 degrees during the
Grand Illumination weekend that climaxed Sunday night with stirring
fife and drum corps concerts and booming fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday afternoon, crowds estimated at 30,000 had flooded
into the173-acre living history village known as Colonial
Williamsburg, where it's always 1774.
</P>
<P>
   They ambled up and down the mile-long Duke of Gloucester Street
to view the 18th-century style decorations _ all natural, including
pine boughs, cones, dried pods, pomegranates, pineapples, lemons,
limes and apples. And they awaited dark when candles would glow
from windows of the more than 500 restored or re-created public
buildings, houses, taverns and trade shops.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, the buzz was the unseasonably warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   How hot was it?
</P>
<P>
   It was so hot most folks opted for summer picnic attire, and
those who insisted on wearing their favorite Christmas sweaters
looked positively wilted.
</P>
<P>
   It was so hot you wondered if the apples on the della robia
wreaths on doors might bake.
</P>
<P>
   It was so hot one carriage driver swore it had been cooler back
in July.
</P>
<P>
   And at the beverage stands that had been set up to serve the
crowds, icy cold bottles of water far outsold libations such as
steaming cider and cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the heat, most seemed happy to be a part of the
throng.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes family from Annapolis, Md. _ all dressed in shorts
mom threw in the car at the last minute _ were taking advantage of
the balmy conditions. Colleen Hughes watched her husband, Harold,
and children Kelsey, 8, and Cameron, 4, frolic with a glider
airplane on a sloping field near the power magazine across from the
Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Christmas and it looks like Christmas, but it
doesn't feel like Christmas,'' she says. ``But it's sooo glorious.
We think of it as a Christmas gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Fourth of July, Christmas _ especially the
weekend of Grand Illumination, always the first Sunday in December
_ is the busiest time of the year for Colonial Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   During the past weekend, there was no room at the Inn. That is
the Williamsburg Inn, as well as the Lodge, Woodlands and
Governor's Inn, the group of Colonial Williamsburg-owned hotels.
They were booked solid months ago, and by Friday every nearby
lodgings had no vacanies.
</P>
<P>
   Through the remainder of the holiday season, it will be
difficult but not impossible to find a place to stay. Reservations
at both Colonial Williamsburg lodgings in the historic area and the
many motels and hotels within a few miles are limited. You'll have
a much better chance if you travel midweek.
</P>
<P>
   In the Visitors Center and other ticket venues, the Sold Out
signs had gone up over most of the special day and evening programs
such as Holiday Decorations Walking Tours, Holiday Lanthorn
(lantern) Tours of Trade Shops and ``Dance, Our Dearest Diversion''
at the Capitol. Carriage rides sold out for the entire day by 10:30
a.m. Saturday and weren't even offered Sunday because so many
pedestrians were expected. Lines to tour the most popular historic
sites such as the Governor's Palace were even longer than usual.
Some visitors reported waiting up to an hour to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   Programs will remain in high demand through Jan. 3. But keep in
mind that you can enjoy the decorations and the historic ambience
even if you don't take part in the special programs.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, there are no lines at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller
Folk Art Center, featuring its annual holiday exhibition, ``Toys
and Joys,'' or at the DeWitt Wallace Gallery, featuring ``Treasure
Quest: Great Silver Collections of Colonial Williamsburg'' and
``Furniture of the American South.''
</P>
<P>
   And while you may find that ticketed dinner events and musical
programs _ such as the wonderful ``Profound Joy,'' traditional
music and song presented by acoustic soloist Timothy Seaman _ are
sold out, wandering entertainers pop up on the streets and in the
taverns.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a table in one of the historic area's taverns _
Christiana Campbell's, King's Arms and Shields _ was a challenge
for those without reservations on Grand Illumination weekend and
will continue to be. Waits were long for Chownings _ the only
tavern to offer first-come, first-serve seatings. Even Trellis, a
popular restaurant in Merchant's Square, adjacent to the historic
area, turned the hungry away (unless they wished to wait for a 9:30
p.m. seating).
</P>
<P>
   The key to enjoying Grand Illumination weekend in Colonial
Williamsburg is planning ahead. A year ahead isn't a bad idea. A
desk clerk at Williamsburg Lodge said some people come every year
and make their next year's reservations when they check out.
</P>
<P>
   But for regulars such as Georgia and Vince Cassano of Virginia
Beach, 50 miles away, the inconveniences are worth it. They didn't
need overnight lodging, but they couldn't snag a parking place
nearer than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   After the fireworks ended, they stood near _ but not too near _
a roaring bonfire, drinking in the festive scene as a ladies' choir
sang ``Walking in a Winter Wonderland'' on the Courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been to some (illuminations) when it was so cold we wore
hooded coats and gloves and brought wool blankets and sat real
close together and were still freezing,'' says Vince Cassano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love the Colonial period,'' says Georgia Cassano.
``There's something about it that is just magic.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there:
</P>
<P>
   AirTran is offering a special sale of $49 each way to Newport
News/Williamsburg through Thursday; otherwise, it's $59 each way on
a 14-day advance purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tickets: The best deal is a Patriot's Pass, which is good for
one year. Cost is $34 for adults; $19, children. Includes
orientation walk, history walks, all exhibits and museums, and
discount on evening events (except during the holiday season).
One-and two-day passes are also available.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Staying over: The Colonial Williamsburg lodgings are heavily
booked through the rest of the month, but there is limited
availability, primarily on weekdays. Call 1-800-447-8679. (This
number is also for dining and ticketed program reservations.) For
lodging outside the historic area, call the Williamsburg Hotel &AMP;
Motel Association at 1-800-899-8462 or check online at
http://www.williamsburg.com/index.html
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dining: The taverns in the historic area are the most fun
places to eat, because you'll not only dine on historically
inspired dishes by candlelight (at night), but you'll be
entertained by performers who stroll from room to room. Our
favorite is King's Arms Tavern, where the specialty is ``Mrs.
Vobe's Dinner,'' including the most unusual but very tasty peanut
soup, pan seared chicken, Smithfield ham with a raisin currant
sauce, cornbread dressing and pecan pie. (The roast pork ``game of
the day'' entree was also a winner as was the lamb.) Other options
include Christiana Campbell's Tavern, Shield's Tavern and
Chowning's Tavern. Reservations: 1-800-447-8679.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Planning ahead: Call 1-800-447-8679 to request a copy of
``Your Official Guide to Christmas Past'' for 1998 and indicate
that you want to receive a mailing as soon as tickets for 1999
holiday programs are scheduled. As Christmas is considered peak
season, it's not too early to go ahead and secure a room for next
year. You'll have to guarantee the reservation, but you'll be set.
The priciest accommodations are at Williamsburg Inn (in the
$300-plus range), followed by Williamsburg Lodge ($200-plus) and
Woodlands and Governor's Inn ($100-plus). Ask about packages, but
don't anticipate any ``deals.''
</P>

SOME PHRASES NEVER GET WORN-OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike clothing, where everything old is new again, verbal
expressions, particularly slang, usually become extinct long before
the generation that coined them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I never hear anyone shouting ``Power to the
people!'' or ``Way to go, Daddy-0!'' anymore. When was the last
time you heard someone utter the words ``Make love, not war'' or
``Thank you. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, scratch that last one. That phrase isn't obsolete yet, but
it is definitely on the endangered-sentences list.
</P>
<P>
   However, as a parent, I miss one expression most of all.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when your children were young and just starting to
assert their independence? I can recall so many occasions when I
tried to help my toddlers with a task and they told me, ``I can do
it.'' No matter how big a rush I was in or how much they were
struggling, they wouldn't allow me to assist them. Even now, I'm
having flashbacks of little shoes on the wrong foot and shirts
buttoned awry. When he was 3, my son put his pants on backward and
insisted on wearing them that way all day.
</P>
<P>
   That reminds me of a joke that I heard once: You know it's time
to go on a diet when you put your pants on backward and they fit
better.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after much tongue biting and hand wringing, I finally
saw my kids reach the point where they could indeed do it and do it
well. They mastered the fine art of using a spoon, knife, and fork.
We're still working on chewing with our mouths closed, however.
When they select their clothes and dress themselves, everything
actually matches.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we've come a long way but in the process, something got
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   What ever happened to, ``I can do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, when I say, ``I need for someone to take out the garbage,''
no one volunteers, ``I can do it!''
</P>
<P>
   When I ask whose turn it is to do the dishes, I'm never told,
``I can do it!''
</P>
<P>
   My car is sitting in the driveway covered in mud, but when I
suggested that the boys wash it for me, one of them said, ``I think
the weatherman said it's going to rain tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then never mind,'' I replied sarcastically. ``I wouldn't want
you guys to get wet. You might catch a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Their solemn response was familiar:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Mom. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated.''
</P>

OLIVE OIL FAD SPREADS, AND SO DO THE PRODUCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBBY MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They stand in a huddle, sniffing tiny cups. They
take small sips, rolling the liquid over their tongues and sucking
in a bit of air to develop the flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruity, with a peppery finish,'' says one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buttery, pleasantly bitter,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well-balanced with herbal flavors and a nice assertiveness,''
chimes in one more.
</P>
<P>
   Good lord. Not another wine tasting. That is so '80s.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's an olive oil tasting, and it's all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   California is in the throes of another food revolution,
reminiscent of the boutique vineyard explosion that put California
winemaking on the world map in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Little artisan grower-producers of condiment-quality olive oils
are popping up all over the place, growing from three or so in 1990
to more than 50 today.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past few years, 1,000 new olive trees have been
planted in California. Robert Mondavi has plans to plant as many as
2,000 trees on acreage recently cleared of grapes.
</P>
<P>
   What it all means is that we're in for a whole new breed of
cocktail party bore, the olive oil snob.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the vocabulary is developing, and it's not just ``extra
virgin'' (which means first pressing) anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freerun'' (the oil that drips from the paste, without further
extraction techniques). ``Stone mill vs. hammer mill'' (traditional
granite wheel vs. enclosed metal mechanical crusher).
``Unfiltered.'' ``Olio nuovo.'' Go ahead. Join the party chat.
</P>
<P>
   These and other terms turn up in a proliferation of new books on
olives, oils and oil making that have hit the shelves. Every foodie
magazine this year has carried full features on the stuff. You
could go blind prowling through the Internet, flitting from Web
site to Web site devoted to olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can go take a look and a taste or two, right now.
</P>
<P>
   December is high season for olive harvesting, and since the oil
ideally should be pressed within 24 hours of picking, it's a busy
time in the mills.
</P>
<P>
   At Mill Valley's Frantoio restaurant and olive oil mill last
week, Ridgely Evers and his wife, Colleen McGlynn, oversaw the
pressing of 2 1/2 tons, just one day's harvest of their 4,500 olive
trees in Healdsburg for their Da Vero label. They expect to produce
in the neighborhood of 600 gallons of oil, up from 25 gallons their
first year in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The olive harvesting season runs from late October to March,
depending on weather and desired degree of ripeness, and Evers and
McGlynn's ranch is now close to completely harvested.
</P>
<P>
   They found an empty container and brought a few ounces of the
freshly pressed oil to the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike wine, once olive oil is pressed, it's a finished
product,'' Evers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes out of the spigot, it's done,'' McGlynn agreed,
drizzling some of the stunningly green, startlingly pungent olio
nuovo over her garbanzo bean soup. ``It needs no further
manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole trick to making a good olive oil, then, is simply
using good olives. And getting the oil out of them as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Off the tree, olives are susceptible to mildew. A bruised olive
might begin to rot.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to have a mill nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Frantoio (named for the Italian word for olive mill), opened
three years ago to capitalize on the emerging popularity of olive
oil and Tuscan-style cooking in California. The restaurant produces
its own line of olive oil, and makes the mill available to other
growers such as Evers and McGlynn to crush olives _ pits and all,
by the way _ for independent labels.
</P>
<P>
   Other mills have come into being as the need has arisen, some
even closer to the olive orchards.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Gregory Reisinger, president and general
manager of B.R. Cohn's Olive Hill oil company, drove a truckload of
petite picholine olives _ which mere moments before had been
dangling from limbs in the Sonoma sun _ 2 miles to a mill in Glen
Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have to take them to Modesto,'' he said. ``We'd
have to wait until we had picked enough to be worth the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1992, when vintner Bruce Cohn first made good on his
``threat'' to make oil from the 500 neglected 120-year-old olive
trees that dotted his vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Cohn and a cooperative of 14 investors, including
Chalone, Lila Jaeger, Iron Horse and Spectrum Naturals, established
the Olive Press to accommodate the pressing needs of oil producers
in the area, many of whom, like Cohn, were winemakers who had olive
trees on their property.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper heiress Nan McEvoy went them one better. Upon learning
that the Petaluma ranch property she purchased in 1990 was strictly
zoned for agricultural use, she planted 11,000 olive trees and had
a state-of-the-art olive press built right on the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get interested in food, it kind of takes over,'' she
said last month during the ranch's fourth annual harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frantoio and the Olive Press, McEvoy's mill is available
for crushing olives of other growers. The cost to the customer
depends on the quantity of olives and the method used. The classic
granite wheel and painstaking sinolea oil extraction are more
expensive than the modern metallic hammer mill and mechanical
separation. Both are used at the McEvoy Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The Olive Press uses only the hammer mill method; Frantoio uses
only the granite wheel and traditional mat pressing. Of the various
approaches, Reisinger said, ``The best technology is the one you've
invested in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the method, the experience is exhilarating. It's loud,
aromatic and, in some cases, slippery. Machinery rumbles. The air
smells intensely green and fruity as the newborn oil dribbles into
holding vats. Oil makers sample the fresh unfiltered stuff, judging
body, color and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Reisinger coughed once or twice when the peppery single-varietal
picholine oil hit the back of his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something people say in the industry,'' Evers said with
a laugh. ``A `one-cough, a two-cough or a three-cough' oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Evers blends four Italian olive varieties to achieve a
Tuscan-style balance. He selected his trees by finding the grower
of an Italian oil he admired and importing saplings to his
Healdsburg ranch.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy uses the same four Italian varieties, in about the same
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Other producers use different varieties and blends, even
extracting oil from humble mission and manzanilla olives _ ``eating
olives,'' you might call them.
</P>
<P>
   Still others are resurrecting long-forgotten orchards. And new
varieties are being test-farmed in 10 California locations,
according to Reisinger, past president of the 7-year-old California
Olive Oil Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern right now with some of the plantings is a
focus on Italian varietals,'' he said. ``I would like to see French
varietals, Spanish varietals. I think that's what will put us on
the map.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``us,'' Reisinger means all California gourmet olive oil
producers. It's a friendly community.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about the olive oil industry is how people will
share their ideas and their experiences,'' he said. ``Anything that
benefits one person benefits the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   California olive oil accounts for no more than a tenth of a
percent of the world's olive oil at present. Boutique olive oil is
expensive, running in the neighborhood of $20 for 12 ounces, and is
not yet a profitable endeavor for most of its manufacturers, many
of whom came into the field with fortunes made elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``To buy property in Sonoma just to produce olives would make no
sense financially,'' Reisinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, who moonlights as manager of a rock band, tells his
version of an old joke: ``You know how to make a small fortune in
olive oil? Start with a large one.''

A CONNOISSEUR OF WINE, FOOD, PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Louis P. Daniel's death on Oct. 29 at age 77 did not
really end an era in New York restaurant life; that happened years
ago. But it did bring back a host of memories, especially for wine
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, Daniel owned Le Chambertin, a French
restaurant at 348 West 46th Street. To its regulars, Le Chambertin
was a special place. Daniel, known to all of them by his first
name, was a hands-on restaurateur, constantly moving from the front
door to the bar to the kitchen to the customers' tables. Few of his
customers were famous, but he knew many by name.
</P>
<P>
   It was not by accident that Daniel, a Breton, named his
restaurant after one of Burgundy's most famous vineyards. He was
passionate about wine. He knew every bottle in the converted coal
bin that was Le Chambertin's cellar and, long before computers, he
knew what he sold and exactly what he wanted to buy. He could and
would terrorize hapless wine salesmen who knew less than he thought
they should.
</P>
<P>
   This was unusual because French restaurateurs were rarely wine
enthusiasts. Even famous restaurants often depended on wine
salesmen to choose the wines, keep their cellars stocked and put
together their wine lists. Some still do.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did I learn about wines from Daniel, but I learned how
they were sold. Before it was fashionable, he offered wine dinners.
Looking through his cellar, he would find wines that had reached
their peak, then offer them as part of special dinners.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one in the early 1970s that included a bottle each of
Chateau Margaux 1953 and Chambolle-Musigny 1969. The price for four
people: $125.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar years and well into the 1970s, Le Chambertin was
one of many small French restaurants in the west 40s and 50s. They
were fashioned after working-class bistros in France and were run
mostly by Normans and Bretons, many of whom had worked on French
ships. With the French Line piers only a few blocks away, the West
Side became a small but thriving French community.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel came to New York in 1950 from Bermuda, where he had been
part of a team of cooks, waiters and waitresses that reopened the
Castle Harbour Hotel there. Most of the Bermuda crowd migrated to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel had become involved in the restaurant business as a
teen-ager, when he worked in restaurants in Paris. In 1942, during
the German occupation of the city, he was taken prisoner and sent
to Germany to work in war plants.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, rocking with laughter, he would tell how he sneaked
from the workers' barracks one Christmas Eve, stole a pig from the
Germans' kitchen and cooked it for his fellow prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Paris after the war, he worked at the brasserie that the
author Georges Simenon used as the model for the Brasserie
Dauphine, a favorite of his fictional Inspector Maigret.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York, Daniel worked for several French restaurants,
including Les Pyrenees, before opening Le Chambertin in the late
1950s. He also bought four acres in Phoenicia, N.Y., in an area
known then as now, as the French Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   There, on weekends and vacations, he was the consummate farmer,
and would fill his station wagon with fresh produce to serve his
customers during the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner at Le Chambertin was a treat, but dinner at his home in
the Catskills was always something special. Often, there was game
he had shot, and always, vegetables from the garden. As for the
wine, he would emerge from his cellar grinning happily and carrying
a magnum of Burgundy, perhaps a 1959 Gevrey Chambertin or a 1971 Le
Corton. ``Not so bad for a country dinner, eh?,'' he would say. No,
it wasn't, particularly after the white wines, Puligny-Montrachet
or Meursault Perrieres, which had started the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel closed Le Chambertin on December 31, 1975, worn out, he
said, from trying to maintain a classic French restaurant in a city
where fast food seemed to be taking over. But retirement was not
for him. At the age of 55, he became a wine salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring warnings that his old friends _ restaurant owners and
bartenders _ might be less congenial when he came calling with his
wine list, he built a successful second career, selling in
Manhattan and the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a moderately priced French restaurant like Le
Chambertin, with a staff of 20, all of them French except the
busboy, and a classic menu and a decent wine list, is only a fond
memory now.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, New York is hardly lacking in good restaurants. But
how many of them or their owners will evoke similar memories 20
years from now?

   Batard-Montrachet 1994, Louis Jadot. About $100.
</P>
<P>
   The recent auction of 1998 Burgundies in Beaune, France, made it
clear that prices for these wines were not going to drop in the
foreseeable future. Which means that if you like great white
Burgundy, you are going to have to pay dearly to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Batard-Montrachet is a great white Burgundy. About half of the
vineyard is in the town of Puligny-Montrachet and half in
Chevalier-Montrachet, and it all lies just to the east of the
Montrachet vineyard, which is generally considered the finest white
wine vineyard in France.
</P>
<P>
   Maison Jadot owns no vines in Batard-Montrachet but purchases
grapes or wine from others who do. Jadot's wine maker, Jacques
Lardiere, blends them into a white wine with exceptional
concentration and elegance.
</P>
<P>
   It is equal to and occasionally surpasses the Batards of some
smaller producers who are known particularly for their white
Burgundies. Expensive? Yes, but no more than many first-growth
Bordeaux produced in much larger quantities. This is a wine for
very special occasions.

SIR ALEC GUINNESS OFFERS A LESS-THAN RETIRING TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you need a stocking stuffer for the reader on
your list, pick up a copy of Alec Guinness' delightful ``My Name
Escapes Me _ The Diary of a Retiring Actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now available in paperback from Penguin Books ($12.95, 198
pages), the diary looks back at 18 months in Guinness' life from
January 1995 to June 1996. An homage in the form of a preface is
written by author John le Carre, whose character George Smiley was
brilliantly brought to life on TV by Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   Le Carre begins by saying, ``He is not a comfortable companion.
Why should he be? The watching child inside the 80-year-old man has
still found no safe harbors or easy answers. The deprivations and
humiliations of three quarters of a century ago are unresolved. It
is as though he were still striving to appease the adult world
about him; to winkle love from it, to beg its smile, to deflect or
harness its monstrosity. ... God forbid that I should paint him as
a stern man. Alec's bubbling laughter and good fellowship, when
they come, are all the more miraculous for the uncertain weather
that preceded them.''
</P>
<P>
   The man Sir Alec shares with the world is many men _ a devoted
husband, caring father, an aging actor coping with the ills of old
age, a modern man who takes swipes at politicians and fools (not
necessarily in that order), a reader with a wicked sense of humor,
a traveler who inhales the world around him.
</P>
<P>
   Living outside London, Guinness and his wife, Merula, deal with
everyday living _ feeding the goldfish in the pond, selecting which
wine to pour with dinner, picking the best of the evening's
offerings on television, which book to take to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some of Guinness' musings:
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Day, 1995: ``A sudden little blizzard made us too
apprehensive to drive the couple miles to Mass in the evening, so I
threw a log on the fire and mixed a lethal cocktail called, I
believe, the Claridge (half-and-half gin and French vermouth, with
a good dash of Cointreau and apricot brandy). That kept our eyes
slightly unfocused on the TV production of ``Cold Comfort Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Feb. 14: ``A Valentine card in a tiny illiterate hand.
Surely I can't have sent a card to myself. Now that Dr. Alzheimer
looks as if he may be extending a welcome to me I can no longer be
sure of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, June 7: ``Took delivery of a splendid new Wheel-Horse
motor mower called Toro. It seems capable of doing almost
everything but cook dinner. It looks lovely at the moment but I see
an alarming glint in the lady gardener's eye _ I think she is
imagining herself winning Le Mans or Monaco.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Oct. 25: ``On Monday night the heavens fell; or,
rather, Merula did, heavily, tripping on a paving stone. She has
broken her right hip and was in great pain, which she bore with her
usual fortitude. ... She is being operated on as I write. ... The
hospital has just telephoned to say all went well.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Jan. 6, 1996: ``When I played Malvolio in a poor TV
`Twelfth Night,' Larry (Olivier) came to the final run-through ...
Just before we went on the air he said to me, `Marvelous, old cock!
I never realized Malvolio could be played as a bore.' Such-like
encouragements were part of his repertoire. Yet I was fond of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, May 6: Ealing Studios never succeeded in killing me in
spite of some quite good tries, the first of which was during the
making of `The Lavender Hill Mob.' Rehearsing a brief scene in
which Stanley (Holloway) and I were required to escape from the top
of the Eiffel Tower, the director (Charlie Crichton) said, `Alec,
there is a trap door over there _ where it says Workmen Only _ I'd
like you to run to it, open it and start running down the spiral
staircase. Stanley will follow.' So I did as asked. A very dizzying
sight to the ground greeted me. But I completed half a spiral
before I noticed that three feet in front of me the steps suddenly
ceased _ broken off. I sat promptly down where I was and cautiously
started to shift myself back to the top, warning Stanley to get out
of the way. `What the hell are you doing?' the director yelled.
`Down. Further down.' `Further down is eternity,' I called back.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness has always been one of my favorite actors. He is now
one of my favorite writers. ``My Name Escapes Me'' is a charming
glimpse into the life of a complex yet simple man _ sometimes
cantankerous, often amusing, always bright. I can't think of a
better way to spend a few hours than curled up with this
all-too-brief glimpse into the life of a great actor.

   ``The Red Zone.'' By Tim Green. Warner Books. $24. 325 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth mystery by the former NFL pro is an intriguing look
at the world of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Madison McCall is the top defense lawyer for her Austin, Texas,
firm. When a partner dies, the firm presses her to take on its
sports agency clients, which she balks at. However, when the dead
partner's aide, Chris Pelo, gets his walking papers, McCall agrees
to help him renegotiate the contract of Luther Zorn, an inside
linebacker for the Florida Marauders.
</P>
<P>
   Before the contract is worked out, Marauder owner Evan Chase is
killed, and Zorn is the prime suspect because he was having an
affair with the owner's wife. Next, Zorn's girlfriend disappears,
and evidence linked to Chase's murder is found at her home.
</P>
<P>
   McCall is sure that Zorn is being set up, but by whom and why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Zone'' is one of the better mysteries of the last few
months _ good plot, well-paced, interesting characters, decent
dialogue. And you don't have to be a football fan to enjoy it.

<P>
   ``The Widow Killer.'' By Pavel Kohout. Translated by Neil
Bermel. St. Martin's Press. $24.95. 391 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Kohout's murder mystery, set in Prague in the final months of
the Third Reich, is a good book, but a very difficult one to
navigate because there are two books here. One is a compelling tale
of a sadistic killer; the second is a look at the relationship
between the Czech police and the Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of a German general has been murdered and then
ritualistically carved up. Jan Morava, a young assistant detective
for the Prague police, is given the case. Since the widow was a
German, the Gestapo assigns Irwin Brubeck to the case. But Brubeck
has a second assignment _ to spy on the Czechs so that when the end
of the war nears, the Germans won't be overtaken.
</P>
<P>
   As more widows are butchered, Morava and Brubeck begin to
respect each other. Each man has a romance, but both use their
lovers as bait to lure the killer into a trap. Unfortunately,
Morava's love is killed because the Gestapo did not fulfill its
commitment. Almost crazed, Morava pushes on, and he and Brubeck
learn the killer's name, but they cannot find him. As the Russians
near Prague, the killer joins a rogue group of Czech Revolutionary
Guards and begins killing at random.
</P>
<P>
   Bermel does an excellent job of translating. Kohout offers up a
truly terrific mix of characters in a very good plot. But the moral
dilemmas thrown at the main characters really slow the story down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Widow Killer'' should have been one of the best mysteries
of the year. But Kohout overreaches. A good editor could have made
this work.

   FBN-FALCONS _ ATLANTA _ Even some Falcons players admit that the
press clippings might have something to do with slow starts against
mediocre opponents. So far, the Falcons have managed to overcome
the alarming trend. But that might not wash this week against the
Saints' strong defense. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   GASOUTH _ Georgia Southern has the top-ranked offense in
Division I-AA, but the Eagles will need improved play from their
defense as they continue their chase toward a fifth national
championship. Georgia Southern has allowed 20 or more points in
eight of its last nine games and is allowing a staggering 332 yards
of total offense per game. The Eagles figure to face their biggest
test of the season Saturday in the national semifinals against
Western Illinois, which is averaging 30 points and 400 yards per

   NCAA-SUPREME-COURT _ The NCAA argues before the Texas Supreme
Court Tuesday that its rule allowing forfeiture of games in which a
school played an illegal player would be in jeopardy by a Texas
Tech case. A Tech football player, declared ineligible at the start
of his final season, played every game that season before the
courts got around to hearing his case, then an appeals dismissed
the case. That in effect kept t the NCAA from enforcing the rule _
because the season was over. The decision could be important not
only to college athletics but also to Texas high schools, which
compete under the same type of rule. (McCarthy, Austin
American-Statesman).

   TARVES, Scotland _ It's the time of year in northern Scotland
when gusts of wind send gold and russet leaves climbing the air,
and bales of straw gone gray in the early falling dark stand
sentinel over fields of barley stubble.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, Alexander George Gordon, the Earl of Haddo and
laird of the Haddo Estate, and his manager, Mark Andrew, were in
the staff quarters on the 9,000-acre family property, pulling on
their distinctive navy and white estate tweeds. ``Someone once said
we ended up looking like a herd of zebra,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   First came dark blue stockings with a bright yellow tail at the
top called the garter, then the over-the-knee plus fours called
breeks, finally a matching waistcoat, jacket and flat cap.
</P>
<P>
   Lachy, Lord Haddo's yellow Labrador, sashayed through the door
while other Labs and springer spaniels yelped and swarmed outside.
At a gruff order, they quieted down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we wait all year for,'' Andrew said, stepping
outside and splashing merrily through a puddle.
</P>
<P>
   Late autumn is the time when the brooding pace of country living
picks up in Aberdeenshire, a place of wind-lashed expanses
stretching to horizons dotted with ancient castles and crumbled
towers. The start of the November-to-February pheasant-shooting
season is cause for real excitement. The workers on the estate have
spent months getting ready for the moment, and scores of
well-dressed shooters have pursued their sport here from Austria,
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Far away from here, there is a sense of anticipation, too. ``I
look forward to the fall and get really excited with the start of
the season in Scotland,'' Terrance Brennan, the chef of Picholine
in New York, said over the telephone. For him and an increasing
number of cooks and chefs in the United States, pheasant from
Scotland is the best way to meet a game lover's fancy. Scottish
pheasant spend more than half their lives completely wild, and that
gives them flavor that flightless domestic birds confined in pens
never acquire. The only domestic game allowed to be sold in the
United States is farm raised.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef at Monkey Bar, said that only
Scottish pheasant lets him recreate in New York the game dishes of
his youth in an Austrian village on the Danube. ``Also, there's no
fat in wild game the way there is in farmed birds,'' Gutenbrunner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the season is so early and the birds are still young,
Gutenbrunner said, their meat is paler and milder than it will be
in a few weeks. ``The longer it lives out in the woods, the gamier
it gets,'' he said. ``Just a couple of weeks makes a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And to real pheasant connoisseurs like Gutenbrunner, the gamier
it is the better. ``Even if you taste the best that the U.S. has to
offer, once you try the Scottish pheasant, there is no turning
back,'' Brennan of Picholine said. ``For me, flavor is the most
important thing, and there is no comparison between the gamy taste
of Scottish pheasant and the kind that's been pen raised.'' He said
that Scottish pheasant had flavors that were ``complex,
complicated,'' the kinds that challenge a cook.
</P>
<P>
   This marriage of pheasants flying in Scotland and chefs working
in America was brokered here by a serendipitous coming together of
separate interests _ sportsman, estate owner, processor and
importer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of things in Scotland, it began with tradition. The
custom has always been that a sportsman is entitled to keep a brace
_ two birds _ that he has killed, and the rest belongs to the
estate. A normal day's outing can produce up to 250 birds.
</P>
<P>
   The estate's birds used to be hung for a week to age and then
passed out to workers on the grounds or sold to food merchants.
With the disappearance of the corner butcher and the coming of
supermarkets, the call for pheasant fell away. ``They weren't too
keen on laying out birds with lead shot in them for supermarket
customers,'' Andrew, Lord Haddo's manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting an opportunity, John Bain, the managing partner of Bain
of Tarves Game and Venison Suppliers, created a fleet of
refrigerated trucks and compiled a schedule of times and places of
shoots, so that he could pick up freshly killed game and rush it
the same day to his processing plants. Plucked, cleaned and vacuum
packed, the pheasants are on their way to British supermarkets and
American importers in two days, with a shelf life up to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Now the biggest employer in this rural area, Bain said he'd just
as soon keep his success a secret. ``People think I'm handling 12
birds a week,'' he said, swinging his van around a hedgerowed
corner. ``If they realize how many, they may want to come up here
and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is handling 10,000 pheasant a week for the 12 weeks
of the season ending in February. Twelve thousand of them end up in
the United States through the importer D'Artagnan in Newark, N.J.,
which sells them to restaurant chefs and home cooks.
</P>
<P>
   With food safety such an issue in Britain and the United States,
hygiene controls are strict at Bain's operations. Visitors have to
take off watches or jewelry before donning surgical wraps and
entering the premises. The birds are tracked by documents and
virtually have group passports to make their final journey.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Duncan, the procurement manager, rummaged through a newly
arrived batch of birds to show how they're sorted. ``We look at the
bum first to see that the color is good,'' he said. ``You've got to
see where the shot went in and whether it caused much damage, also
where the dog bit into the pheasant,'' something that happens when
the dog retrieves it.
</P>
<P>
   He looks as well for the spot where the bird hit the ground. ``A
little later in the season, when the ground is frozen, they're more
damaged from their fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The winter also produces fatter birds. ``Imagine it's snowing
outside and you're perched up on a branch,'' Duncan said. ``You'd
tend to eat more, too.'' The birds are graded as A, oven ready; B,
which are good for just their breasts, and ``no value,'' birds that
have an unappealing greenish color.

REFS' MISTAKES COSTLY IN MANY WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On its back page Monday, a New York tabloid
called NFL officials divine.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's a Jets fan,'' the headline in the Post said, after the
men in stripes, working in increasingly mysterious ways, handed the
New York Jets a win over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The league begged to differ. On Monday, finally, belatedly, the
NFL declared its officials far too human.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the New York headquarters came the news that the league
would consider using limited instant replay in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets game Sunday left no choice. The officials, just when
they needed to be on their best behavior, gave Vinny Testaverde a
last-minute touchdown that he never scored.
</P>
<P>
   This was too much, in the week after two respected team owners
paid $50,000 for the luxury of criticizing them, in the week after
officials gave New England more do-overs than a parent teaching a
4-year-old how to play checkers.
</P>
<P>
   It all kept adding up. From Indianapolis to Oakland to Arizona,
everyone had a genuine gripe. This was fast becoming the Season
Through the Looking Glass, heavy on pass-interference
hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the NFL put out the word that the officials weren't
making more mistakes than usual. They had just made a few at the
wrong time _ on an overtime coin toss that robbed Pittsburgh and
two final plays that beat Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But in Monday's instant-replay proposal, the league acknowledged
the obvious _ that errors on last-second plays are less forgivable.
</P>
<P>
   For the playoffs, the plan would allow each team to challenge
one play per half. But the limit would be liberal, allowing a club
to use an extra challenge on any last-minute, deciding play.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of flexibility is fairly out of character for the NFL.
So is the spontaneity behind the replay suggestion. What next?
Dropping the television blackout rule, just because everyone has a
warm spot for Al Davis?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL finally wised up because the only option was sticking
with an argument that defeated itself. The NFL favors the human
element in officiating, with all its flaws. But, in defense of its
crews last week, it tried to strip the soul out of a game's final
plays, pretend that they have no special value.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with that theory, and the word ``clutch'' fades from the
sports vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Mitch Williams a goat for giving up a three-run homer? A
lot of relievers give up three-run homers. Because Williams gave
one up in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 6 in the
Phillies-Blue Jays World Series. His team had a lead before he
threw the pitch, and a long winter after he threw it.
</P>
<P>
   He took away his team's last chance. But at least, he was a
player. When an official does the same thing, it's intolerable.
Human, yes, but still intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   For the NFL, the problem reached critical mass last weekend. The
AFC East standings are now hopelessly warped. The Patriots and Jets
each have a win they don't deserve. The Bills have a loss they
don't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes may not cost anybody a playoff berth in the end.
But here's one small measure of the errors: Doug Flutie's low-ball
contract with Buffalo is laden with incentives. If the Bills finish
over .500, he gets a big salary bump for each additional victory.
His 1999 salary is supposed to be based partly on this season's
earnings. With the bogus defeat against New England, Flutie stands
to lose at least $750,000 in the next 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   For the league as a whole, the losses are intangible, but still
devastating. Consider this snide exchange in the ABC booth Monday
night, when the Green Bay Packers had 3 seconds left against Tampa
Bay, a two-point deficit and no shot at a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a touchdown or bust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe not a touchdown or bust.'' A small laugh. ``There
could be pass interference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's ever seen pass interference called on a Hail Mary?''
Another small laugh. ``I haven't seen it in eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL started this season in a funk, tedium dominating on
every channel. It has recovered magnificently, with the perfection
of the Broncos, the dramatic struggles in Green Bay, the revelation
of Flutie, the revival of Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC East is spectacularly competitive. The NFC is terribly
flawed, but in 13 days, there will be a showdown that no one could
have imagined. Saints vs. Cardinals, with a possible playoff berth
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, more and more games are being decided in the final
seconds. Sports leagues thrive on this sort of suspense, on
``touchdown or bust,'' with no disclaimers needed.

 TARVES: greenish color.

<P>
   The rearing process begins when the season ends in February and
the female birds are lured into cages by food and then put into
fields with cocks. Once in place, pheasants stay put. ``Pheasants
would walk everywhere instead of flying if they could,'' Andrew
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs are laid in late March or April and, aided by incubation,
hatch in May. In the early weeks, the chicks are fed pelletized
food, but within six to eight weeks, their diet includes barley,
wheat and maize from the estate. They are then transferred to
100-square-yard release pens in the woods with room to roam. By 12
weeks they are trying out their newly sprouted flight feathers.
</P>
<P>
   By October, some 9,000 grown pheasants are on the estate. There
seem to be as many skittering across roads and darting around stone
walls as hunkering down in wooded areas, copses or overgrown
cottage ruins. ``Like any of us, they like warm places,'' Lord
Haddo said. They take to the air only when roused, springing from
the ground in bursts of energy that last only eight seconds before
they have to glide to a landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have eight guns and four wives for lunch,'' Lord Haddo
cheerfully told the women in the kitchen, who were cutting up
chicken parts and smoked bacon for the noontime huntsman's pie. The
``guns,'' the invited shooters, were arriving in the driveway,
every one in olive tweeds, a tattersall shirt, game-bird necktie
and insulated wellies, the all-purpose Wellington boots, which have
sheltered the feet of farmers and outdoors people in the British
Isles for generations.
</P>
<P>
   A typical ``driven'' shooting goes to six sites during the day,
with retreats from the chill wind to break into flasks of mulled
wine. At each drive, or spot where birds are driven out, there are
numbered stakes known as pegs, corresponding to the number the
individual shooter has for that drive.
</P>
<P>
   Once they are in place, 20 men known as beaters come up gingerly
behind the birds, waving flags and shaking rough-hewn wooden
rattles. A first-time visitor asked Andrew if it was the tradition
to use blue flags. ``No,'' he confided. ``It's just that fertilizer
sacks come in that color.''
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the beaters' skill not to scare all the birds up
at once, and they scatter from cover and soar over the shooters in
waves. Most make it to the other side of the clearing. Dogs tear
through the brush after fallen birds and bring them back to one of
the five pickers-up, who put them in their side bags.
</P>
<P>
   The cry ``Don't shoot'' goes up if the bird is an owl, a
songbird, a hawk or some other protected species. ``Continental
Europeans will shoot anything that moves,'' Lord Haddo said, taking
his own shot at Britons' favorite targets. Andrew summoned a look
of disgust. ``The French shoot larks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A qualmish question about killing birds came up, and Lord Haddo
turned mildly scornful. ``I would say the expression `birdbrain'
applies perfectly to pheasants,'' he said. ``I'm often amused when
people talk about giving birds their rights. Well, if you gave
pheasants rights, they'd all be in jail for murder and gang rape.
They are ferocious to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The higher the flight, the greater the sporting challenge and
the happier the estate owner. ``Exciting birds,'' Lord Haddo
exclaimed as a clutch rose above the trees. ``It's my challenge to
put as high a bird as possible out. Low birds should not be shot
at. They should be allowed to fly another day.''
</P>
<P>
   At one drive, Lord Haddo quietly told a newcomer whose aim kept
dropping: ``Make sure there's a bit of sky. Otherwise, the beaters
can get anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the beaters feel they've chased all the birds from one
spot, they blow a whistle, and the group moves on to the next
drive. On the Haddo estate, an old British railroad maintenance car
attached to a John Deere tractor transports the keepers. The guns
in their tweeds travel in cars.
</P>
<P>
   As Lord Haddo, 43, strides his grounds, the history of his own
family, one of Britain's oldest, precedes him. Forty thousand of
the original 65,000 acres had to be sold off in the 1920s to
satisfy bad debts, but Lord Haddo is quick to defend the family
honor. ``I stress that it wasn't things like gambling. It was bad
business sense and too much benevolence.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out a low red-brick building in a hollow and said
that is where his great-grandmother raised exotic pheasants. Two
hillsides bear monuments memorializing two ancestors _ one a young
colonel who died in the Battle of Waterloo, the other the fourth
Earl of Aberdeen, who was Britain's prime minister from 1852 to
1855.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Bain of Tarves, Duncan and his workers went through the
messy business of handpicking and cleaning the day's pheasants.
Hearing that his visitors had been on a shoot that morning, Duncan
talked about how much people here love their blustery outdoors, and
he asked excitedly if one of the pickers-up had been a woman with a
black dog.
</P>
<P>
   His visitors nodded yes. ``That's my wife,'' he said. He looked
longingly out the factory window at the swirling gray skies closing
in on a newly harvested barley field and a forest of spruce, pine
and larch. ``She's got a fine, bonny job,'' he said.  &QL;

   WILD SCOTTISH PHEASANT IN A SALT CRUST AND FOIE GRAS SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Kurt Gutenbrunner, Monkey Bar
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 large piece fat back, at least 6 inches by 4 inches by 1 inch
thick
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups salt, plus extra for seasoning
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 male wild Scottish pheasants, breasts removed and skinned and
carcass and legs reserved (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, cut into 1-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 leek, white and light green parts only, in 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 celeriac, cut into 1-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 strips bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   15 white peppercorns, lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   24 juniper berries, lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   \ cup fresh pine needles, rinsed and dried (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons port wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces fresh foie gras (optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. Freeze fat back until firm, then cut four very thin slices
(postcard-size or larger). Set slices aside at room temperature,
and reserve remaining fat back for another purpose.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1{ cups of the salt with the
flour. Add 2 eggs, and mix lightly. Gradually add just enough water
_ { cup to 1 cup _ to make a cohesive dough. Work dough by hand
until smooth. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Chop pheasant carcass and legs
into medium pieces and set aside. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or
casserole over high heat, heat olive oil, and add carrots, leek,
celeriac, bacon and bay leaf. Saute, stirring, for 1 minute. Add
pheasant carcasses and legs, and crushed peppercorns. Continue to
saute until pheasant pieces are lightly seared, about 10 minutes.
Transfer pan to oven, and roast uncovered until the carcass bones
are brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven, cover and set aside
at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   4. Season pheasant breasts with ground white pepper. Sprinkle
both sides of the breasts with about half of the crushed juniper
berries, and the pine needles. Wrap each breast completely in a
slice of fat back.
</P>
<P>
   5. Divide dough into four balls. Roll out each ball to \ to 1/3
inch thick. Place a wrapped pheasant breast on one side of the
dough, and fold the dough over to enclose it completely. Trim
excess dough, and seal edges with a little water. In a small bowl,
beat remaining 2 eggs until blended. Brush outside of the dough
packets with the egg wash. The dough packets may then be
refrigerated for up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place dough packets on a lightly
oiled baking sheet, and bake until an instant-read thermometer
inserted through the dough into the meat reads 135 degrees, 13 to
15 minutes. Remove from oven, and allow packets to rest for 3 more
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. While breasts are baking, prepare foie gras sauce: Place the
pot with the pheasant carcasses over medium heat, and add the port
wine, red wine, chicken stock and cream. Simmer for 15 minutes. Add
remaining crushed juniper berries, and simmer an additional 2 to 3
minutes. Strain sauce, discarding solids. Transfer sauce to a
blender, and add the foie gras. Blend until smooth, about 3
minutes. If necessary, return to a clean pan to reheat just until
hot.
</P>
<P>
   8. To serve, slice around the sides of the dough packets, and
remove the top portion intact. Remove pine needles and juniper
berries, and slice each breast. Place sliced breast on each of four
serving plates, and top each breast with the top of the dough
packet. Serve with foie gras sauce and, if desired, spaetzle or
dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Wild game frequently contains tiny pieces of shot, and it
is not always possible to remove it before cooking. This will not
harm the meat, but caution should be taken when eating.

   ROAST WILD SCOTTISH PHEASANT WITH SWISS CHARD, WILD MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   AND SWEET POTATO-VANILLA PUREE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Terrence Brennan, Picholine
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   2 male wild Scottish pheasants (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons juniper berries, finely ground
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 medium bunches of fresh sage
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
</P>
<P>
   } pound red Swiss chard
</P>
<P>
   1 cup assorted wild mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   \ cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   } cup diced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce slab smoked bacon, sliced thinly into pieces { inch long
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Potato-Vanilla Puree (see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   1. Rinse pheasants and pat dry with paper towels. Rub { teaspoon
of the ground juniper berries into the upper cavity and on the
breast and sides of each pheasant. Season with salt and pepper to
taste. Place one bunch of sage in the cavity of each bird, and
truss the birds with kitchen string. Using 1{ tablespoons of the
butter for each bird, rub the entire outside of each bird with
butter.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place a 12-inch ovenproof saute
pan or roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add grapeseed oil. Add
the birds and sear, turning, until lightly browned on all sides.
Place the pan in the oven, with the birds breast side up. Cook
until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part
of the breast reads 135 degrees (for medium), about 15 minutes.
Place the birds on a rack to rest, for 10 to 12 minutes, and
reserve the pan and drippings.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove stems from Swiss chard leaves, and cut stems into
1{-inch pieces; reserve leaves. In a small saute pan over
medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter, and add
mushrooms. Saute quickly, until mushrooms are lightly browned and
begin to soften; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a small nonreactive saucepan over high heat, bring the
white wine to a boil, and reduce by three-quarters. Add it to the
pan the birds were cooked in, and scrape the bottom of the pan with
a spatula or wooden spoon to deglaze the pan. Add onions and bacon,
and lower heat to medium. Stir until onions are transparent, 3 to 4
minutes. Add Swiss chard stems, and saute until barely tender,
about 4 minutes. Add Swiss chard leaves and chicken broth. Reduce
chicken broth by half. Add mushrooms, and cook an additional 2
minutes. Remove from heat, and whisk in the remaining tablespoon of
butter until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cover and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, carve pheasants, removing the breast meat, legs and
thighs. Debone legs and thighs. Divide mushrooms, Swiss chard and
sauce among four dinner plates. Top with a breast, leg and thigh,
and serve with Sweet Potato-Vanilla Puree.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Wild game frequently contains tiny pieces of shot, and it
is not always possible to remove it before cooking. This will not
harm the meat, but caution should be taken when eating.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET POTATO-VANILLA PUREE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   1} pounds sweet potatoes, scrubbed
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated orange zest, firmly packed
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place whole potatoes on a baking
sheet. Bake, turning two or three times during cooking, until a
fork can pierce them without any resistance, about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Allow potatoes to cool enough to be handled. Split them in
half lengthwise. Using a tablespoon, scoop the pulp into a food
processor; be careful not to include any skin.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a small saucepan, combine the heavy cream and orange zest.
Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the pulp into the pan;
reserve the pod for another use. Place the pan over high heat and
bring to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat. (Optional: The
cream may be allowed to stand for 20 minutes for the flavors to
blend.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Add the cream mixture to the sweet potatoes, and puree for 30
seconds. Scrape down the sides and repeat until the mixture is very
smooth, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If
necessary, cover and then reheat in a preheated 300-degree oven, or
transfer to a microwave-safe dish, and reheat in a microwave oven.
Serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 cups (4 to 6 servings).

 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ I never thought it would be like this.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in my fantasy of the world's greatest jobs _
professional sleeper, professional vacation taker, professional
ice-cream taster _ I never thought the last would include lab
coats, cubicles and green lights.
</P>
<P>
   But it does here at Ben &AMP; Jerry's headquarters, where I'm being
trained by Shawna Parizo, the company's sensory analyst, the person
whose job it is to decide how the ice cream tastes _ and how to
keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parizo, 26, is a serious woman who seems puzzled by my
romantic notions of ice cream. She has no problem remaining a size
4. She refers to the ice cream's ``hedonic rating scale'' in a
purely scientific manner. When she says that the company had to
change the name of Chunky Monkey ice cream in Japan because it was
being taken literally, I laugh. She does not.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parizo's job is a new one, 3 years old. In 1978, when Ben
Cohen and Jerry Greenfield opened their first scoop shop in a
renovated gas station here, they made eight flavors and $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later the business has grown internationally to 11
countries and in 1997 it made $174 million. As Ms. Parizo says:
``Research and development used to consist of Ben and Jerry, but
the company's too big to do it that way anymore. We know our
customer likes a rich and creamy ice cream that's filled with stuff
that's kind of taboo or restricted, like candy and cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parizo's job is twofold: to work with in-house experts and
consumer focus groups to test new flavors (the company creates at
least six a year) and to guarantee continuity in the taste and
quality of flavors that already exist. That includes not only the
ice cream but the ``stuff'' that goes into it, everything from
marshmallow to cookie dough.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 brands are the only ones so far that have been subject
to the full sensory evaluation procedure. Jim Barrett, a food and
beverage analyst at the brokerage firm of Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New
York, says that along with the company's new chief executive, Perry
Odak, and new advertising campaign, the more sophisticated testing
process could account for a rise in sales that amounted to 16
percent in the most recent quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parizo takes me to the Sensory Room, outfitted with window
partitions facing the kitchen. We start with something called a
difference test, using the chocolate sandwich cookies for Mint
Chocolate Cookie ice cream. (The green light disguises the fact
that the colors of the cream filling vary, which should not
influence how I think they taste.)
</P>
<P>
   Difference testing is used when an ice cream's ingredient must
change; in this case the company has switched cookie suppliers. In
another instance _ if, say, Cherry Garcia is made with a different
type of cherry _ ``the juices might bleed differently than what the
consumer already knew,'' Ms. Parizo says, ``and even though the
taste is the same, the consumer might be alarmed by a change in
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   I have been instructed not to eat, chew gum or smoke for one
hour before the tasting, and I sit down with my response form,
ready for action. Ms. Parizo pulls down a partition to block light
from the kitchen and offers a tray with three randomly numbered
paper cups holding cookies. I am told to taste from left to right
and sip water in between, and to identify which cookies are the
same and which different.
</P>
<P>
   Easy. The one in the middle is different. Ms. Parizo nods.
``Once the cookies are in the ice cream, the panelists are not
reliably detecting the difference, which is in the level of fat in
the cream, not the cookie,'' she says. ``The mint has an almost
numbing effect, so we have to taste individual components
separately, to control the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so easy is the job of Ben &AMP; Jerry's descriptive panel _
staff members who volunteer for the job _ which meets at least once
a week to quantify flavors so they can be reproduced. Ms. Parizo
puts a dipstick into a bottle and hands it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use these to learn individual aroma notes,'' she says.
``That is caramel.'' I seem to smell only alcohol. ``Take quick
little bunny sniffs,'' she instructs. ``Now, on a scale of 1 to 15,
we'll rate the intensity of the caramel note, and keep doing that
until we know that a 7 rating of caramel tastes like this, a 3
rating of butter tastes like that. We develop a common language so
our base of knowledge is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, this is really a barrel of laughs, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   She smiles. ``The consumer's taste can be subjective. It's our
tastes that have to be objective. When a product's been launched,
then my job is to guarantee uniformity of taste. When we have new
products with no set standard, then my job is to figure out what
about these products consumers like or dislike, so when we launch
it, it's at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about the emotional taste, the way you feel lying in
bed with a pint at the end of a bad day? Does that count? Or, more
to the point, can she count it?
</P>
<P>
   She nods. ``Ice cream is a comfort food and we are aware that
our products will be responded to with more emotion than, say,
testing bread. Our hedonic scale of 1 to 9 says you either like it
extremely or dislike it. With breads, if you score 5, you're
golden. With ice cream you might as well forget about that product.
There's not a magic hedonic number but there is a magic range,
above 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, it's time for lunch, which we have with three flavor
developers and Mary Kamm, the company's director of research and
development, to whom they all report. You can tell these are people
who make their living from dessert _ none of them orders any.
Instead, they stick to fish and chips and beer. ``I usually crave
potato chips,'' Ms. Parizo acknowledges. ``Anything with salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kamm gives a brief overview of their yearly work cycle: Each
January, Ben &AMP; Jerry's marketing department gives them a list of
products that are selling and those that are not. The flavor
developers then look at flavor trends, at the restaurant industry
for dessert ideas, and at the beverage industry, a pioneer in new
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Using this information, the flavor developers come up with about
200 product concepts. Ms. Parizo then works with consumers to
screen them. By May, they are narrowed down to 40 or 50 and are
developed further before being tasted by consumers again.
</P>
<P>
   Using those results, the marketing department decides which
flavors will be put into full commercial development. These are
tested again, and if they duplicate their first approval scores,
survive. Samples are sent to retailers in December, and the product
goes on the shelves the following March.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dale Conoscenti is the flavor developer in charge of pints, who
takes an annual culinary trip to spot trends. Three years ago it
was to New York City, where he ate 70 desserts in a weekend. In
1997, his eight-day trip to California yielded 157 desserts, and
there was a comparable number in Miami in 1998. But what seems to
have excited him more than the desserts was the trade he made at
O'Hare Airport after being bumped from a flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a nice woman at the ticket counter I was talking to
who wanted a free merchandise coupon for our ice cream,'' he
recalls. ``She said, `My grandmother made fresh potato knishes this
morning,' so we traded. They were great.'' Conoscenti also
regularly trades 5 pints to get a haircut. He smiles. ``It's
amazing what people will do for ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to name any of the flavors that interested him in
Miami, which consumers will not see on the shelves until 2000. Ms.
Kamm laughs. ``The ice-cream business is not that different from
fashion,'' she says. ``One designer launches something and the next
thing you know there are knockoffs in every store. It's the same
with flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Ms. Parizo says, Ben &AMP; Jerry's new products have
done well, but those introduced in 1998, tested by her sensory
evaluation procedure, have done even better. Perhaps most
successful has been Phish Food, a sticky sweet combination of
chocolate ice cream, marshmallow, caramel swirl and fudge fish,
which has taken off with teen-agers, on whom it was tested.
</P>
<P>
   There have been disappointments, too, of course. Holy Cannoli, a
flavor dear to Conoscenti (on his New York trip he consulted
Ferrara in the Little Italy neighborhood on how to make cannolis),
failed to find a mainstream audience. ``It was a complicated
flavor, maybe too complicated,'' he says. ``Pistachio, butter, rum,
ricotta, cannoli. It was expensive, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the test kitchen, Ms. Parizo sets out numerous cartons
of vanilla ice cream, and we proceed to ``isolate aroma notes''
like cooked milk and vanilla, and rate them.
</P>
<P>
   One part of being a taster I hadn't counted on was having to
taste flavors I loathe, vanilla topping the list. After the fourth
sample, all I want is to brush my teeth. Clearly, my fantasy of
this job has hit a dead end. I like what I like and that's it. A
perfect consumer, a rotten taste tester.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally bid Ms. Parizo and her crew farewell, they kindly
offer me a free merchandise coupon. I decline with thanks. Knishes
would have been another story.

</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful warm spring day and Rodger and his wife, Ellie,
are at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie's wearing a cute, loose fitting, pink spring dress,
sleeveless with straps. As they are walking through the ape exhibit
and pass in front of a very large gorilla, the gorilla goes ape. He
jumps up on the bars, holding on with one hand (and 2 feet),
grunting, and pounding his chest. He is obviously excited by Ellie
in the wavy dress.
</P>
<P>
   Rodger noticing the excitement, suggests that Ellie tease the
poor fellow. Rodger suggests Ellie pucker her lips, wiggle her
bottom, and play along. Hesitantly, Ellie does and Mr. Gorilla gets
even more excited, making noises that would wake the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rodger suggests that Ellie let one of her straps fall,
which she does, and Mr. Gorilla is just about to tear the bars
down. `Now try hiking up your dress a little.''This drives the
gorilla absolutely crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rodger grabs Ellie, rips open the door to the cage, slings
her in with the gorilla and says `now, tell HIM you have a
headache.`

<P>
   &UR; Questions about love, marriage and sex were posed to kids ages
5 to 10. Some of their answers below are enlightening: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?
</P>
<P>
   `On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that
usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date.`
</P>
<P>
   (Mike, 10)
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNING WHY LOVE HAPPENS BETWEEN TWO PARTICULAR PEOPLE:
</P>
<P>
   `No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to
do with how you smell. That's why perfume and deodorant are so
popular.` (Jan, 9)
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNING WHY LOVERS OFTEN HOLD HANDS:
</P>
<P>
   `They want to make sure their rings don't fall off because they
paid good money for them.` (Dave, 8)
</P>
<P>
   HOW CAN YOU TELL IF TWO ADULTS EATING DINNER AT A RESTAURANT ARE
IN LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   `Just see if the man picks up the check. That's how you can tell
if he's in love.` (John, 9)
</P>
<P>
   HOW A PERSON LEARNS TO KISS:
</P>
<P>
   `It might help to watch soap operas all day.` (Carin, 9)
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO MAKE LOVE ENDURE:
</P>
<P>
   `Don't forget your wife's name...That will mess up the love.`
</P>
<P>
   (Roger, 8)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE CRAZY PRESBYTERIANS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After the revival had concluded, the three pastors were
discussing the results with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodist minister said, `The revival worked out great for
us! We gained four new families.`
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist preacher said, `We did better than that! We gained
six new families.`
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian pastor said, `Well, we did even better than
that! We got rid of our 10 biggest trouble makers!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deep Thinking &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A day without sunshine is like, night.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   He who hesitates is probably right.
</P>
<P>
   The colder the X-ray table, the more of your body is required on
it.
</P>
<P>

tried before.

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one Christmas toy continues to be this stupid Furby
thing. People just act silly over this. It said on the news that
this Furby is a wonderful educational tool. Once you realize you
spent $30 for one, you'll never do anything that stupid again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First 'Antz' was a big hit, now 'A Bug's Life. Both these
movies have done huge dough. If I had known insects were gonna be
so popular, I would've sold the rights to my old apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's something scary. Republican congressman Ed Pease of
Indiana was robbed at gunpoint. In fact, someone yelled, ``Stop,
thief!'' and 200 congressmen froze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the Republicans call a woman who hasn't had sex
in seven years? A nymphomaniac.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people have done some of their Christmas shopping on
the Internet? I don't know. I tried it, but I feel funny about
giving porno as a Christmas gift.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are having a breakdown. They've gone mad with
this impeachment thing. They can't let it go. It is an obsession.
They're stalking the President. You have fighters in Islamic Jihads
watching this going, 'Boy, these guys hold a grudge. I mean, let it
go, fellas.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans just can't believe we're not buying this.
Clinton lied to the country and we just don't care. It's like when
they tried to sell professional soccer to Americans. No matter how
right it seemed we were just like ``No, sorry, just don't like
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``This week the Republicans brought out other people who lied under
oath about having sex and went to jail for it, (including) a female
psychiatrist who performed oral sex on her male patient. Hey, if
that doesn't cure depression, nothing will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study on smoking released this week shows that people
who quit gain an average of 18 pounds. Tobacco executives are
already lobbying for a new label warning on packs of cigarettes:
'WARNING: QUITTING SMOKING MAY CAUSE SWELLING OF THE ASS.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The male vocal group Lionheart performed recently at the Church
of St. Mary the Virgin in Manhattan. The audience was completely
absorbed in the chants of 12th-century Paris when a shrill ring of
a cell phone brought everyone rudely back to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   To general astonishment, a woman left her seat, phone to her
ear, and walked behind a nearby sarcophagus where she proceeded to
talk. The audience could hear her, and members of the group on
stage later told me she was telling the person at the other end of
the line that she was ``at a Lionheart concert'' and that ``they're
singing Renaissance music.'' (Note: It was really medieval, but
what's a few centuries?)
</P>
<P>
   The piece over, the men in the ensemble stopped and looked in
her direction, but she continued talking, oblivious to the fact
that now everyone was looking at her. Finally, an irate member of
the audience walked over and urged her to stop or leave.
</P>
<P>
   She then proceeded up the side aisle, still talking, and turned
into a small chapel to continue. The audience was incensed. Another
member walked over, took her by the arm and led her out of the
church, still talking.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming the concert, Richard Porterfield, a member of the
group, said, ``This piece, appropriately, is about the world going
to hell.'' The audience laughed and the concert continued; the
intrusion of the modern era was over.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suzanne L. Ford
</P>
<P>
   On a recent theater trip to New York, Margie and Harry Sheld of
Las Vegas overheard the following conversation before the opening
curtain:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``I found a good second-hand store on 26th
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Don't go there. It's no good. I bring my stuff
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina, the 9-year-old daughter of Ann and Jonathan Dachs, wanted
to know what all the fuss was about when the Starr report came out.
Her parents answered her question as diplomatically as possible.
Nina then asked what the president's punishment would be and, after
a discussion of the process, was told that he could possibly be
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, when she saw her father reading the paper,
Nina asked whether the president was going to be oranged. After a
second or two, the light dawned. ``You mean impeached, don't you?''
her father asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, I knew it had something to do with fruit,'' she
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Bell family gets in the car for a trip, long or
short, there's a fight over the CD player. Martin Bell, the father,
wants Bob Dylan; Daniel, the teen-age son, wants Green Day or
Offspring, and Frances, the 9-year-old daughter, screams for the
Spice Girls or some other group du jour. Mrs. Bell tries to play
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as they got into the car anticipating another round in
the music wars, Frances commented that her third-grade class was
studying Bob Dylan. Mrs. Bell asked if she told the teacher that
her Daddy listens to Dylan, hoping that her daughter might now
recognize that Dylan was indeed special.
</P>
<P>
   Frances replied with disdain: ``Everybody's father listens to
Bob Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   While on the subject of Bob Dylan, Stephen Tympanick thinks this
could be filed under ``you know you're old when ...'' He was at a
yard sale in the Hamptons, perusing the knicknacks, when he saw a
teen-age boy carrying an LP of Dylan's greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   The boy joined his father and enthusiastically blurted: ``Look
Dad, I found a record by Jakob Dylan's father! I didn't know he was
a musician, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue McMahon found a flowering amaryllis bulb in her neighborhood
hardware store and went up to the cashier to pay for it. The clerk
had a problem getting the machine to sum up the purchase with the
tax and called for help. Behind Ms. McMahon, a male customer
shuffled restlessly, constantly checking his watch.
</P>
<P>
   When the transaction was finally completed, the man gave vent to
his irritation. ``That was an awful lot of trouble for an onion,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent story on ``Alice in Wonderland'' reminded Eleanor Roth
of an experience she had in California some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   She was watching her grandniece riding a Wonderland children's
carousel when she noted that the Mad Hatter had a number on his
hat. Why, she wondered, and turned to the young mother standing
next to her. ``Are you familiar with `Alice in Wonderland?''' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The woman looked blank. ``I'm from out-of-town,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What the kids on Santa's lap are saying: ``Do your elves have a
pretty good 401(k) plan?''

   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful warm spring day and Rodger and his wife, Ellie,
are at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie's wearing a cute, loose fitting, pink spring dress,
sleeveless with straps. As they are walking through the ape exhibit
and pass in front of a very large gorilla, the gorilla goes ape. He
jumps up on the bars, holding on with one hand (and 2 feet),
grunting, and pounding his chest. He is obviously excited by Ellie
in the wavy dress.
</P>
<P>
   Rodger noticing the excitement, suggests that Ellie tease the
poor fellow. Rodger suggests Ellie pucker her lips, wiggle her
bottom, and play along. Hesitantly, Ellie does and Mr. Gorilla gets
even more excited, making noises that would wake the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rodger suggests that Ellie let one of her straps fall,
which she does, and Mr. Gorilla is just about to tear the bars
down. `Now try hiking up your dress a little.''This drives the
gorilla absolutely crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rodger grabs Ellie, rips open the door to the cage, slings
her in with the gorilla and says `now, tell HIM you have a
headache.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why Men Have it Better &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You can open all your own jars
</P>
<P>
   When clicking thru the channels you don't have to stop on every
shot of someone crying.
</P>
<P>
   You can leave a hotel room bed unmade
</P>
<P>
   You can kill your own food
</P>
<P>
   You see the humor in `Terms of Endearment`
</P>
<P>
   Your underwear costs $7.50 for a pack of 3
</P>
<P>
   None of your coworkers have the power to make you cry
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate is just another snack
</P>
<P>
   One mood, all the time
</P>
<P>
   The remote is yours and yours alone
</P>
<P>
   You need not pretend you're `freshening up` when you go to the
bathroom
</P>
<P>
   You think the idea of punting that small, ankle-biting dog is
funny

psychiatrist who performed oral sex on her male patient. Hey, if
that doesn't cure depression, nothing will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study on smoking released this week shows that people
who quit gain an average of 18 pounds. Tobacco executives are
already lobbying for a new label warning on packs of cigarettes:
'WARNING: QUITTING SMOKING MAY CAUSE SWELLING OF THE ASS.'''

   The male vocal group Lionheart performed recently at the Church
of St. Mary the Virgin in Manhattan. The audience was completely
absorbed in the chants of 12th-century Paris when a shrill ring of
a cell phone brought everyone rudely back to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   To general astonishment, a woman left her seat, phone to her
ear, and walked behind a nearby sarcophagus where she proceeded to
talk. The audience could hear her, and members of the group on
stage later told me she was telling the person at the other end of
the line that she was ``at a Lionheart concert'' and that ``they're
singing Renaissance music.'' (Note: It was really medieval, but
what's a few centuries?)
</P>
<P>
   The piece over, the men in the ensemble stopped and looked in
her direction, but she continued talking, oblivious to the fact
that now everyone was looking at her. Finally, an irate member of
the audience walked over and urged her to stop or leave.
</P>
<P>
   She then proceeded up the side aisle, still talking, and turned
into a small chapel to continue. The audience was incensed. Another
member walked over, took her by the arm and led her out of the
church, still talking.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming the concert, Richard Porterfield, a member of the
group, said, ``This piece, appropriately, is about the world going
to hell.'' The audience laughed and the concert continued; the
intrusion of the modern era was over.

   On a recent theater trip to New York, Margie and Harry Sheld of
Las Vegas overheard the following conversation before the opening
curtain:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``I found a good second-hand store on 26th
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Don't go there. It's no good. I bring my stuff
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina, the 9-year-old daughter of Ann and Jonathan Dachs, wanted
to know what all the fuss was about when the Starr report came out.
Her parents answered her question as diplomatically as possible.
Nina then asked what the president's punishment would be and, after
a discussion of the process, was told that he could possibly be
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, when she saw her father reading the paper,
Nina asked whether the president was going to be oranged. After a
second or two, the light dawned. ``You mean impeached, don't you?''
her father asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, I knew it had something to do with fruit,'' she
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Bell family gets in the car for a trip, long or
short, there's a fight over the CD player. Martin Bell, the father,
wants Bob Dylan; Daniel, the teen-age son, wants Green Day or
Offspring, and Frances, the 9-year-old daughter, screams for the
Spice Girls or some other group du jour. Mrs. Bell tries to play
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as they got into the car anticipating another round in
the music wars, Frances commented that her third-grade class was
studying Bob Dylan. Mrs. Bell asked if she told the teacher that
her Daddy listens to Dylan, hoping that her daughter might now
recognize that Dylan was indeed special.
</P>
<P>
   Frances replied with disdain: ``Everybody's father listens to
Bob Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   While on the subject of Bob Dylan, Stephen Tympanick thinks this
could be filed under ``you know you're old when ...'' He was at a
yard sale in the Hamptons, perusing the knicknacks, when he saw a
teen-age boy carrying an LP of Dylan's greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   The boy joined his father and enthusiastically blurted: ``Look
Dad, I found a record by Jakob Dylan's father! I didn't know he was
a musician, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue McMahon found a flowering amaryllis bulb in her neighborhood
hardware store and went up to the cashier to pay for it. The clerk
had a problem getting the machine to sum up the purchase with the
tax and called for help. Behind Ms. McMahon, a male customer
shuffled restlessly, constantly checking his watch.
</P>
<P>
   When the transaction was finally completed, the man gave vent to
his irritation. ``That was an awful lot of trouble for an onion,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent story on ``Alice in Wonderland'' reminded Eleanor Roth
of an experience she had in California some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   She was watching her grandniece riding a Wonderland children's
carousel when she noted that the Mad Hatter had a number on his
hat. Why, she wondered, and turned to the young mother standing
next to her. ``Are you familiar with `Alice in Wonderland?''' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The woman looked blank. ``I'm from out-of-town,'' she said.

   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful warm spring day and Rodger and his wife, Ellie,
are at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie's wearing a cute, loose fitting, pink spring dress,
sleeveless with straps. As they are walking through the ape exhibit
and pass in front of a very large gorilla, the gorilla goes ape. He
jumps up on the bars, holding on with one hand (and 2 feet),
grunting, and pounding his chest. He is obviously excited by Ellie
in the wavy dress.
</P>
<P>
   Rodger noticing the excitement, suggests that Ellie tease the
poor fellow. Rodger suggests Ellie pucker her lips, wiggle her
bottom, and play along. Hesitantly, Ellie does and Mr. Gorilla gets
even more excited, making noises that would wake the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rodger suggests that Ellie let one of her straps fall,
which she does, and Mr. Gorilla is just about to tear the bars
down. `Now try hiking up your dress a little.''This drives the
gorilla absolutely crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rodger grabs Ellie, rips open the door to the cage, slings
her in with the gorilla and says `now, tell HIM you have a
headache.`
</P>

 UNDATED: on you!' ' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Questions about love, marriage and sex were posed to kids ages
5 to 10. Some of their answers below are enlightening: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?
</P>
<P>
   `On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that
usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date.`
</P>
<P>
   (Mike, 10)
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNING WHY LOVE HAPPENS BETWEEN TWO PARTICULAR PEOPLE:
</P>
<P>
   `No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to
do with how you smell. That's why perfume and deodorant are so
popular.` (Jan, 9)
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNING WHY LOVERS OFTEN HOLD HANDS:
</P>
<P>
   `They want to make sure their rings don't fall off because they
paid good money for them.` (Dave, 8)
</P>
<P>
   HOW CAN YOU TELL IF TWO ADULTS EATING DINNER AT A RESTAURANT ARE
IN LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   `Just see if the man picks up the check. That's how you can tell
if he's in love.` (John, 9)
</P>
<P>
   HOW A PERSON LEARNS TO KISS:
</P>
<P>
   `It might help to watch soap operas all day.` (Carin, 9)
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO MAKE LOVE ENDURE:
</P>
<P>
   `Don't forget your wife's name...That will mess up the love.`
</P>
<P>
   (Roger, 8)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE CRAZY PRESBYTERIANS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After the revival had concluded, the three pastors were
discussing the results with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodist minister said, `The revival worked out great for
us! We gained four new families.`
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist preacher said, `We did better than that! We gained
six new families.`
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian pastor said, `Well, we did even better than
that! We got rid of our 10 biggest trouble makers!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deep Thinking &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A day without sunshine is like, night.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   He who hesitates is probably right.
</P>
<P>
   The colder the X-ray table, the more of your body is required on
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never
tried before.
</P>
<P>
   Borrow money from pessimists _ they don't expect it back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one Christmas toy continues to be this stupid Furby
thing. People just act silly over this. It said on the news that
this Furby is a wonderful educational tool. Once you realize you
spent $30 for one, you'll never do anything that stupid again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First 'Antz' was a big hit, now 'A Bug's Life. Both these
movies have done huge dough. If I had known insects were gonna be
so popular, I would've sold the rights to my old apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's something scary. Republican congressman Ed Pease of
Indiana was robbed at gunpoint. In fact, someone yelled, ``Stop,
thief!'' and 200 congressmen froze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the Republicans call a woman who hasn't had sex
in seven years? A nymphomaniac.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people have done some of their Christmas shopping on
the Internet? I don't know. I tried it, but I feel funny about
giving porno as a Christmas gift.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are having a breakdown. They've gone mad with
this impeachment thing. They can't let it go. It is an obsession.
They're stalking the President. You have fighters in Islamic Jihads
watching this going, 'Boy, these guys hold a grudge. I mean, let it
go, fellas.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans just can't believe we're not buying this.
Clinton lied to the country and we just don't care. It's like when
they tried to sell professional soccer to Americans. No matter how
right it seemed we were just like ``No, sorry, just don't like
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``This week the Republicans brought out other people who lied under
oath about having sex and went to jail for it, (including) a female
psychiatrist who performed oral sex on her male patient. Hey, if
that doesn't cure depression, nothing will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study on smoking released this week shows that people
who quit gain an average of 18 pounds. Tobacco executives are
already lobbying for a new label warning on packs of cigarettes:
'WARNING: QUITTING SMOKING MAY CAUSE SWELLING OF THE ASS.'''

a cell phone brought everyone rudely back to the 20th century.

   To general astonishment, a woman left her seat, phone to her

talk. The audience could hear her, and members of the group on
stage later told me she was telling the person at the other end of
the line that she was ``at a Lionheart concert'' and that ``they're
singing Renaissance music.'' (Note: It was really medieval, but
what's a few centuries?)
</P>
<P>
   The piece over, the men in the ensemble stopped and looked in
her direction, but she continued talking, oblivious to the fact
that now everyone was looking at her. Finally, an irate member of
the audience walked over and urged her to stop or leave.
</P>
<P>
   She then proceeded up the side aisle, still talking, and turned

member walked over, took her by the arm and led her out of the
church, still talking.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming the concert, Richard Porterfield, a member of the
group, said, ``This piece, appropriately, is about the world going
to hell.'' The audience laughed and the concert continued; the
intrusion of the modern era was over.

   On a recent theater trip to New York, Margie and Harry Sheld of
Las Vegas overheard the following conversation before the opening
curtain:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``I found a good second-hand store on 26th
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Don't go there. It's no good. I bring my stuff
there.''

   Whenever the Bell family gets in the car for a trip, long or
short, there's a fight over the CD player. Martin Bell, the father,
wants Bob Dylan; Daniel, the teen-age son, wants Green Day or
Offspring, and Frances, the 9-year-old daughter, screams for the
Spice Girls or some other group du jour. Mrs. Bell tries to play
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as they got into the car anticipating another round in

`SIMPLE ITALIAN FOOD': DISTINGUISHED IN ITS SIMPLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As testament to the modern celebrity of chefs, Mario Batali's
name appears in larger type than the title of his new book,
``Simple Italian Food'' (Clarkson Potter, $30). And there is a
full-length photograph of Batali clad in chef's whites and orange
kitchen clogs, baring hairy legs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot to swallow on a cookbook cover. It's probably best to
keep it open at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfectly pristine ingredients, combined sensibly and cooked
properly, are what make Italian food taste so good,'' writes
Batali, the chef at Po and Babbo in Greenwich Village in New York
City. This is a truism spouted in various forms by many American
chefs.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're trying to distinguish yourself as a chef, it
takes courage to serve straightforward food. Which is why for many
of them, it is more about talking the big game than playing it.
They slip in that extra, unnecessary ingredient. They use tomatoes
out of season. They put too much topping on their bruschetta.
</P>
<P>
   But Batali means what he writes. His recipes deliver the honest
flavors of Italian cooking. And they do it in tantalizing ways.
</P>
<P>
   Mostaccioli with fennel, mint and bread crumbs, a simple pasta
dish, is pure-tasting and delicious. Whole mint leaves, sprinkled
in at the very end of cooking, give the dish a lively edge and
offset the heat from red pepper flakes. And it takes no time to
cook.
</P>
<P>
   Green gnocchi with caduta di formaggio (or ``snowfall of
cheese'') also had a surprise. A little grappa stirred into a
cheese sauce made with Gorgonzola, asiago and plenty of butter
added depth to what could easily be a heavy, monotone sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Small touches in the recipes, like pomegranate seeds in a fennel
and blood-orange salad, and a heady black pepper-oregano oil
sprinkled over crostini with broccoli rape are what make this book
great.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are minor errors, like the omission of salt in the
mostaccioli, they are merely nicks in an otherwise smooth
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Batali reminisces about his years cooking at Trattoria La Volta
in northern Italy and in the Village, but I must admit, I was more
drawn to the recipes than the stories.
</P>
<P>
   You may recognize some of the dishes from the menus at his
restaurants. No matter. Whether they are being served to you or you
are preparing them, they are smart. They are, as promised, simple.
And they make Batali a distinguished chef, even without that goofy
cover photo.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN GNOCCHI WITH CADUTA DI FORMAGGIO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Simple Italian Food'' by Mario Batali &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   1 pound russet potatoes, scrubbed
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds spinach, stemmed, rinsed and partly dried
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 extra large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sea salt
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Gorgonzola cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grappa
</P>
<P>
   { cups freshly grated asiago cheese
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped chives.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the potatoes in a saucepan, and cover with water. Bring
to a boil, and cook until very tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, place the spinach in a deep pot with a lid. Cook
over medium heat, allowing the spinach to steam in its own liquid,
1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the spinach to an ice bath to stop the
cooking. Drain well, then wrap the spinach in a clean dish towel
and twist to extact as much liquid as possible. Chop very fine.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them. Using
the finest setting, run the potatoes through a ricer or food mill
onto a cutting board. Add the spinach. Sprinkle the flour over the
potatoes and spinach; make a well, add the egg and kosher salt, and
knead to form a dough.
</P>
<P>
   4. Divide the dough into 4 balls. Roll each ball into 1-inch
thick ropes, and cut each rope into 1-inch long pieces. Roll each
piece off the tines of a fork to form the classic gnocchi shape.
Place on a lightly floured baking sheet, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. In a deep pot, add the sea salt to 6 quarts of water, and
bring to a boil. While the water heats, in a 12-to-14-inch saute
pan, mash together the Gorgonzola and butter until smooth. Stir in
the grappa, and simmer over medium heat for 4 minutes. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   6. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water, and cook until they
float to the surface, about 1 minute. Do this in 2 batches. Drain
well, and add to the cheese sauce, increasing the heat to medium.
Toss to coat the gnocchi. Add the asiago and chives; toss again.
Pour into warmed bowls, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful warm spring day and Rodger and his wife, Ellie,
are at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie's wearing a cute, loose fitting, pink spring dress,
sleeveless with straps. As they are walking through the ape exhibit
and pass in front of a very large gorilla, the gorilla goes ape. He
jumps up on the bars, holding on with one hand (and 2 feet),
grunting, and pounding his chest. He is obviously excited by Ellie
in the wavy dress.
</P>
<P>
   Rodger noticing the excitement, suggests that Ellie tease the
poor fellow. Rodger suggests Ellie pucker her lips, wiggle her
bottom, and play along. Hesitantly, Ellie does and Mr. Gorilla gets
even more excited, making noises that would wake the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rodger suggests that Ellie let one of her straps fall,
which she does, and Mr. Gorilla is just about to tear the bars
down. `Now try hiking up your dress a little.''This drives the
gorilla absolutely crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rodger grabs Ellie, rips open the door to the cage, slings
her in with the gorilla and says `now, tell HIM you have a
headache.`
</P>

 UNDATED: on you!' ' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Questions about love, marriage and sex were posed to kids ages
5 to 10. Some of their answers below are enlightening: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?
</P>
<P>
   `On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that
usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date.`
</P>
<P>
   (Mike, 10)
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNING WHY LOVE HAPPENS BETWEEN TWO PARTICULAR PEOPLE:
</P>
<P>
   `No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to
do with how you smell. That's why perfume and deodorant are so
popular.` (Jan, 9)
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNING WHY LOVERS OFTEN HOLD HANDS:
</P>
<P>
   `They want to make sure their rings don't fall off because they
paid good money for them.` (Dave, 8)
</P>
<P>
   HOW CAN YOU TELL IF TWO ADULTS EATING DINNER AT A RESTAURANT ARE
IN LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   `Just see if the man picks up the check. That's how you can tell
if he's in love.` (John, 9)
</P>
<P>
   HOW A PERSON LEARNS TO KISS:
</P>
<P>
   `It might help to watch soap operas all day.` (Carin, 9)
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO MAKE LOVE ENDURE:
</P>
<P>
   `Don't forget your wife's name...That will mess up the love.`
</P>
<P>
   (Roger, 8)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE CRAZY PRESBYTERIANS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After the revival had concluded, the three pastors were
discussing the results with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodist minister said, `The revival worked out great for
us! We gained four new families.`
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist preacher said, `We did better than that! We gained
six new families.`
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian pastor said, `Well, we did even better than
that! We got rid of our 10 biggest trouble makers!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deep Thinking &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A day without sunshine is like, night.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   He who hesitates is probably right.
</P>
<P>
   The colder the X-ray table, the more of your body is required on
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never
tried before.
</P>
<P>
   Borrow money from pessimists _ they don't expect it back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one Christmas toy continues to be this stupid Furby
thing. People just act silly over this. It said on the news that
this Furby is a wonderful educational tool. Once you realize you
spent $30 for one, you'll never do anything that stupid again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First 'Antz' was a big hit, now 'A Bug's Life. Both these
movies have done huge dough. If I had known insects were gonna be
so popular, I would've sold the rights to my old apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's something scary. Republican congressman Ed Pease of
Indiana was robbed at gunpoint. In fact, someone yelled, ``Stop,
thief!'' and 200 congressmen froze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the Republicans call a woman who hasn't had sex
in seven years? A nymphomaniac.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people have done some of their Christmas shopping on
the Internet? I don't know. I tried it, but I feel funny about
giving porno as a Christmas gift.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are having a breakdown. They've gone mad with
this impeachment thing. They can't let it go. It is an obsession.
They're stalking the President. You have fighters in Islamic Jihads
watching this going, 'Boy, these guys hold a grudge. I mean, let it
go, fellas.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans just can't believe we're not buying this.
Clinton lied to the country and we just don't care. It's like when
they tried to sell professional soccer to Americans. No matter how
right it seemed we were just like ``No, sorry, just don't like
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``This week the Republicans brought out other people who lied under
oath about having sex and went to jail for it, (including) a female
psychiatrist who performed oral sex on her male patient. Hey, if
that doesn't cure depression, nothing will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study on smoking released this week shows that people
who quit gain an average of 18 pounds. Tobacco executives are
already lobbying for a new label warning on packs of cigarettes:
'WARNING: QUITTING SMOKING MAY CAUSE SWELLING OF THE ASS.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The male vocal group Lionheart performed recently at the Church
of St. Mary the Virgin in Manhattan. The audience was completely
absorbed in the chants of 12th-century Paris when a shrill ring of
a cell phone brought everyone rudely back to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   To general astonishment, a woman left her seat, phone to her
ear, and walked behind a nearby sarcophagus where she proceeded to
talk. The audience could hear her, and members of the group on
stage later told me she was telling the person at the other end of
the line that she was ``at a Lionheart concert'' and that ``they're
singing Renaissance music.'' (Note: It was really medieval, but
what's a few centuries?)
</P>
<P>
   The piece over, the men in the ensemble stopped and looked in
her direction, but she continued talking, oblivious to the fact
that now everyone was looking at her. Finally, an irate member of
the audience walked over and urged her to stop or leave.
</P>
<P>
   She then proceeded up the side aisle, still talking, and turned
into a small chapel to continue. The audience was incensed. Another
member walked over, took her by the arm and led her out of the
church, still talking.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming the concert, Richard Porterfield, a member of the
group, said, ``This piece, appropriately, is about the world going
to hell.'' The audience laughed and the concert continued; the
intrusion of the modern era was over.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suzanne L. Ford
</P>
<P>
   On a recent theater trip to New York, Margie and Harry Sheld of
Las Vegas overheard the following conversation before the opening
curtain:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``I found a good second-hand store on 26th
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Don't go there. It's no good. I bring my stuff
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina, the 9-year-old daughter of Ann and Jonathan Dachs, wanted
to know what all the fuss was about when the Starr report came out.
Her parents answered her question as diplomatically as possible.
Nina then asked what the president's punishment would be and, after
a discussion of the process, was told that he could possibly be
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, when she saw her father reading the paper,
Nina asked whether the president was going to be oranged. After a
second or two, the light dawned. ``You mean impeached, don't you?''
her father asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, I knew it had something to do with fruit,'' she
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Bell family gets in the car for a trip, long or
short, there's a fight over the CD player. Martin Bell, the father,
wants Bob Dylan; Daniel, the teen-age son, wants Green Day or
Offspring, and Frances, the 9-year-old daughter, screams for the
Spice Girls or some other group du jour. Mrs. Bell tries to play
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as they got into the car anticipating another round in
the music wars, Frances commented that her third-grade class was
studying Bob Dylan. Mrs. Bell asked if she told the teacher that
her Daddy listens to Dylan, hoping that her daughter might now
recognize that Dylan was indeed special.
</P>
<P>
   Frances replied with disdain: ``Everybody's father listens to
Bob Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   While on the subject of Bob Dylan, Stephen Tympanick thinks this
could be filed under ``you know you're old when ...'' He was at a
yard sale in the Hamptons, perusing the knicknacks, when he saw a
teen-age boy carrying an LP of Dylan's greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   The boy joined his father and enthusiastically blurted: ``Look
Dad, I found a record by Jakob Dylan's father! I didn't know he was
a musician, too.''
</P>

   Sue McMahon found a flowering amaryllis bulb in her neighborhood
hardware store and went up to the cashier to pay for it. The clerk
had a problem getting the machine to sum up the purchase with the
tax and called for help. Behind Ms. McMahon, a male customer
shuffled restlessly, constantly checking his watch.
</P>
<P>
   When the transaction was finally completed, the man gave vent to
his irritation. ``That was an awful lot of trouble for an onion,''

WHEN TEMPERING, OIL IS A VIRTUE  
 STANDING IN FOR HEAVY CREAM  
 OF ARMAGNAC AND OLD PRUNES  
 POOR MAN'S CAVIAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have heard that you can avoid the long process of tempering
chocolate by adding a few drops of oil as you melt it. Is this
true? If so, does it affect the taste or consistency? Which oil is
best to use?
</P>
<P>
   A. You've heard right: A little bit of oil added to melted
chocolate can often allow you to forgo the rather exacting process
of tempering it.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering chocolate (melting it, cooling it and then gently
melting it again) creates a lustrous, stable medium that can be
turned into a glossy coating for candies, fruit, cakes and cookies,
or used to create fanciful decorations like ruffles, curls and
lace.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering requires care and practice, as the temperature at
every step must be carefully watched. But by simply stirring 1
tablespoon of oil or other liquid fat (like melted clarified butter
or vegetable shortening) into every 3 ounces of melted chocolate,
you can create a mixture that approximates tempered chocolate and
that is colloquially called ``quick-tempered'' chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, when a recipe calls for tempered chocolate, you
may use the quick-tempered kind. But because it has a thinner
consistency than conventionally tempered chocolate (because of the
added fat), it may not work quite as well when you are making some
types of decorations. It may also not hold up as reliably if the
chocolate is meant to be stored for a long period. But for home
cooks making chocolate to be consumed within a few days, it's
generally fine.
</P>
<P>
   You can use any type of oil to quick-temper chocolate, but
neutral oils, like canola, vegetable or safflower, won't interfere
with the flavor of the chocolate. On the flip side, butter and nut
oils (like hazelnut or walnut) can add a delightful nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Standing In for Heavy Cream
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can evaporated skim milk be substituted for heavy cream in a
recipe? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on the recipe. Substituting evaporated skim milk
for cream in equal measure works beautifully in baked goods,
custards, creamy soups and cream sauces.
</P>
<P>
   But be warned: Evaporated skim milk has a slightly cooked,
processed flavor compared with the fresh dairy taste of cream. If
the dish you are preparing is well seasoned with spices, chocolate,
garlic or chilies, you can make the swap without much harm to the
flavor. But delicate cream sauces won't fare as well.
</P>
<P>
   For foods that are not cooked, like a whipped-cream topping or a
mousse, try substituting either cottage cheese or part-skim ricotta
cheese for the cream. But first eliminate the curds by whirling the
cheese in a food processor or blender until it is very smooth (this
will take at least a full minute or two). Plain yogurt is another
good stand-in for cream in uncooked dishes, but since it tends to
curdle, it can't be used as easily in cooked dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for a creamy but creamless soup, try simmering a potato
in the soup broth and then pureeing the mixture. The starch in the
potato thickens the soup without adding fat.
</P>
<P>
   Of Armagnac and Old Prunes
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a jar of prunes in Armagnac that I bought in France 15
years ago. It has never been opened, the seal was never broken, and
the jar has been stored most of the time in a dark cabinet. Do you
think the prunes (and the Armagnac, for that matter) can still be
eaten?
</P>
<P>
   A. According to both the California Prune Board and the Food and
Drug Administration, the prunes and Armagnac should be perfectly
safe, and probably delicious. Armagnac, like most spirits, keeps
for decades and can improve over time. In this case, it acts as a
preservative, protecting the prunes from both desiccation and rot,
and probably imbuing them with a luscious, heady flavor.
</P>
<P>
   But be wise: Open the jar, and sniff. If the contents smell at
all suspicious (like vinegar or worse), use common sense and throw
it away.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Man's Caviar
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently I tasted something called Southern caviar, an
appetizer concoction that contained no caviar but was very tasty. A
recipe would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   A. Southern caviar, also called poor man's caviar, is a savory,
vegetable-based spread or dip that is supposed to take the place of
expensive, real caviar as an hors d'oeuvre or appetizer (not that
anyone would be fooled).
</P>
<P>
   While it can be made from any number of vegetables, eggplant is
by far the most popular, especially in the South, where some
scholars say the vegetable was introduced, perhaps via the West
Indies, by African slaves or Sephardic Jews, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a versatile recipe that is good as a spread with crudites
and toasted baguette rounds, and even better as a sauce for pasta
or a side dish for poultry or meats. And I suppose you could also
pile it onto a blini.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN CAVIAR
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus 15 minutes for cooling
</P>
<P>
   1 large eggplant
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons packed fresh Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons packed fresh celery leaves (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 scallions, white part only, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   \ cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon capers, drained (optional)
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Hot pepper sauce to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prick eggplant all over with a
fork, and place it on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until
eggplant is very soft, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool completely, and
then scoop out flesh, and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   2. In bowl of food processor, combine parsley, celery leaves,
scallions and garlic. Pulse until mixture is finely chopped, about
1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add eggplant, olive oil, lemon juice, capers, salt, black
pepper and hot-pepper sauce, and process until mixture is quite
smooth. Taste, and adjust seasonings. Refrigerate until serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 1{ cups.

THE HIDDEN CHARMS OF THE BLADE STEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In food as in life, the truly remarkable often lurks among the
merely ordinary. Take, for example, the top blade steak. It comes
from the chuck or forequarter of the cow, which usually produces
cuts that are flavorful but very tough.
</P>
<P>
   Full of connective tissue, these are best cooked by slow, moist
cooking methods like braising or stewing.
</P>
<P>
   But the top blade breaks this mold. It is actually the second
most tender cut of meat, surpassed only by the butter-soft
tenderloin. This underappreciated cut of beef is a culinary hidden
gem just waiting to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The top blade steak's position in the pantheon of beef
tenderness is not based on mere supposition. In Texas, where beef
is truly king, measuring tenderness is serious business.
</P>
<P>
   And while attending a course at Texas A &AMP; M University called
Beef 101, we saw meat scientists measure beef toughness with a
piece of equipment called a Warner-Bratzler, after its inventors.
This gizmo measures the amount of pressure required to break apart
a piece of meat.
</P>
<P>
   When the top blade was put up against all other cuts of beef, it
came in second only to the extremely pricey tenderloin. A blind
tasting of 10 cuts of beef held at the end of the course confirmed
the machine's evaluation, since the top blade was rated extremely
tender by all tasters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the top blade is only about half the price of
other steaks like the Delmonico and the sirloin, which are
generally regarded more highly by consumers. In fact, in most
supermarkets top blade is only a few cents more a pound than tough
steaks like the top round.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is this meltingly tender, flavorful and inexpensive
steak not the darling of chefs and home cooks alike? Well, like a
tragic hero, it does have a flaw: running smack down the center of
each steak is a line of inedible cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   This poses a problem, for sure, but hardly an insurmountable
one. To our minds, tenderness and flavor make it worth simply
eating around the cartilage and leaving it on your plate.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fastidious, though, there are excellent options.
One is to remove the line of cartilage, cut the raw steak into
chunks and then use them in stir-fries or on skewers. Another
possibility is to cook the steak whole, remove the offending
gristle and cut the cooked steak into thin slices before using it
in salads or other composed dishes.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution: do not mistake the top blade steak for what
is sometimes called the chuck blade steak. The chuck blade is about
three levels further down on the tenderness scale and is better
suited for moist, slow cooking methods that melt the stringy
collagen that it contains.
</P>
<P>
   Though the top blade steak is usually clearly labeled in
supermarkets, it is also recognizable from its chunky triangular
shape, which resembles that of an old-fashioned iron. This likeness
has given the steak the moniker of ``flatiron steak.''
</P>
<P>
   As is typical in the often-confusing world of butcher
terminology, the top blade may also be called the book steak,
lifter steak and butter steak, among other names.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is called at your local market, this is a piece of
meat worth seeking out. After all, what's a small flaw when you get
tenderness and deep beef flavor? &QL;

 A MINI-SERIES STRIVES TO SAVE THE 1960s  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 13)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ If ever there was a map of a collective human heart,
of where a generation found its emotional epicenter, it was laid
out on a set on the Paramount lot here on a chilly day recently.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gritty urban street corner where the men wore black
turtlenecks and corduroy coats, while the long-haired women, many
of them smoking, wore boots and beads. A young man strummed a
guitar in front of the Kettle of Fish restaurant (with lox and
cream cheese listed on the menu at 75 cents). Nearby were the Cafe
Figaro, the Bitter End and posters for concerts by the Lovin'
Spoonful and Buffy Sainte-Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was Bleecker and MacDougal, Greenwich Village, 1964.
</P>
<P>
   This was the last day of filming on the NBC mini-series ``The
'60s,'' which is scheduled to be broadcast Feb. 7 and 8, and it was
fitting somehow that the people behind the project _ baby boomers _
had chosen to close the production of this paean to their ambiguous
youth in an unambiguous flight of happy nostalgia. That note of
hope is, in fact, central not just to their own mythology but also
to this unusually personal bit of television.
</P>
<P>
   Jordana Brewster and Josh Hamilton, two of the lead actors in
the four-hour mini-series, were strolling down the street, with Ms.
Brewster's character, Sarah Weinstock, lamenting that she had yet
to go to the South and march in civil rights protests. She could if
she wanted, replied Hamilton, playing the good-hearted Michael
Herlihy, suggesting a world in which anything was possible if it
sprang from passion and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Then the pair stopped to sing some lines from ``Mr. Tambourine
Man,'' a hint of their real mission, which was to catch a glimpse
of Bob Dylan _ to worship, in other words, at the altar of youth,
an act as seductive for those creating the mini-series today as it
was for them 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s'' tries to chart the course of that decade by
following a family, the Herlihys, from 1960 through 1969. The
dreams that motivate the children into the thick of the troubled
era end up taking an enormous toll on the family. One son veers
into self-destruction, while another finds hope in his painful
coming of age, and on the way they experience everything from Black
Panther meetings to Woodstock and the 1968 Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   NBC promises some great '60s music _ it plans to release a CD _
as part of its overall effort to use the mini-series to attract the
young, affluent audience that advertisers so desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it would dramatize all that passion,'' said
Lindy De Koven, NBC's executive vice president in charge of
mini-series and movies. ``And, let's be honest, a lot of what is
going to drive this is the music.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mini-series is more than an attempt to win high ratings,
according to the people behind the project. They want it both to
recall their history and, in effect, to perform reconstructive
surgery on it.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the years have not been all that good to the
1960s. The entertainment industry, mirroring public attitudes, has
frequently depicted the decade as a time of misadventures,
irresponsibility and illusions, whether in the form of Vietnam War
movies or paranoid visions like Oliver Stone's ``JFK'' Another
picture, ``The Ice Storm,'' conveyed a popular image of the era's
residue (the early '70s) as soulless hedonism and moral breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   But some baby boomers are fighting back, trying to reclaim that
terrain as perhaps excessive and tumultuous but, at least in part,
noble _ maybe even a model for their children rather than a
cautionary tale. The question is whether young people will find
such nostalgia appealing or out of touch with today, when free sex
conjures up images of AIDS, drug use suggests rehab and Colombian
cartels, and the struggle for racial equality often means divisive
court battles over reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about what our children will think of us and what we went
through,'' said Lynda Obst, the executive producer of the
mini-series. ``About why it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Obst, a producer of movies like ``The Siege'' and
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' and the editor of ``Sixties: The Decade
Remembered Now, by the People Who Lived It Then,'' the excitement
in the Village scene was enormous, and she insisted on pointing out
to a visitor the wealth of details she had recreated, including
menus, posters, pleated skirts _ and telling stories about how each
one had been part of her real life.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, Ms. Obst, 48, checked out the curly hair of an
actor to see if it looked enough like Bob Dylan's to fill the part
of the bard, who would be glimpsed briefly from behind in this
scene. She recalled skipping school as a girl growing up in
Westchester County, N.Y., and rushing to this exact spot in the
hope of seeing Dylan. (The best she could manage, she said, was a
peek at Buffy Sainte-Marie and snaring a button that read, ``Hands
Off Lenny Bruce.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a `Roots' for boomers,'' Ms. Obst said. ``We want to
reinspire that sense of passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Fiskin, one of the screenwriters, added: ``We were
shameless grave robbers of our own lives for this. But I know what
I hope. I hope young people will say, `I wish I lived then,' or
that they say, `I can make the times what I want.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s are not the villain,'' Fiskin said. ``They're the
good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brewster, who is 18, said she was not so sure. She described
the kind of rebellion she was re-enacting as ``a phase every kid
goes through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' she said. ``Kids want to relive sort of
the hippie experience, wear Birkenstocks, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brewster has special reason to feel a sympathetic interest
in those times; her grandfather was Kingman Brewster, who, as the
president of Yale University during the 1960s, was accused of
tolerating draft evaders and defending indirectly the Black
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Brewster remarked: ``It's kind of ridiculous to be
envious of the '60s. I'm not envious. I'm glad I'm living it
vicariously. I don't think we can afford that innocence anymore. We
don't have the repression to rebel against. No kid my age is
allowed to be that free, that promiscuous, to experience that much,
because of the consequences of everything now.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I think kids will be a little depressed watching
this, that there's not something now to rebel against.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton expressed similar sentiments. ``When I was younger, I
was depressed that I'd been born in the wrong era,'' he said. ``I'd
missed my time to be alive. But we don't have the war to galvanize
us all.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's been almost a campaign waged against the
'60s to make it into a failure, to make political activism unhip.
This age of irony we're in now, it disturbs me. But it is such a
different time. It can't be helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Obst and her team are not the only boomers in Hollywood
eager to portray those times more positively.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grazer, for example, was the producer of Oliver Stone's
tumultuous 1991 movie ``The Doors.'' The film showed rock-and-roll
icon Jim Morrison as perhaps brilliant but certainly out of control
as he flung himself into a cycle of self-absorption and destruction
that snuffed out his life at the age of 27, in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, that was seen as the symbol for the '60s,''
Grazer said. Four years later, however, he produced ``Apollo 13,''
which found real heroes from the '60s and put the era in a very
different light. The film received a far more enthusiastic response
at the box office than he had ever imagined. So Grazer helped
produce the huge HBO mini-series ``From the Earth to the Moon,''
which was broadcast earlier this year. ( Fiskin wrote one of the
episodes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to use the space program to say there was
something good at that time,'' Grazer said. ``Subconsciously, I
admit it: we were mythologizing the space program. We were very
excited about the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Obst said she had her sights clearly fixed on posterity.
``I'm concerned that my kids learn about what we did, that they not
forget the struggle,'' she said. ``I guess their not caring is the
worst thing, just after their thinking it was a waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped at the chance of doing this because young people have
been discouraged from taking the '60s seriously, or as something
positive. This is when everything happened. This is when it all
started. Good and bad, but definitely good.''

FOR SOME, IT REALLY IS ABOUT GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Dec. 15)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are people out there who are the anti-Scrooge. Ga-ga about
giving, they dash into the malls, prance through crafts fairs and
jingle all the way.
</P>
<P>
   You may suspect they have been too long in the eggnog or doubt
their enthusiasm, since it is more popular to be cynical, to decry
crass commercialization and grump along with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I met one the other day who is fully, happily, giddily and
even sometimes expensively into shopping. She was wrapped in a
raincoat, throwing back a cup of coffee and gearing up to join the
swarm, hot on the trail of a certain potpourri.
</P>
<P>
   She's modest. She doesn't want any attention and if she could
she'd drop off her gifts and disappear like Santa Claus. I'll call
her Scarlet because when she was a little girl her favorite
Christmas gift was a Scarlet O'Hara doll in a green velvet dress,
which is pretty much all she'll say about being on the receiving
end. She's clearly about giving, our Scarlet.
</P>
<P>
   She does not shop out of guilt, dread or obligation. She may be
the only one in a long checkout line who is humming along with the
store's loudspeaker, celebrating her purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlet insists she loves shopping for other people. And by
shopping she does not mean grab, charge, and move on down the list.
She means seriously looking for the one item that will delight or
surprise, that winks to her as she walks through stores and says
``Doesn't this look just like Harry? Isn't this just perfect for
the neighbor who collects glass penguins?''
</P>
<P>
   But what, I wonder, about all this conspicuous consumption? What
about the pressure to buy furry little dolls with big eyes and home
exercise equipment?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, piffle, she says. ``I like to make people happy. I don't
think there is anything better.''
</P>
<P>
   She eavesdrops all year, like one of the elves, to hear what
people want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hear someone say `I always wanted,' or `I wish I had,'
and it clicks in my head. Then I'll go to great lengths to find it.
It's what I like to do. It's fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends have ended up with service for eight, plus color
coordinated tablecloth and napkins, after Scarlet has overheard
them longing for a nice set of dessert plates.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't even have to be close friends. Mention that you
know someone looking for yellow mittens and they'll likely be
stuffed in your mailbox a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends tell stories about her generosity, how even if you
mention a craving for lasagna she'll be bringing by a hot dish the
next day. I heard about her, tracked her down and asked if she had
a secret to pass along and perhaps ward off the December lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlet doesn't have time to analyze much. After all, there's
only three weeks before Christmas and she has about 40 people on
her list. But she makes it clear that she doesn't give gifts to win
someone's friendship, forgiveness, eternal gratitude or get on
their list for next year.
</P>
<P>
   She can even do without shows of appreciation. Recipients say
sometimes she'll leave something at the door and before you can say
thanks she's off down the sidewalk, waving goodbye over her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get embarrassed. I really don't do it for the thanks. It
just gives me pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was little she thought it would be a nice idea to give
her parents a Christmas stocking so she and her brother wouldn't be
the only one with goodies on Christmas morning. She put in some
peanut brittle and a ring for her mother from the dime store. They
were thrilled. She loved doing the thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   So, that is what the giver gets. The thrill of providing some
wonderful surprise, like Darren McGavin who gives his little boy a
BB gun in the movie ``A Christmas Story'' and then stands there
grinning and chuckling as the kid squirms with glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel lucky to be able to give to people,'' says
Scarlet. She is not a rich person. She works part-time and admits
to running up some whopper bills before Christmas. But they're paid
off for the next round of gift giving, which generally happens
around Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't begrudge one penny of what I spend.''
</P>
<P>
   I think what Scarlet is talking about is spontaneous, volunteer
giving, what some schmaltzy scribe would say is giving from the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, people are always moaning about Christmas getting so
commercial. They say it every year. But, you do have a choice if
you want to buy or not. No one's making you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if no one is, and it's just because you adore someone and
suddenly see this music box that plays his song and the personal
thrill is beyond ``great, I can cross him off my list,'' then you
get to sing ``Joy to the World'' all the way home.

ATTACKS ON JOURNALISTS RAISE NEW CONCERN IN MUSIC WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Perhaps hoping to derail the dangerous new trend
of violence by musicians against journalists, the publisher of Spin
magazine is pursuing both criminal and civil actions against
shock-rocker Marilyn Manson for an alleged attack on Spin executive
editor Craig Marks Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Vibe/Spin Ventures released a statement last week that reads:
``The increasing violence against music journalists ... is
profoundly disturbing. We hope that by drawing attention to these
matters, we can encourage members of the music community to resolve
their differences in a civilized manner.''
</P>
<P>
   This most recent incident _ involving Manson and Marks _ gave
every music journalist pause. These details were strangely
underreported in the mainstream press: At Manson's Hammerstein
Ballroom concert in New York City, Manson, who recently made
headlines for setting his dressing rooms on fire in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., asked Marks to come backstage after the show. When Marks got
there, Manson allegedly shook his hand, then hushed the backstage
crowd so he could announce to Marks, ``You know, I can kill you,
your family and everyone you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson then allegedly signaled his bodyguards, who shoved Marks,
37, against a wall, and lifted him up by his neck until his feet
were off the ground, choking him until he nearly passed out. Marks
had his bruises checked out at a nearby hospital; he then went to a
police station and filed a report. The police are investigating the
incident to determine whether criminal charged should be filed
against Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Manson so angry with Spin? Because Marks decided not to
use Manson, a two-time Spin cover boy with a penchant for
near-naked, gender-bending costumes, for the front of the January
``year in review'' issue. In other words, this was not payback for
a negative article or a bad review.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, who has stopped giving interviews now that litigation is
pending, last week told one of the Internet's largest music-news
sources, Sonicnet, that he thought the alleged attack was
premeditated, and that he was set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what (Manson) hoped to gain,'' Marks is quoted as
saying. ``It seems like an action that reeks of desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Interscope Records, Manson's label, is not talking about the
incident. And the normally vociferous Manson has remained silent
about the incident, although he noted on his Web site that he and
Marks had indeed had a ``conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him ... I simply no longer wanted to work with him or
his magazine that obviously has a lack of respect for musicians and
their fans.''

</P>
<P>
   The violence was not the first between artist and journalist.
Earlier this month, Jesse Washington, editor of the hip-hop
publication Blaze (also a Vibe/Spin publication), was attacked by
three men and seriously beaten, allegedly because of something he
wrote. He claimed that one of the attackers was hip-hop producer
Deric ``D-Dot'' Angelettie, who has now been charged with the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also alleged that this summer, former Fugee Wyclef
Jean pulled a gun on him during an argument about coverage of his
new album. Jean denies the claim and no charges have been filed in
that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, way back in the '70s, the hottest
musician-vs.-magazine feud anywhere was between the Eagles and
Rolling Stone. Fed up with R.S. dismissing them as faux California
Cowboys, the Eagles challenged the magazine writers to a softball
game. The stakes? Whoever won the game could write a story about it
in the hallowed pages of the rock publication.
</P>
<P>
   When the Eagles creamed the ``desk jockeys,'' they were
merciless in their hilarious write-up.

REPUBLICANS CAN'T FORCE THE `L' WORD OUT OF CLINTON LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: STANDS for CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT; story could go with
IMPEACH-STRATEGY)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has been ``misleading,''
``evasive,'' ``incomplete,'' and even ``maddening,'' in his
statements under oath and to the American people, but he has never
lied, White House Special Counsel Gregory Craig said Tuesday at
Clinton's impeachment hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Try as they might, Republican members of the House Judiciary
Committee could not get Craig to say the ``l'' word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Craig, did the president lie to the American people when
he said, `I never had sex with that woman'?'' asked Rep. Bob
Inglis, R-S.C., referring to Clinton's affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly misled and deceived ... '' Craig replied before
Inglis cut him off and said, ``Well, wait a minute now. Did he
lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig answered: ``He misled them and did not tell the truth at
that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Inglis paused a moment, shook his head and asked Craig again if
Clinton lied when he denied having an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he doesn't believe he did,'' Craig answered.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis, grimacing, asked how the president could believe he told
the truth. Craig said the president's idea of sex came from the
dictionary and that under the dictionary's definition, Clinton and
Lewinsky did not have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Although Craig did not say which dictionary the president used
for the definition, Webster's New World Dictionary, 2nd College
Edition, defines sex as ``anything connected with sexual
gratification or reproduction or the urge for these.'' However, a
second definition of the word defines it as ``sexual intercourse,''
which would exclude Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., pressed Craig from a different
angle, asking him how the president was not lying when he testified
to lawyers for Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit that he
could not remember whether he had been alone with Lewinsky. The
congressman said Clinton's testimony was particularly hard to
believe since according to Lewinsky's unchallenged testimony, the
president had had oral sex with the former intern eight times by
that point.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that the president's answer was ``evasive and
misleading'' but that Clinton had ``tried to be narrowly
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking a copy of Clinton's testimony in his hand, Canady said:
``I don't see how anyone in this country could believe that this
was a truthful answer in light of all the evidence that is before
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., attempted one last time to get
Craig to admit that Clinton lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think he (Clinton) has violated his oath to the
American people in telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not violate his oath,'' Craig said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously frustrated, Gallegly voiced what many of his
Republican colleagues _ including some moderate Republicans _ have
said publicly and privately. ``Quite frankly, this is an insult to
our intelligence and, frankly, indicates that the president is
still not telling the truth.''

`LIFE THE MOVIE': ALL THE WORLD'S A REEL AND MEN ARE CREDITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Jim Carrey's hit movie ``The Truman Show,'' a young man named
Truman Burbank discovers that his entire life has been grist for a
hit television show, that he was brought up by actors playing his
parents, married to a woman cast as his wife and sent out to live
and work on a huge stage set. His life is, literally, an ongoing
mini-series, the most watched home video ever made.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Life the Movie,'' the cultural historian Neal
Gabler suggests that Americans are all becoming Truman Burbank,
that life has become ``the biggest, most entertaining, most
realistic movie of all, one that played 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year, and featured a cast of billions.'' Even as the stratagems of
show business are infecting real life, turning journalism, politics
and religion into forms of entertainment, Gabler argues, reality is
challenging fiction in strangeness and surreality, creating ongoing
soap operas starring the likes of O.J. Simpson, Bill Clinton and
Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   This thesis, it's clear, grows out of Gabler's two impressive
earlier books: ``An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented
Hollywood'' (1988), which examined how Hollywood's Jewish moguls
reinvented themselves as Americans while producing movies that
created a fantasy version of the United States, and ``Winchell:
Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity'' (1994), which
portrayed the gossip columnist Walter Winchell as the avatar of
``the tabloid revolution'' that brought us the contemporary
concepts of celebrity and ``infotainment.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Gabler reprises many of the ideas from those earlier
volumes in ``Life the Movie,'' he also remains heavily indebted, as
he acknowledges, to the pioneering work of other thinkers like
Daniel Boorstin, Dwight Macdonald and Marshall McLuhan. The result
is an intermittently provocative but highly derivative book, a book
that tends to read like a discursive magazine article padded out to
hardcover length.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a large part of ``Life the Movie'' consists of other
writers' quotations, embroidered with Gabler's observations,
rebuttals and addendums. What Gabler calls the ``Zsa Zsa Factor'' _
a reference to Zsa Zsa Gabor, meaning, he says, ``fame that
required having to do no work to get it, save gaining media
exposure'' _ is really little more than a rephrasing of Boorstin's
definition of a celebrity as ``a person who is known for his
well-knownness.'' Gabler's arguments about fame and celebrity are
similarly indebted to Leo Braudy's ``Frenzy of Renown,'' just as
his arguments about television and show business owe a debt to Neil
Postman's ``Amusing Ourselves to Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-19th century, Gabler argues, popular culture has
been a more potent force in America than in Europe: for Americans,
he writes, entertainment was ``the cultural equivalent'' of Andrew
Jackson's political egalitarianism. Movies and television
galvanized the victory of popular entertainment over both high
culture and its middlebrow cousin, midcult, and promoted what
Gabler calls ``an epistemology in which all information, whatever
the source, was forced to become entertainment'' in order to
capture and hold the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Gabler argues that ``the first portal through which
entertainment slithered into life and then conquered it was
journalism'': with the appearance of the penny press of the 1830s,
more and more newspapers began focusing on sensational stories of
murder and sex _ a development taken to new heights by William
Randolph Hearst, who in Gabler's words, ``shifted the newspaper
decisively from its information function to its story function.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century later, television would appease the public's
ever growing hunger for entertainment by treating news events as
disparate as the O.J. Simpson case and the Persian Gulf war as
real-life prime-time dramas, complete with stars, supporting casts
and unfurling, serial plots.
</P>
<P>
   While television was discovering that politics could make good
entertainment, politicians were discovering that stagecraft could
help them shape public perception. Staged press conferences,
creative campaign ads, cynical photo-ops and marathon spin sessions
all became de rigueur, as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton
effectively turned politics into another branch of show business.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was politics the only arena of contemporary life to become a
thrall of entertainment. Gabler points out that television
evangelists like Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart ``recast the old
revival meeting as a television variety show,'' that more and more
sporting events have ``evolved from competitions to exhibitions''
and that contemporary intellectual debate often devolves into the
sort of ``staged fights'' featured on television shows like
``Crossfire'' and ``The McLaughlin Group.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of Gabler's observations _ or his citation of other
people's observations _ are interesting, he has an annoying
tendency to push his thesis so hard that he fails to make important
distinctions among the examples he cites.
</P>
<P>
   In writing about the importance of artists' public personas, for
instance, he lumps together serious figures like Hemingway and
Picasso with calculating wannabes like Jeff Koons and Julian
Schnabel. He suggests that without Hemingway's theatrics, only
``litterateurs were likely to pay'' his actual books any heed, and
asserts that Picasso ``used the very oddness of his work'' to
market himself to the public ``as an artistic caricature, a sort of
rarefied bird who painted paintings for rich idiots.'' )

   In his acknowledgments, Gabler notes that ``Life the Movie'' was
intended as ``an interstitial book between doorstop-sized
biographies of Walter Winchell and Walt Disney'' but found that the
project grew ``from interstitial to interminable.'' Unfortunately
for the reader, the book too often feels like both: interstitial
and interminable, as well as secondhand.

   What's so funny about a bottle of steak sauce, a can of beer or
a bag of caramel corn?
</P>
<P>
   Normally, not much _ unless you're Newman's Own steak sauce and
your label reads ``Preferred by 9 out of 10 cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you're a can of Miller Lite assuring consumers that ``Miller
Time is unaffected by Daylight Saving Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you're a bag of Lenny &AMP; Larry's caramel corn Power Pops,
encouraging snackers to ``Dump it all over the floor and roll in
it, devour it like a wild animal ...''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from their brethren in advertising, the folks who
design product labels seem to have discovered their sense of humor.
The witticisms range from self-deprecating jabs at the product to
irreverent designs to cheeky one-liners hidden in the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   Small, offbeat companies like Lenny &AMP; Larry's naturally have
more leeway to joke around on their packaging than their stodgy
multinational counterparts. But even a few mainstream corporations
are lightening up.
</P>
<P>
   Take Miller Brewing Co.'s Miller Lite brand. The beer cans are
covered with slapstick cracks like ``This beer has your name on it.
No, wait, it has our name on it. Whatever.'' and ``Union Made For
Your Drinking Pleasure'' and ``No Batteries Required.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-language version warns ``No Se Use En Pinatas.''
(Translated: Do not use in pinatas.)
</P>
<P>
   Snapple bottle tops inform drinkers they can ``Win Nothing
Instantly!'' and Lever Brothers' Surf laundry detergent would be
delighted for you to call with questions or ``if you think spending
an afternoon talking about laundry might be fun ... Operators are,
as they say, standing by.''
</P>
<P>
   Humorous packaging gives a product a distinct personality. Or it
becomes a forum for the packager's, uh, sillier side. Pasta-sauce
king Paul Newman, for instance, is responsible for much of the
vaudevillian humor on his Newman's Own line of edibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No label goes out without his approval,'' notes company Vice
President Bill Lee. ``This is not his main livelihood, so he ends
up trying to have fun with the business.'' (Note: Newman moonlights
as an actor.)
</P>
<P>
   Take the company's balsamic vinaigrette bottle: It features a
fantastical anecdote about two Italian brothers, Balsa and Mick,
who duel to their deaths, prompting their grieving mother, Violetta
Vinegar, to christen a new grape _ Balsa-Mick _ in their memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Newman's Own,'' the bottle reads, ``their names live
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's Own has, on occasion, been taken to task for its wit.
``People have gotten upset about a few of the labels,'' Lee admits.
Like the cartoon on the Caesar salad dressing bottle depicting ol'
Julius with a knife in his back: Too violent, folks complained.
Some vegetarians found the steak sauce quip a bit offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing compared with the furor a company called
Senate caused when it got a tad too cute with a clothing label:
``Machine wash cold. No bleach. Tumble dry low. Remove promptly.
Don't iron decorations. Destroy all girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate, which makes in-line skating accessories, chucked the
loaded phrase after the news media picked up on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention wasn't to be hateful,'' says marketing manager
and in-line skating notable Arlo Eisenberg. ``We were trying to be
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The company still makes strange cracks on its clothing labels.
Another tag reads: ``This would be a clever place to put something
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We challenge ourselves to be unconventional here,'' Eisenberg
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's Mixture, a Canadian cough suppressant recently
introduced in the United States, pulls no punches on its label. The
alcohol-free cough syrup, notes company President Frank Buckley on
the back of every box, has one problem: ``... to be real honest, it
tastes real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Calido Chile Traders uses a similarly unconventional selling
point for its Batch No. 114 Jamaican Hot Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain,'' reads the label, ``is good.''
</P>

TEXAS GROUP LEADS NATIONAL PUSH FOR MANDATORY HEARING TESTS FOR
NEWBORNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sleeping newborns, row upon row, are wheeled out of the nursery
and into the quiet room next door. Most hardly stir as the tiny
probe makes a soft click in their ears.
</P>
<P>
   But that small click is important. The sound that echoes back is
analyzed by computer to determine how well the infant's ear is
hearing. On average, one of every 300 babies is found to have some
hearing loss. If the problem is detected at this early stage, it
could possibly save the infant countless hours of frustration and
lost learning opportunities, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose your baby couldn't hear. How could she tell you? asks
Terese Finitzo, the clinical audiologist who heads the Sounds of
Texas project, an innovative effort to screen all newborns for
hearing loss before they leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about potential and letting the child develop
normally,'' said Finitzo, who also currently leads the national
Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, which advocates universal
newborn screening. The committee includes the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the American Academy of Otolaryngology and several
hearing and education groups as well as representatives from state
health departments.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds of Texas, which began in Fort Worth and Dallas, is one of
11 statewide screening programs nationwide. Serving about 70,000
babies annually, it's also the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of infant hearing screening programs note that the
tests are quick, inexpensive and painless; more importantly, they
can prevent delays in language development and socialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies can't tell you that they can't hear, and parents,
pediatricians _ all of us _ tend to mistakenly label toddlers and
preschoolers as behavior problems when the reality is, they can't
hear, and we don't know it,'' Finitzo said. ``Hearing loss is
typically not diagnosed until about age 3 in this country, and
that's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids with hearing problems often fail to distinguish phonetic
sounds and miss the key building blocks of language development.
The problems come to the forefront when the kids are old enough to
begin reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who do not hear well do not learn language well, and
children who do not know language do not learn to read well. If we
get them help early, they develop normally,'' Finitzo said. ``The
detection of hearing impairments allows us to connect children to
services that can help them reach their full potential and have the
best opportunity to be productive adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can prevent illiteracy,'' Finitzo said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ian Herring, who will be 3 in February, Sounds of Texas has
already made a difference. Ian was diagnosed with a mild to
moderate hearing loss the day he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total shock. He was perfectly healthy with no known
risk factors, and we have no family history of hearing problems. We
would not even have thought to ask for a hearing test,'' said Julie
Herring of Watauga, a suburb of Fort Worth. ``Ian got hearing aids
by the time he was 6 months, and he wears them full time except
when he's asleep. He hasn't had any trouble with them because he
realized real early that they make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A teacher with the deaf program at Snow Heights Elementary works
with the family to teach Ian to listen to sounds, and to reinforce
his speech with speech therapy and sign language.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a speech evaluation at the first of the year when he
was turning 2, and he was right on track for a normal 2-year-old.
He definitely would have missed out on a lot if we had not found
out about his hearing loss so early,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Finitzo said this kind of progress is not unusual when the
hearing problem is identified early. ``We now have very good
research to show that if we can find these babies at birth and get
them into a program before they are six months of age, they will
have normal or near-normal language development by age 3.
Follow-ups at age 5 show they maintain those gains,'' Finitzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, an average of three Texas babies is born with some
degree of hearing defficulty. If every Texas baby born this year
were screened, about 960 would be identified with hearing losses,
the Texas Health Department estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Sounds of Texas has so far identified about 2,400 babies
with mild to profound hearing losses at birth. Cost for testing is
about $25 to $30 per baby.
</P>
<P>
   Finitzo is scheduled to meet with the governor's committee on
early childhood initiatives Thursday in Austin, the state capital,
and hopes to get a bill introduced in the next session of the
Legislature to mandate universal newborn screening throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my goal is to demonstrate to legislators and the
governor that this is a way of really changing the lives of a lot
of children in Texas,'' said Finitzo.

CUSTOMERS PAY THROUGH THE NOSE FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Woody Harrelson's new ``super-oxy-herbar'' in trendy West
Hollywood, health-conscious consumers can follow up their Shaman
pizza with a snort of joy.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``joy''-scented oxygen-enriched air, $15 for 20 minutes.
Not in the mood for joy? Try ``clarity,'' or ``energy,'' or
``mint-flavored'' air for the same price.
</P>
<P>
   Plain air will set ya back 13 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Why would people buy oxygen when, supposedly, it is in plentiful
supply right under their noses? Isn't free air good enough anymore?
Is it even legal to suck up this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Let's take those questions one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The November opening of Harrelson's O2 (that's ``oh-two'')
planted oxygen bars on the communal radar screen for the first time
since their inconspicuous American debut in 1996. Mimicking a trend
that started in Japan, more than 60 oxygen bars operate in the
United States, according to Mark Zarubi at the National Oxygen Bar
Association (NOBA) in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Don't waste your time looking for one in Texas, though. State
laws have thus far prevented any authorized oxygen-snorting venues
from opening.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen bars developed based on the belief that purer air
promotes better health: The air we breathe normally contains 21
percent oxygen; depending on the method of delivery an oxygen bar
uses, it can theoretically provide air containing up to 99 percent
oxygen. Whether that's actually beneficial is up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   By law, oxygen bars can't make any medical claims. But they can,
and do, promote themselves as a sort of groovy way to spend a
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat it like a new experience, (like) bungee jumping,''
says Kevin McFarland, chief of operations for O2 Zone LLC in Reno.
``It's a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   McFarland sells equipment and ``know-how'' to oxygen bars all
over the world. He has helped establish 51 in the United States, he
says, plus bars in Antwerp, Milan, Taiwan, Rio de Janeiro and, most
recently, Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   A typical session at a McFarland-supplied oxygen bar might go
something like this: Take a seat at the counter and pick your
flavor _ tropical punch, tangerine twist, lime smoother, eucalyptus
mist, etc. ... Drape the clear polyethylene tubing over your ears
and in front of your nose so that the two tiny plastic prongs are
pointing at your nostrils (sounds very attractive, no?). Now,
breathe deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might choose a ``facial cascade,'' available at
McFarland's Scottsdale, Ariz., location. Place the Darth Vader-like
hood over your face and let the oxygen shower your kisser.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland, an engineer who bought the O2 Zone from Zarubi in
March, believes the potential customer base for oxygen bars is huge
_ even if the vast majority of users never return for a second
shot. NOBA's Web site optimistically predicts oxygen-bar
entrepreneurs can ``turn 25 cents into a $20 bill,'' and the
organization sells a $79.95 information manual to parties
interested in opening their own oxygen establishments.
</P>
<P>
   But the business side of the oxygen-bar phenomenon can get a
little sticky _ especially when the federal government's official
position is that the bars shouldn't be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know of any instance where someone could
operate an oxygen bar without being in violation'' of Food and Drug
Administration regulations, says FDA spokesman Brad Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA considers medical oxygen, Oxygen USP, a drug, and as
such it is available only by prescription. The plastic tubing
apparatus that delivers the oxygen from the tank, called a medical
cannula, is also available by prescription only.
</P>
<P>
   But oxygen bars have finagled around most state and federal
measures in a few ways. First, most don't use medical oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland's clients dispense either aviation oxygen, the kind
pilots use, or oxygen produced by generators that separate O2 from
the surrounding air. Both of those can deliver air with up to 99
percent oxygen, the same as medical oxygen, but are not
specifically regulated by federal and most state agencies. (The
only difference between aviation oxygen and medical oxygen is that
the former doesn't undergo the same strict pharmaceutical controls
placed on the latter, says Angela Bensel in the Texas Department of
Health Drug and Medical Devices Division.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, the cannulas McFarland sells are slightly different from
medical cannulas and therefore not prescription devices.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the FDA's jurisdiction extends only to interstate
commerce, meaning it can stop businesses from sending prescription
equipment and drugs across state lines, but otherwise has little
direct authority. Because McFarland avoids dealing in prescription
oxygen and devices, he is not in any direct violation of the rule.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland and Zarubi say they have been operating with the FDA's
tacit approval for almost two years. Zarubi, who opened the
original O2 Zone oxygen bar in February 1997, says an FDA official
even visited his operation ``with pen and paper in hand, ready to
issue a citation, and upon seeing our process, he couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the FDA's assertion that no oxygen bar, as they are
typically conceived, could be operating legitimately, the agency
has taken limited action against the businesses. According to
Stone, most of the oxygen bars that the FDA has become aware of
have either failed financially or have been closed by state or
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA ``has had more than ample opportunity to squash this
thing for at least two years now, and they've chosen not to,''
Zarubi notes. ``They'll tell people oxygen bars are illegal, but
they don't take any action against it. One, because they don't have
the power to do it, and two, because there's really no law against
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The true test of survival for oxygen bars will likely be whether
the general public buys into the novelty or accepts the purported
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of oxygen therapies contend that inhaling the gas
boosts energy levels and can help relieve a variety of ailments,
including headaches, allergies and depression. Some users have even
suggested it improves their sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream science is skeptical of these claims, at best. ``For
normal people, I can't imagine it's going to do a whole lot,'' says
Dr. Alvin Mathe, director of the Wound Healing and Hyperbaric
Medicine Center at the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas. ``It
may provide a brief period where you feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathe notes that the hemoglobin in our blood is already 98
percent to 99 percent saturated with oxygen. Upping that another
percentage point isn't going to make a significant or long-term
difference. Plus, to get the pure oxygen from a tank into your
body, you would need either a very tight-fitting mask or ``a tube
down your throat,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Devices like the one described earlier _ with the two prongs
shooting gas toward the nostrils _ allow much of the oxygen to
escape, Mathe says. ``With those cannulas, if you work hard, you
can get it to 35 percent oxygen,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, breathing a half-hour's worth of concentrated oxygen
every now and again probably can't hurt you either, Mathe says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the aromatherapy aspect of the experience probably is a
pleasant effect. When you think about it, for $15, it's a
relatively cheap way of putting a little joy in your life.

thought we ought to cut and run. I thought the tent people would
calm easily. They did, and a few hung around to talk. These, after

times, Sandy will say, ``My husband kidnapped me and stabbed me and
tortured me and I almost died and God knows why I didn't.'' And
unless you already know the story, you think surely she must be
exaggerating. Because who on Earth could survive all that? This is

COMPANIES VOW TO HELP SAVE OLD-GROWTH FORESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than two dozen U.S. corporations, half of
them Fortune 500 companies, have promised to stop using or selling
paper and other wood products made from the world's disappearing
old-growth trees.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark Cards, 3M Corp., Starbucks Coffee Co., IBM Corp.,
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. are among a growing list
of top corporations that have pledged to find substitutes for
lumber and pulp gleaned from the dwindling store of the planet's
virgin forests, trees hundreds of years old that shelter species of
animals, birds and insects.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven U.S. companies have made the pledge, according to
the Coastal Rainforest Coalition, a group of environmental
organizations including the Natural Resources Defense Council,
Rainforest Action Network and Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that, on a large scale, American
corporate leaders have sent the signal to the marketplace that they
no longer want to purchase wood-based products that originate from
ancient forests,'' said Michael Marks, executive director of the
nonprofit Coastal Rainforest Coalition in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies collectively represent nearly $2 billion of
the U.S. paper and package markets,'' he said. ``They're saying to
the producers of alternative tree-free paper, certified wood and
recycled fibers that there is a market.''
</P>
<P>
   A full-page ad in Tuesday's New York Times, paid for by the
coalition, praises the businesses for earning green points with the
public for helping to save the last of the untouched temperate and
tropical forests, mainly in British Columbia, the United States,
Brazil, Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   At Levi Strauss, scrap denim from plants around the country is
used by an Albuquerque, N.M., mill to make the company's
letterhead, envelopes, note pads and most other corporate paper, a
project that began in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our desire to be environmentally responsible,''
Derek van Bronkhorst, the company's public affairs director, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kinko's Inc. is taking a similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to be a political instrument of any type,''
said Larry Rogera, environmental manager of Kinko's, which has 900
stores nationwide. ``We realized that commerce can have a negative
or positive impact on the environment. We think if we're going to
be around on a long-term basis we need to do things sustainably.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hallmark Cards in Kansas City, spokeswoman Julie O'Dell said:
``It's our policy to work only with suppliers who do not derive any
products from logging old-growth forests.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainforest Action Network says only 20 percent of the
world's old-growth forests are left _ only 5 percent of which are
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to preserve the forests began more than a decade
ago, starting with a worldwide effort to save the Amazon. More
recently, the focus turned toward British Columbia's Clayoquot
Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, environmentalists widened the battle to include
products made from old-growth trees.

 &HT;    HEARINGS AND THE TALK SHOW WORLD MERGE AT THE CAPITOL
 &HT;    570&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Equipped with a cell phone and descriptions of her
prey, Kerri Forrest trolled tirelessly for guests Tuesday in the
corridors outside the hearing room where the House Judiciary
Committee is considering the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive,'' explained the ambitious young booking
producer for the MSNBC cable TV network. ``You're always trying to
get to somebody before they show up on some other network's air.''
</P>
<P>
   Booking producers are big game hunters in a media jungle where
the quarry glides seamlessly between TV talk shows and the
televised hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has the same information coming out of the committee
room,'' said Teri Schultz, a freelance producer who was working
Tuesday with CNN correspondent Bob Franken. ``We want Bob to have
something that everyone else doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   However, scoops are hard to come by for the correspondents and
producers on the 24-hour news channels where White House scandal
has been a programming staple for nearly a year now. The same
people say the same things over and over again. Only the setting
can cue viewers where the action is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y., is being
interrogated by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the venue is the Judiciary
Committee hearing. But if Holtzman is answering similar questions
from Chris Mathews, it's MSNBC's ``Hardball'' talk show. In both
places, she's saying that Clinton should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   If Reps. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and Barney Frank, D-Mass., are asking
questions in front of blue curtains, it's the hearing. If they're
talking to Fred Graham with the Capitol dome in the background,
it's Court TV. Both places, Barr and Frank are disagreeing.
</P>
<P>
   Only a three-minute walk separates the hearing room from the
makeshift studios set up on the same floor of the Rayburn House
Office Building. Some witnesses and committee members could make
the trek blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shortage of people here who want to jump in front
of cameras,'' said Carter Yang, a producer with ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for producers is to get the right person in front
of their cameras at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   So, producers keep an eye on a monitor showing what's going on
in the hearing room, and an ear on a cell phone conversation with a
desired member's press aide. They patrol the halls for witnesses.
They trade gossip with congressional staffers, colleagues and
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Luck is frequently a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this morning that _ just by accident _ Reuters TV had
caught David Kendall (the president's private attorney) coming into
the building. The Reuters crew was there waiting for the release of
files on Frank Sinatra,'' said Schultz. ``An entrance shot is a
pretty big thing in TV, and CNN is a Reuters client. So I called up
and got a dub.''
</P>
<P>
   John Oglunik, a producer for National Public Radio, recalled
waiting for Rep. Lamar Smith, a Judiciary Committee member, to
finish another interview so he could get the Texas Republican in
front of a microphone. On deadline, ``I needed a Republican for
balance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oglunik sought help from a fellow he took to be a Smith staffer,
but who actually was Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican Judiciary
committee member from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte ``turned out to be a wonderful interview,'' said
Oglunik.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio and some cable TV news channels provide
gavel-to-gavel coverage when the hearings are in session, so the
scramble comes during breaks. ``We pounce on them,'' admitted
Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondents covering the hearing from inside the room can
``talk through'' a 10-minute break, said Oglunik, but producers
need guests to fill any longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We avoid the witnesses'' as interview subjects, said Graham,
the on-air correspondent for Court TV. By the time the committee
has finished questioning them, ``every witness is wrung dry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The producers' workdays are often impossibly long. At 6:30 on
Tuesday morning, Schultz was with a CNN camera crew outside the
McLean, Va., home of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. By 9 a.m.,
she was in the Rayburn Building for the committee hearing expected
to last late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 hours of news programming to fill every day, the
appetite for interviews and talk show guests is insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure, but it's fun,'' said Forrest.
``Every day can bring a triumph.''

GREG CRAIG PUTS A GENTLER FACE ON A STUBBORN WHITE HOUSE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Blue chip Washington lawyer Gregory Bestor Craig
relied on boyish charm, a deferential manner and the indignation of
a father of five to put a fresh face Tuesday on the White House
defense of President Clinton against threatened impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a 53-year-old Yale Law School classmate of the president
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, treated the House Judiciary
Committee to a low key defense of the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel is exploring the possibility of impeachment in
conjunction with Clinton's sexual relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and his attempt to cover up the
liaison with perjurious testimony, obstruction of justice and abuse
of the powers of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Craig told the committee that the White House would mount a
``powerful case'' against impeachment, based upon the testimony of
15 witnesses over two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open your mind; open your heart and focus on the record,''
Craig implored the committee. ``Just as no fancy language can
obscure the simple fact that what the president did was morally
wrong, no amount of rhetoric can change the legal reality that
there are no grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig's earnest manner offered a sharp contrast to last month's
combative presentation before the same committee by his former law
partner, David Kendall, whose rapid-fire, sharp-edged questions to
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr reflected White House efforts to
make Starr _ not Clinton _ the focus of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Without the edge, Craig pitched the same contentions that
Clinton did not lie in a civil suit deposition last January; that
Clinton did not commit perjury in his nationally televised Aug. 17
grand jury testimony; that Clinton did not obstruct justice by
helping Lewinsky find a job; and that Clinton did not abuse his
office by exerting claims of executive privilege or misleading
aides about an extramarital relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Craig conceded at one point that Clinton may even face criminal
prosecution after leaving office for allegedly misleading a U.S.
District Court in his January deposition in the Paula Jones civil
sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jones settled the case for $850,000 last month.
Critics contend that Clinton misled the court about the nature of
his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If did mislead a court under oath, that would be wrong; it
would be unlawful,'' Craig told the committee. ``Most people that
are working with the president in the defense believe that is a
very likely possibility in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the style of Craig's presentation was designed
to appeal to moderate Republicans who hold the key to whether the
full House votes to impeach Clinton. Such a move would send the
case to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote next week on any articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at the behest of his wife Hillary, hired Craig as a
White House lawyer on Sept. 10, the day after Starr presented his
sexually explicit findings about the Lewinsky affair to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton was looking for a politically
savvy lawyer who could orchestrate the legal, political and
congressional strategy to combat threatened impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was serving at the time as the director of policy planning
at the State Department, a prestigious post once held by George
Kennan, the mastermind of Cold War containment of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Craig had built a reputation in the nation's capital as a man to
see in crisis. Craig, who had served as senior aide to Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., during the 1980s, endeared himself to the
Kennedy clan by guiding the senator through his ticklish,
nationally broadcast testimony in the 1991 Palm Beach, Fla., rape
trial of his nephew, William Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was acquitted. Kennedy subsequently won a tough fight for
re-election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Craig helped orchestrate the successful insanity defense of John
W. Hinckley Jr., following Hinckley's attempt to assassinate
President Ronald Reagan three months after taking office in 1981.

 &HT;    Carey, `Line' cronies test recipes for comedy
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' is as refreshing as its title is
unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best situation comedies run on certain formulas: exit
lines, laugh tracks, wacky neighbors. But ``Line'' is a game show
where the situation is always fluid and unpredictability is the
only certainty. This means it doesn't always work, but even when it
starts to falter, it's already moved on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Drew Carey, ``Line'' is an American rip-off (money did
change hands) of a long-running British game that played on cable
here. Carey and an audience throw ideas and situations at four
hyperactive but intensely focused improvisational comics (including
Ryan Stiles, a supporter on Carey's hit ABC sitcom) and let 'em
rip.
</P>
<P>
   So one guy's going to an imaginary party and has to impersonate
a human pinball machine, and another one's on a ``Dating Game''
where he gets an electrical shock every time he has an impure
thought. A woman from the audience is yanked onstage and given an
off-the-cuff serenade, and a mock newscast features a sports anchor
who thinks he's an emotional preacher giving a eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Line'' was a moderate hit as a summer replacement series, but
ABC, which only sort of gets it, went with ``The Secret Lives of
Men'' for its big fall lineup. ``Men'' tanked, so ``Line'' is back
to fill in. Don't get too attached to it, though; rumor is ABC is
readying a new sitcom with Norm Macdonald for the time slot in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   There ought to be room for ``Line.'' It's dirt-cheap to make,
gets decent ratings and makes us hope that network TV is capable of
doing something besides churning out the same old chain letters.
Maybe ABC execs ought to get an electrical shock every time they
think about taking it away again.

 &HT;    Without camp, bio of Susann falls flat
 &HT;    By Lee Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From its opening shot of a high-heeled, bathing suit-clad
authoress strolling poolside to the strains of Tom Jones' ``She's a
Lady,'' ``Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story'' seems to
have limitless camp possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But as the flashbacks begin, it quickly becomes apparent that
``Scandalous Me'' (9 tonight E.S.T. on USA) is a run-of-the-mill TV
movie, and the unintentional laughs will be few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Susann (Michele Lee), a failed actress who became a best-selling
writer in the late '60s and early '70s with such potboilers as
``Valley of the Dolls,'' ``The Love Machine'' and ``Once Is Not
Enough,'' yearns to please her demanding father, a Philadelphia
portrait painter. Marriage, childbirth, small parts in TV shows and
hobnobbing with the rich and famous don't satisfy her. Scenes of
infidelity, physical illness, mental problems, booze and pills _ or
``dolls,'' as Susann affectionately calls them _ are blandly
trotted out.
</P>
<P>
   After a bout with breast cancer (which she eventually died of in
1974), she pleads with God to give her 10 more years so she can
achieve success.
</P>
<P>
   Here, about halfway through the movie (when most viewers will
have long lost interest), Susann realizes her purpose and begins
transforming her diaries into trashy best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, ``Scandalous Me'' picks up steam, showing the
pushy Susann barnstorming the country to publicize her books. She
bullies agents and publishers and cajoles and flatters bookstore
owners to carry her merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by her producer-husband, Irving Mansfield (Peter
Riegert), Susann became one of the first modern brand-name authors,
churning out three No. 1 best sellers and helping to pave the way
for Danielle Steel and Jackie Collins. She brought previously taboo
subjects such as oral sex into publishing's mainstream long before
the Starr report hit the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the author from her 20s to her 50s, Lee captures the
energy and drive that made Susann a media celebrity. She even
resembles Susann, whose lacquered wigs and fossilized appearance in
bright Day-Glo minis and pantsuits prompted Truman Capote to call
her a truck driver in drag.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Scandalous Me'' doesn't shrink from portraying the
less flattering qualities of Susann, it nevertheless treads lightly
on other issues, such as bisexuality. (Apparently, Susann had a
thing for Ethel Merman, which is never fully explored.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps audiences will have to wait till next year for a fuller
portrait of Susann, when Bette Midler appears in a feature film on
the flamboyant author's life. Maybe that one will make us care.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: 1 Doll.

HAUTE HITS NEW HEIGHTS IN NEW YORK DINNER PRICES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some numbers rise to the level of poetry. The 35
that's attached to the dollar sign that's attached to the leek and
potato soup at Lespinasse is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that the Chrysler Building is more than a
building, the $35 soup, teeming with white truffles and
langoustines, is more than a soup. It is a symbol, a beacon, a
shiny new prototype in the grand factory of Manhattan restaurant
dining. With a stroke of the pen, Christian Delouvrier, the new
chef at Lespinasse, has raised haute to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five dollars?'' asked Alan Stillman, the president of
the New York Restaurant Group, speaking, with an audible gasp, from
Las Vegas, where he was overseeing the opening of a new Smith &AMP;
Wollensky. ``You sure that's for one person? Maybe it's for six.''
</P>
<P>
   It's for one.
</P>
<P>
   In crude economic terms, the soup is a lagging indicator, proof
positive that the long shadow cast by the stock market crash of
1987, a calamity that took down the $35 plate of pasta right along
with it, is well and truly over. No one has set off fireworks. The
price of a roast-chicken entree has barely budged in the last
decade. But clever restaurant owners have engineered their menus to
give their customers every opportunity to rack up big bills, from
the mineral water and aperitif that start the meal to the desserts
that finish it off. And diners do not seem to be in the mood to say
no.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers say they've seen the evidence on their
restaurant checks for the last three years. ``I'm stunned by the $9
bottled water, which is just sort of slipped in there at the
beginning of the meal,'' said Andrea Schwan, a public relations
consultant who represents architects and designers. ``It's like,
`Will it be still or sparkling?' I feel like saying, `Well, I'd
really like Chateau Giuliani,' but you feel it's part of the
experience, so you just go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's the simple salad that somehow crept up, from $7
to $10, or the side order of garlic mashed potatoes, for $7.50. For
others, it's the 12-ounce cup of hot and sour shrimp from Daily
Soup that runs $7.95 (served with a wedge of bread, a piece of
fruit and cookie), or the lunch-time entree that cracks the $30
barrier, like the sauteed veal chops at Limoncello. The examples
may differ but the song is the same: dining in the city has become
very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for their definition of a moderately priced meal,
several diners agreed that $50 was about right, compared with $35
just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? New Yorkers react to food prices the same way they
react to crime. No matter what the statistics say, city residents
can be counted on to tell pollsters that crime is on the rise. The
diner who has just been mugged by a bottle of sparkling water
priced like a designer fragrance ($5 for a half liter at the ``21''
Club and $12 a liter at Harry Cipriani) is likewise inclined to
believe that restaurant prices have gone through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing the city has to a database on restaurant
prices is the annual Zagat Survey, which, although comprehensive,
must be read with a certain degree of caution, since the
information comes from an army of unmonitored volunteers. According
to the 1999 survey, which includes data through the end of June
1998, the price of a dinner, defined as an appetizer, an entree and
a drink, has risen from $29.38 in mid-1994 to $31.68, an increase
of almost 8 percent. For the 20 most expensive restaurants in the
city, the price of a dinner rose from $63.45 to $68.56, also an 8
percent increase. In the last year, prices rose 3.2 percent
overall, but less than 0.5 percent for the 20 most expensive
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   So, why do many diners feel as though they are spending a lot,
lot more when they go out to eat? Probably because they are, even
though their spending patterns are not likely to be reflected in
the Zagat Survey.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my clients are telling me that their checks are up
dramatically, but I can't remember the last time any of them have
raised prices,'' said Gary Levy, a partner in Arthur D. Levy, an
accounting firm whose clients include Bouley Bakery, Jean-Georges,
Aquavit and Mesa Grill. ``The smarter operators realize that if you
train your staff to sell properly, you get a higher check
average.''
</P>
<P>
   The operators are making sure that their staff members have
something to sell. While holding the line on the basic roast
chicken, they have added enticing options at the higher price
ranges, loaded on higher-priced specials, expanded their lists of
wine by the glass, pushed the bottled water hard and in general
(very much like car dealers) festooned their menus with so many
tempting options that the Zagat figure seems more like a
theoretical construct than an achievable goal.
</P>
<P>
   Pastry, a high-markup category, plays a much greater role than
it did even a few years ago, with pastry chefs getting their own
menus and star billing not only at restaurants like Le Cirque 2000
or Gramercy Tavern but at more modest establishments like 27
Standard or Club Raleigh at the Oaks. Wine by the glass, another
profit center, has taken off as well, in part thanks to fancy new
vacuum dioxide machines that make it possible to open an expensive
bottle and preserve it for as long as a week.
</P>
<P>
   The once-standard $5 glass of pedestrian California chardonnay
(these days more like $8) now inhabits a thickly populated list
that teems with money-making opportunities, especially among the
lesser-known brands that can take a big mark-up, since customers
are unlikely to know the retail price. At Veruka in SoHo, most
customers will know that $9 for a glass of 1995 Rosemount Estate is
not much of a value, since the wine sells at retail for $10, but
will they know how to size up the $18 price tag on a glass of 1993
Ferrari-Carano cabernet? (It retails for about $23.)
</P>
<P>
   At every turn diners have every opportunity to spend big.
``We've gone the option route,'' said Steve Scher, an owner of
Union Pacific. ``We have a $59 prix fixe menu, which we regard as
good value, but the also menu presents you with options to build a
meal that results in a more expensive check.'' A little foie gras
here, a flight of amuses-bouche there, an excursion into the $110
tasting menu _ it can add up.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific is not alone. Fixed-price fever has gripped the
city's restaurants, despite its paradoxical nature. Diners like
prix fixe because they know in advance what the check will be.
Restaurants like it because it commits diners to a meal that may
very well be more expensive than the one they would order a la
carte, especially since it commits customers to eating desserts.
``Within the confines of a prix fixe menu, you can hide all sorts
of extravagant items,'' said Drew Nieporent, whose Myriad Group
owns Nobu, the Tribeca Grill and other high-end restaurants. ``A
$75 menu is probably a $25 appetizer, a $35 entree and a $15
dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owners have been hesitant to do much more than nickel
and dime the menu on the basic appetizers and entrees. When le
Cirque 2000 opened, its owner, Sirio Macchioni, declared a two-year
freeze on prices. Fear not, the rack of lamb holds steady at $38.
Rather than hike prices at Arizona 206, the Santo family shut the
place down and installed Bolivar, a moderately priced South
American restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not feel a renovation was enough of a rationale for
higher prices,'' said Andy D'Amico, a partner in the Santo Family
Group, which owns the restaurant. The group is currently shopping
for the kind of grand premises that will enable it to position
Arizona 206 as a haute-Southwestern restaurant with prices to
match.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox. New York, flush with Wall Street money, has
a lot of loose change jangling in its pockets. But restaurant
owners who remember the last recession are reluctant to raise menu
prices across the board, especially with increased competition from
a rush of new high-priced restaurants. It takes a grand opening, or
the arrival of an important chef, like Delouvrier, making a major
statement, to crank prices up to a heroic level. like the $22 prawn
cocktail at the newly opened Rage, or the $26 pumpkin risotto at La
Fourchette, another newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see the prices at Lespinasse, we get an overall
impression that there's fluidity in the market, but there is a
certain threshhold that, if you cross it, you have to justify it,''
said John Harding, the vice president of marketing at Restaurant
Associates, the group that owns Cafe Centro and Tropica. The money
is out there, in other words, but restaurants have to employ guile
and stealth to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Which still leaves one question about the $35 soup. ``As an
Italian,'' Macchioni said, ``I have to wonder, what are white
truffles doing in a soup to begin with?''

 &HT;    LAWMAKER SAYS U.N. KNEW RWANDAN GENOCIDE WAS PLANNED
 &HT;    430 words
 &HT;

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney on Tuesday released two
documents she says support claims that the United Nations knew
about the 1994 Rwandan genocide before it occurred, but did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, D-Ga., also asked at a press conference that an
independent international organization be established to
investigate the United Nations' activities before, during and after
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of such a commission would not be primarily to pass
judgment on the decisions and those who made them, but to establish
truth,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is of paramount importance to know what the United Nations
and the United States knew of the possibility of genocide and
massive killings in Rwanda and why they did not move to prevent
this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500,000 people from the Tutsi ethnic minority and
moderates from the Hutu majority died in the mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   One document released was a February 1994 interoffice memorandum
addressed to Force Commander Canadian Gen. Romero Dallaire.
</P>
<P>
   The letter states that a ``serious threat'' was in the area and
that a group was planning ``murder against Mr. Lando (Landoald
Ndsingwa) and Mr. Joseph Kavaruganda.''
</P>
<P>
   When the genocides began in April 1994, both Ndsingwa,
co-founder of Rwanda's Parti Liberal, and Kavaruganda, president of
the constitutional council, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Another document released at the press conference is a 1995
letter from Dallaire to senior U.N. officials. McKinney said the
letter is evidence that the general was concerned about the U.N.'s
failure to share with Belgium critical information about the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were unearthed by Michael Hourigan, a former
investigator for the War Crimes Tribunal, who says the information
was excluded from official U.N. accounts of the killings. The
Washington press conference was held at the same time Belgium Sen.
Alain Destexhe released the documents in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why has it taken over four years for all this precious
information to become available?'' McKinney asked. ``Do we even now
have it all, or are more secrets lurking in the vault of the U.N.
and the countries involved?''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, who sits on the International Relations and National
Security committees, has long been involved in African issues. In
May, she spearheaded an effort to hold hearings on the Rwandan
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney also is a staunch supporter of Congolese President
Laurent Kabila, who is now accused of ordering the executions and
imprisonment of political foes.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations representatives could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.

REP. BONO CHALLENGES CLINTON LAWYER TO EXPLAIN LIES TO KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Mary Bono, the widowed mother of two young
children, asked President Clinton's lawyer Tuesday how he explained
to his children ``that your president has lied and it's okay?''
</P>
<P>
   After White House special counsel Gregory Craig and other
Clinton defenders argued for more than four hours that the
president's infractions were not impeachable offenses, Bono engaged
Craig is a parent-to-parent chat about raising children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have small children at home?'' Bono inquired. ``What do
you tell them? How do you explain to them that the president has
lied and that it's okay?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the father of five, responded that he tells his children
that ``one of the reasons that the president is in such trouble is
that he did not tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He misled the American people, he misled his family, he misled
his colleagues,'' Craig said. ``And that was wrong. And the
president should have admitted that earlier. And that's a very
important lesson to the children of this country, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig conceded that if Clinton had misled a court in his
deposition in the Paula Jones civil sexual harassment suit, then
the president could face future criminal prosecution after he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people that are working with the president in the defense
believe that is a very likely possibility in the future,'' Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bono responded, ```I think this is the hardest thing for me, for
any parent, that we have looked at, we have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bono was elected in April to fill the seat left vacant after her
husband, comedian-turned-congressman Sonny Bono, was killed in a
skiing accident.
</P>
<P>
   The lone Republican woman on the House Judiciary panel and a
mother of a son Chesare, 10, and a daughter Chianna, 8, Bono says
she ``trys to avoid legal gymnastics,'' because she is one of three
nonlawyers on the 37-member committee. The others are Reps. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif., and Elton Gallegly, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
presented her at a news conference as the newest member of the
committee, Bono again echoed the parent theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I know our children will learn as much from what
we do as from what we say,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee don't expect
her to become entangled in the fine legal points, but instead
``look to me for `How is this going to play in Peoria?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bono ``brings a common sense woman-on-the-street approach to the
issue,'' said Marshall Wittmann, director of congressional
relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``Obviously the
legal beagles on the panel are bringing a very constitutional
approach. She is someone with a nonlegal background, who might ask
the questions the average person at home might ask.''
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, Bono vacates the Georgetown townhouse she once
shared with Sonny and flies home to her district and home in Palm
Springs, Calif., where her children remain during the week with a
longtime nanny. A good weekend with the kids might involving taking
her son to tennis lessons or watching her daughter as a cheerleader
at football games.
</P>
<P>
   She said when she is ``stressed out'' back in Washington, she
begins to plan her weekends with her children. ``I start to think,
I can't wait to take them to (the movie) `A Bug's Life,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bono also says she believes Clinton committed perjury and ought
to be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Bono says she is ``overwhelmed'' to sit in judgment of the
president and that ``the gravity of it hits me in the gut.'' She
says she has coped with the impeachment firestorm by ``focusing on
the task immediately at hand,'' and ``taking one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shake when I speak'' at congressional hearings or news
conferences, Bono said.
</P>
<P>
   After observing quietly from the sidelines for months, Bono
announced at Tuesday's hearing, ``I won't be labeled a zealot
because I do believe it was perjury. I do believe it was wrong. And
I won't have a problem supporting that article of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bono says she reached her decision last week after hearing the
congressional testimony of two women, psychiatrist Barbara
Battalino and former college basketball coach Pam Parsons who were
convicted for lying under oath about sex. ``No one is above the
law,'' she said. ``This is what happens when you perjure yourself.
The president shows no remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   As the junior member of the Republican majority on the panel,
Bono must wait until the rest of the Republicans have asked their
questions at congressional hearings before she gets to speak. She
says she can feel the adrenaline surge when her turn is just two to
three members away.
</P>
<P>
   Bono, a former high school gymnast and certified personal
fitness instructor who has studied Karate and Tae Kwan Do,
complains that her bicoastal trips and the Judiciary Committee
schedule have left her without time to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Bono recently cut her long blonde hair short and returned it to
its natural brunette color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1961 in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a surgeon, Clay
Whitaker, and a chemist, Karen, Bono met her future husband Sonny
Bono while celebrating her graduation from the University of
Southern California at one of his restaurants in West Hollywood,
Calif., which she later managed.
</P>
<P>
   She said her fellow Republicans, and some Democrats like Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., have helped ease the transition to Capitol
Hill by acting as coaches. She admits she still finds it unsettling
to hear camera shutters clicking and must resist the temptation to
turn and make a face.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., who says he has taken Bono ``under my
wing as a friend,'' said walking into the impeachment hearings was
as if ``she has stepped into a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the wife of someone famous, but I don't think she was
prepared to have all the attention shift to her,'' Buyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bono said she is looking forward to shifting her attention away
from the president and toward issues such as education and health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to putting impeachment behind me,'' she
said. ``This is so overwhelming. From this point on, it's got to
get easier.''

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds from the north and northeast will buffet southern
California Wednesday as a strong high pressure system intensifies
over the Great Basin of the interior West. Local gusts could exceed
70 miles an hour in some of the canyons and passes east of Los
Angeles and San Diego. The windy conditions will persist into
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the air descends toward the Pacific Ocean, it will warm,
boosting temperatures to near 70 degrees at the coast Wednesday
afternoon. Meanwhile, despite mainly sunny skies, unusually chilly
air will cover interior sections of the Southwest with record chill
possible over Nevada and Utah Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of snow will whiten the ground of eastern Colorado and New
Mexico Wednesday as breezes from the east carry moist air toward
the Front Range of the Rockies. An approaching jet stream
disturbance may cause the snow to turn heavy for a time later
Wednesday afternoon and evening. Elsewhere in the West, a few light
rain and mountain snow showers will precede the return to milder
conditions in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Generally dry weather will cover an expansive area from the
Plains to the East Coast Wednesday. A few showers, however, could
affect the eastern Carolinas as a cold front presses off the
Atlantic coast. Although the record setting heat in Northeast is
over, abundant sunshine will still keep daytime readings several
degrees above seasonal levels Wednesday. Meanwhile, warm and humid
air will be confined to the southern half of the Florida peninsula
Wednesday with temperatures well into the 80s amid ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Flood Without Rain &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As the sun broke through the low overcast over western
Washington Tuesday, a flood watch was issued for the coast.
Warnings were based on offshore buoys detecting large ocean swells
up to 28 feet high. With large waves crashing Washington shores,
dry beaches might suddenly be awash with water. Giant logs tossed
like tiny sticks by breaking waves also posed a danger. Farther
south, heavy surf advisories were posted for Oregon shores as
offshore buoys detected swells as high as 31 feet. Large swells
were generated a few days ago by a large storm over the Gulf of
Alaska.

 &HT;    FORMER TREASURY DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TO TESTIFY FOR CLINTON AT
PROCEEDINGS

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Treasury Department's former top cop, who
punished the supervisors of the disastrous Branch Davidians raid,
will become a witness for the defense Wednesday as the House
Judiciary Committee hears more testimony on behalf of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald K. Noble, who was undersecretary for enforcement when he
left the Treasury Department in early 1996, said Tuesday that he
will draw on his experience as a federal prosecutor to tell the
Judiciary Committee holding impeachment proceedings that the
perjury allegations against Clinton do not warrant prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying facts and circumstances of what happened are so
messy, tawdry and unclear, I can't see why a federal prosecutor
would want to bring a case,'' Noble said from his office at New
York University Law School, where he teaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the position that if this case were brought before an
ordinary prosecutor and there was an ordinary defendant, the
likelihood is that the prosecution would never go forward,'' he
said, adding that he can understand why independent counsel Kenneth
Starr and Congress would be tempted to press charges against such
an extraordinary defendant as the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temptation is so strong because there is no bigger target,
both for assassinations and for prosecutions,'' Noble said.
</P>
<P>
   Noble was appointed by Clinton in 1993 to be the assistant
secretary for enforcement in the Treasury Department, a job that
put him in charge of the Secret Service, Customs Service and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Noble's first assignment from then-Treasury Secretary Lloyd
Bentsen was an investigation of the ATF's actions in its Feb. 28,
1993, raid on the Branch Davidians' compound at Mount Carmel, near
Waco, Texas. Four ATF agents died in the subsequent gunfight at the
compound. When the investigation ended in September 1993, at least
four raid supervisors were demoted or otherwise disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   During his three years with the Treasury Department, Noble also
made the controversial decision to close Pennsylvania Avenue in
front of the White House. The closure happened shortly after the
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City
in April 1995, but Noble insists that the closing had been in the
works for some months.

TEXAS TIES FORTUNE TO OTHER INDUSTRIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The last time oil prices fell within sight
of $10 a barrel, Jack Huff was starting a real estate brokerage in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1986, and the Texas oil and gas business was about to go
into a free fall. Soon the real estate industry would collapse,
too, and hundreds of Texas banks would go belly up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take on a siege mentality,'' Huff recalled. ``All we
could worry about was survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to December 1998: Oil prices have plunged 40
percent in the past year, sending tremors through the oil patch.
</P>
<P>
   With profits reeling, oil companies are folding up drilling rigs
and preparing to lay off tens of thousands of workers. Mergers,
including last week's megadeal between Exxon and Mobil, are
sweeping the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on Huff this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really seen it or felt it,'' said the co-founder of
Stoneleigh Huff Brous McDowell. ``We have a few clients in that
sector who are tightening their belts. But it's pretty much
business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   That view, which would probably be shared by many Texans,
reflects just how much the state has changed in less than a
generation. And it tells us why the current threat, while painful
to those in the industry, is nothing like the oil shock that rocked
Texas a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Texas still evokes images of rowdy roughnecks and
towering oil derricks, of a state awash in ``black gold.'' The
reality is that today's Texas is as much about semiconductors and
computers, airlines and trucking, retailing and services.
</P>
<P>
   And many of those businesses, along with millions of consumers,
welcome lower oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, consumers are paying the lowest prices
at the pump since before the oil embargo of 1973. That helps whet
their appetite for big trucks and sport utility vehicles, which
last month topped car sales for the first time since a brief period
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Low oil prices also contribute to low inflation, which has
spawned a boom in mortgage financing and home construction.
</P>
<P>
   In short, cheap oil is good news for many Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When oil prices fall, there are 9 million workers who benefit
every time they go to the gas pump,'' said Gerald Higgins, revenue
analyst for the Texas comptroller. ``And there's a small percentage
who suffer because they work in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation that's got good and bad,'' Higgins said. ``It
depends on whose ox is getting gored.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two decades ago, the state's economic fortunes hinged
on the price of oil, rising and falling with the cycles of the
volatile industry. It is still significant, especially around
Houston and Midland-Odessa, where energy jobs are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   But oil's influence has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, taxes on oil and gas production accounted for nearly 29
percent of state revenues, according to the Texas comptroller.
Today those levies make up less than 4 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The industry itself has shrunk by almost half. Texas had more
than 300,000 oil and gas workers in 1981. In October, the total was
156,600, said the Texas Workforce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Over those 17 years, the rest of the Texas economy boomed,
adding 2.7 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a simple story,'' said Stephen P.A. Brown, senior
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ``The oil industry
shrank, and others grew. Low oil prices still hurt the Texas
economy but not nearly as much as 12 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of oil production has shifted abroad, as new seismic
technologies have boosted exploration, and better machinery has
made it easier to pull oil from the ground and ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging countries in South America, the Middle East and parts
of the former Soviet Union also have pumped up oil supplies,
because they are desperate for hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Asia's economic troubles led to slower demand
for oil, resulting in the latest drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling activity demonstrates how much the landscape has
changed. In 1981, Texas had 1,449 drilling rigs looking for oil.
Now the total is 246.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the number of rigs drilling in the Permian Basin
around Midland-Odessa has fallen 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas oil and gas business has declined, other
industries have emerged, especially around Fort Worth-Dallas. And
many of them benefit directly from cheap oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Worth area, oil and gas accounts for an estimated
4,300 jobs, about one-half of 1 percent of the work force. AMR
Corp., the parent of American Airlines, employs eight times that
number of workers in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   AMR, on pace for another year of record profits, said it saved
$238 million in the first nine months of '98 because of falling oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the region also benefits because it has become a center
for trucking and rail transportation, especially in the Alliance
Airport area. FedEx operates a hub there, and many companies ship
and store goods at Alliance area warehouses.

DRUG ADVISER WARNS ABOUT GROWTH OF METHAMPHETAMINE USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ America is winning the war against cocaine, but
the drug is being quickly replaced by chemically produced
methamphetamine, a Clinton administration official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, methamphetamine was a minor, West Coast,
biker-gang drug,'' said retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the
White House drug policy adviser. ``Now its a dominant drug problem
in the rural Midwest, Hawaii, Idaho and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   While casual cocaine use has dropped by as much as 70 percent,
he said, methamphetamine use and production are spreading
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has actually replaced cocaine as the principal emergency
room threat in Southern California and Hawaii,'' McCaffrey told
reporters before he addressed the Council of State Governments
meeting, which ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very worried about it, and I think we're going to see
more of this,'' he said of the narcotic methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   The organization devoted the last day of its meeting to drug
policy.
</P>
<P>
   During one panel discussion, Kansas Attorney General Carla
Stovall gave a grim account of methamphetamine use in the Midwest.
The narcotic is a powerful stimulant that is relatively easy and
cheap to manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people are being injured each year in makeshift labs
that are cropping up in homes in Kansas, Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the proliferation of the drug, Kansas lawmakers
want to stiffen criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who addressed the state government organization
agreed that government policy should focus on rehabilitation of
drug addicts and curbing drug use among children.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he was concerned by the message being sent to
children by advocacy groups that are pushing for the legalization
of marijuana for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain management is not best done with a joint or two vodkas _
it just doesn't ring true,'' he said. ``Doctors should decide about
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who played video from four public service messages
designed to reduce drug abuse, said the number of eighth-graders
taking drugs has tripled in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge to America is to keep kids from about the sixth
grade to the 12th grade from smoking pot and abusing alcohol,'' he
said.

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY CONFEREES AGREE ON GOAL, NOT DIRECTION
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional leaders found
common ground Tuesday on the need to preserve the nation's
retirement system, but differed over how to begin the reform
process and what Social Security should look like after it is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference is seeking ways to protect the 45 million
current beneficiaries while preserving Social Security for the 77
million baby boomers and their descendents in the next century. The
meeting's more than 200 participants represented widely divergent
views on how to achieve this, and Clinton urged them to keep an
open mind in their search.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways to deal with this, but there is only one
way to get it done,'' Clinton said. ``Let me say to all the people
on all sides of this debate: the only way we can save Social
Security ...is by working together, putting progress ahead of
partisanship, placing the long-term interests of the nation
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The first dispute is over who should step forward first with a
reform proposal _ and become a possible target for political
attacks on its painful remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want Clinton to offer a specific proposal soon,
while the administration wants to wait until a possible agreement
is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   There are early signs that the reform battle may center on the
topic of investing part of the Social Security trust fund in
private securities markets, whose higher historical returns may
ease or eliminate the need for tax increases or benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that ...people are looking favorably at
some form of prefunding(cq) that will give a higher return, and a
lot of the debate you're seeing is about what form that would
take,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House's chief economic
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The key point of contention is whether individuals should be
able to invest their own retirement money, or whether the
government should invest it for them. Advocates of individual
accounts told the conference it would give people greater control
of their future. Advocates of having the government invest the
funds said it would minimize the risk faced by each retiree.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is the culmination of a year-long process that
began with the president's State of the Union message last January.
Early next year, Clinton plans to meet with congressional leaders
to begin negotiating a reform plan that would be voted into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will only get harder. Every single year we avoid
resolving this it will get harder and harder and harder,'' Clinton
told the conference Tuesday, pounding the podium. ``And everybody's
favorite idea will have a less beneficial impact the longer we
wait. Now is the time to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Without reform, the Social Security trust fund is expected to be
depleted by 2032, after which payroll taxes would cover only
three-fourths of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While predicting reformers would have to ``sacrifice our sense
of the perfect to work together for the common good,'' Clinton
avoided offering a specific plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of this conference is to open honest debate
and to build consensus, not to shoot down ideas, or insist that one
side or the other has to go first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans criticized Clinton's refusal to offer a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save and strengthen Social Security, Mr. President, you
must lead our nation. It's that simple,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw
Jr., R-Fla., incoming House Ways and Means Social Security
subcommittee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, reading a text prepared by the Ways and Means chairman,
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, urged Clinton to follow the lead taken
by previous presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some presidents relied on commissions, some submitted plans,
but from Roosevelt to Reagan they all took a stand and they all
took the lead,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches, Shaw said Clinton indicated he would submit
a plan and that he did not expect Republicans to take the lead with
a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who missed the opening speeches because of a scheduling
conflict, was harshly critical in his comments to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the president play politics with the most important
issue facing the American public _ by his own definition _ this
coming year?'' Archer said. He said the conference ``will only be
worthwhile if, at the end of this, he presents a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who did not participate in
the conference, issued a statement offering to introduce whatever
Social Security reform bill Clinton sent to Congress as
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The conference _ one day at a Washington hotel, the second day
behind closed doors at the White House _ was designed to give key
lawmakers and interest groups an opportunity to discuss the need
for reform and some possible options.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota stressed that Social
Security should be renovated, not razed.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., suggested that while reforms
should protect current beneficiaries, they also should offer
opportunities for higher returns to future retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard these themes before. The real question is: behind
the rhetoric, how flexible are people?'' said John Rother, AARP's
legislative director.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL DEBATES BROWSER STRATEGY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft antitrust trial took on the guise of
a computer science class Tuesday with the judge seeking to find
whether the ability to surf the Internet must be bolted into the
software giant's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the government as a $300-an-hour expert witness,
David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania professor, argued that a
computer operating system need only perform the basic functions
necessary to make the hardware respond to all applications,
including Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no technical barriers that prevent Microsoft from
developing and selling its Windows operating system as a stand
alone product separate from its browser software _ or other
software functions beyond the appropriate operating system
functions,'' Farber held in his direct testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 million copies of Windows 98 which Microsoft has sold
since last May ``consists of modules which are malleable and
separable'' Farber wrote in written testimony unsealed late Monday.
Moreover, he added, there are ``no technical efficiencies'' that
couldn't be achieved by mounting Internet Explorer as a distinct
program that ran atop of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm sort of stuck with the whole grocery bag,''
Farber complained Tuesday to Microsoft lawyer Steven Holley, who
had proudly posted in the courtroom a large chart of 13 dual-use
functions which Microsoft had built into Windows 98 in such ways
that they cannot be removed without reducing the computer into a
useless box.
</P>
<P>
   Holley's strategy was to post a red ``no'' sign next to each of
the functions, thereby seeking to refute what the Justice
Department and 19 states have alleged: that Microsoft has illegally
tied Internet Explorer into its Windows operating system, thereby
denying consumers an effective choice.
</P>
<P>
   That was a cue for U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
who has mainly sat in silence in the eight weeks since the trial
began, to dig more deeply into the issue at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``So an operating system is something that has to be running
with everything?'' Jackson asked the witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Farber replied.
</P>
<P>
   As Windows is currently packaged, Farber had noted earlier,
``you get the pinball machine and the solitaire game ... as part of
the operating system and that's just absurd.'' Microsoft contends
it includes the games in the package to help novice users learn how
to use a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average non-technical user ... has no desire to sit and
stare at an operating system idly,'' Holley replied, labeling
Farber's views as ``extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What business people ordinarily refer to as an operating
system is far broader than what you are saying is an operating
system, is that not correct, Professor Farber?'' Holley said.
``...You're not suggesting, are you, that average users should be
subjected to a Chinese menu of system functions from which they
would have to assemble their own operating system?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with marketing terms as opposed to technical
terms,'' Farber replied. ``One of the problems in the academic
world is staying ahead of the marketing hype.''

SOCIAL SECURITY CONFERENCE ATTEMPTS TO FOSTER BIPARTISANSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, opening a two-day conference
Tuesday on Social Security, called for an end to political rancor
that might block a consensus on how best to fix the government's
63-year-old retirement and disability benefits program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are too high, the issues far too important,''
Clinton told an audience of more than 250 participants drawn from
Congress, advocacy groups, universities, labor unions and religious
organizations. Propping up Social Security is ``not about
politics,'' he said. ``It's about doing right by young Americans
and older Americans and the future of America.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Clinton spoke, some rancor surfaced in the form of
controversy over the wisdom of turning the government-run system
into one augmented by individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system
funded through a payroll tax of 12.4 percent, split evenly between
employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Under several plans backed by conservatives, Republicans and
some Democrats, individual account holders would receive retirement
earnings through a portion of their payroll taxes invested in
equity funds such as stocks. Under these plans, they would also
continue to receive benefits from the traditional Social Security
program.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the idea of private accounts is an amalgam of AFL-CIO
unions, women's groups and liberal organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has avoided taking a stand on private accounts.
Clinton said Tuesday only that Social Security ``must remain a
rock-solid guarantee,'' and that beneficiaries must get paid
``regardless of the ups and downs of the economy or the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But just after Clinton's speech, White House economic adviser
Gene Sperling told reporters, ``There's no question that we are
looking favorably on options that would in some way seek to bring
in higher returns.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has not locked into any one plan, the White House
is exploring ``prudent ways'' to boost the Social Security trust
fund through investments, Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Hints that the White House might be leaning toward private
accounts infuriated representatives of unions and women's groups.
``It would be totally wrong,'' said Andrew Stern, president of the
Service Employees International Union. ``I represent a lot of
low-wage workers, people who need a guarantee and not a gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Friedan, a pioneering feminist and first president of the
National Organization for Women, said: ``I hope the Clinton
administration listens to women and older people, and stands firm
by not allowing any mucking around with Social Security. It's
dangerous. You don't want any Wall Street control over (financial)
security in old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of private accounts seemed confident that time is on
their side. ``I think the political dynamics lean toward some kind
of modest private accounts,'' said Martha Phillips, executive
director of the Concord Coalition, which favors a balanced budget
and supports creation of such accounts. ``They have to be there if
you want to get something through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, who asked not to be
identified, said the White House is exploring options other than
private accounts. An example: reserving budget surpluses
exclusively for the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office projects a surplus of $1.55
trillion over the next decade, much of it from Social Security
payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, participants debated topics such as the
impact of the budget surplus, the particular retirement needs of
minorities and women, and ``private market options.'' But much of
the conference's focus seemed to be on Clinton, when and if the
White House would put forward a Social Security plan of its own,
and how the administration ultimately will position itself on
private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conferences are good for airing points of view, but in the end
there needs to be a decision made and that can come only from
presidential leadership,'' said House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, whose panel has jurisdiction
over Social Security. Clinton ``needs to step up and lead or the
odds of getting this done are insurmountable. Politics as usual
will not get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling responded that Clinton is ``trying to engage with
members of both parties'' on what is necessary to produce ``a
bipartisan agreement.'' He added, ``Whether and when (Clinton) puts
forward specific ideas, and what they will be, is not a decision to
be made at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer and Sperling agreed that a fix to Social Security must
come in the first half of 1999 because delay would bump the issue
into the 2000 presidential cycle. Waiting until the next century
would give lawmakers precious little time to overhaul the system
before the massive wave of baby boom retirements kicks in around
2010.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, as the 76 million baby boomers begin
swelling retiree ranks, the Social Security payroll tax alone will
not be sufficient to cover benefits. By 2013, the government will
have to dip into interest on the system's trust fund to meet its
obligations. By 2021, it will have to dip into the fund's
principal, and by 2032, the fund itself _ now valued at about
$756.9 billion _ will be depleted, and payroll taxes will provide
only enough to pay 75 percent of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Archer and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said they did not believe
the impeachment cloud hanging over Clinton would necessarily impede
progress on Social Security. ``We might try to wish it away but we
can't,'' said Gramm, who compared Clinton's troubles to playing a
football game in bad weather. ``You wish it wouldn't rain but you
play anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration beamed the proceedings to 57
mini-conferences in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Wednesday's
wrap-up session will be held at the White House, with top
administration officials and lawmakers hashing out the issue behind
closed doors.

MRFOX-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ As a kid growing up in New York, Tobias
Picker loved the fiction of Roald Dahl. But not Dahl's ``children's

fiction (the only kids' books Picker could stomach were A.A. Milne

LUNCH AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Why would Hugh Hefner, the creator of a magazine
about women without clothes, have a luncheon to honor a French
fashion designer?
</P>
<P>
   It was an invitation too intriguing to pass up, especially since
the guest of honor was Thierry Mugler, the Paris designer with the
sharpest edge in women's fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Over a buffet luncheon of salmon, steak and pasta served in the
Tudor-style Playboy mansion in Beverly Hills, we learned Mugler
photographed a bunch of Playboy bunnies in his '40s-inspired
fantasy fashions for Playboy's January, 1999 issue. According to
Mugler, who was dressed in a tan-and-black snakeskin blazer with
black leather jeans and T-shirt, ``Playboy invited me to do my
version of Ertes, and the beautiful girls in a beautiful setting
inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, we strolled the gardens, watched the peacocks
preening themselves and talked about the future of fashion. Said
Mugler: ``In the next century, we're going to see more and more
nudity and tattoos. Of course, they'll still be wearing clothing,
but women won't pay so much attention to seasonal collections, and
black will remain the basic color ... which shows you as a jewel.
Also I think fabrics will clean themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who are wondering what the mansion is like, it's a
stone castle with a lot of heavy, dark Georgian period furniture
with a lion motif. In the foyer there's a painting of Hefner
between two lions, and in the formal dining room are more lions on
the walls, the carpeting, the fireplace screen, the blue velvet
chairs and the huge buffet that features winged lions holding the
thick gray marble table top.
</P>
<P>
   The restroom walls are covered in beige velvet and marble, and
the toilet has a secret pull-chain (on the bottom of the tank) that
had everybody talking. Other buzz was about the possibility of
getting Monica Lewinsky into Playboy; how it was so unnecessary to
mention Sonny Bono was taking prescription drugs when he died; and
how Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kathy Ireland was making a
fortune (said to be $70 million) with her Kmart collection. Also
hoping to make a few million is Playboy, which will launch its new
collection of activewear in the spring at local department stores. &QL;

KHRISTICH MAKES A POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins' leading scorer has not had a goal in four
games. But Dmitri Khristich is hardly concerned about a perceived
lack of production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games, the team scored three goals and I had two
assists, so I'm still getting points and that's what I'm trying to
do,'' Khristich said Tuesday. ``But statistics are really only
important when you are negotiating contracts. It measures how well
a person is doing, and if a person is doing well, the team will do
well. It all goes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich has 11 goals and 16 assists, giving him and linemates
Jason Allison and Sergei Samsonov a direct contribution to more
than 40 percent of the Bruins' 63 goals. They have helped the
Bruins compile a seven-game undefeated streak, and since Nov. 3,
the team is 7-1-4 overall and unbeaten on the road going into
Thurday's visit to Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all three are on, they are pretty tough to defend,''
coach Pat Burns said. ``Dmitri is good with and without (the puck).
I was worried about what went on with his contract in the summer.
But it hasn't affected him. He's part of the team and he's fitting
in. His role hasn't changed a lot since last year. Dmitri is just
getting more breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that the Bruins are emphasizing defense, a
strategy that has been successful despite them being 11th in
scoring among the NHL's 14 teams with winning records. They would
not be nearly as effective, though, without an attacking line or
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep creating chances,'' Khristich said. ``Some
games the puck doesn't go in the net, but you have to keep doing
those things. You can't get frustrated. We had a stretch of some
games where the puck would not go in, but if you keep doing the
right things you will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we caught teams by surprise, they didn't know what
to expect from us. It's much tougher this year. We are in a tough
division. We can't take teams by surprise. They play us close, the
game is tight and they check our line. It can be more satisfying if
you beat teams under those conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' first line will be the target of Carolina Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a pretty good team, for sure,'' Burns said. ``Ron
Francis has brought them some experience. They make us scratch our
heads sometimes, but when they are on their game, they are tough to
beat. They are in the same position we are in; they've been off for
a few days. But after the first 10 minutes, the game should settle
down.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is preaching caution, though the Bruins appear to have
confidence and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost a lot of games,'' Burns said. ``We've held our
own. But that could change quick.''

`MR. FOX' BOASTS INSPRING SOUNDS OF PICKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Growing up outside New York City in the late
1950s, Tobias Picker couldn't stomach most so-called ``children's
literature.'' About the only authors of that ilk he could abide
were A.A. Milne and ``a little bit of Dr. Seuss.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was one children's author the precocious Picker rated
highly: Roald Dahl, who gave the world ``James and the Giant
Peach,'' ``Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' and other
prepubescent classics.
</P>
<P>
   Only thing was, Picker didn't actually read those books until
later in life. Instead he was drawn to Dahl's adult fiction, a
taste he'd acquired from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were big readers, and they loved his writing,'' says the
soft-spoken 45-year-old composer. ``They just loved his wicked,
twisted, wonderful, wry (style) _ they thought he was a genius. And
Hitchhock discovered it also on his `Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'
and dramatized, I believe, more than one Dahl story. I used to
watch that show as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   From Hitchcock to Dahl to L.A. Opera might seem a surreal
sequence. But it's one that will be completed tonight when Picker's
operatic adaptation of Dahl's children's story, ``Fantastic Mr.
Fox,'' premieres at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   With a libretto by Donald Sturrock and sets and costumes by
British political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, ``Fantastic Mr. Fox''
was conceived as a colorful musical morality tale that, like Dahl's
book, could speak to adults without talking down to children.
</P>
<P>
   Its story concerns a family of clever foxes who are being
hounded by three grotesque English farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean,
who are bent on exterminating them. Canadian baritone Gerald Finley
stars as the wily vulpine patriarch. The cast also includes Los
Angeles native mezzo-soprano Suzanna Guzman as Mrs. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   A key to the project, according to its production team, was
preserving Dahl's multiple layers of meaning and his subversive
edge. ``Fantastic Mr. Fox'' can be read as a satire of human greed
and brutality, with the animals in the story representing a kind of
oppressed underclass. But the story also works on a simpler comic
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Dahl) had a delight in the naughty,'' says Sturrock,
``which most adults can share with children, and in saying things
which shouldn't be said, and in seeing things as they are rather
than how they seem, which I think a child can immediately
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of his adult stories are based on that `What if _ what
if things aren't what they appear to be?' or `What if somebody said
this, but was actually doing something else?'''
</P>
<P>
   Picker said the project appealed to him in part because it was
miles removed from his first opera, ``Emmeline,'' which premiered
two years ago at Santa Fe Opera to considerable critical oohs and
aahs.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a novel by Judith Rossner (``Looking for Mr.
Goodbar''), ``Emmeline'' was based on a true story about Emmeline
Mosher, a textile worker in 19th-century rural Maine who was
seduced by her boss and forced to give up her infant son. Twenty
years later, she met and married a young drifter, only to discover
that he was the very son she'd abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the Oedipus legend as seen through Jocasta's eyes,
``Emmeline,'' with a libretto by poet J.D. McClatchy, had the shape
and structure of classical tragedy. Reviewing New York City Opera's
production last April, the New York Times critic Bernard Holland
wrote, ``The City Opera should put `Emmeline' in its permanent
repertory. It is a model of its kind.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opera's downbeat subject took a toll on Picker, who says
that after ``Emmeline'' he was ready to work in a brighter musical
palette.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Emmeline,' I wanted the freedom that this (`Fantastic
Mr. Fox') allowed me of all these different characters and
possibilities and playfulness and fun and comedy _ the challenge of
doing something funny, which is very, very hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for an opera of ``Fantastic Mr. Fox'' came from a 1993
lunch chat between librettist Sturrock and Peter Hemmings, general
director of L.A. Opera. Sturrock, who was in town shooting a BBC
documentary on tenor Placido Domingo, mentioned that he'd been
commissioning some orchestral works based on the writings of Dahl,
whom Sturrock had befriended late in the author's life.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings told him: ``If ever you think of doing an opera, let me
know.'' Two years later, Sturrock began writing the libretto.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while trying to decide on a composer, Sturrock and Dahl's
widow, Liccy (short for Felicity), attended ``Emmeline's'' world
premiere in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard `Emmeline' in Santa Fe, it made a very big
impression on me,'' says Sturrock. ``He (Picker) is a composer that
can craft an opera in a very impressive fashion and also write
something that can very much move an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of the equation was hiring Scarfe, at Hemmings'
suggestion. Known for his fanciful production designs for the
feature films ``Pink Floyd: The Wall'' and Disney's animated
``Hercules,'' Scarfe previously had teamed with L.A. Opera for its
1993 production of ``The Magic Flute'' (restaged here last season).
</P>
<P>
   While the plot of Dahl's original story has been condensed,
Sturrock has compensated by fleshing out several secondary
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters are strengthened, and each one has a
personality of their own,'' Picker says. ``Hedgehog _ actually
there's a family of hedgehogs _ and I think Donald created Miss
Hedgehog, the spinster, the lonely spinstress, who at the end
finally finds the animal of her dreams in Mr. Porcupine. And they
sing a love duet. And there's a fox trot!''
</P>
<P>
   Ba-DUM-bum!
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantastic Mr. Fox'' arrives at a moment when a handful of
American composers, several of them just entering their peak years,
have been writing operas. The past two seasons alone have seen the
debuts of ``Emmeline,'' Tod Machover's ``Brain Opera'' and Michael
Torke's ``King of Hearts,'' plus Andre Previn's adaptation of ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' which premiered earlier this season in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his contemporaries, Picker spent much of his early
composing career studying under an older generation of devout
serialists. His teachers included such godfathers of atonality as
Elliott Carter at the Juilliard School, Charles Wuorinen at the
Manhattan School of Music and Milton Babbitt at Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   But Picker's subsequent work has embraced the more melodic vein
of the American vernacular and the warmer sounds of
neo-romanticism. In addition to song cycles, three symphonies and
concertos for violin, viola, piano and oboe, he also composed ``The
Encantadas,'' a ``concerto'' for actor and orchestra inspired by a
text by Herman Melville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate, and it was unconscious at the same time,''
Picker says of his gradual movement toward opera. ``I knew that
eventually I was going to have to write opera. And theater and
drama, that was just part of me and in my music. My father had a
great interest in theater and was a drama critic early in his
career and had wanted to write plays but never did.''
</P>
<P>
   With the success of ``Emmeline,'' Picker already has received
requests for three more operas. On tap for the year 2000 is a
Metropolitan Opera commission based on a turn-of-the-century
American novel that Picker declines to name.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth opera, he says, will be a treatment of an Emile Zola
text _ though which one he's keeping a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Picker recently wrote a Suite for Cello and Piano for
Lynn Harrell that is being premiered in San Francisco in January,
and he also found time to write another chamber piece, ``but I've
forgotten what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   What he does know is that he wants each new opera to ``solve
different problems, dramatically and musically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much to learn,'' he says. ``It's another world.'' &QL;

FORT WORTH, Texas: area warehouses. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The General Motors plant in Arlington, which employs about 1,300
workers to produce full-size pickups and sport utility vehicles,
has seen the drop in prices improve its prospects. Much of its
hot-selling products' market gains are attributable to cheap
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Trucking companies are reporting banner results, thanks to high
traffic and low fuel prices. The American Trucking Association says
the industry has saved about $3 billion from the 15-cent decline in
diesel prices in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Although some clearly benefit from the plunge in oil prices, the
Fed's Brown said that the trend is still a net negative for the
entire state and perhaps the region.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, for example, has several oil service companies, and
they've been among the hardest hit by the downturn in prices.
Halliburton Co. plans to lay off 8,100 workers companywide in the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many residents receive royalty checks from oil
properties. Those numbers are obviously going south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is still not at the point where falling prices are a
benefit,'' Brown said. ``Consumers benefit from low-priced gas, and
that helps with shipping costs, including food.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the layoffs that are coming in oil and gas are going to
have a ripple effect. They'll lead to less spending in retail and
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   And they'll reach into related industries, such as Dale Meyer
Trucking in Odessa. The transportation company, which has 42
trucks, specializes in hauling drilling rigs and pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can buy diesel fuel cheaper,'' said Gary Meyer, who heads
the 47-year-old company. ``but if we're not moving rigs, it doesn't
do us any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among people who remember oil as king, there is no fear of
the kind of catastrophe that struck the state during the '80s. One
reason is that oil companies are focused on controlling costs and
are quickly responding to the shifting market.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Exxon and Mobil agreed to the biggest merger in
history, with a market value of more than $80 billion. Others have
teamed up: British Petroleum and Amoco, Kerr-McGee and Oryx Energy,
Halliburton and Dresser, Atlantic-Richfield and Union Texas
Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidation has built much bigger, stronger companies that
can weather the storm much better,'' said Larry Helm, who heads
energy lending at Bank One Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers also enable the companies to cut costs quickly. Layoffs
are already apparent, but more are coming. Exxon and Mobil said
they plan to cut at least 9,000 jobs worldwide. BP-Amoco wants to
lay off 6,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas employment has fallen for four consecutive months in
Texas and is down by 2,100 jobs in the past year. Last week, Union
Pacific Resources Group said it will eliminate 140 jobs in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very real pain for these people,'' said Higgins of the
state comptroller's office. ``They have very specialized skills,
and they earn high wages. They don't have a lot of quick
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have decided to wait it out, banking that prices will
recover soon.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Gearhart, owner of Rock Bit Industries in Fort Worth,
said he hasn't laid off any of his 50 employees. He has even gone
ahead with a Christmas bonus _ although he admits to some doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling our people it won't last all that long,''
Gearhart said of the downturn. ``But with Exxon buying Mobil, maybe
I don't know as much as I thought I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil producers say their problems are even worse than they appear
to much of the public. The prices quoted daily from the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the energy industry's marketplace, are for
deliveries in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The price that refiners pay often averages at least $1 per
barrel less than the futures prices. In futures trading Friday,
West Texas intermediate crude closed at $11.17, meaning that many
refiners are paying $10 or less per barrel _ lower than the price
during the 1986 market crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you factor inflation into the price, we're seeing the
lowest spot crude prices in 40 years,'' said Fred Rabalais, an
independent oil producer in Fort Worth, who has been in the
business for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Low prices also have stung the Permanent University Fund, the
$7.2 billion investment portfolio that supports the University of
Texas and Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, royalties and bonuses from oil-producing properties
generated more than $250 million for the fund, accounting for 23
percent of the portfolio's value. Now the 2 million acres of land
dedicated to the fund produce about $70 million in annual income,
equal to just 1 percent of the holdings, said Thomas Ricks, chief
executive of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although falling oil production hurts, it also prompted
officials to invest more aggressively in stocks. Since 1990, the
fund earned more in investment returns than it racked up in 75
years of oil profits.
</P>
<P>
   And since '81, the endowment has grown from about $1 billion to
more than $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund reflects the transition that's happened with the rest
of the state,'' Ricks said. ``Both of us have evolved from a
resource-based economy to one that is richer and more diverse.''

GORE HAS COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several prominent Democrats are already angling for
a chance to take on Vice President Al Gore for the party's
presidential nomination in 2000, despite Gore's intimidatingly
healthy head start.
</P>
<P>
   What makes them think they can outwit, outspend, outtalk and
out-campaign the 800-pound political gorilla who has been the
hard-working, very visible heir-apparent to the Democratic throne
for six years? Are they nuts?
</P>
<P>
   No, not crazy. Just brash and ambitious. And aware that in
politics you can't get ahead if you don't play the game.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council
the other day four politicians provocatively began positioning
themselves for a run for the presidency in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley promptly followed that up
with an announcement that he has formed a presidential exploratory
committee. Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry
and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt say they will decide soon
whether to join Bradley. Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone is also
dropping presidential hints, although he is not taken as seriously
as the others.
</P>
<P>
   Of the bunch, Gephardt might be the strongest contender but is
the least likely to actually take the leap. His prospects for
becoming House Speaker brightened considerably when the Democratic
gain of five House seats in the November election edged his party
close to majority status. The speakership will be a lot easier for
him to attain than the presidency, for which he would have to begin
campaigning and raising money right away.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had hoped that his formidable intellect and pragmatic
political assets would scare away potentially serious rivals.
Compared with the rogue who currently occupies the White House, he
has managed to remain relatively scandal-free. With no independent
counsel on his trail, his dealings with those Buddhist monks and
his questionable fund-raising phone calls won't do him in.
</P>
<P>
   Except in rare instances of a popular incumbent, the presidency,
that ultimate political prize, is never handed over on a platter.
It has to be won by campaigning hard for it.
</P>
<P>
   So Bradley and company are moving to make Gore work for it, and
they will see what happens when they do. There is always the
surprise factor in politics. Today's political fantasy may be
tomorrow's reality. Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, former Vice President Walter Mondale expected to coast
to the presidential nomination but found himself blindsided by an
attractive young senator hardly anyone knew much about. Colorado's
Gary Hart so caught the public fancy that Mondale did not cinch the
nomination until the final primaries that June.
</P>
<P>
   One year before the 1992 presidential campaign, President George
Bush was so popular in the wake of the Persian Gulf War that
Gephardt and other leading Democrats declined to challenge him.
That cleared the field for second-tier candidates of dubious
presidential stature.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the party's big shots, that unknown Arkansas governor,
Bill Clinton, and marginal political players _ Iowa Sen. Tom
Harkin, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, former Massachusetts
Sen. Paul Tsongas and Kerrey _ figured they had nothing to lose by
going for it.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the unanticipated, erratic presence of Ross
Perot, who split the vote by running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Election Day neared, Bush had fallen like a stone in
the public opinion polls and was defeated by Clinton. The
Democratic nomination had been worth something after all.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 is also tempting because it will be one of the few
times in recent history that no incumbent president is on the
ballot. (The last time was 1988 and before that 1960 and 1928.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore has persistently clung to Clinton's side as half of the
best-advertised and congenial White House twosome in memory, but he
is still only the vice president. And being No. 2 is never as good
a deal as being No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   As the clear frontrunner, Gore will be the favorite target of
all others who get into the presidential race. Until now, Clinton
has absorbed most of the slings and arrows of political warfare.
But that will change soon, as the power struggle shifts from
impeachment madness to the 2000 campaign. Gore is bound to take
some hits and look a lot more like damaged goods than he presently
does.
</P>
<P>
   If they are to compete, presidential candidates in both parties
must be up and running soon, which is why hopefuls are getting
itchy. The bulk of the primaries will be held unusually early in
2000. The nomination could be determined by the end of March. That
does not leave much time for fund-raising, identity-establishing
and rival-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   To the winner, who is still likely to be Gore, will go the
spoils. But to the best loser often goes the consolation prize, the
vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And despite all the jokes about the valueless veepdom, it isn't
a bad job. It comes with a nice house, car, free travel and
interesting company. That itself may make the exercise worthwhile
for other wannabes.

   NEW YORK _ Even if Andre Previn were inclined to rest on his
laurels, he wouldn't have time. He was a Kennedy Center honors
recipient on Sunday night and is to be named Musical America's 1999
Musician of the Year on Tuesday at Lincoln Center. This week he has
two appearances at Avery Fisher Hall, where Kurt Masur and the New
York Philharmonic will celebrate the George Gershwin centennial
through Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday at 8 p.m. and Friday at 11 a.m., Previn will be the
piano soloist in the Concerto in F. On Friday at 8 p.m., he moves
to Alice Tully Hall for a program of Gershwin and jazz with the
bassist David Finck. And on Dec. 30 is PBS' national telecast of
the world premiere of the San Francisco Opera production of his
opera, ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' starring Renee Fleming as
Blanche.

   Britain's queen mother, mouthing the words of ``Mad Dogs and
Englishmen,'' paid tribute to Noel Coward in London. Anticipating
next year's 100th anniversary of his birth, she unveiled Angela
Conner's life-size statue of Coward, the playwright and composer
who died in 1973, in the foyer of the Theater Royal in Drury Lane.
The queen mother, a friend of Coward's, praised him, adding, ``I
think we are fortunate to be the legatees of his lovely music and
his lighthearted fun.''

   NEW YORK _ The spectacle on tap for Broadway at 5:30 p.m.
Wednesday is to light up the tree. With stars and members of
virtually every Broadway and Off Broadway show expected and with
Audra McDonald of ``Ragtime'' and Roger Daltrey of ``A Christmas
Carol'' as the switch flippers, the 1998 Broadway holiday tree will
come to life next to the TKTS booth in Duffy Square, at Broadway
and 46th Street. Then comes a holiday sing led by the Broadway
Kids, the 8-to-15-year-old Broadway veterans in a weekend revue at
the Douglas Fairbanks Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Besides sponsoring the event with the Times Square Business
Improvement District, two other groups, the Theater Development
Fund and the League of American Theaters and Producers, are
starting an annual gift of $5,000 to a nonprofit organization
serving theater people. The first recipient is the Actors' Fund.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With profits reeling, oil companies are
folding up drilling rigs and preparing to lay off tens of thousands
of workers. Mergers, including last week's megadeal between Exxon
and Mobil, are sweeping the industry. But it's not having much
impact on the Texas economy. That reflects just how much the state
has changed in less than a generation. And it tells us why the
current threat, while painful to those in the industry, is nothing
like the oil shock that rocked Texas a decade ago. By MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil prices have plunged 40 percent in the past year, and, for
the first time since 1986, may be headed to $10 a barrel. Some
effects _ good and bad _ of cheap oil:
</P>
<P>
   _ In real dollars, consumers are enjoying the lowest prices at
the pump since before the oil embargo in 1973. Some Fort
Worth-Dallas gas stations are selling gas for less than 90 cents a
gallon, and lower prices are coming. Cheap oil also contributes to
low inflation, a boon for mortgage financing, home construction and
vehicle loans.
</P>
<P>
   _ American Airlines, the largest employer in North Texas, saved
$238 million in fuel costs in the first nine months of '98.
</P>
<P>
   _ Truck sales topped car sales in November for the first time
since a brief period after World War II. Low gasoline prices makes
it less expensive for consumers to drive larger vehicles. That not
only cheers truck-loving Texas, it's a boost for the General Motors
assembly plant in Arlington, which makes trucks and sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mergers are sweeping the energy industry. Last week, Exxon and
Mobil agreed to the biggest deal in history. Big layoffs are
coming. Employment in the industry has fallen for four consecutive
months in Texas, and companies plan a slew of layoffs. For example,
Exxon-Mobil plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trucking companies say they're enjoying their best market in
decades. Traffic is high, diesel has dropped to $1 a gallon _ the
lowest in years _ profits are climbing and they're hiring.

`DIVORCE IRANIAN STYLE': HAVING THEIR DAY, OR NOT, IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Filmed mostly on location in a tiny, crowded Tehran
divorce court, Kim Longinotto's extraordinarily intimate
documentary, ``Divorce Iranian Style,'' reminds you that marital
discord knows no geographic boundaries. What varies from place to
place are only the laws allowing couples to officially dissolve
their unhappy unions.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, when a woman wants a divorce, the only legal grounds
are a husband's insanity, impotence or inability to provide for her
financially.
</P>
<P>
   If you imagined that Iranian women, following Islamic teaching,
tend to be mute, subservient acolytes to their conjugal lords and
masters, you would be wrong. Glowering under their chadors, the
women shown petitioning for divorce are angry, discontented,
thoroughly modern-sounding wives who don't mince words when
describing their unhappy situations. To the excruciating
embarrassment of their husbands, they also can be bluntly candid
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   But since insanity is one of the few grounds for divorce, their
testimony often sounds as if the signs of a husband's hostility
have been amplified and exaggerated to try to fit a legal
definition.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that the women who are the focus of the
movie, which opens Wednesday at Film Forum, don't have every reason
to be frustrated in their often arranged, loveless marriages to men
who appear to be a pretty sorry lot.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the plight of a wife whose husband is pathologically
jealous and restrictive. After she describes a situation in which
she is virtually a prisoner in her own house (she is not even
permitted to make personal telephone calls), the judge calmly
instructs her to make herself more attractive for her husband and
``tempt him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Ziba, a teen-ager who was contracted in marriage
at the age of 15 to a man of 37. A year after their wedding, she
argues that she was too young to foresee the consequences of her
marriage. Now she is locked into a relationship that is physically
unsatisfying and frustrating in other ways since her husband
refuses to let her go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find a legal loophole she asks the court what the
legal age is for marriage in Iran; she is told that it is puberty,
which can be as young as 9. For as long as her husband wants to
stay married to her, Ziba appears to be trapped.
</P>
<P>
   The most complicated case involves Maryam, a fiery young woman
who successfully divorced her first husband and married for love.
Now claiming that her first husband is neglecting their young
daughter, she seeks custody of the girl, who by law automatically
remained in his care.
</P>
<P>
   Maryam pleads, harangues and weeps, and out of sight of the
camera even physically attacks her first husband. She rips up his
court order and lies to the judge, saying he was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Observing all this turmoil is the very young daughter of the
court secretary. After a session has been closed, the smart,
articulate little girl climbs into her father's chair and
scaldingly addresses an imaginary husband, asking him why he treats
his wife so badly.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she hopes one day to get married, she says no,
because she knows what husbands are like. After watching this
documentary, many will undoubtedly share her distaste for an
institution that in Iran can be brutally unfair to women.

ONE-TIME CENTER FOR OIL DRILLING SURVIVES BY DIVERSIFYING ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies OIL-TEXAS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAHAM, Texas _ This town of 9,000, which sits astride the
Brazos River 80 miles northwest of Fort Worth, was a busy oil
community four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a busy community. Oil is just not as big a part of it
as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas have been drilled in Young County since World War I,
and Graham has long enjoyed the reputation as one of the state's
centers for independent oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Texas energy industry slumped in the mid-'50s, the
folks in Graham decided to try to diversify the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders formed an Industrial Development Commission and,
over the years, it has helped attract industries that made such
products as computer tape, aircraft parts, stadium bleachers and
boating equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Graham will have a cushion for this round of low
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been in the business long enough to see that energy could
go up and down and that we'd better get some other industries in
town,'' said Roy Pitcock, who in 1956 was four years removed from
his graduation from TCU and had returned home to help his father
run the family oil business, now called Pitcock Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The diversification, to be sure, has been a slow turn, with a
few bumps along the way. And the oil slumps, which seem to hit at
least once each decade, still sting.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham has not withered away. Indeed, Graham this year has
begun a $600,000 downtown restoration that includes putting in new
sidewalks and upgrading the lighting system.
</P>
<P>
   The first big diversification score came in 1959, when Graham
attracted a Hexcel Corp. plant that made aircraft parts. Plant
employment reached 500 during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Bleachers later opened a 90-worker plant to make
outdoor seating.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, the Graham Industrial Development Commission sought
and attracted operations such as Anacomp (originally Graham
Magnetics), a maker of computer tape that now employs 350, and
Texas Recreation, which makes water sports equipment and employs
75.
</P>
<P>
   When Hexcel closed its plant in the early '90s, Graham was able
to snag a relocation of Schlegal Co., which makes weatherstripping
materials, to use some of the abandoned Hexcel space.
</P>
<P>
   The last big energy bust, beginning in 1986, took away most of
the town's roughnecks and locally owned drilling rigs. Today's
energy people are contractors, not operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we had about 80 rigs working out of Graham,''
Pitcock said. ``Each rig needs a crew of 12. Now, we have three
rigs out of Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   So Graham thinks that it can weather the current downturn in
good shape, although it isn't smug about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot to protect ourselves,'' said banker Jay
Gober, who heads the Industrial Development Association. ``But $10
per barrel oil is going to hurt. We'll lose some more operators,
and we'll feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Doug Stroud not only oversees the local economic activity
but participates in the energy industry as an investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham is doing well under the circumstances,'' he said. ``But
we're not immune from economic changes.''

SWISS NOT TOO EFFERVESCENT OVER CHAMPAGNE DISPUTE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAGNE, Switzerland _ Swiss vintners have been making white
wine in this ancient village for centuries, and though it doesn't
bubble, they call it champagne.
</P>
<P>
   That pits this hamlet against the makers of French champagne,
who are renowned for their vigor in preventing anybody else from
using their name on sparkling wine. The fight is also part of a
continuing debate among the Swiss about how much they should have
to do with the European Union, where the French writ on champagne
is law.
</P>
<P>
   The village's 650 residents, a number of whom are employed in
activities involving the champagne name, are not too happy at the
thought of being rolled over by the French juggernaut. It is not
just a matter of brute commercialism, they say; the spat also
strikes at their local pride and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being told what to do by France,'' protested
Champagne's mayor, Albert Banderet, gesturing to some of the
village's 65 acres of vineyards, which yield 50,000 bottles of
white wine a year. ``It's the monarchy all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no chance, as the French insist, that consumers will be
tricked into buying the wrong thing simply because of the champagne
label, argues Martial Girod, director of the nearby Bonvillars
winery, which produces the Swiss version.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be confused with the other champagne because it's not
bubbly, and it has a screw top, not a cork,'' he explained. And
Swiss champagne costs only $5 a bottle, around one-sixth the cost
of a medium-priced bottle of the French stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the French champagne makers' association is not
swayed by accusations that it is heartlessly attacking rural Swiss
villagers. ``We also have little grape growers in Champagne, which
is a mosaic of tiny family plots,'' said Daniel Lorson, spokesman
for the French producers, who turned out 245 million bottles of
champagne last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our patrimony and our collective trademark,'' he
continued. ``If we don't defend it, in a few years the word
`champagne' won't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Swiss case, champagne makers enlisted the help of the
French government. Regulations stripping Switzerland of its right
to use the name are tucked away in the voluminous accords, under
negotiation for nearly four years, between the Swiss Confederation
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big issue, commercially speaking,'' said David
Best, spokesman for the Swiss Office for European Integration. ``Of
course, Champagne is seen here as `the little village that
resists,' and gains sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more than sympathy that Banderet, who is also a grape
grower and whose family has been in Champagne for more than 400
years, wants for his village. ``I don't want to lose our
identity,'' the portly, gray-bearded mayor said. ``Our village
dates from the 10th century, and we want that respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Champagne first learned it had an identity problem two
years ago when an anonymous fax arrived from Bern, said Girod, the
Bonvillars wine-maker. ``We began to realize we were being
sacrificed to other interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem actually began in 1974, when Switzerland signed
a treaty with France covering commercial protection of wine
appellations, and ``champagne'' did not appear on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one cared in 1974, no one thought of it,'' Best said. Still
unaware or unmindful of the village's stake, Swiss officials agreed
20 years later to a bilateral accord banning Switzerland's use of
the name.
</P>
<P>
   The town's only hope now is that an exception can be negotiated
to allow use of the name in smaller letters, with the name
Bonvillars in the largest lettering, a federal official suggested.
Girod said removing the champagne label would require finding a new
name for the wine, and a marketing campaign to advertise it. ``That
costs money,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Promises that the dispute might be solved diplomatically do not
sit well with the disenchanted villagers. ``This kind of example,''
Girod said, ``does not encourage us to belong to Europe.''

 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAFFORD, Calif. _ On a soggy afternoon, Julia Hill greets a
visitor with a warm hello and an invitation to step inside a small
tent-like shelter lodged in a giant redwood tree 100 feet above the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   She leaps from branch to branch with the ease of a squirrel and
then patiently unhooks a white-knuckled reporter from climbing
equipment as she stands confidently on a thick 2-foot-long branch
without a safety line or even shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Julia ``Butterfly,'' as she likes to be called, has lived there
for nearly a year _ Thursday will mark the anniversary _ in an
attempt to save a tree state foresters estimate to be 600 years old
from the chain saws of the Pacific Lumber Co.
</P>
<P>
   As the protest has endured to become the longest known tree-sit,
Hill has received fan mail from across the globe. With flowing dark
hair and a winsome smile, the former Arkansas waitress has
attracted coverage ranging from national TV to the pages of an
Italian fashion magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Today the bright-eyed 24-year-old finds herself at the center of
the national debate over old-growth timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave a legacy of clear-cuts poisoned with
pesticides,'' Hill said while sitting on an 8-foot-by-6-foot
platform rigged with supporting ropes that serves as one of her two
living spaces. The other is about the same size and covered by blue
tarps 180 feet above the ground, 20 feet below the tree's top. ``To
me, the tree-sit is just further expression of my love of
humanity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While comments like those may strike some as corny or quixotic,
Hill has won over many others, including cantankerous radio
interviewers, with an articulate defense of her action and a
philosophy that blends mainstream environmentalism with New Age
rhetoric and basic Christian tenets. She espouses casting off
materialism, becoming one with nature and loving one's would-be
enemies and tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post office box is always full,'' said Robert Parker, a
fellow Earth First! activist who is coordinating Hill's interviews
and helping to supply her. ``I think a lot of people are really
inspired by what she has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker himself didn't think much of the effort until he heard
Hill being interviewed on the radio. Before Hill came along, he had
spurned Earth First!'s civil disobedience tactics in favor of
producing hard science challenging Pacific Lumber timber plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just speaking from the heart in a very real manner,''
Parker said. Shortly after, in March, Parker volunteered to help.
``I really saw in her such incredible focus and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of Pacific Lumber Co., Humboldt County's largest
private employer, have derided Hill's undertaking. For many, the
tree-sit is but the latest in a long line of Earth First!-sponsored
offenses that hurt the timber industry, which drives the local
economy by providing hundreds of decent-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Humboldt County percolates with rumors that Hill has been seen
in bars or cafes and that she is pregnant. Hill said the rumors are
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   To John Campbell, the president of Pacific Lumber, the tree-sit
is an annoyance that has aroused misplaced public sentiment. One
day, after Hill has left the tree, the company will cut the redwood
as part of a government-approved timber harvest plan for the area,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Hill is trespassing on private property and
endangering her life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could seriously hurt herself or kill herself. We've had a
concern about that for some time,'' Campbell said, adding that the
company would surely be blamed in such a scenario. ``We certainly
didn't ask her to sit in that tree. She is free to go at any time.
She is not a hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell denies that the company ever harassed Hill. He said
Pacific Lumber climbers deemed the tree too dangerous to ascend,
and since then, Campbell has resigned himself to waiting.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hill said, Pacific Lumber employees appeared last
winter to shout obscenities, rouse her from sleep with air horns
and floodlights and try to cut off her supplies with a 10-day
security blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Hill befriended some of the security personnel by singing them
verses from a Christian song about love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they yelled at me, every time they screamed at me,
I sang the song,'' Hill said. ``You can only hate someone who is
singing a song of love to you for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, a helicopter used in logging operations
buzzed the top of the tree, subjecting Hill to a downdraft similar
to the gale-force winds that rocked her perch during winter storms.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the rustic life is a blessing atop the redwood
known by locals as the ``Stafford Giant,'' Hill said. She
affectionately calls the tree ``Luna,'' a name environmentalists
gave it after climbing it during a full moon. On Luna, Hill cooks
on a propane stove, relies on sponge baths to stay clean and uses a
5-gallon bucket lined with plastic bags as a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their duties, supporters make the 90-minute hike to
Hill's tree twice a week to deliver food, letters, warm clothes,
art supplies and other items, as well as to retrieve the toilet
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to live without modern amenities and weathering storms
that bounced her platform like a small boat lost in violent seas
have strengthened Hill's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared at the beginning. I was petrified,'' she said.
``I am human. I am not an adrenaline junkie. I am not Superwoman.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hill said her message is getting out, she chastised the
media for focusing on the human interest aspects of her life and
downplaying the environmental issues that have inspired her to act.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to protect redwoods in the Headwaters Forest, approved
earlier this year by the state and federal government, doesn't go
far enough, she said. For $495 million, the government has agreed
to acquire 7,500 acres of Pacific Lumber land to create an ancient
redwood preserve.
</P>
<P>
   With only an estimated 3 percent of the ancient redwoods that
once covered the North Coast remaining, every tree counts, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, she said, the Headwaters deal doesn't adequately
protect salmon or other endangered species such as the marbled
murrelet sea bird, which uses old-growth timber to nest in. Not far
from Hill's camp is the hillside that gave way on New Year's Day
1997 and damaged 10 Stafford homes in a mudslide. It provides
further evidence of Pacific Lumber's overcutting, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single tree is vital. Every single tree is priceless,''
Hill said. ``These are real important issues. That's why I'm up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to state and federal government officials who worked
for two years to craft the Headwaters deal, the resulting
protection plan would put the last significant privately owned
ancient redwood groves off limits to loggers. In total, 84 percent
of all old redwoods left on Pacific Lumber land would be
safeguarded under the government plan, they say.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 acres of old-growth redwoods are already preserved
in state and federal parks, making the redwood the most protected
tree species in the world, scientists say.

THE SECRET LIFE OF LEADFOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me tell you about the man with the bright blue Corvette, who
drives 55 miles an hour along a residential boulevard, whipping in
and out of traffic, risking his neck and anyone else's to gain a
car length.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, he is hugely vain about that bright blue machine,
and he fears more than anything that he might not be noticed
driving it.
</P>
<P>
   Other things he may be insecure about. His job. His sexual
identity. The cut of his clothes. But when he is behind the wheel
of his bright blue Corvette, all those gnawing worries somehow just
go away.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle could be a restored classic. I wouldn't know _ or
care. It was built to resemble a racing car, and I am surprised he
has not stenciled VALVOLINE in big letters on the side.
</P>
<P>
   What is the use of having a vehicle that will go from 0 to 55
miles an hour in three seconds if nobody knows it?
</P>
<P>
   I saw him first in the rear-view mirror, weaving from lane to
lane and closing at a great rate. Then he got caught behind a rank
of drivers who deliberately, maliciously, stupidly were driving the
speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   After a block or two, however, he spotted an opening and managed
to break out, rocketing forward with engine screaming, dodging
between lesser machines until he topped a hill and passed from
sight.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to have had a decent view of the fellow _ to see
what he looks like, and know if I speculate correctly about the low
hairline and receding brow.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all I got as he hurtled past was a brief look at
his hands, white-knuckled on the wheel. They were small hands, and
looked weak. But being in the driver's seat of such a machine must
compensate for many such inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly you think I am antagonistic toward this man. But why
would I be? He has not, so far as I know, driven his bright blue
Corvette through a sidewalk restaurant or broadsided a public bus.
Not /{yet,/} anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I see the fellow as a potential community
resource.
</P>
<P>
   Police are wasting their time, loitering on side streets,
training their radar guns randomly at the passing traffic, hoping
to catch a mom with a car pool driving four miles over the limit.
</P>
<P>
   That just isn't cost effective. Not when you have this Walter
Mitty, fantasizing he's on the speedway at Daytona, not just
bending the law but obliterating it with flair.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going for small potatoes, why not station an unmarked
car outside his house, and position others _ a great many others _
at strategic points along his daily route, adding up his
transgressions as he passes.
</P>
<P>
   I would be willing to guess that the fines for a single day's
misbehavior would be enough to patch a potholed street, replace a
few blocks of broken curbing or repair one of the city's many
famous crumbling bridges.
</P>
<P>
   A fine notion, you say. But how could the police ever hope to
locate Leadfoot and his dream machine among all the millions of
cars in the city? Where would they even start?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as it happens, the bright blue Corvette had a license
plate _ a Missouri plate, at that. And busybody that I am, I jotted
down the number, on the chance it might someday be of use.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't dream of giving out the number to just anybody. But
interested law officers are welcome to call.

 &HT;    As time on season's play clock runs down, no deal in sight for
NBA
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David Stern surveys the stunning success he has made
of the NBA and winces at fault lines in the foundation and the
cracking sounds that tell us pieces are falling off his beautifully
conceived machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth month of a lockout, the death knell of a season
sounding, the commissioner says wistfully, ``What we would like to
do is sit down with our players and negotiate a deal that could get
them back.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as the bell tolls, very little negotiating is getting
done. The two sides have held three meetings in as many months,
none fruitful. One of the league's premiere events, the All-Star
game scheduled for Feb. 14, was canceled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The players have suffered huge financial losses, and they beg
the public to take note of that. The teams squirrel away TV money
that will be re-paid later. The commissioner, who quietly has not
taken a paycheck since August, said, ``I'm reminded of it every
time I go to the bank to make a withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too late to ask if the NBA acted precipitously by invoking
its lockout of players in July, too late to suggest that the
problem of over-blown salaries might have resolved itself as the
Joe Smiths of the world fell by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   But if you remember the early 1980s and the rebirth of the NBA
under Stern, the question is, how could a business that brings in
$2 billion have reached the point of self-destruction? How could
the only professional league not to lose a game to labor strife, a
sport that is the darling of NBC and the cable industry, have
suffered such a severe self-inflicted wound?
</P>
<P>
   The common antagonist is money.
</P>
<P>
   When Stern and the late union chief Larry Fleisher hammered out
the first salary cap in 1983, the payroll of each of 16 teams was
$2.6 million, increasing to $3 million in the third year. When the
Hawks paid $1 million for the rights to Dominique Wilkins, the
terms were historic in a league that had so little clout that CBS
refused to televise the championships in prime-time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the 29-team league unveiled a proposal that would set
this season's salary cap at $31 million per team, approximately
Michael Jordan's pay for 1997-98. The cap would increase to $55
million in 2004-05, when the average salary would jump from last
season's $2.6 million to $4.983 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would guarantee our players that the mean and median
salaries would continue to be the highest in professional sports,''
Stern said during a visit here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to get a deal, however.
</P>
<P>
   After Stern unveiled his proposal for the players last Thursday,
union president Patrick Ewing said he did not believe the numbers
were correct, deepening players' mistrust of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers are our numbers,'' Stern said. ``I represent
that they are our numbers, and we've agreed with the players and
their accountants that these numbers are accurate and uncontested.
So it's a little late in the game (for posturing).''
</P>
<P>
   So, how can the players say no to a proposal that offers so
much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because not everything is what it seems,'' Dikembe Mutombo,
Hawks center and union vice-president said Tuesday. ``They don't
tell you about the 20 percent tax they proposed, and we don't know
where it's going. They don't tell you they are taking away our
licensing money (of $25 million last season). And they are
misleading you when they show how much money you can make after 10
years as a Larry Bird guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not stupid,'' Mutombo said. ``I know there's no way
Stan Kasten is going to pay me $24 million dollars after I'm in the
league 10 years. It will never happen except for a guy like Michael
Jordan, so what does it mean? The numbers look nice, but they will
never pay that.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners say they will never ask the players to take a cut and
are, in fact, factoring in a 5 percent annual increase and an
average of 53 percent of the league's profits in the final three
years of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've told the players that obviously we're prepared to
negotiate with you further, that there is some give and take,''
Stern said. ``But basically, they've said if there's nothing more
that we have to say, at this point, they refuse to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last meeting, they said they had a proposal they would
like to make to us, but we would have had to agree in advance that
it would satisfy us at every other point. We said we couldn't do
that and if they had something to say to us we wish they would.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo also disputed that point. ``The way it happened,'' he
said, ``is we asked them for their final number. We said if you are
ready to give us your final number (on percentage of revenues),
we'll see if it's something we can take to our members. They
refused, so what was there to discuss?''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that such powerful agents as David Falk and Arn
Tellem are blocking an agreement. Falk's clients dominate the
union's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stern won't comment. ``I would only say this: The deal would pay
every contract that's existent, increase the minimum, provide an
exception for the $1.5 million player and have veterans who are
playing at the minimum play for $1 million. That has to come from
some place, and that some place is the high-end players. So the
notion that the agents for the high-end players are protecting the
middle class doesn't quite resonate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   What does resonate is the ticking of the clock. The All-Star
Game is dead. Christmas is coming. If there is no deal by New
Year's, NBA will stand for No Basketball Action.

 &HT;    Former cheerleader will start for Ga. Southern in playoffs
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With an injury-riddled defense increasingly hammered
during the I-AA playoffs, top-ranked Georgia Southern has been
forced to seek help from a group of reserves, including a former
cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Butler, a 5-11, 202-pound junior whose sister is the
placekicker at Riverdale High School, will start at linebacker
Saturday when the Eagles (13-0) play the Leathernecks of Western
Illinois (11-2) in a semifinal at Paulson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, a cheerleader at Georgia State before transferring and
walking on at Georgia Southern in the spring of 1997, has moved
into a starting role because of injuries to several players,
including starters Daryl Morrell and Larry Rogers. ``When nobody
offered Tony a scholarship after high school, he was a little
discouraged, so he went to Georgia State,'' Riverdale High coach
George Spencer said. ``He found out that there was a little
scholarship money in cheerleading, so he said, 'What the heck, I'll
try it.' It was a little strange, him being a cheerleader and his
sister down here as a placekicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Butler, who will be in a uniform in the Georgia Dome on
Saturday when Riverdale High faces Peach County in a semifinal game
of the state AAA playoff, has made 62 of 63 PATs and seven of 11
field-goal attampts, with a long of 39 yards. According to Spencer,
Tonya could be fortunate enough to get a scholarship, something her
brother still hasn't won.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just glad he's finally getting the opportunity to
play,'' said Spencer, who made numerous calls to Georgia Southern
for Tony Butler before the '97 spring drills. ``He's a kid who is a
little slow and a little short, but his heart is big as a truck. He
loves the game, and he'll give it everything he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries to Morrell (neck) and Rogers (sprained knee)
and the limited effectiveness of sophomore Dante Harrow (knee),
Butler will start alongside senior Josh Smithers and redshirt
freshman Jason Neese, from McEachern High School.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six or seven healthy linebackers on the Eagles' rosters,
Neese is the only one who was on the two-deep depth chart at the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who appeared in eight games as a special-teams player
last season, has played sparingly in 11 games so far. He pushed his
total number of unassisted tackles to 18 with three solo hits in
Georgia Southern's 52-30 victory over Connecticut this past
Saturday.
</P>

   ``He's real scrappy,'' Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson said,
``and I think he loves playing the game as much anybody I've ever
been around.''

 &HT;    Coach, players take exception with notion that focus lacks in
first half
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves hasn't had much to
gripe about during the last six months, but one question always
seems to hit his hot button. Ask if he is concerned about his
team's tendency to start games slowly, and his lips tighten, his
tone changes, and he makes his feelings clear.
</P>
<P>
   It it is a legitimate question for a squad that has trailed in
eight of 13 games this year. The last three Sundays, the Falcons
trailed the Bears 13-3 in the third quarter, the Rams 7-3 in the
third quarter and the Colts 21-7 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They rallied to win all three, a sure sign of a team that has
improved on the way to a stunning 11-2 record. But it's not a good
habit, especially with the playoffs looming and an improved Saints
team waiting in New Orleans on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many different ways can you answer that question?'' Reeves
asked. ``If somebody says, 'Were you motivated or not?' it's one or
the other. All I'm telling you is, I don't think we had a lack of
emotion. I don't think we came out flat. The Colts made some plays,
and we didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is, we didn't lose our poise,'' the coach said.
``We found a way to win. If you think we're going to jump out
because we're 11-2, and regardless of who we're playing it's going
to be 14-0, 21-0, 28-0, you're wrong, because we're not that kind
of football team. OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Shane Dronett has a different perspective.
``I'm glad we're playing three good teams in the next three weeks,
so we can get focused,'' Dronett said, referring to the Saints,
Lions and Dolphins. ``It's almost an arrogance, where you believe
what you read about yourself or your team, and you don't play as
well. You lose your focus. You're almost content with the ways
things are going.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves doesn't believe that. Neither does tight end O.J.
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not buying into this about us not being prepared to play
or that we take people lightly,'' he said. ``We came out there
ready to play ball. I had a turnover that put (the Colts) in good
position on the first drive. They only had to go (26) yards to
score, and the next thing you know we're down 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams like that have nothing to lose,'' Santiago said.
``They're going to try new things, different looks on offense and
defense for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said, ``We're not the kind of team that can play on just
turning on a switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Falcons have showed an ability to rally fast.
</P>
<P>
   They scored two touchdowns in the final 1:21 of the first half
to tie the Colts, then Ray Buchanan intercepted a Peyton Manning
pass on the first play of the second half. Three plays later,
quarterback Chris Chandler hit Terance Mathis on a 4-yard touchdown
pass.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 13 plays, nine by Atlanta's offense, the Falcons
went from a 21-7 deficit to a 28-21 lead, with just 3:04 elapsing.
</P>
<P>
   With a defense ranked third in the NFL with 31 takeaways; with
two receivers, Mathis and Tony Martin, on pace to have 1,000-yard
seasons; and with Chandler completing 57 percent of his passes for
an average of 16.2 yards per completion, the Falcons do have the
ability to rally.
</P>
<P>
   But if Atlanta falls behind Sunday at New Orleans, a comeback
figures to be more difficult. It will be the same in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints (6-7) have plenty of incentive. They have lost seven
in a row to the Falcons, three in the Crescent City, and they're
tied with Arizona and Tampa Bay in a race for the final wild-card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to the Saints and a victory by the 49ers over the Lions
would leave both teams 11-3, and San Francisco would hold a
tiebreaker edge over Atlanta in the race for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   So, now would be a good time to break the slow-start habit.
</P>
<P>
   FALLING BEHIND

have rallied six times.

 &HT;    Owners not ready to reinstate replay rule
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the NFL floated the possibility of instant replay
for the playoffs to help save face after a 1998 season marred by
questionable officiating, the idea could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite complaints about officiating, indications Tuesday were
that owners would reject replay if commissioner Paul Tagliabue
polled them by conference call next week. Eight votes would block
the return of replays.
</P>
<P>
   A check Tuesday with some owners found eight solidly opposed to
replay and at least two others leaning that way. Several owners
characterized as over-reaction the Monday announcement that the NFL
was considering a limited replay system for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal might not even come to a vote, especially if
Tagliabue senses opposition. ``We've seen the real-life definition
of 'knee-jerk,''' said Bengals owner Mike Brown, a long-time replay
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Retired game official Jim Tunney, one of the most respected
referees of this era, said that implementing replay now would
destroy officials' morale.
</P>
<P>
   At least two owners who voted against replay at the league
owners meeting in March, when it failed 21-9, said they now favor
it. But some owners, including Pittsburgh's Dan Rooney who
supported replay in March, said they could not reconcile
implementing the system for the playoffs and without the debate
that usually accompanies such decisions. Even NFL senior vice
president George Young questioned the wisdom and the timing of
Monday's trial balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league always has maintained the same rules of competition
(for the regular season and the postseason),'' Young said. ``I
don't run the league, but how in the world . . . could we go into
the most critical part of a season without having tested this? What
kind of logic is that?''

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta, rival sue each other over on-screen TV
guides
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gemstar has counter-sued Scientific-Atlanta over its
interactive on-screen TV guide in what's shaping up as a major
battle over who will control what viewers see when they first turn
on their TVs in the coming digital age.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are millions from advertisers who will pay a premium
for preferred placement on the on-screen guides.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the dispute is use of the software that creates
interactive television guides. The guides have become essential in
new digital TV set-top boxes, which enable viewers to get more than
200 channels. With the technology, viewers can search for shows,
get show descriptions and program VCRs with the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta is a major manufacturer of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar's patent infringement suit was filed in federal district
court in Northern California. It came days after Scientific-Atlanta
charged the Pasadena, Calif.-based company with antitrust and
patent violations in its own suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view Scientific-Atlanta's anti-trust allegations ... as a
desperate attempt to delay the severe legal consequences of its
willful infringement of Gemstar's intellectual property rights,''
says Henry C. Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta executives declined to comment, explaining
they never discuss ongoing legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The company's suit surprised industry observers and journalists
alike. Scientific-Atlanta executives first announced it Friday on a
bus full of analysts the company was escorting from the Western
Show in Anaheim, Calif. The analysts were being taken to see a
demonstration of the company's digital cable technology in an
Orange County system owned by Atlanta-based Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   On-screen guides are the first thing many digital TV subscribers
see when they turn on their televisions. They have become valuable
television commercial real estate, with some advertisers clamoring
to get on.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive guides have been contentious from the start. The
original two developers, Prevue and StarSight, have been battling
legally over the technology since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The battle grew more complex when Gemstar, a longtime supplier
of software to the consumer electronics industry, bought StarSight
in May 1997. StarSight had been a technology start-up funded by the
cable TV industry, including Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   When Gemstar bought StarSight, Gemstar's software was already
being used by Scientific-Atlanta. The Norcross, Ga.-based maker of
cable TV equipment was planning to use StarSight as the guide in
its new Explorer 2000 digital set-top system. That system has been
sold to many of the top cable TV operators, including Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta and Gemstar soon were in struggle over
interactive TV guide technology. Scientific-Atlanta lost the first
round when an arbitration panel ruled it had ``misappropriated''
the StarSight technology. It had to pay Gemstar $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The companies negotiated a new contract, in which
Scientific-Atlanta continued to use Gemstar's StarSight technology
for a fee. But that contract is due to expire July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume Gemstar and Scientific-Atlanta were in the process of
renegotiating that contract,'' said Alan Gould, a media analyst
with Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientific-Atlanta realized the fee for using StarSight was
going to go up. It could either pay more or get sued,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar has already sued Scientific-Atlanta's two biggest
set-top competitors, General Instruments and Pioneer, which also
use StarSight in their digital set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gould says that, in effect, ``Scientific-Atlanta launched a
pre-emptive strike.'' By suing first, he explained, the company
guaranteed its case would be heard in Atlanta _ not Northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV operators consider the guides important to winning
subscribers over to digital television service, for which they
charge a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Industry surveys have shown that consumers like the guides,
which is why the operators want Scientific-Atlanta, Gemstar and
others to settle, once and for all, who owns the technology.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech project to study new frontiers for fiber optics
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The future is in lights.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the means that could carry and manage much of the
world's high-speed communications of the future is the technology
of fiber optics _ the delivery and handling of data via the photons
that make up light. In an effort to find out just how commercial
that technology can be, a trio of interested companies have joined
with Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, Nortel and Corning last week announced support of the
second _ and potentially final phase _ of the Ultrafast Optical
Communciations Consortium under way at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very leading-edge stuff,'' said Mark Williams,
director of emerging technologies for Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-optic networks already carry data all over the globe. But
the Ultrafast Optical Communications Consortium is focusing on the
so-called backbone of the networks, where signals are combined or
separated. In those devices, where data is ``multiplexed'' and
``de-multiplexed,'' huge jams of data can slow down networks.
</P>
<P>
   That work is now commonly done through manipulation of
electrical signals. Researchers supported by the consortium are
hoping to find ways to use optics in those operations in order to
dramatically boost the capacity of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The all-optical multiplexing and de-multiplexing technologies
that are being explored by the consortium hold the promise of
significant increases in fiber-optic system capacity,'' said
Charles Deneka, senior vice president at Corning.
</P>
<P>
   The project had its start about four years ago with funding from
the Pentagon's high-tech arm, the Advanced Research and Projects
Agency. ARPA has since pulled out, but the private sector has
picked up the slack, hoping for techniques that will improve their
telecommunication businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Tech has a very good location. They've got very good
talent, and they've come up with an idea that we think is good. It
is a new technology for multiplexing. If you can do it in the
optical domain, you can save a lot of equipment. The question is
whether that is viable economically,'' said Deneka.
</P>
<P>
   Although the companies won't detail their financial involvement,
they are all donating money and people to the project. Nortel is
donating devices, Corning is donating optical components and
specialty fibers, and BellSouth is providing software and business
savvy. All are also sending researchers.

 &HT;    Officials deny company's claims of new prison dealBy Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The nation's largest private prison company plans to
build its third facility in Georgia and claims to have a deal with
the state to house Georgia inmates. But state officials say they
have not negotiated an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Corp. of America has bought land from the city of
McRae to build another 1,500-bed private institution in the South
Georgia ``prison belt.'' It would be the fourth private prison in
Georigia, including one owned by Cornell Corrections Inc. in
Charlton County.
</P>
<P>
   Although CCA has yet to break ground on the $45 million project,
plans call for the prison to be finished by February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and a CCA executive said the medium-security
McRae prison, just a few miles from two state prisons also in
Telfair County, will hold Georgia inmates only.
</P>
<P>
   CCA Vice President Peggy Lawrence said the company does not have
a contact, but there is an understanding with the state. ``This is
not going to be a facility that will house what we call out-sourced
inmates (from states other than Georgia). This is strictly for
Georgia use. That is our understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, State Department of Corrections Commissioner Wayne Garner
said the project was speculative. ``We have not had any
negotiations with them, period, about these facilities,'' said
Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Telfair Commission Chairman Chester Swain said the state was
involved in negotiations that began just two weeks ago, but he
declined to elaborate. ``I've told you all I can tell you. This
thing moved so fast. We're just trying to get everything off the
ground,'' Swain said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence said CCA does not build speculative prisons. ``That is
not our business. We don't always do it (build a prison) with a
signed document, but we do it with. . . a good assurance that those
beds will be used,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Roy Barnes, who must approve money for private prison
beds, said he would not ``preclude'' the McRae facility just
because it was run by the private sector but it would have to meet
the state's specifications. ``We've used a mixture of private and
public (prisons) and it think it's an appropirate thing to use a
mixture,'' Barnes said. House Appropriations Committee Chairman
Terry Coleman (D-Eastman), who represents the Telfair area, said
the talks have progressed to the point where CCA has said it will
charge the state the same $44.95 to $48.10 inmate per diem that it
charges at its other two prisons in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons _ public and private _ provide jobs and boost the local
economy. Even though there are state prisons holding in four of the
six counties adjoining Telfair, local officials still want more
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were needing something in the county for some employment,''
said Telfair County's Swain. ``This supposedly will employ between
350 and 400 people.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae Mayor Quinton Mullis said he is not concerned about
security problems even though dangerous inmates have escaped from
CCA prisons in other states. ``We're just trying to get the
facilities for the jobs,'' Mullis said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just days after the U.S. Department of
Justice released a report on the escape of five dangerous inmates
from a CCA prison in Youngstown, Ohio, a medium-security facility
that was holding high security inmates from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators found, among many things, that CCA
accepted inmates even though the Youngstown prison was not ready to
open, that prisoners were not properly and that security was flawed
and guards were not well-trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the start up problems it had are behind it,''
Lawrence said. ``The Justice Department report is perfectly
appropriate, but I view it as old news at this point and what's
critical is how well the facility is operating now.''

 &HT;    Wrestler pleads guilty to assault, threat charges
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A popular pro wrestler known as Big Poppa Pump pleaded
guilty Tuesday in Cherokee County to felony aggravated assault and
making terroristic threats.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Carl Rechsteiner was charged with assaulting and
threatening a road worker for the Georgia Department of
Transportation last April. He faces a maximum sentence of 26 years
in prison, but a lengthy sentence is unlikely. Rechsteiner tried to
plead guilty last month in a deal that would have placed him on
probation for 5 years and fined him $2,676.
</P>
<P>
   Judge C. Michael Roach rejected that deal because he was not
satisfied with Rechsteiner's answers to his questions about the
events that led to his arrest. Rechsteiner was allowed to plead
guilty Tuesday under a provision that allows someone to plead
guilty without admitting guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily I do not accept a plea from anyone who's not
willing to get up here and tell me exactly what happened,'' the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not immediately sentence Rechsteiner, who wrestles in the
New World Order wrestling organization under the name Scott
Steiner. He ordered state officials to conduct an investigation and
recommend a sentence for the wrestler, known for his bulging biceps
and a blond Fu Manchu mustache.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor David Gafnea told the judge Tuesday that he had
evidence to show that Rechsteiner drove down a closed exit ramp off
I-575 on April 21. He said Rechsteiner twice hit DOT road worker
Paul Kaspereen with his Ford F-250 pickup after Kaspereen told him
the ramp was closed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaspereen was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Gafnea said witnesses were ready to testify that Rechsteiner
said ``he didn't care who (Kaspereen) was'' and that he said ``he
would kick his ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Rechsteiner, who looked at the floor as Gafnea spoke, stood in
front of the judge and answered Roach's questions in a quiet voice.
His attorney, Alan C. Manheim, said last month that Rechsteiner
pleaded guilty because he was concerned that a jury would convict
him because of his ``public persona.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My client believes that he's innocent,'' Manheim said Tuesday.

ALLIES BALK AT U.S. STRATEGIC PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ American proposals for a broad new strategic
concept for NATO, to counter the global threat from chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons, received quizzical responses
Tuesday from European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Many allies also resisted U.S. suggestions that the alliance
could intervene in regional crises even when it did not have
explicit authority from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told other foreign
ministers at a meeting in NATO headquarters here that it was
hogwash to suggest that possible new missions for the alliance,
like building up intelligence on weapons of mass destruction held
by countries outside the NATO area, might contradict the original
self-defense goals of the North Atlantic Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was not suggesting, other officials who heard her
remarks said, that NATO extend its area of operations to Iraq or
Iran or take on the problem of development of nuclear weapons by
North Korea, for example. ``I made very clear,'' she said later,
``that we are not trying to get NATO to go global.''
</P>
<P>
   But the American initiative on weapons of mass destruction, an
assertive post-Cold War strategy for an alliance whose primary
mission has always been to defend its members' territory, raised
questions nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France said Tuesday that he
was concerned that if NATO broadened its mission ``we would run the
risk of diluting the alliance and dividing the allies, which, of
course, should not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany said it would be a
mistake to make a rule out of the exception that the allies made
this fall in Kosovo. NATO threatened bombing to halt government
attacks against ethnic Albanian civilians in the Kosovo province of
Serbia, even though the U.N. Security Council had not explicitly
authorized military action.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond self-defense, France and Germany insisted, NATO missions
should have Security Council approval. Albright said the U.S. view
was that NATO should address the issue case by case. But, she
agreed, ``NATO will in all cases act in accordance with the
principles of the United Nations Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has invited allied leaders to a summit meeting
in April in Washington to welcome Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary as new members, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
alliance and to approve a new post-Cold War strategy for the new
total of 19 members.
</P>
<P>
   The allies agreed that a new strategic concept would take many
more intensive discussions. Their primary concern remains European
security, guaranteed by the United States as leader of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies welcomed an agreement by Britain and France last
week that European countries should have the means to act
militarily on their own trouble-prone continent and to take
military action, even when the United States or other allies do not
want their own troops involved.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain, which has long argued
that NATO provides all the defense that Europe needs, conceded that
in trouble spots like Bosnia or Kosovo, Europeans might want to act
on their own before regional insecurity developed into a threat to
their own territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France said last week that they were aiming for a
capacity for autonomous military action by the European Union,
whose common foreign and security policy has so far been a
toothless tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States welcomes a more capable European partner,''
Albright said, ``with modern, flexible military forces capable of
putting out fires in Europe's own back yard and working with us
through the alliance to defend our common interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States would prefer the European defense identity to
develop in NATO, though. Washington agreed three years ago to a new
command structure that would allow its European allies to conduct
peacekeeping and other military operations under NATO auspices with
their own commanders and without U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   The United States agreed with the allies Tuesday to complete the
new command structure _ long delayed by disagreements over who
should control headquarters _ by the 50th anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies expressed great concern about security in Kosovo
and faulted the rebels and Serbian authorities in Belgrade for
increased tension following Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
decision, under allied pressure, to stop attacks. Serbia is one of
two republics that remain in Yugoslavia. Albright said fighting
could resume in the spring unless there was a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The allies also warned that their 32,000 peacekeepers could not
stay in Bosnia forever. Even after three years with the
peacekeepers, the allies said, peace is not yet self-sustaining.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta, rival sue each other over on-screen TV
guides
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gemstar has counter-sued Scientific-Atlanta over its
interactive on-screen TV guide in what's shaping up as a major
battle over who will control what viewers see when they first turn
on their TVs in the coming digital age.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are millions from advertisers who will pay a premium
for preferred placement on the on-screen guides.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the dispute is use of the software that creates
interactive television guides. The guides have become essential in
new digital TV set-top boxes, which enable viewers to get more than
200 channels. With the technology, viewers can search for shows,
get show descriptions and program VCRs with the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta is a major manufacturer of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar's patent infringement suit was filed in federal district
court in Northern California. It came days after Scientific-Atlanta
charged the Pasadena, Calif.-based company with antitrust and
patent violations in its own suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view Scientific-Atlanta's anti-trust allegations ... as a
desperate attempt to delay the severe legal consequences of its
willful infringement of Gemstar's intellectual property rights,''
says Henry C. Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta executives declined to comment, explaining
they never discuss ongoing legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The company's suit surprised industry observers and journalists
alike. Scientific-Atlanta executives first announced it Friday on a
bus full of analysts the company was escorting from the Western
Show in Anaheim, Calif. The analysts were being taken to see a
demonstration of the company's digital cable technology in an
Orange County system owned by Atlanta-based Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   On-screen guides are the first thing many digital TV subscribers
see when they turn on their televisions. They have become valuable
television commercial real estate, with some advertisers clamoring
to get on.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive guides have been contentious from the start. The
original two developers, Prevue and StarSight, have been battling
legally over the technology since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The battle grew more complex when Gemstar, a longtime supplier
of software to the consumer electronics industry, bought StarSight
in May 1997. StarSight had been a technology start-up funded by the
cable TV industry, including Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   When Gemstar bought StarSight, Gemstar's software was already
being used by Scientific-Atlanta. The Norcross, Ga.-based maker of
cable TV equipment was planning to use StarSight as the guide in
its new Explorer 2000 digital set-top system. That system has been
sold to many of the top cable TV operators, including Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta and Gemstar soon were in struggle over
interactive TV guide technology. Scientific-Atlanta lost the first
round when an arbitration panel ruled it had ``misappropriated''
the StarSight technology. It had to pay Gemstar $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The companies negotiated a new contract, in which
Scientific-Atlanta continued to use Gemstar's StarSight technology
for a fee. But that contract is due to expire July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume Gemstar and Scientific-Atlanta were in the process of
renegotiating that contract,'' said Alan Gould, a media analyst
with Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientific-Atlanta realized the fee for using StarSight was
going to go up. It could either pay more or get sued,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar has already sued Scientific-Atlanta's two biggest
set-top competitors, General Instruments and Pioneer, which also
use StarSight in their digital set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gould says that, in effect, ``Scientific-Atlanta launched a
pre-emptive strike.'' By suing first, he explained, the company
guaranteed its case would be heard in Atlanta _ not Northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV operators consider the guides important to winning
subscribers over to digital television service, for which they
charge a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Industry surveys have shown that consumers like the guides,
which is why the operators want Scientific-Atlanta, Gemstar and
others to settle, once and for all, who owns the technology.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech project to study new frontiers for fiber optics
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The future is in lights.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the means that could carry and manage much of the
world's high-speed communications of the future is the technology
of fiber optics _ the delivery and handling of data via the photons
that make up light. In an effort to find out just how commercial
that technology can be, a trio of interested companies have joined
with Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, Nortel and Corning last week announced support of the
second _ and potentially final phase _ of the Ultrafast Optical
Communciations Consortium under way at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very leading-edge stuff,'' said Mark Williams,
director of emerging technologies for Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-optic networks already carry data all over the globe. But
the Ultrafast Optical Communications Consortium is focusing on the
so-called backbone of the networks, where signals are combined or
separated. In those devices, where data is ``multiplexed'' and
``de-multiplexed,'' huge jams of data can slow down networks.
</P>
<P>
   That work is now commonly done through manipulation of
electrical signals. Researchers supported by the consortium are
hoping to find ways to use optics in those operations in order to
dramatically boost the capacity of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The all-optical multiplexing and de-multiplexing technologies
that are being explored by the consortium hold the promise of
significant increases in fiber-optic system capacity,'' said
Charles Deneka, senior vice president at Corning.
</P>
<P>
   The project had its start about four years ago with funding from
the Pentagon's high-tech arm, the Advanced Research and Projects
Agency. ARPA has since pulled out, but the private sector has
picked up the slack, hoping for techniques that will improve their
telecommunication businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Tech has a very good location. They've got very good
talent, and they've come up with an idea that we think is good. It
is a new technology for multiplexing. If you can do it in the
optical domain, you can save a lot of equipment. The question is
whether that is viable economically,'' said Deneka.
</P>
<P>
   Although the companies won't detail their financial involvement,
they are all donating money and people to the project. Nortel is
donating devices, Corning is donating optical components and
specialty fibers, and BellSouth is providing software and business
savvy. All are also sending researchers.

 &HT;    BellSouth confident, but still working on problem
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth is confident about fixing and testing its
Y2K bugs, but according to its recent filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the company still has plenty to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be there,'' said Robert J. Marmorato, who is with the
company's Year 2000 program management office. He was referring to
the company's June 30, 1999, target for a complete fixing and
testing of vital components.
</P>
<P>
   Marmorato said he couldn't disclose the number of
mission-critical systems at BellSouth, nor would the company say
how many embedded chips it has to fix.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also inventoried everything, including 4,000
buildings, 70,000 desktops, 2,500 voice switches and 8,000 servers,
along with about 5,000 unique software elements on company
mainframes, said spokesman Clayton Owen.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has spent $40 million on Y2K thus far. It estimates it
will cost $250 million to $350 million to fix the bug.
</P>
<P>
   The company has launched its Y2K counterattack in three parts,
each of which encompasses hardware, software, embedded chips,
suppliers and third party networks.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these areas, the ``network components'' effort,
focuses on the core of BellSouth's phone business. Suppliers
provide all the hardware and most of the software, and the vendors
are responsible for fixing and testing the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 30, the company said, the planning, inventory and
impact analysis phases were 75 percent to 100 percent complete, and
the remaining three phases _ conversion, testing and implementation
_ were each about 25 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   The second area of concern is ``information technology
systems,'' those that support customer operations such as billing.
The software for these systems was developed by both BellSouth
Telecommunications and vendors. Both are doing the work, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of September, the first three phases were each about
70 percent to 100 percent done, and the other three phases were
each about 30 percent to 50 percent complete for BellSouth
Telecommunications and about 0 percent to 50 percent complete for
other company operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building and environmental systems,'' the third area, includes
goods and services not part of network or customer care. Such items
are provided mostly by third parties and include everything from
elevators to aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 30, the planning phase was about 85 percent to 100
percent complete, the inventory phase was about 75 percent to 100
percent finished, and the impact analysis effort was approximately
67 percent to 100 percent done. The remaining three phases were
approximately 0 percent to 25 percent complete.

 &HT;    Time a factor in online news-gathering
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a new prime time _ noon to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Prime Time'' was one of several topics discussed
Tuesday at Jupiter Communications Digital News conference being
held here. More than 400 attendees gathered for the two-day
conference winding up today at the Omni Hotel in the CNN Center.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a key time period for online news consumption
according to analyst Patrick Keane. It's when workplace Web surfers
hit the Web for news and information in quick news summaries. With
the Web pushing past radio and newspapers as the third major source
of news information, the need to capture and engage the workplace
news junkie is vital.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Jupiter, an Internet research and consulting
company, makes it clear that there is a young wired group of people
looking for a news fix between the morning paper and the evening
news, there is still, even among the most venerable news
organizations considerable concern and discussion about how best to
reach the Net news audience.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists from major news organizations including Forbes, The
Washington Post, The Economist, MSNBC, CNN, and online magazine
Salond talked about the opportunities and the obstacles facing
traditional publishers in the online world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain kinds of publications are in great jeopardy,'' said
Forbes publisher Rich Karlgaard , ``Others will have a long run
ramp before any of this pays off.'' Karlgaard said some
publications including Forbes can find middle ground. ``We have our
own content and new material,'' he said, ``but what we still don't
know over time is if this will cannibalize our content.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Coll, managing editor of The Washington Post said that for
his newspaper the Web was a welcome outlet for a newspaper that has
long wanted to have a national presence. Coll and Anthony Gottlieb,
executive editor of the Economist, also said they would consider
integrating what works best on the Web into their sites, including
offering readers suggestions for other articles to read, in the
same way Amazon.com recommends books.
</P>
<P>
   There was no great concern about portals such as Yahoo, or
Excite, which provide a variety of services including Web
searching, news, white and yellow pages directories and free
e-mail, siphoning off the online news audience. Most thought that
analysis, even quick analysis, would ultimately draw readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, content providers have the advantage,'' said
Christian Science Monitor Editor David Cook. ``Anyone can post what
Alan Greenspan says, but only a content provider has somebody there
to tell you what it means,''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble has never been the editorial model, it's the
business model,'' Coll said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woelfel, editor-in-chief of CNN Interactive said the Web
site was another way for CNN to reach a wider audience. ``We reach
audiences in a way the other (CNN) networks can't. A Web site can
do a lot more than break one news event at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the custom home pages, portal strategies, news
alerts and quick summaries, MSNBC's Merrill Brown said online news
still had a long way to go. ``We have not created an Internet news
habit yet,'' Brown said. Jupiter research shows that the average
Web news junkie spends about 10 minutes on a news site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be really focused to be a real stand alone business
... One of our challenges is in developing a voice,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the overriding theme was the importance of having a
coherent vision. ``If you don't know who you are and what your
mission is,'' said the Post's Coll, ``You won't know how to react
when new technologies and situations present themselves.''

MASSIVE BLACKOUT HITS SAN FRANCISCO AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates throughout with details, quotes)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A massive power failure brought San Francisco to
a standstill at the height of the morning rush hour Tuesday,
stranding hundreds of people in high-rise elevators and dark
tunnels, freezing traffic and paralyzing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million people were without power during the height of
the outage, which was blamed on a construction accident. But the
authorities reported no major injuries or looting.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout hit parts of the San Francisco Bay area when a
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric substation in San Mateo shut down at 8:17
a.m. By midday, power had been restored to some areas but much of
the region was still without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Corey Warren said power was being restored
station by station, with manual switching required to restore
electricity city block by city block.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown said he was told by PG&AMP;E officials that the
blackout was caused by human error. Other officials attributed the
outage to a construction accident at the San Mateo substation.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco has been magnificent,'' Brown said. ``People
have been respectful of each other. The city is essentially
functioning as it previously has, a little bit slower but it's
functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Of major concern were reports from the San Francisco Fire
Department that as many as 50 elevators in 500 high-rise buildings
were having problems, although it was not immediately known how
many people were stuck inside.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department Inspector Kaan Chin said the biggest problem was
panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fire Department has been anticipating a situation like
this since the 1989 earthquake,'' he said, adding that it took
about a half hour to free trapped people from each elevator.
</P>
<P>
   According to PG&AMP;E spokeswoman Mary Rodrigues, the San Mateo
substation takes high-voltage power from transmission lines and
lowers it to a voltage that can be used by consumers. She said when
the substation shut down, automatic switches were triggered to
isolate the area.
</P>
<P>
   Without the switches, all of Northern California could have lost
power. Utility authorities said it would take hours to return the
substation to full service.
</P>
<P>
   For commuters, the blackout couldn't have come at a worse time,
hitting right in the middle of the morning rush into San Francisco,
crippling Bay Area Rapid Transit trains, stalling much of the
Municipal Railway's fleet, delaying and rerouting flights at San
Francisco International Airport and jamming various freeways.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of people were evacuated from subway tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, flight operations continued using separate power
but some flights were diverted to Oakland and San Jose to reduce
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency power lighted the airport terminals but computers were
not working, making it impossible to check in passengers, airport
spokesman Ron Wilson said. Airport personnel used bullhorns to
alert travelers to flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights at intersections throughout the city were off and
some electric buses and trolleys were stuck in the intersections,
blocking traffic. The police and parking control officers directed
traffic at others.
</P>
<P>
   At the Macy's department store on fashionable Union Square,
security guard Dennis Avant said he used a crowbar to rescue people
from elevators on the first and seventh floors. People were still
stuck at mid-morning on some floors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Stock Exchange stopped trading as computers failed,
but trading continued at the exchange's Los Angeles office.

 &HT;    Day's hearings put forth little drama
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scott Lauf, director of the Clinton Impeachment
Commission, arrived at the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday with
his 22-month-old daughter hoping to find a big crowd eager to
snatch up his fluorescent pink ``invitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauf's flyers invited the public to ``the O.J. Simpson Trial _
Part II,'' featuring ranking member John Conyers (D-Mich.) as
Johnny Cochran and Bill Clinton as ``the juice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lauf got few takers for his anti-Clinton joke. In sharp
contrast to independent counsel Ken Starr's appearance before the
Judiciary Committee three weeks ago, Tuesday's hearing was sparsely
attended and featured none of the electricity or drama.
</P>
<P>
   Many seats inside the committee room, impossible to get when
Starr testified, were empty. The hallways outside the large
committee room in the Rayburn House Office Building had little of
the hustle and bustle of Starr's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The stand of microphones erected for members to appear before
the media down the hallway from the committee room, which were in
almost constant use when Starr testified, were also quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the White House spinners _ the contingent of presidential
aides who work the media with the president's defense _ had a light
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just going through the motions,'' said Sean Wilentz, a
Princeton history professor who testified on the first panel. ``The
drama wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the difference had to do with Starr. Three weeks ago,
Starr hadn't uttered more than a few words in public about his
four-year investigation of President Clinton. Republicans were keen
to show the public that Starr was just a hard working prosecutor
trying to do his job. Democrats wanted to unmask him as an
overzealous prude. The public wanted see for itself who the real
Ken Starr was.
</P>
<P>
   Now, few mysteries remain. It is a virtual certainty that
Republicans will vote out at least one article of impeachment
against Clinton. It is equally certain that Democrats will vote
against the article or articles, and instead push a motion of
censure.
</P>
<P>
   No one anticipated that any witness called by the president's
team Tuesday would change any minds on the committee. And no
witness did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony was predictable,'' said George Gekas (R-Pa.).
``There was nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the purpose of the panel of legal experts and historians
was not to change minds on the committee but to sway the estimated
30 Republican moderates who are believed to be sitting on the fence
about how they should vote when articles of impeachment reach the
House floor next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wilentz, who told members that their ``reputations will be
darkened'' forever if they vote to impeach Clinton, said he was
acutely aware that those moderates were his audience. ``I wanted to
be sure they understood the grave constitutional question they
face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The empty hallways and light crowds clearly disappointed Lauf,
whose organization has staged a number of protests and stunts to
demand Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really hoping there was going to be a rush of people,''
said Lauf, holding a stack of his invitations.

 &HT;    CLINTON FOCUSES ON POLICY AND CONDOLENCES, NOT IMPEACHMENT
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days before the House Judiciary Committee is
expected to send at least one article of impeachment to the full
House, President Clinton spent a long day far from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done repeatedly during critical stages of the
year-long inquiry into his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton did his best to project the image
of a president hard at work on the nation's business, even as his
political detractors worked in the background to undo his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At a long-planned White House conference on Social Security
reform, Clinton appealed to more than 200 Congress members and
experts to ''march together'' to try to come up with a solution to
the retirement system's projected financial shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, when the committee was deep into testimony from
Clinton's personal lawyer, Gregory Craig, and a host of legal
scholars, Clinton was hundreds of miles away, entering the War
Memorial Auditorium in Nashville to hear Vice President Al Gore
eulogize his father, Sen. Albert Gore Sr., who died Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Washington on Tuesday night, Clinton was
scheduled to present an award to Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and his
wife, Betty Flanagan, for their work in setting up the non-profit
organization Peace Links.
</P>
<P>
   He was to speak later at another awards dinner sponsored by the
National Democratic Institute.

`PAVAROTTI AND FRIENDS': LENDING VOICES FOR PBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a duet that makes oil and water seem like a friendlier mix,
Luciano Pavarotti, stiff in white tie and tails, looks straight
ahead at the audience, oblivious to Celine Dion right next to him
onstage. As they perform ``I Hate You, Then I Love You'' (a duet
they also did last year on one of Ms. Dion's albums), he stares in
the direction of the teleprompter while singing, ``I could never
live without you.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she faces him, waving her arms wildly, closing her
eyes melodramatically, generally behaving like a lunatic. His
hauteur and her overacting have nothing to do with dramatizing the
lyrics, but are symptomatic of two singers who probably should not
appear on the same continent, never mind the same stage.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of high camp is what you might expect from ``Pavarotti
and Friends,'' a concert in which the tenor's new pals range from
the silly to the creative, from the Spice Girls to Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Most fit into a mushy middle ground of pop singers, including
Jon Bon Jovi, Natalie Cole, Trisha Yearwood and Vanessa Williams.
But that kitschy moment is the exception in this disappointingly
low-energy concert, the centerpiece of the current membership drive
by Channel 13 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Great Performances'' episode was taped in June before a
huge outdoor crowd in Modena, Italy, Pavarotti's hometown. At least
it was staged for a charitable cause, to benefit children orphaned
by the civil war in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   It was directed by Spike Lee, who is seen offstage with
Pavarotti at the start of the special discussing the chorus of
Liberian and Italian children put together for the event. The
concert is a nice idea that quickly turns flat.
</P>
<P>
   Purists might see this as Pavarotti's latest tumble down the
cultural ladder, but that is not a problem. The difficulty is that
this meeting of high art and pop is not informed by any grace or
wit. Pavarotti exudes an atypical noblesse oblige toward his
guests. And as they move through familiar solos and awkward duets
with the star, the concert seems tossed together, with styles
crashing into one another.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the full orchestra, Ms. Dion offers a stately
version of her inescapable ``My Heart Will Go On,'' complete with
her signature chest-thumping gesture (which always seems
reminiscent of Tarzan).
</P>
<P>
   The low point may be Ms. Cole and Pavarotti's duet on
``Tonight,'' which makes both seem ill at ease. When the four Spice
Girls sing the vapid ``Viva Forever'' with Pavarotti, the
linguistic mishmash of the song's title might stand for this entire
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight comes at the end, when Wonder sings ``Peace Wanted
Just to Be Free,'' a swooping, lyrical song written for this
concert. When Pavarotti joins him, it is the only time he seems to
connect with one of his guests. Part of Pavarotti's discomfort
might have been physical; he had hip-replacement surgery six weeks
after this concert. Whatever the cause, the disappointing outcome
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Coming during PBS' membership drive, the concert throws an
unattractive light on what happens when a supposedly upscale
institution decides to go slumming for an audience. Previous pledge
drives have done well with even more horrendous musical specials
featuring John Tesh and Yanni. If this is PBS' idea of pop culture
at its best, no wonder the network so often seems culturally out of
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Darin: Beyond the Song
</P>
<P>
   PBS usually understands pop music better when it's safely locked
in the past. ``Bobby Darin,'' another pledge program, is an uneven,
reverent, sometimes entertaining biography. In its many pedestrian
scenes, it includes interviews with friends and colleagues who cast
an expected golden glow on the life of a man who had a string of
hits in the late '50s and early '60s and died at 37.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he comes across as more of a Rat Pack wannabe than a true
original. At its best, the program includes juicy clips of Darin
onstage and in what now seem antique television appearances. The
songs include ``Beyond the Sea'' and ``Mack the Knife,'' as well as
one bizarrely irresistible duet (the kind the Pavarotti special
might have delivered): ``Splish Splash (I Was Taking a Bath)'' sung
with Jimmy Durante.

 &HT;    HEARINGS AND THE TALK SHOW WORLD MERGE AT THE CAPITOL
 &HT;    570&AMP;add.
 &HT;    Corrects network to CNBC in graf 6.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Equipped with a cell phone and descriptions of her
prey, Kerri Forrest trolled tirelessly for guests Tuesday in the
corridors outside the hearing room where the House Judiciary
Committee is considering the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive,'' explained the ambitious young booking
producer for the MSNBC cable TV network. ``You're always trying to
get to somebody before they show up on some other network's air.''
</P>
<P>
   Booking producers are big game hunters in a media jungle where
the quarry glides seamlessly between TV talk shows and the
televised hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has the same information coming out of the committee
room,'' said Teri Schultz, a freelance producer who was working
Tuesday with CNN correspondent Bob Franken. ``We want Bob to have
something that everyone else doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   However, scoops are hard to come by for the correspondents and
producers on the 24-hour news channels where White House scandal
has been a programming staple for nearly a year now. The same
people say the same things over and over again. Only the setting
can cue viewers where the action is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y., is being
interrogated by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the venue is the Judiciary
Committee hearing. But if Holtzman is answering similar questions
from Chris Mathews, it's CNBC's ``Hardball'' talk show. In both
places, she's saying that Clinton should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   If Reps. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and Barney Frank, D-Mass., are asking
questions in front of blue curtains, it's the hearing. If they're
talking to Fred Graham with the Capitol dome in the background,
it's Court TV. Both places, Barr and Frank are disagreeing.
</P>
<P>
   Only a three-minute walk separates the hearing room from the
makeshift studios set up on the same floor of the Rayburn House
Office Building. Some witnesses and committee members could make
the trek blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shortage of people here who want to jump in front
of cameras,'' said Carter Yang, a producer with ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for producers is to get the right person in front
of their cameras at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   So, producers keep an eye on a monitor showing what's going on
in the hearing room, and an ear on a cell phone conversation with a
desired member's press aide. They patrol the halls for witnesses.
They trade gossip with congressional staffers, colleagues and
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Luck is frequently a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this morning that _ just by accident _ Reuters TV had
caught David Kendall (the president's private attorney) coming into
the building. The Reuters crew was there waiting for the release of
files on Frank Sinatra,'' said Schultz. ``An entrance shot is a
pretty big thing in TV, and CNN is a Reuters client. So I called up
and got a dub.''
</P>
<P>
   John Oglunik, a producer for National Public Radio, recalled
waiting for Rep. Lamar Smith, a Judiciary Committee member, to
finish another interview so he could get the Texas Republican in
front of a microphone. On deadline, ``I needed a Republican for
balance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oglunik sought help from a fellow he took to be a Smith staffer,
but who actually was Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican Judiciary
committee member from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte ``turned out to be a wonderful interview,'' said
Oglunik.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio and some cable TV news channels provide
gavel-to-gavel coverage when the hearings are in session, so the
scramble comes during breaks. ``We pounce on them,'' admitted
Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondents covering the hearing from inside the room can
``talk through'' a 10-minute break, said Oglunik, but producers
need guests to fill any longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We avoid the witnesses'' as interview subjects, said Graham,
the on-air correspondent for Court TV. By the time the committee
has finished questioning them, ``every witness is wrung dry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The producers' workdays are often impossibly long. At 6:30 on
Tuesday morning, Schultz was with a CNN camera crew outside the
McLean, Va., home of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. By 9 a.m.,
she was in the Rayburn Building for the committee hearing expected
to last late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 hours of news programming to fill every day, the
appetite for interviews and talk show guests is insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure, but it's fun,'' said Forrest.
``Every day can bring a triumph.''

   WRENTHAM, Mass. _ Far from being a domestic abuser, Patriots
tight end Ben Terrence Coates is actually the victim of a jealous
lover who was trying to extort money, Coates's attorney told a
District Court jury here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coates went on trial Tuesday on one count of assault and
battery. The 6 foot, 5 inch, 250 pounds athlete is charged with
shoving 5 foot 8 inch Jennifer Marshall of Norton to the ground
and, when she got up and flew at him again, of picking her up and
throwing her onto the hood of her car last July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Norfolk District Attorney Glenn Cunha warned the jury
in his opening statement that the defense would try to show that
Marshall was trying to set Coates up to gain an advantage in their
legal fight over child support and other money matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after you hear the tapes (of messages Marshall left on
Coates's machine), you will have to ask yourself, `Is this a person
who will set someone up?' '' Cunha asked, and went on, ``At the end
of the trial I will ask you, did an assault and battery happen? Did
the defendant go over the line? Keep in mind the defendant makes a
living off his size and strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coates's attorney Mark Berthiaume told the five men and two
women of the jury that ``This is a woman who is motivated by greed
and anger. On that July 26 she was going to stop at nothing until
she had had a confrontation with this defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   As outlined in both opening and in subsequent testimony by
Marshall, she began dating Coates in 1993 and by March 1994 she
became pregnant with their daughter, whom they named Destiny. She
became pregnant after she learned Coates was married and had two
children in North Carolina, she admitted on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   While pregnant, she went onto the Montel Williams show, on a
program called ``Mistresses of Married Men.'' Marshall said Coates
had dared her to. On that program she admitted that she had said,
``I'm having his baby. He's going to pay for this kid.'' She also
said that if he were to jilt her, there were other Patriots players
who had made frequent passes at her.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, after she was refused admittance to the Patriots'
training camp's family area, she sued him in probate court and was
awarded $4,500 a month, or $54,000 a year, in child support. By
last July they were back in court when she sought an increase in
support payments and tried to ask him to buy her a $46,000 Mercedes
Benz car and a house.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall insisted during testimony that ``I wanted him to buy a
house for his daughter.'' Berthiaume shot back, ``Did you want the
Mercedes for your daughter, too?''
</P>
<P>
   It was when she went to his Franklin apartment on the afternoon
of July 26 to show him two architects' drawings of houses she was
considering having built, the more expensive one priced at
$600,000, that she found a strange car in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Coates would not let her in and, accompanied by a friend,
Carrinne Parkinson and by her daugher Destiny, she drove to a
telephone and left an obscenity-laden tirade of threats on Coates's
answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   She made three more such calls that afternoon and camped outside
the house. In the third of these calls, she can be heard on the
tape saying, ``I hope they will trade you over this (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   She also admitted on the stand she said she would have him
arrested. In one tape she is furious because he is seeing another
woman less than one day after they had sex.
</P>
<P>
   She had Parkinson buy a disposable camera and photographed the
strange car and the lighted bedroom window.
</P>
<P>
   When a young woman at last emerged and got into the car, she
took her photograph, too, she testified, and confronted her and
accused her of being a stripper, told her she and Coates were
lovers and that, moreover, he was married anyway. But she denied
screaming at her.
</P>
<P>
   When Coates came to the door, she reluctantly admitted under
cross examination, she shoved him repeatedly and called him
epithets, until he shoved her and she fell back, catching herself
with her forearms.
</P>
<P>
   When she rose and flew at him, she said, he picked her up and
slammed her onto the hood of her car, causing her to hurt the back
of her head.

 &HT;    PLAN TO RESCUE EVERGLADES DRAWS MIXED REACTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Water management officials seeking public comment
Tuesday on their plan to protect and preserve the Everglades and
South Florida ecosystems met mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   In the last public meeting before the $7.8 billion plan is
presented to Congress, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
South Florida Water Management District gave a quick summary of the
plan known as the ``Restudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan calls for 251,000 acres of marshes, reservoirs
and quarries to store billions of gallons of water for farms,
cities and nature. The proposal also would destroy 200 miles of
interior levees and canals, freeing some of the water the
endangered Everglades requires.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the state of Florida each would pay
half the cost of the 20-year project.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spoke against the plan said it was too vague, relied
too heavily on unproven techniques and cost too much money.
Speakers supporting the plan said it was the best available choice
and lauded the efforts to protect area wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Poole, executive director of the management district, said
though the plan isn't perfect, a ``train wreck'' will happen if the
plan is not implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do something to increase water supply, then all
assurances we can provide will be worthless,'' Poole said. ``We
know there are risks; we know there are uncertainties. If you have
an issue, then let's work to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 80 people who attended the meeting, about 35
signed up to speak. Most were Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Harrington, with the Washington-based Defenders of
Property Rights, said the plan will infringe upon the rights of
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``By proposing to flood 170,000 acres of private property, the
federal government is in violation of the Fifth Amendment,''
Harrington said. She said officials should work to minimize the
burden on landowners and provide rapid, fair compensation to those
whose property must be flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers who voiced their support of the plan pointed out some
faults but applauded the efforts of the Corps of Engineers and
water management district.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say if nothing is done, the quality of water in the
area will deteriorate, water shortages for urban and agricultural
users will occur more frequently, and many plants and animals
living in South Florida will become extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Restudy must happen,'' said Gerald Barber, chairman of the
National Wildlife Federation board. ``It represents our best and
possibly last effort to save the Everglades and wildlife.''

SHIPS REQUIRED TO REPORT PRESENCE IN WHALE WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to reduce the leading cause of accidental death for the
world's most endangered species of whale, an international panel
Tuesday ordered large ships to report to the Coast Guard when they
enter the waters off Massachusetts to help avoid hitting the big
marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting system adopted by the International Maritime
Organization in London will inform vessels entering Cape Cod Bay
and the main shipping route to Massachusetts about nearby Northern
right whales. A similar system will be set up in the whales'
calving grounds off Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Though only one or two right whales are confirmed killed by
ships each year, biologists say the deaths are potentially
devastating to a species that now has only about 300 surviving
members. The monitoring system, they said, is the first step toward
eliminating those needless deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``This population is so small that saving one individual makes a
difference,'' said Scott Kraus, a senior biologist at the New
England Aquarium in Boston. ``If one ship captain gets the message,
sees the whale, and changes direction, it will have been worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring system, championed for the last year by US Rep.
William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, marks the first time a
government agency has required the shipping industry to take steps
to protect right whales. Until now, conservation groups have
promoted voluntary reporting when ships are in areas popular with
whales.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Navy opposed the mandatory reporting plan on
national security grounds, but President Clinton overruled its
objections last May and forwarded the proposal to the International
Maritime Organization, which represents countries with
international shipping industries.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Clinton administration officials were elated at the
unanimous support for the monitoring plan, which would apply to all
boats weighing over 300 tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision significantly improves protection for the
slow-moving whale, since ship strikes account for 50 percent of
known right whale deaths,'' explained Terry Garcia, assistant
secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Northern right whales, which can grow up to 60 feet long and
weigh up to 80 tons, were hunted nearly to extinction at the turn
of the century when only a handful of sexually mature females
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite a ban on hunting the whales for more than 50
years and federal protection as an endangered species for 30 years,
the right whales have made only limited progress. The whales
produced record-few offspring this year and biologists are not sure
if the long term population trend is up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Though the species faces a range of problems, from genetic
inbreeding to entanglement in fishing lines, biologists believe
collisions with ships are their number one hazard. The whales spend
a lot of time in heavily traveled shipping lanes such as the Great
South Channel east and south of Cape Cod and the Bay of Fundy in
Canada, and often don't yield as ships approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the southeast, environmentalists fly surveillance over the
whales during winter calving season, but even that extraordinary
measure wasn't enough to prevent the deaths of several right whales
in 1996 during Navy maneuvers. And biologists are investigating a
potential ship strike death off North Carolina two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the New England Aquarium said shipping industry
officials seem eager to help, but few have experience with whales.
Most of the thousands of ships that cross the Great South Channel
never encounter right whales, and captains may not know they have
hit a whale even when it happens.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, environmentalists said the reporting system, which
takes effect next July, should be seen as part of a larger
campaign, raising mariners' awareness and collecting information on
ship traffic patterns for future, perhaps tougher, decisions about
how to reduce collisions.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring system ``is huge, but it's only a first step,''
said Dave Wiley of the International Wildlife Coalition in
Falmouth, Mass. He predicted the system would save few whales
initially, ``but conservation is a long term thing.''

SPEEDING DOES NOT JUSTIFY CAR SEARCH, SUPREME COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Md.) (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Issuing a speeding ticket does not automatically
give the police the authority to search the car, the Supreme Court
ruled unanimously Tuesday in rejecting the latest invitation from
law-enforcement officials to expand the powers of the police in
encounters with motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The court held that police in Iowa violated a driver's
constitutional rights by conducting a full search of his car based
on nothing more than a speeding violation, for which the police
issued a citation. The search turned up marijuana and led to the
man's conviction on state narcotics charges.
</P>
<P>
   An Iowa law, the only one of its kind in the country, authorizes
the police to conduct the same kind of search after issuing a
citation, for traffic or other offenses, that Supreme Court
precedents permit as an aspect of making an arrest. The Iowa
Supreme Court upheld the law, and the search at issue in this case,
in a 5-4 vote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion Tuesday by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the
justices did not declare the Iowa law unconstitutional in all
possible applications. But for a simple speeding offense, Rehnquist
said, the justifications for the court's doctrine permitting a
``search incident to arrest'' simply do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, when the court first announced in United
States vs. Robinson that the police could search the area under the
control of a person they had just arrested, the justices offered
two rationales for what was, in effect, an exception to the Fourth
Amendment requirement that searches must ordinarily be authorized
by search warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Such searches were justified by the need to protect the safety
of the arresting officers and to prevent the suspect from
destroying evidence, the court said in its 1973 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court Tuesday in Knowles vs. Iowa, No. 97-7597,
Rehnquist said the threat to the police from issuing a traffic
ticket, which he called a ``relatively brief encounter,'' was ``a
good deal less than in the case of a custodial arrest.'' And there
is no further evidence to discover in a speeding case, he said,
noting that once the driver was stopped for speeding, ``all the
evidence necessary to prosecute the offense had been obtained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No further evidence of excessive speed was going to be found
either on the person of the offender or in the passenger
compartment of the car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant in this case, Patrick Knowles, was driving 43 mph
in a 25-mph zone when the police stopped him in Newton, Iowa, in
1996. At a hearing after his arrest for marijuana possession, he
challenged the constitutionality of the search. The officer
testified that he had had no basis for suspecting a crime other
than speeding, but had conducted the search under the state law
authorizing searches ``incident to the citation.''
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted considerable attention once the court agreed
last March to hear Knowles' appeal. The American Civil Liberties
Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
filed a brief for Knowles, while the National Association of Police
Organizations entered the case on Iowa's behalf, stressing the
inherent danger to the police from even routine traffic stops. It
was evident from the briefs that if Iowa prevailed in this case,
the practice of conducting searches after such traffic stops would
become widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's opinion made clear that far from ignoring the issue
of police safety, the justices believed they had taken adequate
account of it in other decisions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, in Maryland vs. Wilson, the court ruled that the
police may routinely order passengers out of a car they have
stopped for a routine traffic violation; a 1977 decision had
already given the police authority to order the driver out of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``But while the concern for officer safety in this context may
justify the `minimal' additional intrusion of ordering a driver and
passengers out of the car,'' Rehnquist said in Tuesday's opinion,
``it does not by itself justify the often considerably greater
intrusion attending a full field-type search.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases growing out of encounters between the police and motorists
are a staple of the court's docket, and the police win most of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in Whren vs. United States, the court ruled
unanimously that the actual motivation of police officers in making
a traffic stop was irrelevant as long as there was probable cause
to believe that traffic laws were being violated; it did not matter
if the stop was really a pretext to check the car for drugs. In
that case, large bags of crack cocaine were in plain view in the
passenger's hands, so the kind of search involved in the case
Tuesday was not at issue.

JUSTICES RULE POLICE NOT ALLOWED TO AUTOMATICALLY SEARCH VEHICLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the
Constitution forbids police officers from automatically searching
the cars of motorists they have pulled over for traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
   In their 9-0 ruling, the justices said drivers who are merely
cited for speeding or similar offenses do not present enough of
threat to law enforcement officers to justify a vehicle search and
therefore enjoy Fourth Amendment protection against the
unreasonable procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices also reiterated an earlier decision permitting
summary searches when police plan to arrest the motorist, saying
officers have a constitutionally protected suspicion that people
facing the prospect of prison might reach for guns or destroy
evidence that could be in their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned the drug conviction of Iowa motorist
Patrick Knowles, whose car was searched by a police officer who had
pulled him over for driving 43 mph in a 25 mph zone. The justices,
overturning an Iowa Supreme Court decision, called the search
unconstitutional and said the marijuana and related paraphernalia
the officer found should not have been admitted at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
a police officer's concern for safety and evidence when citing a
speeding motorist is not as strong as when a driver is about to be
arrested. A motorist simply detained for speeding neither presents
a significant threat to the officer's safety nor gives the police
cause to suspect that the car contains evidence of a crime, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   If an officer does fear for his safety during a routine traffic
stop, he or she may constitutionally order a driver and passengers
out of the car and, if reasonably suspicious, frisk them for
weapons, the court said. However, an officer has no reason to
search for evidence of crime when detaining a motorist simply for a
traffic violation, the justices added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once (the driver) was stopped for speeding and issued a
citation, all the evidence necessary to prosecute that offense had
been obtained,'' Rehnquist wrote. ``No further evidence of
excessive speed was going to be found either on the person of the
offender or in the passenger compartment of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa hailed the court's
decision as a ``victory for ... freedom and privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa's little experiment with a police state is now,
thankfully, over,'' said Ben Stone, executive director of the
state's ACLU chapter. ``Iowans can once again enjoy the freedom of
knowing they can drive down the street and not fear being searched
by a police officer if they make an illegal turn or forget to use
their turn signal.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the National Association of Police Organizations said
it was ``somewhat disappointed'' with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But the group welcomed the court's ``emphatic recognition'' that
officers can take constitutionally protected steps to safeguard
themselves when approaching a motorist to issue a citation.
</P>
<P>
   The reception to the court's decision stood in stark contrast to
its ruling in a Fourth Amendment case last week. The justices
earned scorn from the ACLU but praise from police when they ruled
in Minnesota vs. Carter that business guests do not enjoy Fourth
Amendment protection while in someone else's home.

BOY SUES MOTHER OVER INJURIES SUFFERED IN THE WOMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Five-year-old Ryan Dobson is suing his mother for
injuries suffered in the womb. The case, which could have major
legal implications for the status of fetal and abortion rights in
Canada, was argued Tuesday before the country's Supreme Court in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was delivered by an emergency Caesarean section a few hours
after his mother, Cynthia Dobson, wrecked her car on a snowy New
Brunswick highway in 1993 when she was 27 weeks pregnant. The child
suffers from an array of physical and mental infirmities, including
cerebral palsy, as the result of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The case revolves around whether the fetus that became Ryan is
an individual victim of the accident, and deserves compensation for
injuries beyond what the insurance company was willing to pay to
cover the costs of the mother's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That abstract legal question hides an explosive issue. If the
court recognizes that Ryan is an accident victim, it follows that a
fetus has some rights as an individual. Abortion advocates strongly
oppose giving legal rights or protections to the fetus since such
recognition might lead to restrictions on the medical termination
of pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assigning any rights at all to a fetus has the potential to
take away from a woman's right to an abortion,'' said Kim Luton of
the Canadian Abortion Rights League.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Roman Catholic and Protestant groups that oppose
abortion have entered the case on Ryan's behalf, arguing that a
fetus is an individual with rights separate from those of its
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unborn child and the mother are distinct human beings,''
said Ottawa lawyer William Sammon, representing the Catholic groups
involved in the case. ``The unborn child is a person deserving of
some protection.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, Canadian law gives no rights or protections to the
fetus at any stage of development. Abortion in this country falls
into a legal gray area. Although laws criminalizing abortion were
lifted in 1988, no federal statute regulates the procedure or
spells out the legal status of a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that drew international attention last year, Canada's
Supreme Court ruled that a woman who shot her fetus in the womb had
not committed a crime because a fetus is not a person. Upon giving
birth, the woman was given custody of the baby after surgeons
removed the projectile.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Supreme Court has long hinted that Parliament
should pass legislation defining the rights of the fetus,
especially one close to birth.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's case was originally brought by his grandfather, who sued
his daughter on behalf of the child in an apparent effort to force
the woman's insurance company to help pay the costs of raising the
disabled child. Ryan lives at home with his mother, and there is no
implication that he has been mistreated since being born.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company argued the mother's case, claiming that
the fetus was simply an extension of her body, like a kidney or a
toe, and there is no legal obligation to cover the health costs
once the baby is born and becomes a person in the eyes of the law.
</P>
<P>
   But abortion foes argue that the fetus is an individual in its
own right, and that it is absurd to suggest there is no legal
connection between what happened to the fetus that became Ryan and
the disabilities of the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Dobson is not suffering from injuries that occurred to
his mother. Ryan is suffering from because of injuries he suffered
at the accident scene,'' lawyer David Brown argued on behalf of the
Evangelical Fellowship, a church group opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to be months before the Supreme Court rules on the
case.

N.H. TO URGE PLEDGE ON PRIMARY BY CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Trying to maintain New Hampshire's clout in
presidential politics, a bipartisan commission here said it would
ask potential candidates not to campaign in states that hold
primaries within one week of the Granite State's.
</P>
<P>
   Though such pledges would be voluntary, and no one who refused
would be denied a spot on the ballot, the move illustrates the
jockeying already under way by states trying to maximize their
influence in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said she is urging all
candidates to sign a pledge promising not to campaign in states
that encroach on New Hampshire's sacred first-in-the-nation status.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Missouri Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Minnesota
Senator Paul Wellstone, Vice President Al Gore, and Ohio
Representative John Kasich have signed the pledge. But aides to
former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and publisher Steve
Forbes said their bosses are hesitant to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen said New Hampshire serves a vital role for the nation,
allowing candidates to meet with voters one-on-one and enabling
politicians without the most money or national exposure to compete
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This simply isn't possible in most places,'' Shaheen said.
``The opportunity for personal, retail campaigning is lost in
larger states, where campaigns are played out in television
commercials and on airport tarmacs.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan brought a strong retort from Delaware, which plans to
hold its 2000 primary four days after New Hampshire. Basil
Battaglia, the Delaware Republican Party chairman, called the
tactic ``cheap,'' ``arrogant,'' and ``heavy-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be arrogant for us to tell another state when they
could have their election,'' Battaglia said. ``I would hope that
anyone who seeks our nation's highest office would be able to
resist giving in to what amounts to little more than cheap
political extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Delaware, South Carolina is considering holding its
primary four days after New Hampshire. Furthermore, California
plans to move up its primary to March, while blocs of other states
have begun banding together to hold regional primaries that month,
hoping to gain influence and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire law states that its primary must be held seven
days before any other primary. Members of the commission conceded
that the pledge is nothing more than an attempt to publicly
pressure the candidates to uphold New Hampshire's tradition, which
dates back to 1920 and brings upward of $30 million into the state.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Keefe, a commission member and former chairman of the state
Democratic Party, urged party activists to refuse to help
candidates that campaign in states such as Delaware. He said
members of the media should vigorously question candidates who
don't comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as they pay no price in New Hampshire for campaigning
in Delaware or any other state, they won't refrain,'' Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Governor Hugh Gregg, a Republican, said he had begun
contacting Republicans who might run for president and received a
mixed a reaction. Keefe said he is still trying to reach all of the
Democrats who might run for president. Senator John F. Kerry, who
is thinking about running, has not yet received a call about the
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was en route to Jakarta, Indonesia, Tuesday and could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Neither chairman of the Democratic or Republican Parties in New
Hampshire said he planned to take any action against candidates who
won't sign the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to beat up on any candidate,'' said Steve
Duprey, chairman of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for Forbes and Alexander were leery about the pledge
and its implications since neither man is a declared candidate and
the primary schedule is still in flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes is not a candidate,'' said Paul Young, the head
of Northeast operations for Forbes's Americans for Hope, Growth and
Opportunity group. ``He has always supported New Hampshire being
the first in the nation primary and continues to support that and
hopes the process can be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Griffin, a New Hampshire consultant to Alexander, was
exasperated at the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be suffocated in pledges here,'' he said,
citing two similar pledges from 1996 signed by Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamar Alexander has not made an announcement conclusively that
he's going to be a candidate for president,'' Griffin said. ``The
schedule is not settled. There's nothing worse than signing a
pledge and breaking a pledge.''

PROPOSAL CALLS FOR USING RECLUSE'S BEQUEST FOR HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some poor people in San Francisco would get free
medical and dental care under a city proposal for the fortune left
by a recluse who died earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zygmunt Arendt, who died Jan. 24, left at least $4.5 million in
stocks and real estate in a handwritten will stipulating that the
mayor and the Board of Supervisors use 60 percent of the money for
the poor and needy, and the remainder for disadvantaged seniors and
disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Human Services General Manager Will Lightbourne, assigned by the
Board of Supervisors to propose ways to use the estate, has
recommended that Arendt's bequest be given in the form of health
services to poor people who wouldn't normally receive it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would ``identify people who are basically very low
income, who are trying to become self-sufficient, and give them
non-emergency medical assistance,'' Lightbourne said. ``We're
talking about single people who are not eligible for MediCal for
things such as eyeglasses, dental.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, he said, is to use the interest over the next few
years, rather than the principal itself.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors must first approve the proposal. If they agree, it
would be submitted to Probate Court for final approval.

THE ART OF AARON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETTY KWONG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Aaron Yamagata sits poised in his yellow
</P>
<P>
   plastic chair, legs crossed, hands neatly folded over his knee,
discussing his deep passion for art.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock are among his favorite
artists. He can't wait to see the ``Mona Lisa'' in person. Acrylics
_ no question about it _ are his favorite medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to speak to the world when I draw,'' he says. ``When I
want harmony, happiness, peace and love, that's what I draw _ and
that's my message to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Michelangelo. This 8-year-old is determined. He's had
an eye on becoming a famous artist since he was 3 _ and he's way
beyond crayons.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron already has won many awards for his work _ plenty more
than the number of years he's been alive.
</P>
<P>
   His latest achievement came last month, when he was chosen from
a field of 10,000 entries to win the seventh annual UNICEF ``Kids
Helping Kids'' Greeting Card Contest. His colorful rendering of a
snowman will be reproduced and sold as a holiday card at Pier One
stores next winter.
</P>
<P>
   The UNICEF honor, shared with 6-year-old Mia Walsh of Toppenish,
Wash., who won in the 7-and-younger age group, earned him a
three-day trip to Manhattan, N.Y.; $500; and a tour of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The snowman of Aaron's making holds a garland designed with
symbols: a heart, signifying his wish for love in the world; St.
Nick's face for happiness; a dove for peace; and a reindeer,
symbolizing man's harmony with nature.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't stop there. Aaron didn't choose the snowman image
haphazardly either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd take kids helping kids to form a perfect snowman,'' he
explains. ``And the contest was about `Kids Helping Kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course.
</P>
<P>
   The honor will be dutifully added to his two-page resume, which
lists a dozen first-place awards for statewide and national art
contests; firsts for a science fair, a spelling bee and a poetry
contest this year; and appearances across the media landscape,
including a visit to ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a very famous artist when I grow up,'' he begins,
``a famous inventor, a great magician, a musician. And I'm a great
tap dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   He practices his tap dancing almost every day, transforming the
same board that's his makeshift drawing table into a temporary
dance floor over the carpet of the modest apartment that's home to
Aaron and his mother, Didi Yamagata.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any grand plan to turn Aaron into an artist _
famous or otherwise, says Yamagata.
</P>
<P>
   Like any parent, she wanted to expose Aaron to as many
opportunities as possible _ sports, music, language, arts. An ad in
a parenting magazine led her to Linda Wherli's Fine Art and Music
Academy, a home-based art school in Valley Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really took a liking to it, so much so that it became a
second life,'' Yamagata says laughing.
</P>
<P>
   For five years now, he's been attending the after-school academy
for 90-minute sessions once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit apprehensive about his age at first,'' says
Wherli, who interviewed Aaron to assess his ability when he was a
``teeny little elf'' at 3. ``But he was so astute and so alert.
He's right up there with the rest of my students.''
</P>
<P>
   He's outgrown the need for extra seat cushions, but Aaron still
barely takes up a quarter of his metal folding chair at the
academy, more often than not perched on its edge, shoes dangling
from his toes, head bowed with concentration on his latest drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The recent flurry of media attention surrounding his win in the
UNICEF contest _ including appearances on NBC's ``Today Show,''
``Good Morning America'' and even ``CNN Today'' _ hasn't fazed
Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one step toward his dream: ``To live in Paris, France,
and sit on the sidewalk, drawing all the ornamental buildings. To
go the top of the Eiffel Tower and see the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if he never gets to see the whole world from atop the
famous landmark, if he never achieves the fortune that comes with
fame, he already counts himself among the blessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fortunate to have my health, a mother that cares for
me and loves me, my talents,'' Aaron said, ``and a big brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his 11-year-old girlfriend at Woodcrest School has
different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want me to be an artist,'' says Aaron. ``She wants
me to have a legitimate job, like a doctor or a lawyer.'' &QL;

   One by one they wearily offered hair-raising testimonials. Aziza

independence. To others they are just sons, who must be defended no
matter what they did.
</P>
<P>
   But to all, the young men are victims, imprisoned because they
followed their leaders' orders to pursue an armed struggle. Now the
Palestinian leaders are shaking hands with the Israelis, the
mothers said, but their sons are withering away behind bars, many
serving life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis killed thousands of Arabs and they keep saying my
son's hands are filled with blood,'' said Mrs. Abed Rabu, holding a
giant gilded frame with her son's picture inside a needlepoint mat.
``Their soldiers walk free. Our soldiers stay locked up. Is our
blood cheap, and theirs precious and expensive? The war is supposed
to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks there have been mass protests on behalf
of the prisoners and violent clashes across the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   In every Palestinian town, and in East Jerusalem, the prisoners'
relatives have put up makeshift tents _ bases for fasting, camping
and marching into familiar confrontation with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Until the relative calm of Tuesday, the unrest had gained
momentum with every day, threatening the Israeli-Palestinian peace
effort. In response to the violence, the Israelis have frozen the
land-for-security plan, and it appears increasingly unlikely that
they will carry out the second of three withdrawals from the West
Bank as scheduled by Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   And with every day, the prisoner issue has assumed greater
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Some youths are referring to the riots as ``the prisoners'
intifada,'' evoking the Palestinian uprising of 1987-1993. The
anniversary of that uprising's outbreak will be celebrated on
Wednesday. Israeli officials have seized on the label to paint the
unrest as a breakdown of the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, cut short a trip abroad
in order to oversee the containment of the violence, which has
taken on anti-American as well as anti-Israeli overtones as
President Clinton's visit to the region draws near.
</P>
<P>
   To the Palestinians, the fate of their prisoners is as deeply
felt as any issues that were on the table during the peace talks at
the Wye River Plantation in October. They negotiated hard to win
the release, in three batches, of 750 of the roughly 2,200
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Israelis released the first group, most were common
criminals, not political prisoners. The Israelis said that was
because, as agreed, they would not free any terrorists or anyone
with ``Israeli blood on his hands,'' and that disqualified everyone
but about 100 security detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians assert that this was not the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks we went to Wye to get our car thieves
liberated,'' said Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, the speaker of the
Palestinian Legislative Council. ``This has created a difficult and
complicated situation with our people, and the Israelis need to
amend it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say publicly that the Israelis have stuck to the
letter of the agreement on the prisoners' issue. Privately, some
American officials acknowledge that the Israelis have wiggle room,
and Israeli security officials have pressed others in the
government to consider loosening their criteria for release to
avoid an explosion in the jails and on the streets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Qurei said President Clinton himself was immersed in the details
of the prisoner negotiations, in the haggling over who specifically
could be freed _ ``how much from Fatah, how much from Hamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the understanding was that members of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Fatah movement who had taken part in
terrorist acts could be freed, if they did not directly commit
murder and if the acts were undertaken before the Oslo peace accord
signed in 1993, according to Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, a senior aide to Arafat, said only a fraction, about
300, of the Palestinian prisoners were directly involved in
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they are over-represented in the tent in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   To sit with the mothers here, on the rugs that do little to make
the cold pavement softer, is to enter a mindset clouded by years of
living under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   To talk with them, as with the prisoners' advocates who occupied
the tent beside the Red Cross building in East Jerusalem, is to
understand that one man's terrorist is indeed another man's freedom
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is a good boy, a smart boy,'' said Mrs. Afandi, whose
son has served 7 years of a 30-year sentence for stabbing an
Israeli in Jerusalem. ``The Jews made him what he was. When he was
a student at Bethlehem University, the Jews beat him severely.
During the intifada, they stormed our house. They beat his brother.
I was injured by a rubber bullet. After what he experienced, he
understood the cause deeply. He rose to our defense. He reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiraimi nodded, holding up a prison portrait of her
27-year-old son, his hands and legs in shackles. ``My son was
preparing some bombs when he was caught,'' she said. ``Thank God. I
am proud of what they did, our sons. They didn't do anything
shameful. They devoted their life to our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The mothers described years of grueling trips to visit their
sons in prison. Wrapped in traditional Islamic dress, they
complained about being strip searched by the Israelis, down to
their false teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In East Jerusalem, the fathers and brothers kept camp in the
tent beside the Red Cross building, chain-smoking to distract
themselves from the hunger pangs after several days of fasting. In
contrast to gatherings of prisoners' relatives elsewhere, no one
maintained the charges were false. Perched on stools, leaning on
canes and peering through thick bifocals, they, like the mothers in
Bethlehem, talked frankly about their relatives' offenses _
``military activities'' like kidnapping and killing Israeli
soldiers or hijacking airplanes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was a soldier in the PLO'' who followed orders from its
leaders, said Kasem Bakhatan. ``His cell was active in attacking
Israelis, in injuring them. But what he did was before Oslo and the
peace agreements. It was during the armed struggle. Now we are in
the midst of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Israeli jails, hundreds of Palestinians are refusing to
eat as part of a hunger strike that stretches from the detention
tents of Meggido to the concrete cells of Ashkelon. Israeli prison
officials are concerned about an uprising timed to coincide with
Clinton's visit, which begins Saturday, just as Palestinian
officials are worried that a general strike in solidarity with the
prisoners, scheduled for Monday, could get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   During clashes that grew out of the prisoners' marches, the
nephew of Saeb Erekat _ a Palestinian negotiator who is a familiar
figure in Mideast diplomacy, often seen translating into the ear of
Arafat _ was struck by a rubber bullet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The nephew, Nasser Erekat, who Erekat said had climbed onto a
rooftop to urge his younger brother to come in out of harm's way,
was pronounced clinically dead Tuesday.

   CHINA-ART (New York) _ The ``Inside Out: New Chinese Art,'' is
an exhibition organized by the Asia Society in Manhattan and
installed there and at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long
Island City (through Jan. 3). It is the largest gathering of its
kind in the West to date, and the first to take a broad-spectrum
look at new work from across the Chinese-speaking world, including
the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and artists living abroad. The
result is a sprawling affair, a pileup of media, styles and
philosophies, from brush and ink painting to installation art,
mock-propaganda to Pop, Dada to Daoism, exemplary of a ``global''
art that promises to have increasing visibility in the years to
come. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   EROTIC-ART-SALE (Undated) _ The trove of ancient erotic art that
Christie's plans to sell on Thursday includes dozens of objects
made between 500 B.C. and 400 A.D. that cannot be described in
detail in a family newspaper. There are couples coupling and single
guys who would be the envy of modern-day single guys _ and who
could have been bigger scene-stealers than the one in last season's
sculpture-class episode of ``Ally McBeal.'' If only they had lived
another 2,000 years. Some of the terms Christie's uses to describe
these items in its 80-page catalogue do not appear in most
dictionaries. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-IN-LOVE-FILM (Undated) _ Many things about William
Shakespeare's life and work are shrouded in mystery, but the
mystery of what scholars call his lost years is one of the most
intriguing of all. What did Shakespeare do between 1585, when he is
known to have left his home in Stratford-on-Avon, and 1592, when he
re-emerged in London. No one knows for sure, and ``Shakespeare in
Love'' provides a fanciful explanation by imagining the young
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) as a nearly unknown actor and
playwright who finds his poetic voice through a passionate love
affair with one Viola De Lesseps, a woman as clever as she is
beautiful. That Viola never actually existed, and that she is
played by the certifiably American Gwyneth Paltrow (albeit with a
plausible English accent), didn't matter to the filmmakers. The
movie, which opened on Friday, is meant to be a high-entertainment
mix of fact and fiction, combining a modern sensibility with
Shakespearean language and period flourishes, full of the double
meanings and sly jokes that characterize the work of Tom Stoppard,
its co-writer. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-BOX-SETS (Undated) _ Video boxed sets materialize at the
drop of an anniversary, or given almost any excuse, as long as the
topic coalesces and the story unfolds on two or more cassettes.
Major directors, British comedy and theater, American retro
television, a momentous era, master artists and masters of silent
film: all make notable boxes this year. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   BAT-WHISPERS-VIDEO (Undated) _ The action may be antiquated, but
its legacy is hard to match. Along with the radio show ``The
Shadow'' and Leonardo da Vinci's flying machines, Roland West's
1930 thriller ``The Bat Whispers'' was a source for the late
cartoonist Bob Kane, who in 1939 created Batman the Caped Crusader
and Robin the Boy Wonder. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   DANGEROUS-ROOM-DANCE (Undated) _ ``The Most Dangerous Room in
the House,'' by Susan Marshall, will open on Wednesday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater. This vertiginous
78-minute production, her fifth for the academy's Next Wave
Festival in a decade, revolves around a woman tormented by visions
of a child's death. By Christopher Reardon.

``Stop Kiss.''

</P>
<P>
   OPERA-SINGERS (Undated) _ Opera singers keep showing up in the
wrong places. Sometimes they are good singers: Cecilia Bartoli,
appearing as Susanna in the Metropolitan Opera's ``Marriage of
Figaro''; Renee Fleming, very nearly appearing in the Met's
``Traviata,'' and Patricia Racette, who did appear there. Sometimes
they are not good enough: Marcelo Alvarez, for example, opposite
Ms. Racette, as Alfredo. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   PORGY-AND-BESS (Undated) _ As the millennium approaches, a
pop-inflected, genre-bending, dramatically singular masterpiece of
the 20th century is finally edging into the standard operatic
repertory. Is it Poulenc's ``Dialogues of the Carmelites''?
Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District''? It could
be either, but the opus in question is Gershwin's ``Porgy and
Bess,'' which shares with those mighty works enough visceral
dramatic sweep and power, musical invention and craft, vocally and
theatrically meaty characters, and mythical resonance to match any
of Verdi's middle-period operas. Beginning on Thursday, the New
York Philharmonic offers concert performances of ``Porgy and Bess''
at Avery Fisher Hall, culminating a weeklong Gershwin centenary
celebration and offering a fresh chance to reflect on the piece's
long journey toward high-art status. By Cori Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   GANTRY-PLAZA-ARCH (New York) _ The evil spell is broken. Or so
you may be tempted to think while wandering through Gantry Plaza
State Park, a new waterfront promenade and pleasure ground in Long
Island City. The curse that reduced New York's landscape architects
to creating Disney versions of Central Park has been at least
temporarily lifted. At last, a designer and his client have waked
up and recognized that people expect cities to address a
fundamental question. What time is this place? Designed by Thomas
Balsley, the two-acre park is part of Queens West, the development
project planned for a stretch of the East River opposite the United
Nations Headquarters. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   30-YEARS-WAR-ART (Undated) _ To celebrate the treaties of the
30-years-war on their 350th anniversary, a vast exhibition has been
mounted in three sites in Munster and Osnabruck, the Westphalian
cities where the negotiators spent much of the 1640s and where they
finally signed their accords. The exhibition, sponsored by the
Council of Europe and made up of some 1,500 items, opened on Oct.
24 with ceremonies that featured the combatants' descendants in the
persons of 10 kings and queens and 11 other heads of state,
including Vaclav Havel as well as a prince and a grand duke. Far
more than a recollection of the events of 1648, it reaches back
into the 16th-century origins of the fighting; it concludes with a
chilling display of Nazi interpretations of the peace; and in
between it suggests how Europe's political, military and artistic
cultures were transformed by the ravages of a seemingly endless
war. By Theodore K. Rabb.
</P>
<P>
   FIBERGLASS-ART (Undated) _ Beginning in the late 1960s and
continuing to his death in 1996, Duane Hanson sought to create in
fiberglass and resin a catalogue of American social types _ the
tourist, the waitress, the cowboy. Shamelessly realistic and
reeking of pathos, Hanson's life-size figures, their verisimilitude
enhanced by props suggesting a narrative, were widely popular. But
they never received critical acclaim. A retrospecitive of his work,
``Duane Hanson: A Survey of His Work From the 1930s to the 90s,''
opens on Thursday at the Whitney Museum of American Art. By
Elizabeth Hayt.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-OF-CRIME-TV (Undated) _ The moment, brief but breathtaking,
takes place about two-thirds of the way through Jon Alpert's ``Life
of Crime 2.'' A 4-year-old, left alone by his heroin-dazed mother,
balances on the sill of an open window. Three stories below looms
an asphalt parking lot. The scene seems in some ways to define good
documentary filmmaking. Painfully raw, it underscores what Alpert,
a modern master of cinema verite, has spent much of his life
chronicling: the lives of three drug-addicted petty criminals. The
film, which will have its premiere on HBO on Tuesday at 10 P.M., is
considered unlikely to even be considered for an Emmy, a Peabody or
any of the dozens of other awards given each year for documentary
excellence. By Nancy Hass.
</P>
<P>
   THE-60s-TV (Hollywood) _ NBC's mini-series ``The 60s,'' is
scheduled to be broadcast on Feb. 7 and 8. The series will look at
the life style of the time and the aging baby boomers who took part
in the production. By James Sterngold.

SAFETY PANEL TO SEEK FACTS IN JETLINER NEAR-MISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The near mid-air collision Sunday night off the coast of Long
Island between a British Caledonian L-1011 and a Delta Airlines
Boeing 767 has drawn the attention of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested and gathering information on it, although it
is not a formal investigation,'' said Paul Schlamm, an NTSB
spokesman. ``We want to look at what occurred and what problems it
may reveal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported Tuesday that the two planes, with a total of
372 people on board, came within 1.07 miles of each other while
traveling at 500 m.p.h. At the time of the incident _ 10:02 p.m. _
the primary computer system monitoring air traffic at the Boston
Center in Nashua, N.H., had been down for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Center is responsible for all high-altitude flights
over New England and much of New York state. Because the computer
was down, controllers had to exchange hand-written notes containing
information about the flights they were monitoring on radar
screens.
</P>
<P>
   When the back-up system, known as DARC, is working, controllers
can monitor traffic electronically, but they have fewer safety
features at their disposal than in the primary system. For example,
the primary system has a conflict alert function in which the
information about two planes that may travel too close to each
other begins to flash on the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   DARC does not have that function, and, because the primary sysem
failure was so extensive, DARC was not able to display essential
flight information _ such as the plane's airline, flight number,
altitude and airspeed.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers can normally rebuild the system by relying on
computer-generated printouts and then type that information into
the back-up system. The computer, however, was not generating the
printouts, forcing controllers to write notes by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the controllers working the sector east of John F.
Kennedy International Airport had a keyboard that was frozen,
preventing them entering in information even from handwritten
notes. It was in that sector that the loss of a safe distance
between the two planes occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, which is investigating the incident, has insisted the
nation's air system is safe. A spokeswoman said Tuesday that until
the investigation is complete the agency could not say if the error
was the result of computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The on-board computers on the two planes alerted the flight
crews to an impending collision and ordered the crews to take
evasive action. Both planes were flying at 33,000 feet where normal
separation is 2,000 feet vertically and five miles horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta plane was told to climb, and went to 33,600 feet. And
the L-1011, with 271 people on board, dove to 32,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A controller told the Globe the British Caledonian pilot
apparently was so shaken by the incident he radioed the Delta pilot
to go to a radio frequency the controllers could not monitor,
ostensibly so the pilots could discuss the incident in private.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said the preliminary examination of the incident could
be expanded if warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will gather information from the FAA and the airlines and
do an assessment of that information and then we will decide where
to go from there,'' said Schlamm.

EASE THE HOLIDAY RUSH WITH HOMEMADE GIFTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is the gift-giving search getting to you this
holiday season? You keep hunting for the perfect gift for those on
your list but can't find anything you like? You're probably not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now might be a good time to rethink the possibilities and
consider making and giving gifts from your kitchen. Avoid the malls
and head to the grocery store instead.
</P>
<P>
   Food and food-related presents are wonderful because you can
customize them to suit the tastes of the recipients. And they can
also be tailored to the culinary skills of the giver. Homemade
gifts don't have to take hours to make, as long as they look and
taste great and are stylishly wrapped with a professional look.
Remember, appealing good looks are important, because first we
feast with out eyes.
</P>
<P>
   With a little time and attention devoted to content and
presentation, you can create a unique food gift or gift basket that
is a pleasure to give and receive. Remember that often these types
of gifts are the most appreciated and cherished because they are
sprinkled with touches of love _ from your kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Today's recipes include several that beginners as well as
accomplished cooks can pull off without a hassle. Many take only
minutes to prepare and can be made when time is at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Peruse the options, select the ones that best suit your holiday
schedule and the time you'll have available for shopping,
preparation and wrapping. Then get organized and make lists of
ingredients and gift-wrapping items such as jars, tins, baskets,
napkins, ribbons, plastic wrap and cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   For freshness and the best-tasting goodies, plan to make the
gifts, especially baked items like breads, candies and cookies, as
close to the time of giving as possible _ and avoid freezing at all
costs. Some recipes _ like vinegars and liqueurs _ require several
days of standing time and can be made well in advance of giving.
Others, like preserves, refrigerator pickles, panforte and fudge
sauce, can be made a few days ahead and stored in the fridge. If
you plan to give perishable items, be sure you can deliver them to
the recipient in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   If cooking isn't your bag, it's possible to assemble a fabulous
food gift package or basket with specialty items from supermarkets,
delicatessens, bakeries, specialty coffee shops and international
food shops like Trader Joe's and Cost Plus. You can mix and match
themes and colors, or select a single theme for your basket.
Possibilities include a coffee basket with coffee beans and a
coffee grinder _ and perhaps some muffins or scones tossed in _ or
a cookie basket with assorted cookie cutters, homemade or bakery
cookies, a cookie sheet and a potholder.
</P>
<P>
   A chocolate basket is bound to thrill the chocophile on your
list, and the sky's the limit _ just pack it with anything
chocolate. A soup basket could include bean mixtures, store-bought
gourmet soup mixes and a soup tureen or kettle and ladle.
</P>
<P>
   For salad lovers, how about assorted prewashed lettuces,
tomatoes, an assortment of unique salad dressings and jars of
marinated artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers. A salsa basket
could be fun, too, with assorted trendy salsas like mango and
pineapple, and tortilla chips.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas might be a bread basket, slow-cooker basket, pasta
basket, wine basket and more. Or you could theme the basket to be
Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Thai, Creole, hot chiles, etc.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed eclectic basket of a variety of items like olive oil,
biscotti, tapenade and salsa is effective as a hostess gift when
you don't know the particular tastes of the recipient. You can
spend as much or as little as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun _ whether food items are homemade or
store-bought, or a combination of the two _ is gathering the
wrappings for festive presentations. Import and housewares stores,
drug stores, discount shops and party shops are good sources for
assorted items. For gift containers, consider inexpensive baskets,
mugs, boxes, trays, bowls, jars, crocks, covered tins, paper gift
bags, bread boards, baking dishes, skillets, pans, assorted glass
or plastic containers, plates, cookies jars and the like. Wrappings
and decorations can include ribbons, bows, cinnamon sticks, pine
cones, bells, silk flowers, ornaments, kitchen tools and more. You
might also tuck in a new or favorite cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   To line baskets or containers, use napkins, cut fabric pieces or
dish towels _ with or without holiday patterns.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to wrapping, be sure to prewrap all foods well
first (place on a plastic or paper plate if necessary) in food-safe
plastic wrap before placing in a basket or other container and
overwrapping with clear or colored cellophane (not all of it is
food-safe) and tying with colorful bows and ribbons. If you're
placing several items in one basket or container, cushion them with
excelsior, colorful tissue paper or glitzy-looking metallic
stuffing strips.
</P>
<P>
   Also be sure to label all foods, including storage directions as
well as the shelf life of the food _ and if necessary serving
instructions or ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Capture the spirit of the season by making and sharing some of
these recipes with friends, relatives, teachers or hostesses. Happy
holidays! &QL;

   1/4 cup whole allspice
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. Tie 1-tablespoon
batches of mix in a small cheesecloth or muslin bags and tie bags
with a string. Cider mix can be made ahead and kept indefinitely in
a tea tin. One bag of mix makes enough to flavor a quart of cider.
</P>
<P>
   To make mulled cider, put bag in a saucepan with 1 quart cider
and bring cider to a boil over moderately high heat. Simmer slowly,
covered 20 minutes. Add 1/4 cup dark rum, if desired, and simmer 5
minutes. Discard bag.

CHOCOLATE PANFORTE
</P>
<P>
   This dense, chewy Italian fruitcake is a traditional Christmas
favorite in Siena, Italy, where it has been enjoyed for ages.
Traditionally, panforte, which means ``strong bread'' in Italian,
contains citron. This version does not. A nonchocolate panforte
sampled at a casual San Francisco restaurant, Sputino, was the
inspiration for this version, though the restaurant uses dried
sweet cherries rather than the apricots called for here. Chocolate
has been added to this rendition as well.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup hazelnuts
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whole blanched almonds
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped dried apricots
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Place in preheated 325-degree oven and bake until almonds are
lightly toasted, about 5 minutes; transfer almonds to a plate to
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Continue baking hazelnuts until nuts are lightly browned and
dark skins are cracked. Rub warm hazelnuts in a terry cloth towel
to remove as much of skins as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine hazelnuts, almonds, apricots, orange
peel and flour; mix well. Stir in cocoa, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1 1/2-quart saucepan, combine granulated sugar, honey and
butter. Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring often. Boil,
stirring constantly 5 minutes, or until mixture reaches 248 degrees
F on a candy thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   Working quickly, pour boiling syrup over nut-fruit mixture,
mixing until thoroughly incorporated and evenly coated. Turn into
prepared springform pan. Smooth top with a spatula
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven 35 minutes. Do not overbake.
Panforte will harden as it cools.
</P>
<P>
   Remove cake from oven and let cool completely in pan. Run a
sharp knife around edges of pan to loosen cake. Remove springform
side of pan. Peel off parchment paper and wrap cake well in plastic
wrap; then wrap in foil.

<P>
   GHAZIABAD, India _ The children scattered like pigeons when
their teacher, Shankuntla Sharma, came after them with an old
splintered piece of wood, swinging it at the chatterboxes. There
are 60 boys and girls in her class, and keeping order can be a
trial. ``When I get fed up, I use the stick,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Too many children and too few supplies: Mrs. Sharma's classroom
faces common problems in a nation where the average class size is
63, where a third of the children of elementary-school age are
simply not in school, where almost half the people cannot read or
write.
</P>
<P>
   But the most debated educational issue these days in Uttar
Pradesh, India's most populous state, has nothing to do with low
levels of spending on primary schools, which means that no desks,
chairs or books are provided to the children in Mrs. Sharma's
class. It has everything to do with two words they proclaim in
unison every morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vande Mataram!'' they shout with arms raised to salute India.
</P>
<P>
   The words mean ``Hail the Motherland,'' and they are the title
of the country's national song _ and the only part of it that these
children actually recite. Bankimchandra Chatterji wrote it in the
19th century as a tribute to a popular Bengali rebellion against
the British and a local Muslim feudal lord.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this century, ``Vande Mataram'' became a freedom
song for many Hindus and Muslims struggling to gain independence
from Britain. But members of the Muslim League, the organization
that pressed for the creation of Pakistan as a homeland for
Muslims, condemned it as a kind of idol worship of India, said
Bipan Chandra, professor emeritus of history at Nehru University in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the song has again become a source of friction,
this time in Uttar Pradesh. The Hindu nationalist government here,
led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is also in power
nationally, set off the conflict when its leaders proclaimed that
recitation of the song should be compulsory in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim leaders, including Ali Mian, a prominent Islamic scholar
and chairman of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a private
advocacy group, responded with condemnations of the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is against Islamic law to bow your head to anyone except
Allah,'' Mian said. ``India is a secular democracy. It is the
responsibility of the government to insure that minorities have the
freedom of their faith and feel secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindu nationalist student leaders responded by burning effigies
of Mian and other Muslims, while Hindu nationalists in the state
government suggested that those who opposed the ``Vande Mataram''
requirement were disloyal to India.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Muslims have any problems with `Vande Mataram' they are
welcome to go to the madrasas,'' Ravindra Shukla, Basic Education
Minister in Uttar Pradesh, said in an interview two weeks ago.
Madrasas are private religious schools for Muslims. ``To recite
`Vande Mataram' is a tribute to our freedom struggle and freedom
fighters. Those who are opposing it will be given a fitting reply
by the masses when election time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shukla's widely publicized remarks and his stand on the
national song set off a conflict that cost him his job last week.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over the song first surfaced just weeks after the
government in New Delhi, which is led by Hindu nationalists,
circulated documents to state education ministers proposing that
students be required to study sacred Hindu scriptures in public
schools. That idea was abandoned after protests from Hindus and
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Again, in the ``Vande Mataram'' debate, the national government
distanced itself from a divisive proposal _ and put pressure on the
state to withdraw it. Finally, on Friday, the government of the
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Kalyan Singh, issued a clipped
statement rescinding the order and removing Shukla.
</P>
<P>
   This war of words over cultural symbols seems strangely hollow
at the Kanya Pathshala school in Ghaziabad, where 60 students in
the third, fourth and fifth grades sit in rows on a hard, stone
floor, reading from textbooks their hard-pressed parents had to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sharma, who has taught for 28 years and doubles now as
principal, said she was told to begin requiring her students to say
``Vande Mataram'' about a year ago at a meeting of teachers and
administrators, long before the issue became public.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning since then she has gathered the primary school's
129 children _ 15 to 20 of them Muslim _ in a small courtyard to
say their morning prayer and to chant ``Vande Mataram!'' three
times. None of the raggedly clothed boys and girls recite the
stanzas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you a lie,'' Mrs. Sharma confessed. ``Even I
don't remember all the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabya Basri, a Muslim woman, has four children in public school,
including one in Mrs. Sharma's class. She said she does not care
whether they sing ``Vande Mataram.'' She just wants them to be able
to read and write _ something she and her ailing husband never
learned to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please understand,'' said Mrs. Basri, enshrouded in a
floor-length black burka, or loose garment, ``whether you say God
or Allah, it is one and the same. We have mosques. They have
temples. It is the language that is different, but the message is
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cut the fingers of these children, all their blood will
be red,'' she said.

TABRIZ CELEBRATES A JOYFUL HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TABRIZ, Iran _ Among all of Iran's cities, this is the one with
a night owl's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Some shops along Imam Khomeini Avenue keep lights burning until
midnight, and the ones tucked away in the labyrinthine 15th-century
bazaar do not even open their doors until 10:30 a.m. In summer
months, the century-old El Goli amusement park keeps its Ferris
wheel turning until the wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   For two days this month, the glittering lights and buoyant song
of a joyful religious holiday dominated the city as nowhere else in
Iran, transforming what is a shabby commercial center by day into a
festival of color by night.
</P>
<P>
   This is still the Islamic Republic, of course, so public
pastimes must be wholesome. Only behind closed doors do local
residents drink and gamble as they did so visibly before the
Islamic revolution of 1979, when the main street and amusement park
were still named for Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the chill of early December, residents of Tabriz
like to stay out late, and if the reason can be rooted in religion,
so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, late?'' Firouz Alizadeh replied as he pulled
up on a motor scooter, with his two young sons aboard, and headed
toward a mosque for a midnight dinner celebrating the 1,129th
birthday of a prophet whom Shiite Muslims believe will return
someday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Tabriz, the Shiite branch of Islam, since the revolution
the dominant force in Iranian life, remains a generally gloomy
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Its calendar is filled with mourning days and mourning months
commemorated with mournful dirges and decorated in black. Many are
dedicated to the memory of the first 11 Shiite prophets, many of
whom were slain centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12th prophet, Mahdi, is thought to have been an
exception. A many-times great-grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, he
was born in 869 and disappeared as a young child. It is an article
of faith among Shiites that he will one day reappear, as one text
puts it, ``to fill the earth with justice and fairness as it was
filled with oppression and tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   Even under the shah, who was so reviled by the Islamic
revolutionaries, Mahdi's birthday was a national holiday,
celebrated with a joyful zeal. But perhaps only now, and in Tabriz,
has it reached full flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you, Mahdi?'' read a banner hung in Clock Square.
``You are our only precious gem!''
</P>
<P>
   In one mosque, men packed into a narrow room to sing songs of
passionate praise, with the celebration broadcast by closed-circuit
television to those who lined the sidewalks outside. As a sign of
good will, many residents pressed candy and coins into the palms of
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   And even people who said they felt no deep religious faith had
braved a maddening snarl of traffic to take in the late-night
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way Tabrizis celebrate,'' said Mohammed Reza
Azizi, 27, as cars whose passengers included a remarkable number of
wedding parties zoomed past on downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   Shiites take their mourning days seriously, so much so that
weddings are regarded as inauspicious for three months a year. One
of those months, Ramadan, falls just two weeks after Mahdi's
birthday on the Islamic calendar, so Iranian couples often seize on
the holiday as a last best time to wed.
</P>
<P>
   Much socializing in Tabriz involves family visits, and no one
whom a visitor met here could explain why so much goes on so late
in Tabriz, while in Tehran, the capital, most stores shut by 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that the reason was impenetrable, in the same way
that devout Shiites unquestioningly accept the idea that the
prophet Mahdi was born so many centuries ago, but has not yet died.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Friday prayer leader used a metaphor that Tabrizis
said they could understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``An insect can stare at the sun for a very long time, but we
human beings cannot do that,'' the cleric, Ayatollah Mossein
Mujtahid Shabestaki, said at one ceremony. ``Still, we should try
to be like the insect, and then we can see the 12th imam.''

PAUL BROOKS, WAS EDITOR IN CHIEF, VP AT HOUGHTON MIFFLIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Brooks, a retired editor in chief and vice president of
Houghton Mifflin Co., died Sunday in Carleton-Willard Village in
Bedford, Mass. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   During his nearly 40 years with Houghton Mifflin, 25 of them as
editor in chief of the general book department, Mr. Brooks dealt
with many prominent authors, including Sir Winston Churchill, James
Agee, Archibald MacLeish, Louis Auchincloss, John Kenneth
Galbraith, Roger Tory Peterson, and Rachel Carson.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, ``Two Park Street,'' published by Houghton
Mifflin in 1986, he provided a droll insider's account of
publishing's evolution from one of personal relationships to a
relatively impersonal business.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Two Park Street,'' his career began at a
convivial Harvard Lampoon dinner in 1931 where a jolly executive
offered him a job. This was a singular event during the height of
the Depression, and, accordingly, Mr. Brooks reported to Park
Street. There he was assigned an office shared by a dignified
gentleman who spent the morning dictating letter after letter about
the marbled godwit, a handsome shorebird. Lunch followed (a bowl of
crackers and milk, with blueberries, at the Union Club). Upon
returning from lunch, Mr. Brooks was introduced to the company
treasurer, who snorted, ``Huh! Another one of those young
puppies!'' Then editorial director Ferris Greenslet presented the
neophyte with a copy of Sir Stanley Unwin's ``The Truth About
Publishing.'' Greenslet never buzzed for subordinates; instead, he
summoned them with a few bars on his flute.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mr. Brooks's early successes was ``Forty-Two Years in the
White House,'' by Irwin Hood (Ike) Hoover, chief usher of the
president, who had come to the White House as a young employee of
the Edison Co. because President Harrison's family feared turning
on the electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Brooks saw Ross Lockridge (``Raintree County'') and Thomas
Heggen (``Mister Roberts'') destroyed by fame, and helped coax
along Churchill's six-volume ``The Second World War'' in time to
meet production schedules.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that he derived his greatest satisfaction from the
nature writers he met at Two Park Street, particularly Peterson and
Carson, because they brought about a change in our way of looking
at the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Brooks had long been interested in saving remaining
wilderness. In Lincoln, Mass., where he had lived for more than
half a century, he was active on the planning board and the
conservation commission.
</P>
<P>
   He also had served on the boards of such environmental
organizations as the Sierra Club, the Public Lands Institute, and
the Trustees of Reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his writing was aimed at conservation. He felt strongly
that ``the principal destroyers of our environment _ be they
irresponsible giant corporations or government agencies like the
Army Engineers _ are responsive only to informed public opinion''
and that ``anything one can do to reach readers beyond the already
converted is bound to be of some help.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote numerous magazine articles and several books, including
``Roadless Area,'' ``The Pursuit of Wilderness,'' ``The House of
Life: Rachel Carson at Work,'' ``The View from Lincoln Hill,'' and
``Speaking for Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in New York City and graduated from Harvard College
in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the close of World War II, he went abroad for the Office
of War Information as chief of the book section for the European
Theater of Operations.
</P>
<P>
   He was a director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, a
trustee of the Harvard Lampoon and a member of the Usage Panel of
the American Heritage Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves three daughters, Elizabeth B. Harris of Dublin, N.H.,
Susan B. Morris of Waldoboro, Maine, and Kate Brooks of Canaan,
N.H.; a son, Samuel J. of Peterborough, Ontario; seven
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

REPORT SAYS HDTV SETS WON'T FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To consumer electronics companies, the new high-definition
television sets just coming to market are home entertainment's next
big thing. But according to a market research firm, HDTV will
actually be the industry's next big flop.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Tuesday, Forrester Research Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass. predicts that television makers will sell only a
million HDTV sets between now and the year 2003, and that TV makers
should concentrate on less sophisticated digital sets that are much
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   After years of planning, TV stations in US cities have begun
limited broadcasts of digital TV, which offers a much sharper
picture than traditional analog TV sets. By the year 2006, all TV
stations in the United States plan to stop analog broadcasting
entirely, and electronics companies are counting on a
multibillion-dollar bonanza as consumers switch to digital TV
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The top-drawer digital TV sets will use HDTV, an advanced system
that produces the sharpest pictures of all.
</P>
<P>
   Today's first-generation HDTV sets cost between $5,000 and
$10,000 each. Prices for consumer electronics products tend to drop
sharply over time. But the Forrester report, prepared by analyst
Josh Bernoff, claims that HDTV set prices will buck this trend,
remaining higher than $2,000 per set for at least the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In a television picture tube, a stream of electrons draws
horizontal lines across the screen dozens of times every second.
The more lines in the picture, the higher its definition and the
better it looks. Today's TV sets display an image made of 480
lines. A high-definition TV will show well over a thousand lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff agrees the computerized electronics controlling these
HDTV sets will rapidly fall in price, to below $100 by the year
2001. But he adds that there's no cheap way to make
higher-definition picture tubes. ``It's just fundamentally hard
from the perspective of physics to refresh a large screen with that
many lines of resolution 60 times a second,'' he said. So HDTV sets
will stay expensive for years to come, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff recommends that the television industry support an
alternative digital technology called standard definition TV or
SDTV. He said that SDTV sets use a technology similar to that found
in computer monitors to produce a picture that's almost as sharp as
HDTV. But an SDTV set would use about the same number of lines as
today's TV sets, and so would be much cheaper to make. Bernoff
predicts SDTV sets will sell for less than $1,000 by 2002, and will
capture 80 percent of the digital TV market by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The Forrester report brought a quick retort from the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association, the Arlington, Va. trade
group representing TV makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making assumptions about what consumers will do, not
having talked to any consumers,'' said spokeswoman Ann Saybolt. She
predicted that 30 percent of US households will have HDTV sets by
the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Saybolt admitted that today's HDTV sets are quite expensive, but
said they would soon become much cheaper. Besides, she said, people
will buy them even if they're much more expensive that traditional
TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said that they want the best technology,'' said
Saybolt, ``and they're willing to pay for it,'' she said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Marion, general manager of the Alltel Arena in Little
Rock, Ark., was at a concert by former Led Zeppelin members Jimmy
Page and Robert Plant recently when he noticed something strange.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past Led Zeppelin shows, when audience members would hold
their cigarette lighters aloft during the slow, emotional parts of
rock epics like ``Stairway to Heaven,'' this concert had no small
flames illuminating the arena. Instead, he said, during the encore,
``Everybody was holding up their hands, and here and there I could
see guys holding up their cell phones, playing the music for
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, at concerts you don't have cigarette lighters like
you used to,'' he said. ``It's dark, except for the cell phones.''
</P>
<P>
   A concert tradition has been changing. The cigarette lighter,
long the concert prop of choice, is giving way to the cellular
phone. Once held aloft as the universal symbol of thousands of
hearts joined in the magical unity that a pop concert can create,
the lighter is going the way of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at most arenas and concert halls today, smoking is
forbidden; at some clubs, cigarettes and lighters are confiscated
at the door.
</P>
<P>
   With the cell phone becoming as ubiquitous as the lighter was,
its new status at pop concerts may be inevitable. After all, it's
one of the few pocket-or-purse items that lights up. And where
lighters at concerts are like tie-dyed shirts, protest songs, cheap
tickets and other relics of the '60s, cell phones are symbols for
the '90s, where networking is king.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the lighters, the concert cell phones are almost entirely
utilitarian: the fact that they light up the arena is secondary.
``I've called friends from concerts,'' said Laurie Ziegler, a music
producer. ``They wanted to go to a concert but couldn't, so if they
have a favorite song, why not let them hear it? If someone went to
Bob Dylan and he played `Forever Young,' I'd kill them if they
didn't call me.''
</P>
<P>
   A rock-group manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity
(more out of embarrassment than need for confidentiality),
confessed to calling friends during a performance of ``Sweet
Emotion'' at an Aerosmith show and ``Iron Man'' at a Black Sabbath
concert, leaving a song snippet on their answering machines in each
case.
</P>
<P>
   This new form of lighting up is a growing sight, especially at
concerts that attract audiences in their 20s and 30s. Antennae seem
to sprout from people's heads and hands, and there are patterns
made by glowing keypads and flashing green lights, evidence of
concertgoers' calling friends during the good songs or even
checking their answering machine for messages during the boring
parts.
</P>
<P>
   At performances this year ranging from those by the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones to the Pakistani Sufi singer Badar Ali Khan,
concertgoers called other audience members to say hello and find
out where their friends were seated. And at a recent Wu-Tang Clan
concert, a rapper even took a phone call from the stage (a gesture
as inappropriate as a singer flicking a Bic during his or her own
ballad).
</P>
<P>
   The use of cell phones has spread to classical concerts as well,
but it seems likely to remain, like the lighter, mainly a pop
manifestation. When cell phones began ringing at New York's
Carnegie Hall at the season's opening night concert this year by
the San Francisco Symphony, the building's executive director,
Judith Arron, swung into action. She inserted ``An Urgent Note to
Our Patrons'' in the hall's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a phenomenon that we have noticed with dismay that
has been making its presence ringingly known in the Hall in the
last month: the cell phone epidemic,'' the note states. Ms. Arron
advised patrons to turn off the phones or leave them at home. For
the most part people have been respecting her wishes, but the
occasional call can still be heard.
</P>
<P>
   At other classical music halls, phone jockeys have been escorted
to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are less likely to be disturbing at pop concerts,
typically louder and more social. Although tape recorders and
cameras are confiscated at the door at most pop shows, cell phones
are not yet considered an infringement on the audience's enjoyment
or on performers' rights to their music.
</P>
<P>
   Though concertgoers like Ms. Ziegler may create outgoing
messages on their answering machines from a few seconds of music
taped at a concert (a cheaper alternative to the concert T-shirt as
proof of attendance), arena managers doubt that cell phones will be
banned, even if someone succeeds in recording an entire concert on
an answering machine tape. Marion of the Alltel Arena said that
unless people started making money by capturing music on cell
phones, the accessories were there to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians have been noticing the phenomenon. ``I was doing a
show from Vancouver where we were rocking,'' said Justin
Meldal-Johnsen, who plays bass for Beck, the eclectic performer who
mixes folk and hip-hop. ``And I saw this guy and his girlfriend
with a cell phone, and they were passing the phone back and forth
to each other, sharing the concert with a friend for what must have
been 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound system must have been blowing their ears out,'' he
said. ``I was so surprised they were able to talk on the phone.
Everyone around them was just smiling, enjoying this perverse
moment where they're in the concert world but in the outside world
at the at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of fans' holding up lighters is generally traced
back 29 years to Woodstock, which inspired the singer Melanie to
write the song ``Lay Down (Candles in the Wind).'' Her fans took to
lighting candles during the song, then turned to matches when
concert halls began cracking down because candles were forbidden
under some fire codes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon lighting matches between the main set and the encore became
a ritual, as if fans were trying to keep the music's emotional
effect from ebbing. The practice spread especially with the advent
of disposable lighters, popularizing a way for concertgoers to
express the feelings stirred by a sentimental song.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the '90s, however, sentiment goes only so far. Or
perhaps fans see their emotions as too complex to be encapsulated
by a lighter's flame. The cell phone, on the other hand, is a
useful tool at an event where fans now do business, build social
relationships and even get some advice from mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   Meldal-Johnsen of Beck's band noticed cell phones in use when
tragedy struck at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in Washington this
summer. Several audience members were hit by lightning, and
Meldal-Johnsen recalled ``seeing all these kids crying and talking
on their cell phones with their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked so surreal, so apocalyptic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial for Ericsson cellular phones tries to make another
kind of utilitarian claim for the cell phone when events go awry.
During a blackout in the middle of a football game, the cell phone
comes to the rescue with fans turning on thousands of them, sending
out little halos of light to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Melanie's ``Lay Down (Candles in the Wind)'' was the
anthem for matches and cigarette lighters, what will the cell phone
anthem be? The Electric Light Orchestra's ``Calling America,'' New
Edition's ``Mr. Telephone Man'' or Stevie Wonder's ``I Just Called
to Say I Love You''?
</P>
<P>
   Or will it be Blondie's ``Call Me,'' with its phone
permissiveness (``you can call me any day or night''), or Aretha
Franklin's ``Call Me,'' which pleads, ``Will you call me the moment
you get there?''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe someone will write a new anthem, ``Signal Faded (Cell
Phones in the Air),'' which could give rise to more elaborate
concert traditions, like performers' exhorting audience members to
call their loved ones during a ballad, effectively doubling their
listening audience and perhaps helping to land that cellular phone
company as a sponsor. &QL;

 &HT;    Moderate Georgians among Republicans White House seeks to win
over
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgians Saxby Chambliss and Charlie Norwood are
among the 20 to 30 Republicans the White House has targeted in a
lobbying effort to fight off impeachment by the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is working off a list provided by House
Democrats that identifies moderates as well as more conservative
Republicans such as Chambliss and Norwood who may be amenable to
voting against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold an 11-seat majority in the 105th Congress,
which goes out of business Jan. 3. If impeachment supporters do not
hold almost all Republicans in a vote on the House floor, prospects
for passage are dim because the Democrats appear to have all but a
few members of their caucus united in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Every Republican targeted by Democrats comes from a district
that supported Clinton in the 1996 presidential election. Those
election results give Democrats hope that these GOP colleagues will
think twice before voting for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These districts are where the vote (for impeachment) would be
the riskiest,'' said Merle Black, an Emory University political
science professor. ``On the other hand, the type of voter who would
support a Republican congressman in those districts would more
likely be in favor of a tougher line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Chambliss and Norwood, Democrats believe
significant African-American constituencies may influence their
vote, according to a copy of the list obtained by the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Black Georgians make up more than 28 percent of Chambliss's
district, which runs from south from Macon, and more than 34
percent of Norwood's Augusta-based eastern Georgia district.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans have been among Clinton's most loyal
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, in addition, worked closely with the White House last
year on a proposed reform of managed care health plans that put him
at odds with most Republicans. Norwood has said he intends to
re-introduce his legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss and Norwood have not said how they will vote if the
House Judiciary Committee, as expected, approves articles of
impeachment against Clinton and sends them to the full House before
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss ``really would like to wait and see what the committee
reports,'' said Lindsay Taylor, his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood also is awaiting the committee's action, John Stone,
Norwood's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Black said he would be surprised if the Georgians decide against
impeachment ``because that would be a vote they would really have
to explain back home.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republicans on the Democrats' list already have
said they will vote against impeachment, including Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, Peter King of New York and Jack Quinn of New
York. Two other Republicans, John Edward Porter of Illinois and
Mark Edward Souder of Indiana, also are on record as opposing
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the House members on the Democrats' list are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Bilbray of California and Richard Baker of Louisiana,
who narrowly won re-election in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jack Metcalf of Washington, who has a large and traditionally
Democratic union constituency in his district north of Seattle, and
Anne Northup of Kentucky, another GOP member with a large union
presence in her Louisville district.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three other Republicans from the New York suburbs, Michael
Forbes, Ben Gilman and Rick Lazio.

COATES ASSAULT TRIAL OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRENTHAM, Mass. _ Far from being a domestic abuser, Patriots
tight end Ben Terrence Coates is actually the victim of a jealous
lover who was trying to extort money, Coates's attorney told a
District Court jury here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coates went on trial Tuesday on one count of assault and
battery. The 6 foot, 5 inch, 250 pounds athlete is charged with
shoving 5 foot 8 inch Jennifer Marshall of Norton to the ground
and, when she got up and flew at him again, of picking her up and
throwing her onto the hood of her car last July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Norfolk District Attorney Glenn Cunha warned the jury
in his opening statement that the defense would try to show that
Marshall was trying to set Coates up to gain an advantage in their
legal fight over child support and other money matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after you hear the tapes (of messages Marshall left on
Coates's machine), you will have to ask yourself, `Is this a person
who will set someone up?' '' Cunha asked, and went on, ``At the end
of the trial I will ask you, did an assault and battery happen? Did
the defendant go over the line? Keep in mind the defendant makes a
living off his size and strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coates's attorney Mark Berthiaume told the five men and two
women of the jury that ``This is a woman who is motivated by greed
and anger. On that July 26 she was going to stop at nothing until
she had had a confrontation with this defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   As outlined in both opening and in subsequent testimony by
Marshall, she began dating Coates in 1993 and by March 1994 she
became pregnant with their daughter, whom they named Destiny. She
became pregnant after she learned Coates was married and had two
children in North Carolina, she admitted on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   While pregnant, she went onto the Montel Williams show, on a
program called ``Mistresses of Married Men.'' Marshall said Coates
had dared her to. On that program she admitted that she had said,
``I'm having his baby. He's going to pay for this kid.'' She also
said that if he were to jilt her, there were other Patriots players
who had made frequent passes at her.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, after she was refused admittance to the Patriots'
training camp's family area, she sued him in probate court and was
awarded $4,500 a month, or $54,000 a year, in child support. By
last July they were back in court when she sought an increase in
support payments and tried to ask him to buy her a $46,000 Mercedes
Benz car and a house.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall insisted during testimony that ``I wanted him to buy a
house for his daughter.'' Berthiaume shot back, ``Did you want the
Mercedes for your daughter, too?''
</P>
<P>
   It was when she went to his Franklin apartment on the afternoon
of July 26 to show him two architects' drawings of houses she was
considering having built, the more expensive one priced at
$600,000, that she found a strange car in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Coates would not let her in and, accompanied by a friend,
Carrinne Parkinson and by her daugher Destiny, she drove to a
telephone and left an obscenity-laden tirade of threats on Coates's
answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   She made three more such calls that afternoon and camped outside
the house. In the third of these calls, she can be heard on the
tape saying, ``I hope they will trade you over this (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   She also admitted on the stand she said she would have him
arrested. In one tape she is furious because he is seeing another
woman less than one day after they had sex.
</P>
<P>
   She had Parkinson buy a disposable camera and photographed the
strange car and the lighted bedroom window.
</P>
<P>
   When a young woman at last emerged and got into the car, she
took her photograph, too, she testified, and confronted her and
accused her of being a stripper, told her she and Coates were
lovers and that, moreover, he was married anyway. But she denied
screaming at her.
</P>
<P>
   When Coates came to the door, she reluctantly admitted under
cross examination, she shoved him repeatedly and called him
epithets, until he shoved her and she fell back, catching herself
with her forearms.
</P>
<P>
   When she rose and flew at him, she said, he picked her up and
slammed her onto the hood of her car, causing her to hurt the back
of her head.

PROFESSOR'S ARGUMENT COMPLICATES IMPEACHMENT OUTLOOK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Yale University law professor who is a student of
impeachment procedures suggested Tuesday that even if the House of
Representatives voted this year to impeach Bill Clinton, the House
that takes office in January would have to cast at least one more
vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion by the professor, Bruce Ackerman, in an Op-Ed
article in The New York Times and in testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee, added a complication to the impeachment
maneuvering. Republicans were unimpressed, but Democrats said the
Ackerman argument bolstered their case that the lame-duck House
should not vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum to the Judiciary Committee, Elizabeth Bazan of
the American Law Division of the Library of Congress wrote that the
precedents indicated that a new vote would not be necessary on
impeachment itself but that the House would probably have to vote
in January to select members to prosecute the case in the Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, director of government studies at the Brookings
Institution and an expert on Congress, said that even a vote on
appointing managers, as the prosecutors are called, could provide
an opportunity for the new House to review the case and decide not
to try to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes for impeachment this month, there will not be
time for a trial in the Senate to begin until the 106th Congress
convenes in January. A majority vote of the House is required to
impeach the president, while a two-thirds majority of the Senate is
necessary to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman made the case that a bill of impeachment was no
different from a piece of legislation passed by the House that
would die at the end of the 105th Congress if the Senate had not
acted.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress study took issue with that analysis. Ms.
Bazan found examples of impeachment cases involving federal judges
that had been carried over from one Congress until the next. But
she also found that in each instance, most recently in the case
involving Judge Alcee Hastings in 1988 and 1989, the House voted
anew to appoint managers to prosecute the case in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   What that means in the current situation is that representatives
dissatisfied with a House vote this year to impeach the president
could fight the appointment of managers when the 106th Congress
convenes. Without prosecutors, the trial in the Senate could not
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   With the narrower Republican majority in the 106th Congress,
said a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Thomas Barrett of
Wisconsin, ``we do have the real possibility that we could have
this Congress impeach this president, and three weeks later the
case completely fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said this was not beyond the realm of possibility if the
House voted to impeach Clinton and the public reacted angrily.

FRIED SAYS HE'LL STEP DOWN NEXT JULY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT AND PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Supreme Judicial Court justice Charles Fried confirmed
Tuesday he will leave the state's highest court next July to resume
teaching at Harvard Law School. Governor Paul Cellucci said he
wants a ``tough law-and-order'' replacement, but not necessarily a
death-penalty supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Fried's seat will be the first of four expected vacancies
Cellucci will have the chance to fill in the next two years,
including the chief justice. Observers say Cellucci will apparently
become the first governor in state history to select a majority for
the seven-member bench.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he would like to fill Fried's seat with ``a strict
constructionist, someone who's going to enforce the law'' rather
than personal views. ``Obviously, I'm looking for people who have a
tough law-and-order approach to crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor, who supports the reinstatement of the death
penalty, repeated a past vow not to impose ``any real litmus test''
on applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could be personally opposed to the death penalty,''
but still uphold a constitutional amendment reinstating it,
Cellucci said. Several legal sources said no clear frontrunners
have emerged for Fried's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Two Cellucci advisers predicted the governor would likely wait
until after his Jan. 7 inauguration to begin a serious search for a
candidate because he wants to choose new cabinet secretaries first.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it is likely that the number of
vacancies within the next two years could allow a number of
apparent long-shot candidates to emerge as favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may see a lot of interesting folks come to light that the
governor and others might not think of off the tops of their
heads,'' said one downtown lawyer active in GOP politics who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Herbert P. Wilkins is expected to resign next
summer shortly before he reaches the mandatory retirement age of
70, and Justices Neil L. Lynch and Ruth I. Abrams both will retire
in 2000. Remaining will be Justices John M. Greaney, Margaret H.
Marshall and Roderick I. Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Healy, general counsel for the Massachusetts Bar
Association, said that while Cellucci may have ``an unprecedented
opportunity'' to make his mark on the court, ``it also is an
overwhelming task to find four intellectual giants to serve on the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci would not say if he intends to look within the state
court system or go outside of it, as former governor William F.
Weld did when he selected Fried and Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have speculated that Cellucci may want to name a
Latino or Asian-American to enhance the diversity of the court.
``Diversity is always a consideration when you are making
appointments,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Fried, a conservative, squeaked onto the court by a 5-4
Governor's Council vote in 1995 after liberal activists mounted a
massive campaign against him. He said Tuesday will step down June
30 from the $115,000-a-year seat on the bench and begin work as a
tenured Harvard law professor the following day.
</P>
<P>
   A former US solicitor general, Fried was on the bench Tuesday as
the SJC reviewed several first-degree murder cases. He declined a
request for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Tuesday, Fried said he is leaving the SJC
with ``real regret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After much reflection, I have concluded that I can make my
best contribution as a full-time teacher and scholar,'' he said.
``I cherish the friendship and collaboration of warm, dedicated and
exceptionally able colleagues.''

SAN FRANCISCO BARTENDERS BENEFIT UNDER SMOKING BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The respiratory health of San Francisco bartenders improved
significantly just weeks after California banned smoking in bars
and taverns where they were exposed to high levels of second-hand
smoke, says a study.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the findings are among the first to show that
second-hand smoke can cause short-term respiratory problems as well
as raising the risk of long-term diseases like cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Those breathing-related problems, moreover, improved quickly
after the offending smoke was eliminated, said the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits gained by eliminating most of the second-hand smoke
to which the bartenders were exposed ``was somewhere in the range
of what you would see with someone stopping smoking,'' said Dr.
Mark D. Eisner, a pulmonary specialist at the University of
California in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He was the lead author on the report appearing in the current
issue of the Journal of the Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, where smoking in restaurants was banned effective
last Oct. 1 but remains legal in bars and taverns, the new findings
``could have significant impact in propelling this issue forward,''
commented Michael Siegel, an assistant professor in the Boston
University School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel previously published research showing that levels of
second-hand smoke in bars were four to six times higher than in
offices where smoking was allowed. His research also revealed that
second-hand smoke increased the risk of lung cancer in restaurant
and bar workers.
</P>
<P>
   The new report from San Francisco, said Siegel in an interview,
``documents that not only is this second-hand smoke dangerous for
long-term health, it is causing suffering every day they (the bar
workers) go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The research study took advantage of the sharp drop in exposure
to second-hand smoke in bars that occurred when the California ban
took effect last Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and his colleagues asked the owners of 83 bars and
taverns in San Francisco for permission to test the bar workers:
ultimately, the owners of 25 bars complied.
</P>
<P>
   During December 1997, the researchers interviewed 53 bartenders
about respiratory symptoms and performed a test of lung capacity
called spirometer. Forty-five percent of the bartenders said they
themselves smoked.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found that 39 of the bartenders, or 74 percent,
had respiratory symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing,
cough, or production of phlegm, and 77 percent said they
experienced irritation of the eyes, nose or throat.
</P>
<P>
   On repeat testing about eight weeks later, only 17, or 32
percent, of the bartenders still had respiratory symptoms. Of the
39 who had complained of symptoms, 23 subsequently said they were
free of symptoms. And most of those who had reported eye, nose or
throat irritation said they now were free of those problems.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a small but significant improvement on the lung
function tests, Eisner and his colleagues reported. Though not a
dramatic difference, it was probably enough to be noticeable to the
bar workers, though they were not asked about it, Eisner said.
Researchers say they statistically controlled for personal smoking
so that it didn't influence the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gail Wienmann, a medical officer at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute, which funded the study, said that the
before-and-after difference in the lung function test results ``is
pretty significant, considering that these were normal''
volunteers. ``If it occurred in someone with low lung function, it
could be the difference between feeling well and not feeling
well.''

BILL WOULD PROVIDE INSURANCE FOR UNMARRIED PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A California lawmaker has reintroduced a bill
that would require health insurers and health maintenance
organizations to offer businesses the option of covering unmarried
partners of employees.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was approved by the Legislature but vetoed by
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who leaves office at the end of the
year. The sponsor of the bill, Assemblywoman Carol Migden, D-San
Francisco, hopes the incoming governor, Democrat Gray Davis, will
support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If passed and signed by the governor, it could be the first bill
in the nation to mandate that health coverage for unmarried
partners be made available by insurers. A similar measure is before
the Hawaii Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not require companies to offer the coverage to
their employees, but would guarantee that it would be available if
they make that choice.
</P>
<P>
   Migden reintroduced the legislation Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks she's got a shot to make this become law,'' said
Alan LoFaso, a spokesman for Migden.
</P>
<P>
   LoFaso said some big health plans _ including Kaiser Permanente,
Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Health Net and PacifiCare _ already
offered such health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry does not oppose Migden's bill, said
Maureen O'Haren of the California Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has been neutral on this as a concept and plans
to (be) neutral on the bill this year, if not supportive of it,''
she said. O'Haren said industry representatives had worked with
Migden to ensure that the language of her bill is legally and
technically correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to make it work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   LoFaso said the bill, while applying to companies of all sizes,
would have its greatest impact on small businesses that have been
unable to provide health benefits to their unmarried partners of
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   He said large companies had always been able to provide those
benefits if they wished because ``they have negotiating leverage or
they self-insure. They can pretty much tailor-make their insurance
packages.''
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message, Wilson said the bill would ``increase the
cost of insurance because premium rates for dependent coverage are
based on stable family relationships.''

BOXED FOR THE AGES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Video boxed sets materialize at the drop of an anniversary, or
given almost any excuse, as long as the topic coalesces and the
story unfolds on two or more cassettes. Major directors, British
comedy and theater, American retro television, a momentous era,
master artists and masters of silent film: all make notable boxes
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In one of them, Anchor Bay has put together four Hitchcocks:
``Notorious'' (1946), with Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Claude
Rains; ``The Paradine Case'' (1948), with Gregory Peck and Charles
Laughton; ``Rebecca'' (1940) with Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine
and Judith Anderson, and ``Spellbound'' (1945) with Bergman and
Peck.
</P>
<P>
   For a Preston Sturges centennial, Universal has assembled a
small festival: ``Easy Living'' (1937), with Jean Arthur; ``If I
Were King'' (1938), with Ronald Coleman; ``Imitation of Life,''
with Claudette Colbert, and ``Never Say Die,'' with Bob Hope and
Martha Raye. The French director Bertrand Tavernier also has a
retrospective, including his first film, ``The Clockmaker'' (1973),
``L.267'' (1992) and the acclaimed ``A Sunday in the Country''
(1984), about a disappointed French painter and the family who
never quite met his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Sturges films nor the Tavernier titles are in a box
per se, but gather them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Already in a slipcase are three noir films by Akira Kurosawa,
who died in September. ``High and Low'' (1962) about a business man
(Toshiro Mifune) who raises ransom money to rescue the kidnapped
son of his chauffeur, is back on video after being long out of
distribution. ``The Bad Sleep Well'' (1960) also stars Mifune,
confronting corruption as he swings on the corporate ladder. The
third film of the set, ``Stray Dog'' (1949), about a detective
(Mifune again) tracking his stolen gun and a killer through
post-war Tokyo, is classic noir.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the British boxes. As usual, these are filled
with first-rate political satire and social comedy. Spoofing
Victorian society in the guise of Japanese musical drama, a tailor
rises to the post of Lord High Executioner in ``The Mikado,'' one
of three operettas by Gilbert and Sullivan produced by the
Stratford Festival and available in a three-tape set from Acorn
Media.
</P>
<P>
   On the two other cassettes, grand opera takes a beating in ``The
Pirates of Penzance,'' with rogues and bobbies over-emoting on the
Cornish coast, and a band of fairies tangles with the House of
Lords in ``Iolanthe.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the countryside, a retired English army officer
administrates the west of Ireland before independence in ``The
Irish R.M'' (for Resident Magistrate). A PBS Masterpiece Theater
production, the film comes in a six-cassette box from Acorn. Acorn
also distributes two boxed sets of ``Mapp &AMP; Lucia,'' about two
genteel adversaries in the 1920s who, through scheme and social con
game, vye for social supremacy in the English village of Tilling.
</P>
<P>
   The scale is intimate in ``Woven by the Grandmothers:
19th-Century Navajo Textiles'' and ``Legacy of Generations: Pottery
by Indian American Women,'' a pair of PBS broadcasts joined in a
two-casette box from Home Vision.
</P>
<P>
   But the view broadens considerably in ``Making Masterpieces''
from the National Gallery in London, a three-tape set, also from
Home Vision. Using the paintings of Rembrandt, Renoir, Holbein and
others, the series makes fascinating work of such subjects as how
an artist's materials influence his work and how paintings change
over time.
</P>
<P>
   One could spend at least eight cassettes on topics like that,
which is what CNN needs for ``The Cold War,'' a superb recent
reconstruction of the postwar period: Truman's plans and Stalin's
demands, MAD (for mutual assured destruction), Johnson,
Westmoreland and the war we can't win, and the Berlin wall, both
going up and coming down.
</P>
<P>
   The events have been covered before, but here, wrote Walter
Goodman in The New York Times, ``they are infused with fresh drama
by newly unearthed and reconstructed newsreeels, demonstrating once
again the ingenuity of enterprising researchers.'' At 19 hours, the
set is video's longest.
</P>
<P>
   Late-night television came of age early in the Cold War era. In
``Jack Paar: As I Was Saying ... and More!'', perhaps the
consummate talk-show host visits with John F. Kennedy, Judy
Garland, Bill Cosby, Woody Allen and many others on three cassettes
drawn from his career in the 50s and 60s. The set is distributed by
White Star.
</P>
<P>
   Other good retro television boxes include ``The Very Best of the
Mary Tyler Moore Show: Party Girl,'' focusing on Mary's disasters
while entertaining, and ``The Bob Newhart Show: Hi Bob!'' Each has
two cassettes of episodes and is released by New Video. Those shows
have been around in other boxes, but ``The Avengers,'' with Diana
Rigg and Patrick Macnee as the quick-tongued private eyes Emma Peel
and John Steed, is available on video for the first time in a
three-cassette box fom A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   Less talky, is Kino's ``Slapstick Encyclopedia,'' two sets of
four cassettes each, with Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold
Lloyd and dozens of lesser-known silent figures. In fact, no one
says a word.

HEARING DRAWS THOSE WITH A SENSE OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Texas)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As gray skies and a gray mood soaked the nation's
capital Tuesday, Jayson Winn, a student at George Washington
University, had to decide whether to study history or watch it
unfold.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly the end of his first semester at college. The exam
for History 72, American History 1866 to the Present, loomed. So
Winn did what Madison and Jefferson and maybe even his college
professors would understand: He went to see the first impeachment
hearings in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to sit at home and not watch this in person, I'd be
denying myself an opportunity,'' said Winn, 19, who joined a small
line of history buffs and accidental tourists waiting for a seat in
the Judiciary Committee hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gray suits, Winn was the only one with a toothpick in
his mouth, a baseball cap on his head, a Dr Pepper in his hand, and
a flannel shirt completely unbuttoned to reveal a rumpled T-shirt.
But then again, he was probably the only one with a copy of ``The
US Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It'' and a paperback
edition of ``The Federalist Papers.'' (``I read it for fun,'' he
said.)
</P>
<P>
   As the president's witnesses made their rebuttals Tuesday,
Washington didn't come to a standstill _ that tends to happen
mostly when police halt traffic for a presidential motorcade. But
many in the city did pause for updates from the water cooler of the
'90s: the Internet. In the warrens of Capitol Hill, aides immersed
in transportation, health care and other non-Judiciary, non-Monica
issues gave at least a glance to the television sets tuned to
gavel-to-gavel coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The need to know at least something was infectious. Down the
hill, parking lot attendant Solomon Assefa listened to the
testimony on C-Span radio in the booth where he escaped the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Republicans in Congress are crazy,'' said Assefa, an
immigrant from Ethiopia who has followed news of the Monica S.
Lewinsky affair for nearly 11 months. ``If the president does
something in private, that's his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Gold and Joan Sterling, visitors from New York, had a
sheaf of color maps of the Capitol they had printed from a web site
(www:senate.gov). They had taken the ``virtual tour'' on a computer
back home, but their real tour happened to coincide with the
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Gold thought Clinton was getting his comeuppance after
``demonizing'' his critics, but Sterling sympathized with the
president. ``I admit that what Clinton did was wrong, but I don't
think it's an impeachable offense,'' she said. ``He didn't kill
anybody. He didn't rape that girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Old friends found themselves divided over impeachment. Mary Beth
Totten, a visitor from Chicago, didn't vote for Clinton but thought
Congress was letting the hearings drag on. But a family friend,
Dennis Lenard, a congressional staff member who was guiding her
through the Capitol, said, ``I think that Clinton's honesty, or
dishonesty, discredits the United States in foreign affairs.''
Lenard was a Marine lance corporal who served in the Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Before the proceedings started, radio stations crackled with
arguments. C-Span took callers on pro- and anti-impeachment lines.
But outside Room 2141 in the Rayburn House Office Building, where
the hearings are being held, there were few spectators and even
fewer protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Police let in a half-dozen people every half hour or so,
as others left. Ken Nitschke, who works for the California state
government, happened to be calling on legislative aides and stopped
by. ``I think it's time to put an end to this _ it's gone on too
long,'' said Nitschke, who twice voted against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony G. Marasco, a Justice Department employee in the
middle of taking week-long seminar on Congress, was pleased by the
quality of the debate at the hearings. ``This shows that the system
works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winn, the college student and political aficionado, thought
Clinton deserved to be impeached. He predicted the House would vote
for impeachment but the Senate would balk at ousting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Winn got a seat shortly after 2 p.m., although the police
officer who ushered him into Room 2141 sternly told him to throw
away his soda. He figured he'd return Wednesday so that he could
report to his family and friends in Centerville, Texas (``halfway
between Dallas and Houston, population 812'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a misconception that no one cares about this,'' Winn
said. ``I'm going home at Christmas to talk about it, and I'm all
booked up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the White House set out President Clinton's
final defense before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, the
audience that mattered most was not the one in the cavernous
hearing room. Nor was it the nation's television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20 to 30 moderate Republicans who could swing a House
impeachment vote one way or the other and who urgently need a
compelling rationale if they are to oppose impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm desperately looking for a reason that it can be explained
away,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif. Of Clinton, he said, ``I
just wish he'd spent more time explaining himself than having
attack dogs go after these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the now-critical, down-to-the wire White House quest to
win over such Republicans, Gregory Craig, the White House special
counsel, on Tuesday tried to challenge the facts of the case built
by Kenneth Starr. He showcased figures like Nicholas deB.
Katzenbach, attorney general under President Johnson, to remind
Congress it is considering removing an elected president against
the popular will.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important of all, Craig re-emphasized the
contrition that had seemed to fade from White House statements in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, I would not be fairly representing President Clinton
if I did not convey to you his profound and powerful regret for
what he has done,'' he said. ``He has insisted and personally
instructed his lawyers that no legalities and technicalities should
be allowed to obscure the simple moral truth that his behavior in
this matter was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to wonder aloud how
impeachment could now be riding on whether or not Clinton is
perceived to be truly remorseful. ``You may judge the president as
what kind of man he is by the level of contrition,'' he said, ``but
not whether he should be impeached.'' Still, it has always been the
case that impeachment is as much a political process as a
quasi-legal one. And members of Congress say President Clinton and
his aides made a series of costly political missteps after the
mid-term elections, unable to believe that the Republicans'
surprising election losses would not stop them dead in their
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the euphoria from the November
election clouded their expectation about what would happen in the
Congress,'' said Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff
who has been participating in White House conference calls on
impeachment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democrats say, the White House, using its own internal
polling, began arguing that the force of public opinion was running
so strongly with Clinton that the Republicans would never proceed
with impeachment. ``The White House is so obsessed with polling
that it can't imagine anyone else would ignore it,'' said one
Democratic strategist.
</P>
<P>
   So when Republicans called Starr before the Judiciary Committee,
the White House played for public opinion and sought to heap more
discredit on a prosecutor already low in public standing.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private attorney who has jousted with
Starr in legal proceedings for four years, shook him by
aggressively questioning the conduct of his office. But he did
nothing to contest the facts that have left many Republicans
believe the president has committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   And when Clinton did answer 81 questions put to him by the
committee, his answers seemed so evasive and legalistic that
Republicans say that was a turning point. Many of the same
moderates Clinton needs to woo saw White House response as arrogant
and were alienated by it.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials argue that they have had to conduct a
difficult balancing act, aware of a political need for the
president to show he erred but unwilling to do anything that could
open Clinton to prosecution for perjury after he leaves office.
``Certainly, there's concern that there could be legal action,''
said a senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   But even on Tuesday the president's side at times seemed tone
deaf, with some witnesses condescending to or on the offensive
against the Republicans. Sean Wilentz, a Princeton professor, told
the panel's members that they risk ``going down in history with the
zealots and the fanatics.'' And he said, ``if you are at all
unsure, and yet you vote in favor of impeachment anyway for some
other reason, history will track you down and condemn you for your
cravenness.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before his surrogates began their defense against
his impeachment, President Clinton began Tuesday determined to
avoid any public acknowledgment of the principle topic on
everybody's mind in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened the first of two days of seminars on the future
of Social Security, declaring that there was ``no more important
challenge'' facing America.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton and a
large group of congressmen, senators and Cabinet members, flew to
Tennessee late Tuesday morning to attend a memorial service for
Albert Gore Sr., the former senator and father of the vice
president, who died on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The trip forced Clinton to appear earlier than scheduled at the
conference on Social Security, and forced the Clintons to cancel
plans to moderate panel discussions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant the president was out of Washington during the
bulk of Tuesday's testimony. Clinton, smiling and gesturing,
boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base just as his special
counsel, Gregory B. Craig, wrapped up his opening statement before
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no public remarks on the defense being mounted for
him. Nor did Mrs. Clinton. But in contrast to other pivotal moments
through this long year of scandal, when the White House portrayed
him as singularly focused on the nation's business, the president's
aides said Clinton clearly felt the seriousness of Tuesday's
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are aware of what's going on with that, including
the president,'' one aide said of the hearings, where even Craig,
his chief defender, repeatedly referred to the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky as sinful, though not
impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not watch any of the hearings, but a senior adviser,
Douglas Sosnik, briefed him on how the testimony was going.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the hearings overshadowed the debate on Social
Security, which the White House broadcast via satellite to meeting
sites in all 50 states. In his opening remarks, Clinton made an
appeal for bipartisanship in saving the system from insolvency next
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is in this process no room for rancor,'' he said. ``The
stakes are too high, the issues far too important.''
</P>
<P>
   After his remarks, Clinton appeared distracted, scribbling
something into a folder, as congressional leaders followed him to
the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings continued as the Clintons returned to Washington
from Tennessee early Tuesday evening. Together they attended two
awards dinners, one by Peace Links, an arms control advocacy group,
and the other by the National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the
Democratic Party that promotes democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The institute awarded its W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award to
Clinton and the leaders of the peace process in Northern Ireland.

<P>
   A new guide ranking the 50 top colleges and universities where
African Americans are most likely to succeed will be published next
month as a 10-page feature in the monthly business magazine, Black
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a host of national magazines that publish annual college
guides, including Time, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report,
Black Enterprise has ranked colleges based on responses from 1,077
African-American professionals in higher education at 987 colleges
and universities. They assessed things like academic strengths and
social environment. The study also factored in measurements like
graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the list are nine historically black colleges and
universities, beginning with Spelman College in Atlanta, Morehouse
College in Atlanta and Florida A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   After the top nine come Stanford University, Georgetown
University, Oberlin College and Swarthmore College.
</P>
<P>
   ``In making our rankings, we separated out the historically
black schools because they have the overwhelming advantage of
having the greatest number of black students,'' said Marjorie
Whigham-Desir, a senior editor who worked on the project. ``That
way, they became their own category, and so we wound up with what's
called a weighed model.''
</P>
<P>
   The list and rankings were developed by Thomas LaVeist, a
professor of health and public policy at Johns Hopkins University
and CEO of DayStar, the research company that conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   The primary criterion, LaVeist said, was that the college or
university had to be an accredited four-year institution that has
an African-American enrollment of at least 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If an institution did not meet those criteria but was well-known
and would be of significant interest to black students, it was
added to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The educational professionals graded the institutions on a scale
of 1 to 5 from strongly recommended to strongly not recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Edmond, executive editor of Black Enterprise magazine,
said he hoped that the rankings would stimulate the dialogue on how
to achieve greater diversity on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any surprises in the rankings, Ms.
Whigham-Desir laughed and said LaVeist was surprised. ``He went to
the University of Maryland's Eastern Shore campus, and then got his
master's and Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, and neither of
them showed up in the top 50.''

DEMOCRATS TRY TO REVIVE CENSURE RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The push by some Democrats to pass a resolution
censuring President Clinton, which has seemed to founder in the
last few days, is being revived in what the White House views as a
last-ditch effort to stave off a vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have said they are opposed to censure,
leading to speculation that a vote will not be allowed and thus
making the issue moot.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said Tuesday that private negotiations are heating
up with key Republicans in an effort to gain permission to bring a
vote on the measure to the House floor after the expected vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If swing-vote House members know they could vote for censure,
they would be more likely to vote against impeachment, according to
Representative Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat involved in the
censure talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no fizzling of the effort'' for censure,
Boucher said. ``We are working very heard, albeit somewhat quietly,
to achieve an opportunity for censure to be considered.'' Boucher,
a member of the House Judiciary Committee, expects the
Republican-controlled panel to oppose censure, but he said a House
vote might lead to approval of censure if the motion is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The censure move, while still a longshot, picked up a little
steam Tuesday when Representative Amo Houghton, a New York
Republican, prepared to announce Wednesday that he would vote
against impeachment and favored censure. Another New York
Republican, Representative Peter King, has said 20 or more GOP
members oppose impeachment. Republican leaders have said that
number is inflated and there are enough votes to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the Constitution does not provide for censure of a
president, Congress often votes on statements that condemn or
censure a variety of actions. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde said this week, ``We can condemn a ham sandwich if we
want to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde is among the strongest opponents of censure. ``I don't
think censure is an appropriate sanction,'' Hyde said. ``I don't
think Congress has the constitutional authority. In a government of
delegated powers, when it comes to disciplining the chief
executive, the Constitution has delegated impeachment, not
censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hyde gave some hope to Democrats when he said, ``I'm not
for it, but I'm not saying that I will go to the death to resist
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Judiciary Committee approves one or more articles of
impeachment, as expected, the best-case scenario for Democrats is
that both impeachment and censure would be considered on the House
floor. In that case, Democrats are expected to argue a bipartisan
censure would send a stronger signal than a vote for impeachment
mostly along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders have said that censure is too weak,
noting that it can be reversed by a subsequent Congress, as
happened after President Andrew Jackson was censured by the Senate
in 1834.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders prefer that Clinton be impeached by the
House, even though they recognize that there is little chance that
he will be convicted in a Senate trial and ousted from office.
Impeachment, unlike censure, would be a permanent mark against
Clinton that could not be revised by a later Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Tuesday continued their criticism of Republican
efforts to turn impeachment into a ``super censure,'' as it was
called by former New York Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, a
Democrat who testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat who
has led the drive for censure, said through a spokesman Tuesday
that the first step will be to get the House to decide that a
censure motion would be germane. That will be decided by the GOP
leadership and the Rules Committee. The second step, spokesman
Steve Schwadron said, is to draft a censure motion that would be
accepted by some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proceeding aggressively on both fronts,'' Schwadron
said. But Schwadron said that Delahunt so far hasn't released a
draft of the censure motion and is still talking to colleagues
about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how prospects for censure have waned,
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, joined
with House Whip Thomas DeLay of Texas on Monday in signing a
statement opposing censure. DeLay is a chief advocate for
impeachment and thus a likely opponent of censure. But Shays had
been targeted by Democrats as a possible censure advocate because
he is one of the few Republicans on record saying he will vote
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among Democrats and moderate Republicans who favor
censure is that the House will realize that the public opposes
impeachment and that there would be a public backlash for such a
vote. An ABC News poll conducted from Dec. 2 to 6 found that 64
percent of respondents opposed impeachment, while 59 percent
favored censure.
</P>
<P>
   White House communications director Ann Lewis said that
``clearly there is less talk'' about censure, but she didn't rule
out the possibility that such a motion might be approved. She said
Clinton has not publicly backed censure because Republicans might
resent any effort by the president to tell them how to act. But
Lewis said the White House has made clear that ``we are for a
solution that is prompt, constitutional and fair and acknowledges
that what he did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House officials acknowledge they are surprised
that the impeachment effort has moved forward, saying that they may
have been too quick to assume that the November election results
and the ouster of House Speaker Newt Gingrich would end the
impeachment drive. White House officials said that they were
unprepared for the way DeLay has moved the power vacuum left by
Gingrich's departure and DeLay's effectiveness in urging
Republicans to back impeachment.

 &HT;    Ad agency churns out Papa John's pizza ads despite lawsuit
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite complaints, counterattacks and courtroom
drama, Atlanta's Fricks/Firestone continues to roll out new Papa
John's ads.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is about to release its latest TV commercials that
continue what's being called the ``Pizza War'' between powerhouse
Pizza Hut and Papa John's.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut has been the $22 billion industry's No. 1 chain in
size, sales and market share since 1971, while 14-year-old Papa
John's, the fastest growing competitor, is giving its rivals a run
for their money.
</P>
<P>
   The feud is so intense, Pizza Hut has filed a federal lawsuit
against No. 4 Papa John's International, alleging the
Louisville-based chain's ``better ingredients, better pizza''
mantra and other marketing claims are deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Pizza Hut is seeking an injunction to halt the
disputed marketing practices and $12.5 million in damages, along
with attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa John's is totally off the mark when they say this is a PR
stunt. We consider it very serious,'' said Pizza Hut spokesman Jay
Allison. ``We've run some comparative advertising to set the record
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   John H. Schnatter, Papa John's founder and chief executive, has
called the lawsuit ``frivolous'' and commissioned full-page
newspaper ads likening the case to a David and Goliath battle.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut, with 7,200 restaurants, spent $147 million on
advertising last year, compared with the $16.6 million ad budget
for Papa John's, according to Competitive Media Reporting. Yet Papa
John's, with 1,800 locations, nearly doubled its market share in
the last two years, while share grew only slightly for Domino's and
fell for Pizza Hut and Little Caesars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa John's is rattling a lot of cages,'' said Gerry Durnell,
publisher of Pizza Today, a trade magazine. ``They have an intense,
laser focus on quality, and they've never taken their eye off that
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fricks/Firestone President John Fricks said the agency has
stressed that focus on quality since winning the Papa John's
account in spring 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they came along, nobody talked about quality,'' he said,
pointing out how Pizza Hut's advertising focused on its variety and
trend-setting menu items. Ads for Dominos stressed dominance in
delivery, while Little Caesars positioned itself as the low-price
leader, Fricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut has been rocked by the Papa John's quality-centered
ads because ``the first to say something owns that truth,'' Fricks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Creative director Elliott Firestone cooked up the idea for the
first national Papa John's campaign _ the ads that touched off the
blood war when they first began airing in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign features Frank Carney, who co-founded Pizza Hut in
1958 and continued on as president and a board member after the
chain's 1977 purchase by Pepsico. Pizza Hut was a billion-dollar
company, with 4,000 restaurants worldwide, when Carney left in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a better pizza,'' Carney, a Papa John's franchisee
since 1994, matter-of-factly explains in the ads. One of them
playfully depicts his portrait and bust being carted off from Pizza
Hut headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Carney is more than just a figurehead endorser for the chain. He
runs more than 70 Papa John's restaurants and has rights to develop
700 more in the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials landed Papa John's on Advertising Age's list of
the top 100 marketing campaigns for 1997, alongside such
attention-getters as Beanie Babies, Starbucks coffee and Tickle Me
Elmo. They also led to Pizza Hut filing the first of two complaints
against Papa John's with the National Advertising Division of the
Council of Better Business Bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   The NAD ruled that it was accurate for Papa John's to advertise
that consumers significantly prefer its regular and thin crust
pizzas over comparable Pizza Hut products. It also ruled the
comparison of Papa John's fresh-packed tomato sauce to Pizza Hut's
remanufactured paste is meaningful and relevant to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Papa John's made two minor modifications to its ads after the
rulings, which are non-binding. But that wasn't enough to satisfy
Pizza Hut, which filed the federal lawsuit in August. The trial
date has been set for October 1999.

COMMENTARY: THE CLOSET CANDIDATE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an early campaign spot in his 1994 run for the U.S. Senate,
Michael Huffington quoted from William Bennett's ``Book of
Virtues'' on the virtues of family. Soon to come were bucolic,
sun-dappled spots highlighting Huffington's togetherness with his
celebrity wife, Arianna, and their kids.
</P>
<P>
   But not long after he lost narrowly to the Democratic incumbent,
Dianne Feinstein, the Huffingtons separated and then divorced. And
this week, on his own volition, Huffington decided to make his
intimate life public by declaring to Esquire magazine that he is
homosexual, in a detailed confessional to a writer friend, David
Brock.
</P>
<P>
   When the story broke over the weekend, journalists correctly
pointed out that Huffington, unlike such past closeted gay
Republicans from Roy Cohn to the Jesse Helms adviser Arthur
Finkelstein, didn't abet gay-bashing. Though his campaign was
cloaked in hypocritical imagery and rhetoric that included
Huffington's disparagement of ``the gay lifestyle'' (which he first
led himself, he now says, in the 1970s), he often did support gay
civil rights. The Esquire piece makes clear that Huffington was
more a tortured victim of GOP homophobia than a perpetrator of it.
Inspired by Oral Roberts and his party's high priest, Pat
Robertson, he tried to will himself into heterosexuality through
prayer _ with predictably futile, self-annihilating results.
</P>
<P>
   But a full reading of the article also makes it clear that
Huffington's sexual orientation isn't the real news in his story,
as far as the quality of our public life is concerned. What is most
disturbing are the damning non-sexual revelations that may now get
lost in the prurient buzz. By his own account, Huffington emerges
as a man with no political convictions and no achievements. Yet his
vast personal fortune _ once hooked up to the omnipotent medium of
TV advertising, especially negative advertising _ was able to give
him a fake identity and smear his opponent until he came within 2
percent of representing the nation's largest state in the U.S.
Senate. Only a last-minute illegal-nanny scandal defeated him.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington spent $30 million _ by far a record-breaking amount
for a Senate race. Two years earlier he had broken the national
spending record in a House race too _ successfully deploying
negative ads to unseat a well-regarded, nine-term Republican
congressman, Bob Lagomarsino, in the primary. So loudly did
Huffington's money talk that he overcame the seemingly
insurmountable handicap of being a complete unknown who had moved
to California only six months before.
</P>
<P>
   In his race against Feinstein, he was derided as an empty suit
by many commentators, with the notable exception of George Will,
who vouched for Huffington's intellectual prowess and mocked rumors
about his sexuality. But even the candidate's tough press critics
may not have been probing enough. In Esquire, we learn that
Huffington only reluctantly pursued his pre-political career in his
father's oil business, and that he sleepwalked through his Reagan
administration appointment in the Pentagon (``He remembers
virtually nothing of his year there'') and his accomplishment-free
term as a congressman (``He found the minutiae of crafting laws
boring''). The only reason he ran for the Senate is that he ``would
do anything'' not to face another tedious term in the House.
</P>
<P>
   As the real corruption of our time is the spiraling effect of
unchecked special-interest money, not sex, on governance, so the
real lesson of the Huffington case is the corrosive effect of an
unlimited private fortune, not sex, on a political culture where
paid ads can drown out less-moneyed opposition and a free press. A
complete nonentity _ so rudderless he isn't sure today if he's a
Democrat or a Republican _ pulled the wool over the eyes of
millions of voters with the media blanket unlimited cash now buys.
Any empty suit so easily merchandised on TV to all-too-credulous
voters can be merely a front for unseen ideologues pulling the
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the country, both Huffington and the more overtly
dangerous Ross Perot were derailed before they bought their way to
the top. But the as yet scantly examined Steve Forbes is already
spending whatever it takes of his bottomless fortune to win the
presidency in 2000, and as the Huffington saga proves, only a fool
would dismiss him as a joke.

   When the freshman college football player was caught robbing a
gas station near campus, his mother was irate with the coach. ``I
send my boy to you,'' she told the coach by telephone, ``and in
three months' time look what happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach listened. ``I had him for three months,'' he replied.
``You had him for 17 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack Brown, the football coach of the University of Texas,
recalled this incident, which happened in 1975 when he was a
23-year-old assistant coach at Southern Mississippi. The head coach
there, who spoke with the mother, was Bobby Collins. He was talking
about the perils of being responsible for 125 young men _
especially in light of the indictments last week of four
Northwestern University football players on perjury charges related
to point-shaving in games in 1994 _ and what he learned from that
experience which he observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that you had to do all you can to prevent such an
occurrence, and even then it's not always in your control,'' he
said. ``It's like being a parent. I have four kids myself. You
talk, you counsel, you try to get a network to know what's going
on, where they are, who they're with and then you hope they listen,
and you hope for the best. Sometimes the best doesn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack Brown and Phillip Fulmer, head coach of Tennessee, the No.
1 ranked team in the nation, were in town to attend Tuesday night's
College Football Hall of Fame dinner, but Tuesday morning they were
together in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to help promote a
book they both believe is important. The ``Coach's Communication
Playbook,'' by Kathleen Hessert, deals with problems that arise for
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   When the Northwestern scandal broke, the impact on both coaches
_ as it was, surely, in the entire coaching community _ was
immediate and profound. ``It scares you to death,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in the morning after the news of the Northwestern
situation with the newspaper headlines,'' Fulmer said. ``I pinned
them on the board, and discussed it with my players. I have no
doubt coaches all over the country were doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer said that before every season he talks to his players
about gambling _ how it can ruin their lives. The FBI comes in to
talk to the players. This happens on most campuses around the
country. It took place at Northwestern, which also recently endured
a basketball point-shaving scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Gary Barnett,'' Fulmer said, referring to the
Northwestern coach. ``I know he is bright, and he is able. But as
hard as you might try, the coach can't know everything. You try to
establish a network, a support system, so that information will be
filtered to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to know the kind of person you recruited, and be aware
of patterns that might develop. I had one player show up in the
parking lot with a brand-new Mustang. I took him aside and
questioned him about it. He took offense. Turned out that his uncle
had bought it for him. He had the title to the car. The player was
just waiting for me to ask him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the former Northwestern players indicted _ the star
running back Dennis Lundy _ was accused of fumbling in a crucial
situation in trying to win a bet.
</P>
<P>
   When Barnett learned that Lundy was gambling on college sports _
Lundy protested that it wasn't on Northwestern football _ the
senior was suspended for the last game of the season and was
prevented from having a chance to break the school rushing record.
Barnett told the news media that Lundy had broken a team rule. He
didn't specify. Should he have?
</P>
<P>
   ``Families have lawyers,'' Brown said, ``and the best thing you
can do in such situations is immediately refer the problem to the
authorities, the athletic director, the president of the school,
the legal authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Gary Barnett did. ``But you see how difficult the
problem is when it took four years for the investigation to end and
to have federal authorities issue an indictment,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, as Rick Taylor, Northwestern's athletic director
said that, ``Gambling is so pervasive in our society that we're
kidding ourselves if we feel we can control it totally.''
</P>
<P>
   But who must take responsibility in such an alleged scandal? The
player, certainly _ even if only a teen-ager _ because he knows
right from wrong, or ought to. But also the university and the
coaching staff. Northwestern, for one, may have had enough coaches,
but not enough ears.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern contends it did not know the gun was loaded.
Nonetheless, in such cases, it must stand guilty at least of
sublime ignorance.

50 YEARS AFTER HISTORIC DOCUMENT, US STILL SEEKS RIGHTS BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the United States stands as both
guarantor and violator of the lofty ideals embodied in a document
that has inspired generations and created a new body of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Born after the barbarities of World War II, the UN General
Assembly's declaration of civil, social, political and economic
rights for all people was a feel-good measure, glorified but
largely set aside by the perceived imperatives of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Jimmy Carter's presidency that the goal of
extending human rights became an explicit objective of US foreign
policy. In the intervening two decades, US policy has swung like a
pendulum between viewing the extension of human rights as an end in
itself, and the use of human rights as a useful tool to further US
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the struggle to balance a commitment to democratic
ideals with the pragmatism required by superpower status continues,
political observers say human rights have evolved under the Clinton
administration, assuming a more secure and permanent place in
foreign policy. At the same time, however, they say policy is still
fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates are less generous, calling President
Clinton approach ``incoherent'' and ``hollow.'' They say he has
squandered his post-Cold War opportunity to lead on the issue,
hobbled at every turn by excessive concern for national security
and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   And while human rights advocates concede they have greater
access and a stronger presence than ever before in the
administration, they say they don't have influence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, they say, has continued the Cold War
practice of turning a blind eye to human rights violators that are
allies, such as Turkey and Indonesia, while being quick to condemn
violators like Cuba, Burma and Sudan, which are not. Clinton also
failed to respond quickly to genocide in Rwanda, continued human
rights abuses in China and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But his worst offense, they say, is his refusal to join the
international community in supporting the major human rights
initiatives of the decade: a ban on anti-personnel land mines and
the establishment of a permanent international criminal court.
Washington also is bucking the move to raise the minimum age of
child soldiers from 15 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still see that human rights are subjected to other
considerations,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human
Rights Watch. ``Of course, they always will be, but they don't have
to have second tier status as they do today.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials maintain that the issue of human rights
plays a major role in national security thinking, which in itself
is a sign of progress _ even if trade and security concerns
sometimes win out.
</P>
<P>
   To back this up, they cite from decisions to intervene in
Somalia and Haiti, to support for war crime tribunals after the
Rwandan genocide and the civil war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, they say, is that the administration has
reinvented a foreign policy practice that marries the global
pursuit of human rights with US political self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We increasingly appreciate that a world with governments that
respect their people is a world that is more congenial to American
interests,'' noted Eric Schwartz, senior director of the National
Security Council's multilateral and human rights affairs division.
``It's not an either/or. Promoting human rights not only reflects
our values, but it's smart as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But while human rights lobbyists believe Clinton has not been
responsive enough to their demands, the business community has the
opposite complaint: that US policy is in the thrall of ``human
rights extremists who have tried to use trade as an enforcement
mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The US government has become sanctions-happy in the past six
years,'' said Willard W. Workman, vice president of international
affairs for the US Chamber of Commerce. ``The most fundamental
right is food and shelter and the best way to secure it is through
trade and exports.''
</P>
<P>
   In Carter's day, simply talking about human rights was novel,
according to David A. Martin, profesor of law at the University of
Virginia who worked in the State Department's first human rights
bureau established by Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was continuous battle between the rest of the
State Department and the bureau, its creation was Carter's greatest
lasting contributions to the movement, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's outspoken stance on human rights abuses in places like
Chile and Argentina also saved lives, according to Eric Stover,
director of the Human Rights Center at the University of California
at Berkeley, even if his policies were sometimes inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   When President Reagan took office, his administration
immediately repudiated Carter's efforts and ``all-out war'' broke
out between the human rights community and the administration,
remembers Holly Birkhalter, advocacy director for the Boston-based
group Physicians for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, however, came to see that having a human rights agenda
helped him stake out the moral high ground during the Cold
War.However, he also equated human rights and democracy with
voting, regardless of whether basic rights such as free speech were
guaranteed, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights
Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allowed him to massively fund the Salvadoran government
and the Contras in Central America even though they were
systematically committing the most severe abuses,'' said Roth.
``But it also showed that even Reagan couldn't be oblivious to
human rights pressures, that he had to distort the facts to
maintain the facade.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's emphasis on electoralism, however, also translated into
forceful action against corrupt dictators in Haiti and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Once George Bush came to office and the Berlin Wall fell,
however, human rights lost their ideological punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush didn't do much,'' said Henry Teune, professor of
political science at the University of Pennsylvania. ``He wanted to
create an architecture of international cooperation, but human
rights was never a big part of his message.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been a priority, but human rights were used in
US efforts to marshal support for the Persian Gulf War, the
no-flight zone to protect Iraqi Kurds, and a series of innovative
international humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Clinton has borrowed from all three of his
predecessors: Carter's idealism, Reagan's electoralism, and Bush's
pragmatism. But as the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights approaches, the president's legacy appears anything
but clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has undertaken some the best initiatives ever _ and
also some of the worst,'' said Burkhalter.

JAPANESE ACHIEVE MULTIPLE CLONING OF COW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japanese scientists say they have created eight cloned calves
from cells of a single cow, and in doing so have significantly
improved the efficiency of the mammalian cloning technique that
produced the lamb Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   But four of the calves died soon after birth. The scientists
said they thought the deaths were unrelated to the cloning, but
couldn't rule out some undiscovered effect of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In a report scheduled for publication in the journal Science
Friday, the scientists from Kinki University in Japan said that
they made 141 embryos by combining adult cow cell nuclei with
recipient cow eggs. Of these embryos, 38 matured to a stage deemed
ready for transfer to surrogate cow mothers, and 10 were
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the team led by Ian Wilmut at the Roslin Institute
in Scotland reported in 1997 that Dolly was the only surviving
clone from 277 embryos that were created.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese report suggests that they have achieved greater
efficiency, but other scientists said the study was too small to be
a reliable indicator of future efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmut, who Tuesday spoke on cloning at Harvard Medical School,
called the new report ``useful'' and a ``step toward'' greater
efficiency. In his talk, however, he stressed that scientists still
have far to go in understanding the abnormalities of some cloned
offspring and the generally low efficiency rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Science report was released Tuesday after a British
newspaper broke the embargo that had been set for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese scientists used generally the same method pioneered
by Wilmut. Wilmut and his colleagues took specialized cells from
the udder of an adult ewe and transplanted their nuclei _ which
contain the genetic material _ into a sheep egg from which the
nucleus had been removed. The genetic instructions in the adult
mammary cell underwent a ``reprogramming'' that returned them to an
embryonic stage, able to direct the development of an entire
individual.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese researchers, led by Yoko Kato, did not use mammary
cells. Instead, they obtained cow ovaries and oviducts from a
slaughter house and isolated two types of cells: cumulus cells,
which surround the egg made by the ovary, and epithelial cells that
line the oviduct, through which the egg passes to the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   They transplanted 37 nuclei from cumulus cells and 88 nuclei
from the oviduct cells into cow eggs whose own genetic material had
been eliminated, and bathed them in laboratory culture fluid for 8
to 9 days. About half the embryos made with cumulus cells began
developing normally, as did about one-fourth of the embryos created
using oviduct cells.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the scientists took 10 of the thriving embryos, which had
reached the so-called blastocyst stage consisting of a microscopic
ball of cells, and transferred them to the wombs of surrogate
mother cows.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of those pregnancies led to live births.
</P>
<P>
   James Robl, a cloning researcher at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, noted that the Japanese emphasis on using
adult cells is aimed at eventually making genetic copies of elite
animals for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
   Many US researchers, by contrast, are more interested in using
cloned animals as a source of tissue for medical transplants. For
those uses, cloning fetal rather than adult cells is more
appropriate, said Robl.
</P>
<P>
   The UMass scientist said that the main significance of the
Japanese report is that ``with more groups having success with
(cloning), it means this technology is real and is here to stay.''

   MOSCOW _ The severed heads of four kidnapping victims _
identified as three Britons and a New Zealander _ were found
Tuesday on the side of a road in Chechnya, the breakaway region on
Russia's southern border that emerged undefeated from a brutal war
two years ago only to be engulfed by a wave of kidnappings and
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome killings heightened alarm and outrage about the
volatile situation in the region, which spun out of Moscow's
control long ago. Until now, local kidnappers have usually kept
their hostages alive in hopes of receiving ransom money, which has
become a major source of income in an economy devastated by
Russia's 21-month war against Chechen secessionists.
</P>
<P>
   Although the corpses have not yet been found, Chechen officials
said Tuesday that they had been able to identify the victims as
four employees of a British telecommunications company. They were
kidnapped from their house in the Chechen capital, Grozny, by two
dozen armed men on Oct. 3, after a shootout with their bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, in a statement Tuesday night condemning
the ``repugnant murders,'' said it was awaiting final confirmation
of the victims' identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a horrifying crime, committed against the international
community,'' said Manolis Chikhkiyev, an aide to Ruslan Aushev,
president of Ingushetia, a region that borders Chechnya. ``Ordinary
criminals wouldn't kill their hostages, which means that this
situation is much deeper and more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100 kidnap victims _ including several foreigners,
as well as Russian servicemen _ are still being held in Chechnya
and neighboring regions in the northern Caucasus. In neighboring
Dagestan, kidnappers seized Herbert Gregg, an American teacher, on
Nov. 12 as he was leaving a local orphanage. His whereabouts are
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Chechen government has mounted a new
campaign to crack down on the kidnapping gangs, an effort that was
set back in October by a car bomb that killed the leader of its
special anti-terrorist squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, has accused his
political opposition and ``foreign agents'' of using kidnapping as
a weapon in its campaign to unseat him. But the crime wave is also
attributed to competing local chieftans, Muslim extremists and
other groups that have been feeding off the lawlessness and anarchy
that has swept the region.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, a Russian official, Akmal Saidov, was found
strangled to death several days after he had been abducted. The
motive was judged to be political after a note signed by the
``wolves of Islam'' was reportedly found on his body, vowing death
to those who work for the Russian secret service.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of kidnapping has left Chechnya isolated from the rest of
the world, as journalists, aid workers and foreign investors keep a
wary distance from a region now so impoverished that according to
one local resident, some people are reduced to a diet of animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Masyuk, one of three Russian television journalist
kidnapped and then released last year after payment of $2 million
in ransom, said at an international conference last May that the
kidnappings had cost Chechnya the sympathy it had won when Russian
troops were bombing its capital and killing its civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechens made $16 million on journalists last year, but they
lost much more,'' she said. ``They lost the journalists' confidence
that they had had during the war.'' The result, she said, was ``an
information blockade'' against the region and its 1 million
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Russian government, while refusing to
recognize Chechen independence, has virtually no authority in the
region, and has dispersed little of the money it pledged for
postwar reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   There have been successes in the war against the kidnappers _
such as the release last month of President Boris Yeltsin's
personal envoy to the region, Valentin Vlasov, after six months of
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, 55 Russian servicemen who had been held
captive have been returned to Moscow. And in September, a pair of
British aid workers were flown back to England, where they told
harrowing tales of abuse by their captors.
</P>
<P>
   Most released hostages have reported that their captors were
careful to keep them alive, if barely, so as to be able to collect
their reward. One hostage, released this year after several months
of captivity and speaking on condition of anonymity, described
being held in cold, wet basements, wearing the same set of clothes
until they rotted on his body.
</P>
<P>
   Masked guards would deliver meager food rations at irregular
intervals, and periodically move their prisoners to different
locations, always at night. In his case, the motive for the
kidnapping was clear. ``Their goal was only money,'' he said, ``and
they don't hide this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But even the hostage releases have only added fuel to the
politically charged atmosphere in the region, as competing groups
accuse each other of getting rich on the ransoms. Last month,
Maskhadov accused a Russian financier, Boris Berezovsky, of fueling
the kidnapping industry by paying out huge ransoms.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky _ who has played an open role in negotiating the
release of a number of hostages _ has routinely denied the charges,
although he has said he provided humanitarian assistance, computers
and textbooks to Chechnya in an effort to secure good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do everything possible on my side to stop this
mess,'' he said Tuesday. ``Until this case, we were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Ministry officials have insisted that Vlasov
was released after a special operation mounted with the aid of
troops from Ingushetia, without the participation of any Chechen
forces. However, Chechen officials contend that in this case, too,
a ransom was paid. ``Money has been paid in every case,'' said
Sharip Yusupov, a Chechen living in Moscow, who for five years was
Chechnya's representative in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Yusupov said he thought the brazen killing of the four
telecommunications specialists was a sign that the kidnappers no
longer expect to get ransom money from Russian officials. ``The
kidnapping industry is no longer profitable,'' he said, ``which
left these people without a `master.' They were caught in a
squeeze.''
</P>
<P>
   According to another theory, the kidnappers may have killed
their victims because they feared they were about to be caught.
Maskhadov, at a news conference in Grozny Tuesday, said that a
captured suspect had begun to give information last week about the
location of the kidnappers. In London, a spokesman for Granger
Telecom, the British company that employed the men, said they had
had word last week that the hostages were safe.

WHEN THE BAT TOOK FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 13)  
 (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE BAT WHISPERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milestone Film and Video. 85 minutes. Letter-boxed. $29.95.
Information: (800) 603-1104 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The action may be antiquated, but its legacy is hard to match.
Along with the radio show ``The Shadow'' and Leonardo da Vinci's
flying machines, Roland West's 1930 thriller ``The Bat Whispers''
was a source for the late cartoonist Bob Kane, who in 1939 created
Batman the Caped Crusader and Robin the Boy Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   West's bat, however, was in the business of fomenting crime, not
preventing it. At the beginning of the film, an entire city, cast
in an ominous gloom reminiscent of later Batman films, has come to
a standstill as it awaits ``the Bat.'' At exactly midnight or so,
he announces, he will steal a necklace from an apartment belonging
to a Mr. Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Pistol at the ready, Bell stands guard inside the apartment
while outside teams of police brace for the worst. The appointed
hour arrives but no bat. Bell starts to breathe easier, and the
police turn self-congratulatory. On the radio an announcer rattles
on about what's possible when an aroused citizenry rallies against
crime.
</P>
<P>
   But then a shade rustles in the apartment. Bell goes to
investigate. Seconds later he's dead, and the necklace is being
lifted. The clock on his desk reads five past midnight. Before
swiftly ascending to the rooftops, the Bat insolently flips his
calling card on the carpet with a message for the police. ``Bell's
clock was fast and you boys were slow,'' it reads.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty slick. Pieced together from its surviving elements, the
restored film is in its original widescreen format. Made at a time
when movies were adjusting to the talkies, it has many of the
characteristics of silent film. As much a fey comedy as it is a
thriller, it moves in large and exaggerated gestures, has some
laughs at the expense of its characters and is never above breaking
off for a slapstick routine or two.
</P>
<P>
   For all the shenanigans, though, there are flashes of
impressionistic high style. A bat of the human variety, his cape
spread at night to resemble wings and his image flashed against
walls and across lightning-streaked skies, cuts an arresting figure
in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   After the jewel heist, the story repairs to a dark and sprawling
mansion for a tug of war over money stolen from a bank. Contestants
include the feisty matron who has rented the place; a damsel (Una
Merkel, best remembered for her hair-pulling brawl with Marlene
Dietrich in ``Destry Rides Again'') trying to protect her boyfriend
the bank clerk, who is accused of the crime; a police detective
(the jut-jawed Chester Morris), and, of course, the Bat, who
appears apparition-like from time to time to waylay somebody or
otherwise wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody chases one another round and round the heavy
furnishings, up and down sweeping staircases and in and out of
secret rooms behind massive fireplaces. At the end, the identity of
the Bat is revealed. He even takes a curtain call and has a private
word with the viewers. He's not such a bad guy, really, he says. &QL;

GORE EULOGIZES HIS FATHER AND POLITICAL MENTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Under chilly, slate-gray skies, Vice
President Al Gore buried his father Tuesday, paying tribute to
former Sen. Albert Gore Sr. as a political force who helped
transform the Old South into the New South and as a father who bred
in his son an abiding sense of security and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children with strong fathers learn trust early on that their
needs will be met, that they're wanted, that they have value,'' the
vice president said in a eulogy at a service at the War Memorial
here attended by more than 1,000 people, including President
Clinton. ``They can afford to be secure and confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr., a former Democratic congressman and senator for
more than three decades, died Saturday at the age of 90 in
Carthage. The service here coincided with the impeachment inquiry
under way in Washington, and Clinton sat silently next to his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, who has all but officially announced his candidacy for
president, paid tribute to his father for instilling in him values
that may serve as a subtext for the next presidential campaign as
candidates affirm their steadfastness in reaction to Clinton's sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the lessons he taught me as a father, perhaps the most
powerful was the way he loved my mother,'' the vice president said.
``When I was growing up, it never once occurred to me that the
foundation upon which my security depended would ever shake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience sat several of the vice president's former and
possibly future rivals _ Democrats including the Rev. Jesse Jackson
and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, and Republicans including Sen.
Fred Thompson and former Gov. Lamar Alexander, both of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is about to embark on the final leg of a political journey
for which his father set the course decades ago. The elder Gore
was, inescapably, his son's earliest political mentor, taking him
as a toddler to the Senate, where Vice President Richard Nixon
called the boy to the rostrum, bounced him on his knee and let him
play with the gavel.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gore also forthrightly stood up for what he believed,
a trait noted by many of the politicians of both parties who
mingled before the service.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said: ``He was a person who was willing to walk into
the teeth of enemy fire. It's a good example, not just for his son
but for all of us in public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Hooks, the former president of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, lauded this trait from the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a politician driven by polls, but one who was
driven by principle,'' Hooks said, noting Gore's refusal to sign
the Southern Manifesto, which condemned the U.S. Supreme Court's
school desegregation order, and his fierce opposition to the
Vietnam War. ``He was not one who said what he thought his audience
wanted to hear, but he told them what he needed to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore learned crucial political lessons by watching his father
in victory as well as in defeat, and shaped his own career
accordingly. One brutal experience was watching his father lose his
final, bruising Senate campaign in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gore's unabashed liberalism _ against the war, against
school prayer, in favor of civil rights, busing and gun control _
had put him at odds with many in Tennessee, and he was perceived as
having lost touch with his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Once the son entered politics, he relentlessly cultivated his
roots as a home-grown Tennessean despite his upbringing in
Washington. As for issues, the vice president is not associated
with emotionally charged or ideologically polarizing topics,
steeping himself instead in high technology and reinventing
government. He has called himself ``a raging moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's mother, Pauline, said in a 1988 interview that he had
probably learned lessons her husband had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al by nature is more of a pragmatist than his father,'' she
said. ``If there's no chance of victory, there's no sense in
bloodying yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president lauded his father Tuesday for fighting those
battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped to establish the terms of a new politics for
Tennessee and the entire South, a progressive politics that
rejected race-baiting and connected our region to the rest of
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was brave. I mean, really brave. He opposed the poll
tax in the '40s and supported civil rights in the '50s. By the time
he was in his final Senate term, I was old enough to understand
clearly the implications of the choices he made when he repeatedly
rejected the advice of many fearful political allies who had urged
him to trim his sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said some people hated his father because of his
principles, but the vice president suggested that this was a fair
price to pay for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to be hated for what you are,'' he said, ``than
to be loved for what you are not.''

RAYTHEON CHIEF SEES LAYOFFS HALTING AT ANNOUNCED LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co.'s new top executive said he doesn't expect major
layoffs beyond an ongoing reduction of 14,000 jobs announced in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Burnham, who became chief executive of the Lexington,
Mass. defense contractor on Dec. 1, said in an interview this week
that the company intends to avoid further job cuts by becoming more
efficient and winning more military contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and believe it's the last one like this,'' Burnham
said, referring to the current round of layoffs. Two months ago,
Raytheon said it will eliminate 14,000 jobs by the end of 1999 _ up
from its forecast last January that it would cut 8,700 positions. A
total of about 115,000 jobs will remain after the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Employees likely to lose their jobs _ including 1,200 in
Massachusetts _ were all notified last month so as to minimize
uncertainty through the holiday season, Burnham said. ``By
mid-November, everybody knew their situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts come as part of a restructuring meant to improve
productivity and to reduce Raytheon's debt, which now stands at
around $10 billion. Most of the debt was taken on as part of
Raytheon's acquisition streak last year, when it paid $12.5 billion
for the defense operations of Texas Instruments Inc. and Hughes
Electronics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Former Raytheon chief executive Dennis Picard was the architect
of the expansion, part of a broader consolidation in the defense
industry. Picard stepped down as chief executive Dec. 1, and plans
to turn over the chairman's role to Burnham sometime next year.
Burnham, previously vice chairman at AlliedSignal Inc., joined
Raytheon July 1 as president and chief operating officer and was
charged with integrating Raytheon's disparate new units.
</P>
<P>
   To help do so, Burnham said he plans in January to introduce a
quality control program that will provide about 40 hours of
training to every employee.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on similar efforts at AlliedSignal, the program will be
known as Raytheon Six Sigma after the Greek letter used by
statisticians to denote deviations from the norm. (Six-sigma would
indicate fewer than four defects per million units). Burnham said
he wants to reduce manufacturing costs, impose more statistical
controls on operations and improve employee satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is improved productivity and higher profits. ``The most
productive company at the end of the day wins,'' Burnham said. The
program also fits employees' sentiments, he said. In a Dec. 1
letter to employees he wrote that ``You . . . want greater
delegation of authority, less bureaucracy, less disruption, and
more investment in training and development. I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   By making these improvements, Burnham said, the company will be
on track to grow revenue between 6 percent to 8 percent annually
over three years, and to improve earnings between 10 percent to 12
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham cautioned those goals also depend on overall defense
spending by the federal government. But analysts think Raytheon is
on track to meet projections. S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co. analyst Cai Von
Rumohr has rated the company's stock a ``strong buy'' since Burnham
was named over the summer, citing his expectations of cost cuts
from the merged defense businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, 13 analysts surveyed by Nelson's Investment Research
expected Raytheon to earn an average of $3.31 a Class B share. They
expected an increase to $3.77 a share for 1999. In 1997, earnings
were $2.20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's Class B shares closed at 56 1/8, up 7/8. Class A
shares rose 13/16 to 55 7/16.

URGING FLEXIBILITY, CLINTON OPENS SOCIAL SECURITY PARLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton urged members of both parties
Tuesday to be flexible as they seek a solution to Social Security's
long-term financial woes, but he laid out no specific proposal for
one of the most ideologically charged and politically sensitive
issues facing the country.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a two-day conference on Social Security an hour before
his legal team opened his impeachment defense on Capitol Hill,
Clinton said the country needed to have an honest debate about the
difficult choices involved in shoring up the retirement system. To
reach an agreement, he said, political leaders also had to work to
build bipartisan trust and consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' Clinton said, ``all of us in some sense will
have to sacrifice our sense of the perfect to work together for the
common good. I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to move us
forward, but let's agree we have to march together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., said the president had suggested
to him after his speech that he was willing to make a specific
proposal soon to deal with Social Security's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said Clinton had merely reiterated
his willingness to consider any strategy to increase the chances of
getting a deal. Clinton has so far avoided backing any specific
plans for fear that by doing so he would draw so much fire from
Republicans that no compromise would be possible. Republicans say
he must go first if there is to be any chance of finding common
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the conference quickly after his speech Tuesday
morning to attend the funeral in Tennessee of Albert Gore Sr., the
vice president's father. And in the day-long session that followed,
the several hundred policy analysts, academics and interest groups
engaged in the same arguments that have divided them all year.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups called for Social Security to be revamped to
include private investment accounts through which individuals would
invest in stock and bond markets. Liberal groups said the country
should not tinker in any major way with the collective system of
social insurance that has worked so well for more than six decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle was a small group looking for a means of meeting
the core principles of both sides while recognizing that any
solution would involve some combination of tax increases and
benefit cuts that would draw intense opposition from interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that individual investment plans created too much risk
and that the current system provides too much in the way of
benefits to middle and upper income people, C. Eugene Steurle, a
senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said ``a compromise position
must be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Like conservatives, many liberals see the markets as part of the
solution, but they favor having the government invest a portion of
the surplus built up by Social Security in the financial markets.
Republicans and some Democrats want to divert a portion of the 12.4
percent payroll tax that currently goes to paying guaranteed
benefits into individual investment accounts owned by each worker.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is open to the idea of individual accounts, but has not
made a decision, administration officials said. The administration
is also weighing a variety of ways to use the projected federal
budget surpluses to help prepare Social Security for the retirement
of the baby boom generation over the next few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's session brought both parties together with
administration officials to move what so far has been an academic
debate into the first tentative efforts at negotiating a political
deal. That effort will continue Wednesday, when 12 top
administration officials meet with 48 members of Congress behind
closed doors at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among the compromise proposals are several that would establish
so-called ``add-on'' individual accounts. Under such a proposal,
the current system would remain intact, financed by the 12.4
percent payroll tax. The new system would then add mandatory
private accounts for each worker, financed by an additional levy on
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not like the add-on proposals because they view
the additional levy as a tax increase, although the idea's
supporters say it would not be a tax since workers would own the
accounts into which the levies would be placed. Many Democrats do
not like the idea because it creates individual accounts. But,
packaged in the right way, supporters say, it could meet the core
principles laid out by both parties _ maintaining the current
guaranteed benefit program for Democrats, and moving toward an
individually based, investment-driven approach for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a middle ground that could accommodate the core
concerns of both sides,'' said John Rother, the public policy
director for the American Association of Retired Persons.

50 YEARS AFTER HISTORIC DOCUMENT, US STILL SEEKS RIGHTS BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the United States stands as both
guarantor and violator of the lofty ideals embodied in a document
that has inspired generations and created a new body of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Born after the barbarities of World War II, the UN General
Assembly's declaration of civil, social, political and economic
rights for all people was a feel-good measure, glorified but
largely set aside by the perceived imperatives of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Jimmy Carter's presidency that the goal of
extending human rights became an explicit objective of US foreign
policy. In the intervening two decades, US policy has swung like a
pendulum between viewing the extension of human rights as an end in
itself, and the use of human rights as a useful tool to further US
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the struggle to balance a commitment to democratic
ideals with the pragmatism required by superpower status continues,
political observers say human rights have evolved under the Clinton
administration, assuming a more secure and permanent place in
foreign policy. At the same time, however, they say policy is still
fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates are less generous, calling President
Clinton approach ``incoherent'' and ``hollow.'' They say he has
squandered his post-Cold War opportunity to lead on the issue,
hobbled at every turn by excessive concern for national security
and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   And while human rights advocates concede they have greater
access and a stronger presence than ever before in the
administration, they say they don't have influence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, they say, has continued the Cold War
practice of turning a blind eye to human rights violators that are
allies, such as Turkey and Indonesia, while being quick to condemn
violators like Cuba, Burma and Sudan, which are not. Clinton also
failed to respond quickly to genocide in Rwanda, continued human
rights abuses in China and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But his worst offense, they say, is his refusal to join the
international community in supporting the major human rights
initiatives of the decade: a ban on anti-personnel land mines and
the establishment of a permanent international criminal court.
Washington also is bucking the move to raise the minimum age of
child soldiers from 15 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still see that human rights are subjected to other
considerations,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human
Rights Watch. ``Of course, they always will be, but they don't have
to have second tier status as they do today.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials maintain that the issue of human rights
plays a major role in national security thinking, which in itself
is a sign of progress _ even if trade and security concerns
sometimes win out.
</P>
<P>
   To back this up, they cite from decisions to intervene in
Somalia and Haiti, to support for war crime tribunals after the
Rwandan genocide and the civil war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, they say, is that the administration has
reinvented a foreign policy practice that marries the global
pursuit of human rights with US political self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We increasingly appreciate that a world with governments that
respect their people is a world that is more congenial to American
interests,'' noted Eric Schwartz, senior director of the National
Security Council's multilateral and human rights affairs division.
``It's not an either/or. Promoting human rights not only reflects
our values, but it's smart as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But while human rights lobbyists believe Clinton has not been
responsive enough to their demands, the business community has the
opposite complaint: that US policy is in the thrall of ``human
rights extremists who have tried to use trade as an enforcement
mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The US government has become sanctions-happy in the past six
years,'' said Willard W. Workman, vice president of international
affairs for the US Chamber of Commerce. ``The most fundamental
right is food and shelter and the best way to secure it is through
trade and exports.''
</P>
<P>
   In Carter's day, simply talking about human rights was novel,
according to David A. Martin, profesor of law at the University of
Virginia who worked in the State Department's first human rights
bureau established by Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was continuous battle between the rest of the
State Department and the bureau, its creation was Carter's greatest
lasting contributions to the movement, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's outspoken stance on human rights abuses in places like
Chile and Argentina also saved lives, according to Eric Stover,
director of the Human Rights Center at the University of California
at Berkeley, even if his policies were sometimes inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   When President Reagan took office, his administration
immediately repudiated Carter's efforts and ``all-out war'' broke
out between the human rights community and the administration,
remembers Holly Birkhalter, advocacy director for the Boston-based
group Physicians for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, however, came to see that having a human rights agenda
helped him stake out the moral high ground during the Cold
War.However, he also equated human rights and democracy with
voting, regardless of whether basic rights such as free speech were
guaranteed, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights
Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allowed him to massively fund the Salvadoran government
and the Contras in Central America even though they were
systematically committing the most severe abuses,'' said Roth.
``But it also showed that even Reagan couldn't be oblivious to
human rights pressures, that he had to distort the facts to
maintain the facade.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's emphasis on electoralism, however, also translated into
forceful action against corrupt dictators in Haiti and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Once George Bush came to office and the Berlin Wall fell,
however, human rights lost their ideological punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush didn't do much,'' said Henry Teune, professor of
political science at the University of Pennsylvania. ``He wanted to
create an architecture of international cooperation, but human
rights was never a big part of his message.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been a priority, but human rights were used in
US efforts to marshal support for the Persian Gulf War, the
no-flight zone to protect Iraqi Kurds, and a series of innovative
international humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Clinton has borrowed from all three of his
predecessors: Carter's idealism, Reagan's electoralism, and Bush's
pragmatism. But as the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights approaches, the president's legacy appears anything
but clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has undertaken some the best initiatives ever _ and
also some of the worst,'' said Burkhalter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gregory Bestor Craig, the newly hired special White
House counsel, brought a fresh and open face, an eager-to-please
earnestness, and a sackful of secondhand contrition to the House
Judiciary Committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His political skills were evident as he took a novel tack for a
presidential lawyer and spoke in familiar, even friendly terms
about what was ``very important to get straight.'' His legal skills
were evident as he politely challenged subtle assumptions in
Republican questions and gingerly disposed of inquiries about
``intimate touching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will now push the button of my mike,'' Craig said with a
disarming grin, after nervously beginning his defense only to
discover that he was performing unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would help,'' replied a suddenly indulgent Henry Hyde,
the committee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his unslicked silver thatch and unusual willingness
to address details of accusations against Clinton, when Craig came
up against the walls of the president's legal and political box, he
would go no further _ just like any other Clinton defender.
</P>
<P>
   Did Clinton ``lie to the American people people when he said, `I
never had sex with that woman?''' asked Rep. Bob Inglis of South
Carolina, and a pained expression darted across Craig's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he doesn't believe he did,'' Craig said, embarking
on an explication of dictionary definitions of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis was not impressed. ``You're taking back all of his
apologies,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   On display Tuesday were all the attributes with which Craig, who
was hired in September, has won over once-skeptical White House
aides. But those qualities may not have worked as well on the
audience that the White House is most concerned about, the
Republican moderates who will decide the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   It was an indication of Craig's ingenuous charm that he could,
with a straight face and no whiff of irony, appeal to the hardened
members of the House's most ideologically riven committee to ``open
your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was an indication of Craig's pedigree and connections
that, according to a White House official, one of the witnesses,
Samuel Beers, taught him at Harvard College, while another, Bruce
Ackerman, taught him at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Connections brought Craig to the White House. He knew President
Clinton from his days at Yale, and was close to Hillary Rodham
Clinton. She turned over space in her suite of offices to him when
he agreed to join the defense team.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal lawyer and onetime Capitol Hill staff member who was
most recently a senior State Department official, Craig bargained
hard for authority before he accepted the White House job,
insisting that he would report directly to the president, White
House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton announced that Craig would ``quarterback'' his
defense, his new colleagues began referring rather derisively to
him as ``The QB,'' a nickname that has stuck.
</P>
<P>
   In this Arkansas-inflected White House, it did not help Craig
that he is resolutely preppy, with a fondness for sweaters and
expressions like ``varsity effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have been toast,'' one of his White House peers
reflected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for the most part, he has fit in. ``It's a real tribute
to his testament and his talent that he has gotten such universal
acceptance,'' said Paul Begala, a White House counselor.
</P>
<P>
   There is still some tension, White House aides said, between
Craig and Charles Ruff, the White House counsel. But for the most
part Craig, Ruff and David Kendall, the president's private lawyer,
have managed to divide responsibility among themselves. Any
disputes are refereed by John Podesta, the chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the monthslong divide between the political and legal
sides of Clinton's defense has been sealed up, partly because of
Craig's ability to mediate between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg comes pretty close to being fluent in both languages,''
said another senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``He's got a good political sense.''
</P>
<P>
   And his preppiness has begun to seem endearing, this aide said.
``I think that while some people in conversations with Greg might
think they'd been a member of a different fraternity than him in
college,'' he said, ``they basically like him.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeal was one reason that Craig was selected to open the
president's two-day defense before the committee.

MASSIVE POWER FAILURE HITS SAN FRANCISCO AT RUSH HOUR

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A power failure struck San Francisco at the
height of the rush hour Tuesday morning, cutting service to more
than a million people, leaving train commuters stranded under San
Francisco Bay, stalling trolleys and electric buses in the streets
and forcing businesses, some schools and the stock exchange to shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   The power went out about 8:15 a.m. PST, when a construction crew
at a transmission station in San Mateo County, south of San
Francisco, failed to remove a pipe at the right time, said Gordon
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., a subsidiary of PG&AMP;E Corp. That ``simple, human
error'' tripped a protective device that shut down an entire system
_ three major power lines _ for more than six hours.
</P>
<P>
   A 75-year-old woman crossing a city street was struck and killed
by a tractor-trailer in a hit-and-run accident that occurred
shortly after the power failure began. But Dewayne Tully, a Police
Department spokesman, said the police could not say whether the
lack of street lights caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to say whether this was caused by the power
outage,'' Tully said. ``Traffic was moving very slowly. But drivers
were probably watching each other more than pedestrians. And with
all the confusion, it's likely that the power outage was a
contributing factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The power failure trapped hundreds of people in elevators,
stranded subway and train passengers for more than an hour and
slowed downtown traffic to a crawl. Most hospitals canceled
elective surgeries, and many banks, automated teller machines and
major department stores were closed.
</P>
<P>
   No looting or other major accidents were reported. But the power
failure, which affected most of San Francisco and parts of San
Mateo County, caused massive confusion for hundreds of thousands of
people, forcing drivers back to the polite days of the four-way
stop, shutting down much of the commuter transit system and
diverting planes headed to San Francisco in the first hour of the
emergency to San Jose, Oakland, St. Louis, Seattle and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, power in San Francisco was slowly being restored,
police officers were stationed at major traffic stops and Mayor
Willie Brown had announced that ``people should just carry on life
as they did before.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people decided not to wait until the power was
restored, and turned around and went home. By midday, when
electricity had been restored to about two-thirds of San Francisco,
traffic heading out of the city was as heavy as it is in the 5
o'clock rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did not go home simply stood around outside despite
the 50-degree weather. Downtown office workers lined the streets,
smoking, drinking coffee and talking on cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Long lines formed at every ATM machine that turned on, and
stores where power had been restored had lines out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our building is mostly out, and the day is shot,'' said Reed
Jones, an independent financial analyst who works on Market Street,
the main street of the financial district, as he waited in line.
``We could use the phones, but not the computers. We're worried
that when the power comes back on, if the computers are on, they'll
fry.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E officials announced that power was restored at 2:05 p.m.,
but radio news stations later reported receiving complaints from
people who said they still had no electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Maria and Peter Krauss, tourists on their second honeymoon,
waited in a big crowd in front of Macy's in Union Square for the
store to open Tuesday afternoon. ``We're from Germany,'' Mrs.
Krauss said. ``We think this is so funny. Everybody is very polite
and orderly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Nordstrom's and the clerks were ringing up
purchases with calculators,'' Kraus said. ``I think that's a very
sophisticated approach to a crisis.''

WHITE HOUSE FAVORING EQUITY INVESTMENT TO AID SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A White House official says the Clinton
administration is ``looking favorably'' on plans to use the stock
market to raise money for the financially ailing Social Security
program, an idea that could mark a significant change in philosophy
for the national retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The development came as President Clinton, speaking while a
congressional committee debated his possible impeachment, appealed
for lawmakers to set aside all bipartisanship and come to agreement
on a financial fix for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's agree we have to march together. That's the only path to
the finish line. Our ears, our minds must remain open to any good
idea and to any person of good will,'' Clinton said in opening a
two-day White House conference that aims to prod lawmakers into
settling on a plan to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech came at an odd moment, timed just as the House
Judiciary Committee was convening for a final week of hearings
before its vote on whether to refer impeachment charges to the full
House.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say Clinton could create a lasting legacy for
himself if he guides Congress to a long-term solution for Social
Security's problems. But a House decision to send impeachment
charges to the Senate might consume the attention and good will
that is needed to reach agreement on a program as politically
sensitive as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security will hit financial problems in about three
decades, when too few workers will be paying taxes to cover the
benefits for millions of baby boom retirees. By about 2032, the
system will raise enough tax money each year to cover only about 72
percent of promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, there are only three ways to fix the problem: cut
benefits, raise taxes, or try to increase the reserves that the
system already has by investing them in the stock market or in
corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As they have for the past year, Clinton's staff said Tuesday the
White House is open to nearly all proposals. But at the same time,
Gene Sperling, a senior economic aide, said the idea of stock
investing, or seeking ``higher returns,'' has gained momentum in
White House deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no question that we are looking favorably on
options that would in some way seek to bring in higher returns,''
Sperling said. ``But I would also say that the president has not
made any final decision or locked into any proposal. But certainly
we _ as are most people in the debate _ are looking at a prudent
way there could be higher returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's comments left the White House wide latitude, as stock
investing can be made part of the Social Security system in many
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans favor the idea of allowing workers to pay some
of the 12.4 percent Social Security tax into privately owned stock
and bond accounts, rather than to the government. That would turn
Social Security into something like a giant 401(k) plan, the
tax-deferred savings program that is already available to about
half of US workers through their employers.
</P>
<P>
   But under an alternative plan, Social Security's own managers
could invest some of the system's current surplus in stocks and
corporate bonds, rather than in the Treasury bonds they now buy,
which yield about 6 percent interest. Instead of individual
accounts, Social Security as a whole would benefit if stocks rose
in value, and all workers and retirees would share the risk if they
fell in value.
</P>
<P>
   That alternative might win support from the 32 million-member
American Association of Retired Persons and from Democratic allies
like the AFL-CIO. The labor union opposes individual accounts,
saying Social Security should be an insurance program in which
workers help each other through disability and old age, not an
investment plan in which workers gain or lose according to their
own stock-picking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, one person following the White House discussions
said Clinton about six weeks ago was rumored to be favoring a plan
by economist Martin Feldstein to shore up Social Security.
Feldstein, a Harvard professor and former chief economist to
President Reagan, has proposed requiring workers to invest 2
percent of earnings _ above the current Social Security payroll tax
_ in private accounts, with the cost of those contributions
essentially offset by the federal budget surplus through tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a rumor that this was an idea that had taken on some
luster'' at the White House, the source said, and so Democratic
lawmakers and the AFL-CIO lobbied Clinton's staff to back away from
the Feldstein plan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House invited about 250 lawmakers, policy analysts,
and interest group members to Tuesday's conference, where they
heard from several panels on Social Security reform. The event
continues Wednesday, with Clinton scheduled to meet behind closed
doors with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent Republican, Representative Bill Archer, chairman
of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, Tuesday said the
process was doomed to failure. He said lawmakers would not come to
agreement unless Clinton laid down a specific plan first.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Clinton has refused to send a plan to Congress
because a similar strategy failed in 1994, when Clinton tried to
overhaul the US health care system. In addition, Archer said, the
White House fears that offering a specific plan might hurt Vice
President Al Gore's chances to become president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's decision not to submit his own Social Security
plan ``is devoid of leadership,'' Archer said. ``They're saying,
`We don't want to be criticized.' Well, if you're a leader, you
have to be prepared to be criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, spoke to the
conference in favor of private accounts, saying they were the only
way to avoid relying on tax increases or benefit cuts to shore up
Social Security. But House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt
denounced the idea as more radical than needed to fix the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daring and innovative ideas are always attractive and
interesting, but we must remember that we aren't looking for reform
for its own sake,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, director of public policy for the AARP, said he
would not be surprised if Clinton turned to the stock market as
part of his solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what Bill Clinton historically has done in
these issues, it's taking conservative mechanisms and using them to
achieve liberal ends,'' Rother said. One previous example, he said,
was Clinton's attempt in 1994 to create a system of ``managed
competition'' among health insurers to bring health insurance to
all Americans.

 By PAM BELLUCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Mayor Richard M. Daley was minutes away from giving a
speech last weekend when Gina Nikolayerich approached him with an
unrelated question. She and some neighbors wanted to turn a scrap
of land into a tiny park. Could he help?
</P>
<P>
   Eagerly, Daley pressed for details _ what neighborhood? which
block? how big? _ and then quickly summoned an aide to take down
Ms. Nikolayerich's address and telephone number. After the speech,
Joe Rucci, making a plea for a recreation program for his
neighborhood school, got the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to talk to the principal,'' Daley replied easily,
``and work something out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to suspect that the mayor was merely throwing
bones to likely voters. Especially since Tuesday, Daley, who has
run this rough-edged, electric city for nearly a decade, declared
that in 1999 he would try to win election as mayor for the fourth
time.
</P>
<P>
   But critics and close aides alike say Richard Michael Daley
loves this kind of thing, listening to the narrow problems of his
people and trying to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of keep your ear to the ground,'' Daley said in an
interview this week. ``And people are very accessible to me. They
come up and talk to me and tell me some things that sometimes I
don't like to hear, but they're going to tell me. I say, `Well
what's on your mind?', take their name and telephone number and get
somebody back to call them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the son of Richard J. Daley, the legendary Chicago political
boss and jowly, iron-fisted mayor, young Richard _ nicknamed Rich
or Little Richie or sometimes R2D2 _ faces repeated comparison with
his father. Even before his re-election announcement Tuesday, there
were those who called him Mayor for Life.
</P>
<P>
   And there are clearly a few echoes of the father in the son,
especially the apparently genetic propensity to mangle the English
language. (``I'm pro-death,'' Richard M. once said, referring to
his support of the death penalty. And ``What do you want me to do?
Take my pants off?'' he asked another time, after complaints that
he had not worked hard enough to get a candidate elected.)
</P>
<P>
   But this Richard Daley, 56, is different. And not only because
he is trimmer and moved out of his family's old neighborhood, the
white ethnic stronghold of Bridgeport. Daley has one reputation his
father never had. After inheriting a bitterly polarized city, Daley
has managed to make many of the city's minorities, including black,
Hispanic and gay people, feel acknowledged and included _ and by
extension neutralize much of their potential political opposition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coming into office after winning a 1989 special election to
serve out the term of Harold Washington, Chicago's first and only
black mayor, who died in office, Daley ultimately won the support
of most of the city's black aldermen by doling out city services
and contracts. He also made overtures to Chicago's fast-growing
Hispanic population, with economic development projects and
political posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has certainly reached out _ you see him frequenting the
black community, the Latino community,'' observed the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who said the mayor had a ``quilt, coalition-building
style.'' He added: ``He's responsive when he's called. We have
disagreements about things structural, not things personal or
petty. He's a problem solver as opposed to an antagonistic
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   That is significant coming from Jackson, who has decided to
support the only other candidate who has so far announced his
intention to seek the mayor's job: Rep. Bobby Rush, the former
Black Panther.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, 52, a Democrat like the mayor, accuses Daley of
``pinstriped patronage,'' giving contracts and tax incentives to
``a small group of cronies'' and campaign contributors. In his
election announcement, last month, Rush complained that the Daley
administration had ``mishandled economic development'' and that
``downtown grows, the Loop flourishes, while the city's
neighborhoods and communities are neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   The election, to be held on Feb. 23, is the city's first attempt
at eliminating party primaries in the mayor's race. People will be
able to vote for any candidate they want. If no candidate wins more
than 50 percent of the votes, the top two voter-getters will have a
runoff in April.
</P>
<P>
   Rush promises to be an energetic campaigner, but most political
experts give him little chance against Daley, who showed his
strength on Monday when he filed his election petition with 207,000
signatures on it _ eight times as many as required.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of opposition is simply not there,'' said Don Rose,
a longtime liberal political consultant in Chicago who has been
critical of some of Daley's policies. ``He makes a move and the
move is generally popular, and even the jagged edges of the
opposition are trimmed by it. He has smoothed it off. He's defanged
the critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, those who criticize the mayor's
well-publicized infatuation for beautifying the city, with flowers,
street lights, sidewalks and an affection for imitation wrought
iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an increasing preoccupation with the cosmetic,'' said
Jacqueline Leavy, executive director of the Neighborhood Capital
Budget Group, a consortium of 200 community organizations.
``Neighborhood areas continue to struggle, industry continues to
leave for the suburbs and our public transportation continues to
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Leavy added, ``You cannot look at this mayor without
giving him credit for things that have been done, especially the
schools.'' The schools have been a centerpiece of Daley's tenure,
and, with unprecedented power to appoint the school board and the
school system's chief executive officer, he has gradually helped
raise test scores and improve failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way you're going to keep any families in
cities is basically to improve public schools,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   While politically astute like his father, Daley is more of a
manager, chewing on an unlighted cigar while wrestling with
nuts-and-bolts problems. He has not built major structures, like
the new airport he spoke of early on, but in this flush economy he
has encouraged developers to gentrify parts of neighborhoods,
including the poor black Lawndale section, where he made Tuesday's
announcement in a brand new movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of problems in Chicago. The city's murder
rate is likely to be the highest of any major city this year. Not
enough has been done to address the brutal poverty in the housing
projects (which were started under his father's watch). And Chicago
remains one of the most segregated cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that in the interview, Daley said: ``No you have
ethnic communities. This idea that Chicago's any different from any
other city _ cities are all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents seem relatively isolated, like the handful of
protesters in a Mexican-American neighborhood who on Saturday booed
the visiting mayor and his plans to give developers tax incentives
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are some of my admirers,'' Daley mused, unruffled.
</P>
<P>
   In most of his public appearances, Daley tries to strike a
populist note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he feels compelled to speak the King's
English,'' said David Axelrod, the mayor's political consultant.
``He speaks the language of the man on the street.''

 &HT;    Florida politicians work together, create history for state
Supreme Court
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ A constitutional showdown over the makeup of the
state Supreme Court was averted Tuesday, as Florida's departing
governor and arriving governor instead made history by jointly
appointing the first black woman to that post.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Ann Quince, a native of Norfolk, Va., will move from her
seat on the Second District Court of Appeal in Tampa to replace
retiring justice Ben Overton next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud and humbled,'' said Quince, one of six children
reared on by a longshoreman father on his own. ``I will work hard
and I will do an excellent job on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles and Gov.-elect Jeb Bush both claimed the
right to name the replacement for Overton, who is scheduled to
retire the same day Bush will take office. In the end, both men
interviewed all four nominees for the job and, on Monday, quickly
agreed to pick Quince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it mine, he considers it his, we consider it
ours,'' Chiles quipped of the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsettled was the question of which governor has the legal
authority to appoint a justice in such circumstances, said Roberto
Martinez, the general counsel for Bush's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   Quince, 50, joins Barbara Pariente as the second woman on the
seven-member panel, and Leander Shaw as the second black justice.
She called her appointment ``a marvelous opportunity for all of the
citizens of the state of Florida to really see that you can work
hard and . . . that it really will pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Howard University in 1970 and earned her law
degree from the Catholic University of America in 1975. Five years
later she was interviewing with the Attorney General's Office in
Florida, a job she held for the next 13 years under Jim Smith and
Bob Butterworth. She argued death penalty cases for the state and
then ran the 25-lawyer appellate office in Tampa before being named
to the state appellate bench there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so pleased I could jump out of my skin,'' said Pete
Antonacci, who as Butterworth's deputy was Quince's boss until he
left the office last year. ``Florida wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Quince's appointment came the day after Chiles replaced retiring
justice Gerald Kogan with Miami trial lawyer R. Fred Lewis. All
Supreme Court justices, who now earn $141,000 a year, must come
from certain geographical regions, and Overton's replacement had to
come from a 14-county area of Collier County to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Chiles picked Quince over two other Tampa judges and a
Clearwater judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``One stood out above all others,'' Bush said of Quince.
``She'll make an outstanding justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Quince, accompanied at the announcement by her lawyer husband
and one of her two daughters, said she was pleased that two
governors agreed to name her and that she would try to honor her
father's advice: ``He told me two things that I have always tried
to live by, and that is to get an education and to work as hard you
can.''

MALDEN MILLS FIRE SUIT TARGETS   MAKER OF NYLON FIBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawsuit seeking damages on behalf of employees injured in the
Dec. 11, 1995, fire at Malden Mills in Lawrence, Mass. was filed
Tuesday against the manufacturer of nylon fiber used in the
building where the devastating fire apparently began.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in by lawyer Robert C. Autieri, who earlier
told a local newspaper he represented eight of 13 workers who
planned to sue E.I. du Pont de Nemours &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   A Malden Mills spokesman said du Pont, based in Wilmington,
Del., was one of two suppliers of nylon used in the textile mill's
flock upholstery division, where the fire began.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for du Pont said that ``there is no evidence that
any du Pont product caused the fire, and no one has been able to
definitively identify its cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire destroyed three buildings and caused dozens of injuries
and monetary loss of nearly $500 million, capturing worldwide
attention as Malden Mills owner Aaron M. Feuerstein, then 70,
continued to pay 3,100 idled employees for months afterward until
most of the lost facilities could be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Malden Mills spokesman Jeffery Bowman, said the company did not
expect to be cited in the personal injury lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Autieri did not return phone calls Tuesday, but, in a story
published Sunday in the Lawrence newspaper, told of his intentions
and predicted litigation could last for years.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein won national acclaim and a presidential citation as
he continued to pay employees and, before insurance claims could be
settled, dipped into his own wealth to begin designing and
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction was largely completed by late summer 1997 and
all but a handful of workers were back on the job by Labor Day that
year. However, citing weak sales, Malden Mills this year shut down
its auto upholstery division, eliminating 300 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 22 months after the blaze, investigators for the
Massachusetts fire marshal concluded it was ``most probably''
caused when tiny, airborne nylon fibers caught fire in the section
where nylon was used to make upholstery fabric.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested an electrical spark set off a dust explosion that
swept across two production lines. That fire quickly died out, but
not before setting a smaller fire which, fanned by winds, destroyed
the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said when the report was released they had uncovered
no one piece of ``absolute'' evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But they did determine that nylon dust, previously thought to
have too high an ignition point to cause a flash fire, in fact can
burn under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The US Occupational Health and Safety Administration reached a
similar conclusion and issued a warning to other mills where a
similar risk might exist. OSHA said, however, because of the prior
doubt about flammability, Malden Mills was not to blame for the
fire and had committed no safety violations.

   WASHINGTON _ ``Something is actually happening here,'' Rep. Zoe
Lofgren announced in a tone of quiet amazement, interrupting the
nation's mood of holiday bustle to voice the growing fears of House
Democrats that President Clinton could be impeached by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many in the country are not aware of that,'' the California
Democrat continued wide-eyed before the House impeachment hearing,
as if offering disturbing news just now dawning. ``They thought it
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   That it is far from over was made clear as Tuesday's marathon
impeachment hearing before the House Judiciary Committee ground
long and angry through the day and well into the night.
Presidential defenders, finally having two days to make their case,
sent in waves of panelists and stung majority Republicans with some
rough-edged denunciations of them as cowardly partisans and
``vindictive'' lame ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, in turn, accused the witnesses of defending the
indefensible in Clinton's sex-and-mendacity scandal and
rationalizing his evasions. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
committee's chairman, announced a tight gavel at the outset and
made a smiling departure for a long break at the height of the
first panel's testimony. His vice chairman, Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc., cut off witness answers in enforcing a
five-minute limit that angry Republicans often consumed in
rhetorical questions with no time left for a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not a committee vote shifted either way and, if
anything, the combative edge of some of the president's defenders
only spiked the mood of entrenched partisanship as the issue moved
toward an expected party-line impeachment vote by the committee
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans bristled when one of Clinton's most ardent
defenders, Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz,
unapologetically pronounced judgment on members who would vote for
impeachment despite being unsure of how serious the accusations
were: ``History will track you down and condemn you for your
cravenness.''
</P>
<P>
   They sat unmoved by various concessions from the president's
defenders that Clinton had been ``sinful,'' misleading, narrowly
accurate at best, blameworthy and ``maddening'' throughout the
Lewinsky scandal _ all manner of words but ``perjurious,'' the key
allegation Republicans are honing for the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   But they were viscerally moved to anger when their motives were
described as rooted in vindictiveness and ``vengeance'' by the Rev.
Robert J. Drinan of Georgetown University, a Catholic priest and
former congressman who voted as a member of the same committee 24
years ago for the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon. Drinan predicted
``an explosion of public anger'' if Clinton is impeached that would
rival the furor over the ``Saturday Night Massacre,'' when Nixon
purged Justice Department officials trying to investigate his
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you use the word `vengeance'?'' Rep. George Gekas,
R-Penn., furiously demanded of the priest.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan did not retreat and said of his characterization, ``I'll
leave God to judge that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gekas shot back, ``Then maybe God's messenger should not
prejudge.''
</P>

<P>
   Most eager in their nostalgia, the Democrats spent much of the
day reviewing the Watergate crimes and Nixon impeachment, arguing
that by misleading the nation in his sexual indiscretion, Clinton
in no way merited impeachment. After months of steeping in the
furtive tape recordings of the Clinton scandal, the nation was
treated by the Democrats to a few minutes of selected readings from
the Oval Office self-recordings of Nixon. (``Damn it, blow the safe
and get those files!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``This panel seems to be saying unless you've got the Richard
Nixon case you can't impeach anybody,'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
complained to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Steve Buyer of Indiana, added, ``We
don't have a John Dean, someone on the inside to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, a New York Democrat and
Watergate impeachment veteran, warned the committee of ``government
shutdown No. 2'' if impeachment is approved and the Senate has to
spend months putting the president on trial. ``We never intended to
create a Grand Inquisitor,'' she said of the post-Watergate
independent counsel law she helped write for investigating
presidents and cabinet officials.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fresh partisan wrangling, the long day's journey was
most notable, perhaps, for the pessimistic concessions from various
committee Democrats that impeachment is certain to be voted swiftly
by the committee, with the president's survival in a full House
floor vote far from certain next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will of the American people is about to be ignored,''
declared Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., as Clinton's defenders denied
they were stepping around the facts of his misbehavior in
repeatedly citing opinion polls registering firm opposition to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Rep. Tom Barrett of Wisconsin, argued for the
path of presidential censure but did not sound too encouraged by
the proceedings. ``I long ago gave up any hope that this chapter of
our history would have a happy ending for the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton defense argument was two pronged with warnings of
the judgment of future historians and current constituents. ``Your
reputations will be darkened,'' insisted Wilentz, the historian, to
the angry Republicans, while former Attorney General Nicholas
Katzenbach testified impeachment could never succeed without public
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vital fact,'' he told one Republican doubter, ``Those
who wish to ignore this might remember a quote from Bertolt Brecht,
which I'll paraphrase: `Maybe we should elect a new public.' ''

<P>
   Zeneca Group PLC, the third-largest British drug maker, and
Astra AB of Sweden said Tuesday that they were discussing a merger
that would be worth at least $30 billion and would create the
world's fourth-largest pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the merger would be the largest ever in the
pharmaceutical industry and would transform two second-tier drug
makers into a global powerhouse with $14 billion in sales. The
combined company would have a formidable product line, including
Astra's Prilosec, an ulcer drug that is the world's leading
prescription medication, and Zeneca's Zestril, the second-leading
hypertension remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the deal could be announced as early as
Wednesday, analysts said, continuing a sudden wave of European drug
mergers sweeping across Europe. Last week, Germany's Hoechst AG and
Rhone-Poulenc SA announced they would merge to form the globe's
second-largest drug maker, while Sanofi SA and Synthelabo, both of
France, agreed two days later to combine in a $10.4 billion stock
swap.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be a merger of equals and would divide
the key management positions between the two companies. Analysts
confirmed Tuesday that Haaken Mogren, Astra's chairman, would be
the chairman of the combined company, and Tom McKillop, Zeneca's
chief executive, would retain that post. A spokeswoman for Zeneca
declined to comment on the new company's proposed management
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that Zeneca and Astra would combine won applause
from analysts and investors. Trading in the companies' American
depository receipts was halted Tuesday, but not before Zeneca's
ADRs had increased $4.25, to $45. Astra's ADRs rose $3.625 before
being halted at $21.875.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the two companies combine, they will have a good
management team and a strong pipeline,'' said Tom Brakel, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical investment
research firm in New York. ``By pooling their resources, they can
be even stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is completed, it will end one of the most bizarre
episodes to take place in a pharmaceutical merger. In March, Mogren
shocked the pharmaceutical industry by announcing to Swedish
newspapers that he wanted to merge Astra with a company of similar
size. Raising industry eyebrows further, he went on to name Zeneca,
Schering-Plough of the United States and Germany's Bayer AG as
ideal partners, a remark that sent all three stocks spiraling.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at pharmaceutical companies are generally as well
versed in politeness as well as pills, making Mogren's remarks
particularly surprising. David Barnes, the chairman of Zeneca,
dismissed Mogren's comments by repeatedly stressing that he was not
interested in a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, however, Barnes reversed his position,
stating in a telephone interview that he was indeed ``open'' to a
merger. He refused to identify a potential partner.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the remark surprised several analysts in Europe,
they thought Barnes had become more receptive to a merger after he
saw how the proposed deal between American Home Products and
Monsanto would have challenged Novartis' lead in agricultural
products. That deal collapsed in October.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted Tuesday that Mogren had been under intense
pressure from the Wallenberg family, which owns about 12 percent of
Astra's stock, to improve the company's return. Last year, Astra's
stock price was up only 10 percent, compared with a 42 percent gain
for the Standard &AMP; Poor's health-care index.
</P>
<P>
   One particular hindrance to a merger for Astra was its joint
venture with Merck to sell Prilosec in the United States. Under the
terms of the arrangement, Merck could have gained sales and
marketing rights to any products resulting from a merger. In June,
Mogren paid Merck about $7 billion to end the deal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts were happy with Mogren as chairman, even though most
thought he would serve largely as the company's statesman while
McKillop would position the company as a more effective player,
especially in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Zeneca and Astra would be the world's fourth-largest
drug seller, with $9.54 billion in sales _ ahead of Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and American Home Products _ its presence
in the United States would be relatively small. The two companies
have only 11,300 employees in the United States, about one-ninth of
the number Johnson &AMP; Johnson has.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts think that Zeneca and Astra would have enough
top-selling drugs to spark some sales momentum in the United
States. Astra should have Perprazole, an improved version of
Prilosec, on the market by 2000, while Zeneca has products in
several profitable drug classes. Aside from Zestril, Zeneca makes
Accolate for asthma and Zomig, a leading migraine medication.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think that the likely alliance between Zeneca and Astra
will spark more deals and stoke merger speculation on both
continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't ask, `Which company is going to be next?''' said
Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners. ``It's better to ask,
`Who's not going to be next?' Now everybody wants to play.''

ECKERSLEY FACES CAREER DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dennis Eckersley, cut loose by the Red Sox Monday, will
decide by next week whether he intends to continue his playing
career, his attorney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, 44, had said last month that he was leaning strongly
toward coming back in 1999, but only with the Red Sox and only if
he felt his right shoulder was healthy again; Eckersley spent seven
weeks on the disabled list last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the deadline for teams to offer their free agents
salary arbitration or lose the right to re-sign them until May 1,
Eckersley met with Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette in the
Boston offices of the player's attorney, Jack Sands. Duquette
informed Eckersley that the club had decided not to bring him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was very forward, very straight up,'' Sands said Tuesday.
``Dan said the team was looking at people for Dennis's position
that could help the club for more than one year, so they were going
to explore other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Dennis's age, what have you, he wasn't surprised, but he
was slightly disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley has expressed an interest in broadcasting, and this
fall did some work on ESPN during the World Series. If he elects to
retire _ a strong possibility _ he would probably have interest in
talking to the Sox about a broadcasting role, but will most likely
have to wait until the team's TV affiliation is determined.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Eckersley were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander had signed with the Red Sox last winter because
he wanted to end his career in the city where he made his home.
Originally slated to be a ``co-closer'' with Tom Gordon, Eckersley
quickly fell out of that role after a rough spring training, and
did not pitch well in the first weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed on the disabled list June 4 with a strained
posterior rotator cuff in his right shoulder, and did not return
until July 24. Reduced for the most part to pitching in mop-up
situations or to just a batter or two, Eckersley ran off 17
straight scoreless appearances between Aug. 13 and Sept. 17, and on
Sept. 26 in Fenway Park against the Orioles he broke Hoyt Wilhelm's
major league record by making his 1,071st career appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But in his last three appearances in Fenway Park, Eckersley gave
up home runs, including a blast to Manny Ramirez in Game 3 of the
Division Series that proved to be decisive in a 5-4 loss to the
Indians. His regular-season ERA in Fenway Park was 7.48.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Eckersley was 4-1 with 1 save and a 4.76 ERA, a
dramatic comedown for a future Hall of Famer who has 390 career
saves, second all-time to Lee Smith (478), and 197 career wins.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he might be at the end, Eckersley said
last month he still had the desire to compete. If he does, it won't
be with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to sit back and evaluate his options,'' Sands said.
``By next week, he'll make a decision what his plan is for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues facing Duquette this winter is the need to
replenish the bullpen. He's set at closer with Gordon, and has two
above-average setup men in Jim Corsi and Derek Lowe. But the Sox
have only one experienced lefty, Ron Mahay, after Greg Swindell
signed as a free agent with Arizona. Also, Rich Garces (``El
Guapo'') was released, and Dario Veras was claimed on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette also is in the market for starting help, especially a
lefthander, after the team cut ties with three lefties Monday _free
agents Steve Avery, Butch Henry, and Pete Schourek, none of whom
were offered arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball winter meetings begin Friday in Nashville, where
Duquette's top priority will be to find a slugger to compensate for
the loss of Mo Vaughn. But there were strong indications Tuesday
that the market may be a tight one. White Sox GM Ron Schueler has
told confidants that Frank Thomas won't be available, and Marlins
GM Dave Dombrowski, Expos GM Jim Beattie, and Dodgers GM Kevin
Malone are disinclined to trade Cliff Floyd, Rondell White, and
Raul Mondesi, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk that the Braves, who signed free agent outfielder
Brian Jordan, might be willing to move outfielder/first baseman
Ryan Klesko, but in any major deal the Sox make, they almost
certainly will be asked to surrender Lowe, whom the Sox project as
having a big future.

JAPANESE SCIENTISTS REPORT SUCCESS IN CLONING CALVES FROM ADULT
COWS 
</HEADLINE>
 (htv) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Japan have cloned eight calves from cells they
gathered from a slaughterhouse, creating eight identical copies of
a single cow. Though half of the calves died, some biologists say
the results indicate that the cloning of cows may be at least as
efficient as in vitro fertilization with these animals.
</P>
<P>
   Cows are the third adult animal to be cloned. The first was a
lamb named Dolly whose birth was announced in February 1997. She
had been cloned from an udder cell.
</P>
<P>
   Then came mice, announced last July. And suddenly cloning, which
just two years ago had been thought biologically impossible, is
looking like it might be entirely feasible, if not easy, according
to cloning experts.
</P>
<P>
   It still seems surprising to some scientists. After all, an
adult cell, like an udder cell, has reached its final destiny in
the body and under normal circumstances never changes into
something else. But with cloning, an adult cell would have to
reverse its development somehow and become an early embryo cell,
able to direct the development of an entirely new animal that was
the identical twin of the adult that provided the original cell.
</P>
<P>
   But now, ``cloning is becoming routine,'' said Dr. R. Michael
Roberts, a professor of animal physiology at the University of
Missouri and the chief scientist for the Department of
Agriculture's competitive grants program in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A paper by the Japanese scientists, led by Dr. Yukio Tsunoda of
Kinki University in Nara, Japan, describing their cloning of a cow,
will be published on Friday in the journal Science. Science lifted
its usual restrictions on announcing the results before publication
of the scientific paper after The Express in London wrote about the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Tsunoda and the others say that one reason to clone cattle would
be to reproduce exact copies of animals that are superb producers
of meat or milk. In fact, said Roberts, on a recent visit to Japan
he saw a calf that other researchers asserted they had cloned from
cells taken from the ear of a prize bull. The scientists who
created that clone have not yet published their results, Roberts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that several Japanese groups say they are
successfully cloning adult cows and bulls, although Tsunoda's group
is the first to publish results. Dr. Randall Prather, a cloning
researcher at the University of Missouri, said that he and others
are predicting that more than 50 calves that are clones of adults
born in Japan by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But what surprised many cloning experts was not just the fact
that a cow was cloned but the ease with which Tsunoda's group
accomplished its task.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is true, it's startling,'' said Dr. Barry Zirkin, a
reproductive biologist at Johns Hopkins University School of
Hygiene and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the cloning process, the Japanese scientists gathered
two types of cells from a Japanese beef cow whose entrails had been
discarded in a slaughterhouse: cumulus cells, which cling to eggs
and nurse them, and cells from the lining of the cow's Fallopian
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then they used these cells to create embryos, slipping either a
cumulus or Fallopian tube cell into another cow's egg from which
the genetic material had been removed. The researchers attempted to
add cumulus cells to 99 cow's eggs, of which 47 took up the cumulus
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the resulting embryos survived in the laboratory for
eight to nine days until they were ready to be transferred to
surrogate mothers. With the Fallopian tube cells, the researchers
used 150 eggs, got 94 of them to take up cells, and ended up with
28 embryos. Tsunoda's group transferred 10 of their 46 embryos to
cows that could serve as surrogate mothers. Eight calves were born.
Four of the calves died at or soon after birth; the others survived
and appear perfectly normal, the scientists state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In contrast, when Dolly was created, Dr. Ian Wilmut and his
colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Scotland began with more than
400 eggs, ended up with just 29 embryos that they could transfer to
surrogate mothers and just one live lamb, Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese investigators assert that although half of their
calves died, the deaths appeared to have nothing to do with the
fact that they were clones. One died of pneumonia stemming from
heat stroke, two others died from aspirating large amounts of
amniotic fluid at birth, the fourth died from complications during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say they are not convinced those four calves
were entirely normal. Nonetheless, they say, they are impressed
with the astonishing efficiency of the cow cloning _ 80 percent of
the embryos transferred to surrogate mothers survived until birth.
With in vitro fertilization, said Dr. George Seidel, an animal
physiologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, about 50
percent of transferred embryos survive until birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great results, no doubt about it,'' said Dr. Mark
Westhusin, a reproductive physiologist at Texas A&AMP;M University who
is working on the cloning of cattle and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, scientists say, there is much more work to be done to
understand how cloning works, and why. But, some say, with
successful cloning in three species, and with the process becoming
more efficient exponentially, it is hard to doubt that humans will
be cloned, sooner rather than later. Others urge caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible with humans? Perhaps,'' Zirkin said. ``But I'm
not sure this speaks to that. Different species are just very very
different. And the ethical issues on whether it should be tried
remain the exactly the same. Until those issues are appropriately
debated and discussed, it would be a mistake to think in those
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dr. Lee Silver, a molecular biologist at Princeton
University, he already knows of two qualified fertility specialists
who want to clone. And so, he says, ``anyone who thinks that things
will move slowly is being very naive.''

MAN IN THE NEWS: HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
VENEZUELA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With his landslide victory Sunday securing
his place as the next president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez Frias
might have been expected to smooth over the tracks of his first
attempt to storm the presidential palace here, in 1992, in case
other revolutionaries got the same idea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he highlighted the failed coup, along with the day he
left prison two years later. ``What we're living through in
Venezuela is the continuation of February 4, 1992,'' Chavez told
crowds of euphoric supporters, many sporting his trademark
military-style red beret, who had turned out to revel in the
triumph of the man they call ``El Commandante.''
</P>
<P>
   There was good reason for Chavez to celebrate the doomed revolt.
For the 44-year-old former paratrooper, the coup forged his
credentials as the undeniable outsider, whose day would come as
Venezuela's economy sank deeper and its people grew more doubtful
of the traditional ruling class.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's victory has opened not so much a new page, as a new
tome, in Venezuelan politics. At a time when the rest of Latin
America has been moving largely toward streamlining the role of
government and selling off state assets, Chavez speaks of
subordinating the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, to
domestic priorities, and asks whether $9 billion earmarked for
operations and investment by the oil company should not go to shore
up decaying schools and hospitals instead.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez soared to victory on fiery rhetoric that promised fry the
heads of traditional political bosses but he immediately soften his
message upon victory to persuade investors that Venezuela was still
safe for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in the first day of trading after the election, the
tiny Caracas stock exchange jumped a record 22 percent and the
currency strengthened against the dollar after a long slide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez failed to overthrow former President Carlos Andres
Perez, the coup succeeded in other ways: it took the place of party
machinery and war chests, celebrity endorsements and hours of
campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he languished in prison, the mystique grew of the
restless lieutenant colonel condemned for trying to destroy a
system that many Venezuelans recognized as rotted but felt
powerless to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seen as someone who told the truth about the system,''
said one diplomatic analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after President Rafael Caldera freed Chavez _ in a bid
to deflate the commandante's swelling popularity _ Chavez created
his Fifth Bolivarian Movement and began taking his war on
corruption to the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   The son of school teachers who grew up poor in the state of
Barinas, he surrounded himself with a contradictory klatch of
right-wing nationalists from the military and other figures hailing
from the left.
</P>
<P>
   With such an odd mix, some political analysts thought he would
go nowhere. Last December, opinion polls showed him with less than
12 percent support among likely voters. But slowly, perhaps even
unconsciously, his red-bereted image was moving in from the
fringes, to dominate the political scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people hadn't counted on was the real depth of disgust
Venezuelans had for traditional politics,'' said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel also benefited from a souring economy and a beauty
queen's mistakes. Until last spring, Irene Saez, a former Miss
Universe, had been leading in voter surveys, peaking at 35.7
percent to Chavez's 20.6 percent. Then the price of oil, which
underpins Venezuela's entire economy, fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from an optimistic country to a pessimistic one, with
expectations that things will get worse,'' said Luis Vicente Leon,
director of the Datanalysis polling agency. The following month,
Miss Saez accepted a luke warm endorsement from one of the two
traditional parties. The backing compromised her claims to being an
outsider and her popularity ratings slid into the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it was the turn of Henrique Salas Roemer, a former
governor of Carabobo State, educated at Yale. Salas, 62, climbed
aboard a white horse, called Frijolito, or Little Bean, for
campaign rallies. But his claims to being a warrior for the people
also weakened with a last-minute endorsement from the major
parties. Salas rode Frijolito through the streets of Caracas for
his final rally.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the final vote, Chavez, who was frequently criticized
for altering his positions depending on his audiences, succeeded in
capturing some 40 percent of the upper and middle-class vote, on
top of his bedrock support among the poor, said Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez plans to hold a referendum Feb. 15 to rewrite the
Constitution, which some political opponents fear could be a
mechanism for concentrating power in his office.
</P>
<P>
   While Chavez gives voice _ and a roaring one at that _ to
Venezuela's downtrodden, some fear that populist economic policies
will set the clock back here.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez spoke out against privatizing health care, which he
called ``the right of all Venezuelans,'' and has raised the
prospect of a debt moratorium or a grace period for foreign debt,
which he said amounts to 40 percent of the national budget. He has
vowed to raise the minimum wage of just under $200 a month, which
covers only half the cost of the standard food basket for a
family's minimal nutritional needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, he's going to try to deliver on his campaign
promises,'' said Robert Bottome, a publisher of VenEconomy
newsletters, ``The economy will go into a big tailspin and then the
question is, what does he do?''

NBA CANCELS ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With dwindling hope of seeing any games soon, the NBA Tuesday
canceled the one singular attraction in its schedule that has
absolutely nothing to do with basketball: the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern officially deep-sixed the Feb. 14
marketing vehicle scheduled for Philadelphia, blaming it on nothing
more than the ``inexorable march of the calendar.'' In other words,
the no-end-in-sight lockout made it impossible for Stern to assure
what he called his ``business partners'' that they could raise
their corporate banners during the Valentine's Day Weekend while
toasting the Gimmick Games on Saturday and the hideous contest
itself on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stern did say, however, that Philly will get first dibs on the
2002 game; the next two already have been earmarked for Oakland and
Washington. That's assuming there are seasons. This marks the first
time since 1951 that there will be no All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters, the commissioner and
aide-de-camp Russ Granik sounded more resigned than ever to losing
the entire season, although neither would offer a drop-dead date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with the ramifications of losing the first part
of our season,'' the commissioner said. ``We understand fan
reaction, sponsor reaction, network reaction, and licensee
reaction. It has been overwhelmingly negative and it will be
geometrically worse if the season goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game is the latest casualty of the lockout, now
into its sixth month with nothing promising on the horizon. There
are no negotiation sessions scheduled with the players, whose
latest response to the lockout has been to schedule an exhibition
game in Atlantic City Dec. 19 for their down-on-their-luck
brethren. The sides are far apart on the apparently irresolvable
issue of how to split approximately $2 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stern did say that he did not think the season could start by
mid-January even with an imminent settlement, given all the issues
still unresolved and the need for training camps. He said that he
didn't feel the league would start a season in February and Granik
indicated that there was perhaps 10 days of wiggle room in June to
extend the Finals. He said extending the season into July was ``not
a realistic possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said, ``Our focus now will be to see if there is a season
to salvage without an All-Star Game. Our goals remain the same: to
sit down and try and negotiate a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The freeing up of four days in February, however, does not help
the league in rescheduling games. Granik said every NBA arena with
the exception of the one in Philadelphia is booked on Saturday
night, the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Should a season be saved, Stern said, it is probably inevitable
that teams would play games on three consecutive nights, a no-no
for years. Granik said there would likely be an unbalanced schedule
and added, ``Not every team is going to see every other team at
home. That's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern again rejected mediation as an option, saying there has
been plenty of dialogue, if not agreement. Asked why the league
simply didn't declare an impasse, end the lockout, and impose its
own working conditions, Stern said there were two problems with
that. The first is that returning players could strike at any time.
The second is that they could take legal action, as was the case in
baseball.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it focusing by spreading out.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's multibillion-dollar pact between AT&AMP;T, the nation's
largest communications carrier, and IBM, the No. 1 computer
company, was AT&AMP;T's fourth major deal this year. In each, C.
Michael Armstrong, who signed on as chairman just 13 months ago,
has moved his company into a new area of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, AT&AMP;T Corp. has agreed to spend more than $43
billion in cash and stock to acquire a big local communications
carrier and the nation's No. 2 cable television operation. It also
forged a $10 billion international joint venture with British
Telecommunications PLC.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in a deal that was hammered out under the code name
Project Double Helix, AT&AMP;T is set to spend $5 billion in cash for
one of the best global data-communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   While all the deals might seem to be pulling AT&AMP;T in haphazard
new directions, the company has actually narrowed its business
sharply in the last few years. As recently as the early 1990s, AT&AMP;T
was far more than a communications company. It made telephones. It
ran satellites. It made computers. It sold credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   All those operations are now gone _ and prospering after the
spinoffs. Stock of NCR Corp., once AT&AMP;T's computer arm, has vastly
outperformed AT&AMP;T's shares this year, and Lucent Technologies Inc.,
once AT&AMP;T's communications-equipment unit, now has a market value
larger than AT&AMP;T's. In their place, the company has added units
selected to advance a single mission: providing communications
services, though in a broader fashion than at any time in AT&AMP;T's
history.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a paradox of the information age. Even as all
sorts of high-technology products seem set to converge into one
digital service and one digital economy, many of the companies that
actually provide ``this stuff,'' as Unisys Corp. has taken to
calling it, are actually de-converging themselves, zooming in on
what they do best and shedding the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The market certainly endorsed that concept Tuesday, and on a
generally pessimistic day for stocks. On the New York Stock
Exchange, AT&AMP;T's shares, the most widely owned in the nation, rose
$2.25, to $67. Shares of IBM, which hopes to sharpen its own focus
by shedding its network, rose $1, to $168.18.
</P>
<P>
   To people outside the technology world, the difference between
designing and running big communications systems (like AT&AMP;T) on the
one hand and making computers and running big data warehouses (like
IBM) on the other might not seem much of a difference at all. But
they are essentially separate industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much believe that technology is promoting the
convergence of communications, of computing, information, of
entertainment, of data,'' Armstrong said Tuesday in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, he added: ``It's a matter of being able
to deploy resources. The growth of the industry is so great that no
company could encompass all the elements.''
</P>
<P>
   That realization had dawned on both parties to the sale. By
selling its communications grid, IBM will get out of a business
that just a few years ago it saw as vital. Instead, Big Blue will
concentrate on consulting and making and managing big computers.
AT&AMP;T will serve not only IBM's existing communications customers
but IBM's corporate communications needs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, while AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire IBM's network for $5
billion, it also agreed to turn over to IBM more than 2,000 of its
own employees and to hire IBM to handle its software operations and
to run its massive computer centers, which handle millions of
customer records. Those are corporate functions that for decades
AT&AMP;T insisted on performing in-house.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the deal said that the code name Project
Double Helix was meant to convey a perfect fit. But it could also
convey an unraveling and recombination of the companies' basic
blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Tuesday that AT&AMP;T had been planning for several
years to outsource its computer operations, but the prospect of
winning the auction for IBM's network accelerated those plans, at
least partially.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come full circle,'' said Howard Anderson, managing
director of the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in
Boston. ``It was only four years ago that AT&AMP;T was offering to
manage your data center and IBM was offering to manage your
network. Now it's stick to your knitting. Both companies have
pretty much grown out of the idea that they can be in the other
guy's business and be all things to all people. IBM knows more
about running computers, and no one knows more about running
networks than AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM also faced the prospect of spending millions, perhaps
billions, to keep its network current with the latest advances in
Internet-based data communications.
</P>
<P>
   At one time making big bets like that made sense for IBM. When
the computer giant began assembling its network in the late 1970s,
there was no such thing as a global data communications network.
National phone monopolies prevented companies from moving into each
other's territory. IBM, however, had deployed mainframe computers
all over the world for big corporations, and those corporations
wanted those computers to communicate with one another. So IBM
patched together a network of its own, relying on as many as 1,000
phone companies around the world for the transmission of
information from one point to another.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Carden, a consultant for Renaissance Worldwide, a
consulting firm based in Boston, said that IBM served an essential
function (and could charge for it) in getting all of the world's
different network languages to work together. But now, as
deregulation frees big phone companies to expand around the globe
and as the world moves toward relatively simple data communications
standards based on the Internet, it makes less sense for IBM to
invest in upgrading its systems
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Jr.,
said: ``We decided, in a sense, we don't want to compete with our
customers, and it doesn't make sense for us to make that investment
when the telecommunications companies whose core competencies it is
are going to make it. Building networks and managing networks are
not our core competency.''
</P>
<P>
   John McKinley, chief technology officer for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
can certainly understand that reasoning. Merrill Lynch is just the
sort of big corporate customer that every high-technology company
wants for a client _ and it uses IBM to manage its computer centers
and AT&AMP;T to manage its communications network.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about succeeding today in the service economy,
you need scale and you need specialization,'' McKinley said. ``I
think this latest transaction lets both IBM and AT&AMP;T enhance their
core competencies. I think it gives them more focus.''

UNDECIDED MODERATES ARE CAREFULLY LISTENING TO CLINTON'S DEFENSE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican moderates, the largest bloc of undecided
votes on impeachment in the House, said that President Clinton's
first day of defense on Tuesday may have slowed what had seemed to
be growing momentum behind a vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those moderates said that Tuesday's testimony left
unanswered many of their most pressing questions about the
president's behavior and his fitness to govern, and they urged
Clinton or his allies to provide a sharper, less evasive
explanation of his actions in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he eroded his credibility to the point where he can't
govern?'' asked Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. ``There is nothing that
addressed that today. For the core issues that are at the heart of
this for me, today's hearing wasn't on point.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such concerns, a leading moderate Republican, Rep. Amo
Houghton from Corning, N.Y., decided that he would vote against
impeachment on the House floor. Houghton would become the sixth
House Republican to say publicly that he opposed impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is how to heal, rather than further divide, the
nation,'' Houghton said in an op-ed article to be published in the
New York Times on Wednesday. ``Of course morals and decency and the
laws we live by are all important. But can anyone argue that these
threads are made stronger if we dismiss someone from office instead
of issuing a strong rebuke?''
</P>
<P>
   A centrist Democrat who had voted in favoring of opening an
impeachment inquiry into the president also said on Tuesday that he
was leaning against impeachment. The Democrat, Rep. Jim Maloney of
Connecticut, said that Republicans who have been demanding that
Clinton admit that he lied before a grand jury were asking for the
impossible: that the president admit to a crime. ``It's in effect a
trick question,'' Maloney said. ``They want him to admit to
something on the basis that that will solve all of our little
problems. But they are asking him to step into a criminal
prosecution two years hence. That's the kind of partisan posturing
that is counter-productive.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the White House's two-day presentation before the
Judiciary Committee is aimed mainly at winning over the three dozen
or so moderate Republicans who remain undecided about impeachment.
Many of those moderates come from districts where Clinton did well
in the 1996 election and where sentiment for impeaching him is
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those moderates have said that they consider the
president's behavior abhorrent, but that they would prefer a less
severe punishment than impeachment. So they have been waiting for
the president's team to present a vigorous defense before the
Judiciary Committee that could provide arguments, facts or shreds
of new evidence that could justify bucking their leadership and
voting against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear they got what they were looking for on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am desperately looking for a reason that it can be explained
away,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., referring to Clinton's
misleading statements about the Lewinsky affair. ``I just wish the
president had gone before the committee. No one speaks better for
Bill Clinton than himself. I just wish he'd spent more time
explaining himself than having his attack dogs go after these
issues.''

MODERATE VOICES TO SPEAK FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld, who
once described his role during the Watergate hearings as a ``swing
man,'' will perform a similiar task Wednesday as a witness for
President Clinton before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, who was an associate minority counsel for the Judiciary
Committee in 1974, returns as somewhat of a mystery witness: His
name was excluded from the original list of 14 people tapped by the
White House to testify while a conflict with his schedule was
worked out. Weld's participation was confirmed Tuesday by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican who headed the Justice Department's criminal
division under President Reagan, Weld is the prototype of the GOP
moderate considered vital to Clinton's efforts to avoid being
impeached. In an interview in 1978 about his Watergate involvement,
he said: ``I was a swing man. The Republican who got along best
with the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld is being summoned to appeal to those 20 to 30 undecided
House Republicans the White House is targeting in its defense
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have tried to make this a party line. He speaks up
as a Republican and says there are other issues of consideration,''
said White House communications director Ann Lewis. ``He is an
example of a Republican getting elected governor in Massachusetts
and being held up as a real example by members of his party, as a
success story, and he can talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld may find some common ground with the clutch of undecided
Republican moderates whose votes may largely decide whether Clinton
is impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Like Weld, many of them hail from northeastern states, primarily
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The New York group is
especially large, including Representatives John McHugh, Rick A.
Lazio, Michael P. Forbes, Benjamin Gilman, and Sherwood Boehlert.
</P>
<P>
   But some undecides also hail from California, Ohio, Michigan and
Iowa. They include Representatives Brian P. Bilbray of California
and Jim Leach of Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee,
both of whom represent districts that voted for Clinton in 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray barely survived a stiff challenge, 49 percent to 46.4
percent, in last month's election from his Democratic challenger,
San Diego City Council member Christine Kehoe.
</P>
<P>
   Though several GOP moderates represent districts that twice
voted for Clinton, not all of them do. Boehlert's mostly rural
district in upstate New York, for example, went for President
George Bush in 1992 and Clinton in 1996. And the congressman
coasted to victory last month with about 80 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several undecided House members said through their aides Tuesday
that they were reserving judgment until the Judiciary Committee
finishes its job, while others were not tipping their hand until
the matter goes to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really is keeping her own counsel on this thing,'' said
Mary Anne Leary, a spokeswoman for Representative Constance A.
Morella of Maryland. ``She wants to have her own head on straight.
She doesn't want our suggestions or thoughts to influence her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands firmly in the middle,'' said Suhail Khan, a
spokesman for Representative Tom Campbell of California. ``He's not
going to make up his mind until it's all over; he wants the inquiry
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two undecided Republicans, Representatives Michael N.
Castle of Delaware and McHugh of New York, attended the annual
Congressional Ball at the White House on Monday night. McHugh wrote
Clinton a letter Sunday saying he hoped the White House lawyers
would stick to refuting the specific charges against Clinton rather
than attacking the process during their two-day defense this week.
</P>
<P>
   McHugh never got a response to his letter from the White House,
but Tuesday he watched the committee hearings sporadically from his
home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a former prosecutor, watched the hearings intermittenly
from his home on Long Island. ``He feels the White House's
remorseful comments today were welcomed, but it might be a matter
of too little too late, though he is going to wait and see,'' said
his spokeswoman, Emily Miller.
</P>
<P>
   This small group of Republicans are ``critically important'' to
Clinton, said White House spokesman James Kennedy. ``They can spell
the difference between impeachment and no impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moderates, including Representatives Jack Quinn and Peter
T. King, both of New York; John Edward Porter of Illinois and Mark
Edward Souder of Indiana, have already come out against
impeachment. Amo Houghton of New York is expected to announce
Wednesday that he also will oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's advent at the hearing makes the White House strategy of
appealing to these swing vote all the more apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing in Weld is a symbol of bringing in the middle
moderate position in the Republican Party.'' said James A. Thurber,
director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies
at American University. ``I don't know whether it will influence
anybody, but it certainly will not hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld, who has been a friend of the Clintons since he worked with
Hillary Rodham Clinton on the staff of the Judiciary Committee
during the Watergate investigation, has said he was ``repelled'' by
Clinton's behavior in the Lewinsky matter and described it as
``horrible, horrible conduct.'' But Weld said he did not think
Clinton's lying about an affair with a White House intern rose to
the level of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Weld did not return phone calls Tuesday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Weld will be part of a six-person
panel discussing ``prosecutorial standards for obstruction of
justice and perjury.'' He is expected to make the final
presentation on the panel, just before White House counselor
Charles F.C. Ruff makes his closing argument against impeaching the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's last foray on Capitol Hill was during his aborted attempt
to become ambassador to Mexico last year after Clinton nominated
him for the post. His efforts were derailed by conservative
Republicans, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms of North Carolina.

CLINTON'S LAWYERS PUT OLD ARGUMENTS IN NEW BOTTLES

<P>
   The edges were rounded and the arguments were more finely honed,
but at bottom the defense offered by President Clinton's team
Tuesday was essentially old legal arguments in new bottles.
</P>
<P>
   He did not commit perjury, although he misled.
</P>
<P>
   He did not obstruct justice, although he sinned.
</P>
<P>
   And, whatever he did or didn't do, none of his actions warranted
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers did offer a more detailed and serious
effort to rebut the impeachment charges referred to Congress by
Kenneth Starr and repackaged by the House Judiciary Committee's
chief counsel, David Schippers. In a 184-page legal brief, they
provided lengthy and specific denials to the charges that the
president perjured himself, obstructed justice and abused the
powers of his office.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a first, marathon day of testimony, the results of
this last- stand defense appeared to be mixed. The more specific
and detailed rebuttal to the impeachment charges appeared to quell
mounting criticisms from Republicans, particularly the Judiciary
Committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., that the president
was arrogantly refusing to address ``the facts'' arrayed against
him. At the beginning of the day, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
criticized the White House for a witness list that was top-heavy
with legal experts instead of witnesses with first-hand knowledge
of the evidence. ``I'm disappointed that there are no fact
witnesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some Judiciary Republicans, White House lawyer Gregory
Craig's genial manner also appeared to be a welcome tonic to the
more combative style of the president's personal lawyer, David
Kendall. Kendall's aggressive cross-examination of Starr before the
committee last month amounted to an attack on the independent
counsel rather than a defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The impassioned arguments of several panels of historians,
eminent lawyers and former members of the Judiciary Committee, did
not appear to change the minds of the panel's members.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the first panel of lawyers and historians, Rep.
George Gekas, R-Pa., clearly disagreed with the witnesses'
conclusions. ``All of these could be impeachable,'' he said,
calling perjury ``a direct affront to the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   It will fall to Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, to make a
comprehensive rebuttal to the impeachment charges in his closing
arguments Wednesday. But the 184-page brief will be the backbone of
his 90-minute summation.
</P>
<P>
   The brief takes apart the case for impeachment piece by piece,
offering strong and detailed denials that the president committed
perjury, obstructed justice or abused the powers of his office. It
also blasts Starr and the Judiciary Committee for purposely
mischaracterizing the president's testimony and leaving out 11
pieces of exculpatory evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Craig picked up some of these themes in his public testimony,
but Republican members of the Judiciary panel pressed him hard on
the issue of whether or not the president lied.
</P>
<P>
   His answers evoked the same incredulity and anger that Clinton's
critics expressed last August, when he decided to admit to an
``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Monica Lewinsky, but
had denied the affair under oath during his deposition in the Paula
Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit. Craig continued to insist
Tuesday that the president believed his denials were truthful.
</P>
<P>
   The president's insistence that he did not commit perjury rests
on the same legalisms that have enraged his critics for months. In
the legal brief and in Craig's testimony, the president's lawyers
argued, as they have for months, that Clinton believed that sexual
relations meant sexual intercourse. Since he and Ms. Lewinsky did
not have sexual intercourse, the president believed he was giving
the Jones legal team and Starr's investigators a truthful denial of
having had sexual relations. It was clear this explanation did not
satisfy the majority of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Craig termed the president's testimony ``evasive, incomplete,
misleading, even maddening, but it was not perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may judge he crossed the line,'' Craig said. ``But in fact
there is no testimony, no proof, that President Clinton knew he was
wrong ... and intentionally lied.'' He added that the president had
moved last summer to correct his misleading public denial in
January of a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and that he had
admitted to egregious conduct and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Although they seemed to appreciate Craig's willingness to
address the specific evidence against the president, Republicans
still expressed irritation throughout the day over the White
House's legal semantics.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the afternoon, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,
warned Craig, ``Don't give me word games.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., pressed Craig to the wall on whether
the president had lied to the American people when he said he had
never had sex with ``that woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not believe that he did,'' Craig responded. ``He does
not believe he lied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing thing,'' Inglis groused. ``You are taking
back all of his apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., also was clearly unpersuaded by
Craig's colloquy on how the president's evasions did not amount to
perjury. ``How could his testimony be those things without being a
lie?'' he asked incredulously.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most people who grew up in postwar America, China
was invisible. One of the world's poorest, most populous and
politically most powerful countries, it was certainly
(italics)there,(end italics) but only as an enigma, a
four-million-square-mile Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the outside (the superstition ran) could get in; no
one on the inside could get out. A battened-down version of Marxist
communism, culminating in the fanaticism of the Cultural Revolution
of the 1960s and 70s, was in place, as elaborate in its hierarchies
and protocols as any religion or imperial dynasty. Devotion was
obligatory; dissent could be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years of Mao's death in 1976, things started to
change. The political orthodoxy held firm; Tiananmen proved that.
But with the arrival of a capitalist economy, cultural innovations
kicked in and everyday urban life turned surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Fried Chickens hatched in Beijing; once-reviled
imperial monuments were rehabilitated as theme parks; Cultural
Revolutionary campfire songs were set to a rock beat.
</P>
<P>
   And bit by bit, China came West. During the 1980s and 90s,
contemporary Chinese culture, sometimes tailored to non-Chinese
tastes, gained an international presence. Fiction by mainland
writers regularly appeared in English. The opera ``Marco Polo'' by
Tan Dun was produced in New York last season. Films by Chen Kaige
(``Farewell, My Concubine'') and Zhang Yimou (``Raise the Red
Lantern'') have picked up awards and played at Manhattan theaters.
</P>
<P>
   One much-anticipated import never arrived. The classic
Ming-dynasty drama ``The Peony Pavilion,'' performed by the
Shanghai Kungju Opera under the direction of Chen Shi-zheng and
billed as the centerpiece of last summer's Lincoln Center Festival,
was derailed at the 11th hour by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of official muscle-flexing also buzzed around the
Guggenheim Museum's ``China: 5,000 Years'' last spring, when the
show's selection of avant-garde art, much of it produced since 1989
and marked by Western contemporary influences, was suddenly
jettisoned, for lack of floor space, the museum said. (The
Guggenheim subsequently issued a press release announcing that a
separate show of contemporary work was planned for the summer of
1999, though no such show, in fact, has been scheduled so far for
that time.)
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, vanguard work made it to New York this fall in
``Inside Out: New Chinese Art,'' an exhibition organized by the
Asia Society in Manhattan and installed there and at the P.S. 1
Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, N.Y. (through Jan. 3).
It is the largest gathering of its kind in the West to date, and
the first to take a broad-spectrum look at new work from across the
Chinese-speaking world, including the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong
and artists living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a sprawling affair, a pileup of media, styles and
philosophies, from brush and ink painting to installation art,
mock-propaganda to Pop, Dada to Daoism, exemplary of a ``global''
art that promises to have increasing visibility in the years to
come. The question is: How well does it play in the West?
</P>
<P>
   There are problems. Hard-core admirers of the Chinese classical
tradition _ a tradition entirely (italics)about(end italics)
tradition, about transmitting a cultural ideal intact from one
generation to the next _ are likely to dismiss much of the new work
out of hand as trendy, irresolute, barely Chinese at all.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone coming from deep inside Western contemporary art,
with its fixation on ceaseless novelty, may find the art uncool for
other reasons, seeing, at first glance anyway, only familiar
Western styles _ Surrealism, Conceptualism and so on _ warmed over
and, here and there, updated with post-modern tics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither view is entirely wrong. But they both miss the wider,
more complicated, often contradictory story of an art that has only
been around for a decade and a half and is changing at lightning
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a country that is juggling a communist government
and capitalist economy, the new Chinese art seems increasingly to
be looking backward as well as forward, interweaving styles that
the impatient West feels it knows all too well with traditions that
it barely understands at all.
</P>
<P>
   As to how this new Chinese work emerged, some comparative
history is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the decades after World War II were an explosively
inventive time for art, with Abstract Expressionism giving way to
Happenings, Minimalism to Earth Art, in a kind of fever-chart
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   In China during roughly the same years, and particularly during
the decade-long Cultural Revolution, the officially sanctioned art
style was Socialist Realism, along with certain folk and popular
styles. Traditional painting was tolerated, sometimes even avidly
encouraged, though it was often politically tinged. With doors to
the West effectively shut for more than 20 years beginning in 1950,
updated information on modern art, which had had an impact on China
earlier in the century, was scant.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Cultural Revolution, outside
information arrived fast, giving a generation of artists born after
1949 _ which means almost all of the artists in the Asia Society
show _ a crash course in Western art history from Giotto to Jeff
Koons. Contemporary work in particular offered exhilarating
possibilities: fresh formal options, a shot at the international
mainstream, and _ initially, at least _ a vehicle for political
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Art in China has always been about power. Its aura of timeless,
near-mystical authority has been called upon by every ruling class
_ imperial or Communist _ to advertise legitimacy. It has insured
social advancement for artists and patrons alike. To a degree only
sporadically true in the West, it has been a primary medium of
intellectual discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Whether artists were attached by appointment to the court or by
profession to the academy, or were living in disaffected retreat
from both, they were expected to comment critically, if obliquely,
on the world around them through a narrow vocabulary of coded
images, most of these drawn from nature.
</P>
<P>
   This ``commentarial'' impulse was much evident in the new art of
the 1980s. With the Cultural Revolution still fresh in memory,
young artists began filtering its esthetic preferences through
off-the-rack Western models. Socialist Realism was retooled as an
ambivalently debunking style known as Political Pop, with Mao as a
central image.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Mao's droopy, pear-shaped face had loomed over
China like an all-powerful Oz, intimidating and reassuring, a
revered but crotchety parent, subject to mood swings and with a
dangerous mean streak. In a well-known triple oil-on-canvas
portrait by the early Political Pop artist Wang Guangyi, Mao is
seen as a gray marmoreal presence set behind a grid of solid black
lines, as if he or the viewer were confined behind, and perhaps
protected by, prison bars.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings like this have been popular in the West and taken as
proof that all Chinese avant-garde work is, by definition,
``dissident'' and counter-revolutionary, though this is not the
case. Wang Guangyi's painting, with its debt to Warhol, is an
ambiguous image, reflecting to some degree the general popular
attitude toward Mao in China: critical but, as the horrors of the
Cultural Revolution are softened by time, also deeply nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   A 1990s painting trend known as Cynical Realism shifts its
attention away from a revolutionary past to an equally, if
differently problematic present: a rapidly Westernizing China of
stampeding commercialism, bureaucratic corruption and social
inequities.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Cynical Realism _ represented by artists like Cao
Yong and Song Yongping, both of whom appear in the show at the Asia
Society _ sells well on the Western-based market and so has become
part of the capitalistic system it rebukes. And at least one of its
most visible exponents, Fang Lijun, a member of the early 1980s
avant-garde, has become a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   Fang's signature images of yawning, bald, look-alike men
originated as a version of peasant figures and may convey a sense
of existential ennui to Western eyes. But among some of his
colleagues, he is regarded as a sell-out, producing rote, sure-fire
pictures for money, while enjoying the rewards of haute-bourgeois
privilege in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   An entrepreneurial avant-garde of the kind Fang represents has
long been familiar in the West, perhaps most recently in the
high-priced ``consumer critique'' Neo-Geo of the 1980s. And it is
fast gaining ground in China. But few vanguard artists at the
moment share his luxe life style. Art still falls into officially
approved and disapproved categories, with certain forms _
installation art, in particular, with its often disruptive physical
presence and hard-to-read open-ended meanings _ seen as especially
likely to convey problematic messages.
</P>
<P>
   That suspicion is often well founded, as it was in the case of a
1996 public installation by Wang Jin in Zhengzhou City. In response
to a commission by the city government to create a sculpture for a
new shopping mall, the artist froze a trove of high-end consumer
items _ cellular phones, jewelry _ into big blocks of ice, then
stacked the blocks to form a wall (itself a resonant symbol
throughout China's isolationist history). When the wall was
completed, a near riot ensued as a frenzied crowd hacked through
the ice to get at the goods locked inside.
</P>
<P>
   Because the current government is anxious to look liberal and
with-it in the world's eyes, it may not suppress such work
outright. But it does its best to make life difficult for the
artists by controlling access to public exhibition spaces,
including those at art schools, almost all of which are state
owned.
</P>
<P>
   One solution has been to create ephemeral public works. Wang
Jin's ice wall is an example; so is a piece entitled ``To Raise the
Water Level in a Fishpond'' by the conceptual artist Zhang Huan,
one of the outstanding figures in the Asia Society show. For this
work, Zhang rounded up dozens of itinerant urban male workers _
China's newest disenfranchised class _ and photographed them
standing at shoulder height in a Beijing pool, isolated from one
another and from the city itself, to suggest their political
inconsequentiality in post-Maoist China.
</P>
<P>
   In a solo performance at P.S. 1 in October, the artist subjected
himself to a physical endurance test with spiritual and political
implications. The main prop was a Chinese-style bed with a
``mattress'' made of ice on which he lay naked and face down for 10
minutes or so, as if symbolically trying to melt a cultural
permafrost with his body heat.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists have started holding exhibitions in their homes to
an audience made up largely of peers. Two installation artists,
Wang Gongxin and Lin Tian-miao, husband and wife (she is one of the
few women in the Asia Society show), have been credited with
initiating so-called ``apartment art'' when, in 1994, they arranged
a one-night-only show in Wang's parents' home in Beijing. News
spread by word of mouth; hundreds of people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The format has been widely copied. The police appear to be aware
of the exhibitions but so far have interfered only in cases where
the material shown is either sexually explicit or directly critical
of the government. (The gender-bending nude performances by the
charismatic young artist Ma Liuming, who also made a memorable
appearance at P.S. 1 in October, have been raided and closed down.
Both Ma and Zhang Huan will have exhibitions in Manhattan galleries
this season.)
</P>
<P>
   A domestic context for art has a long history in China. For
centuries, classical forms _ ink and brush painting and calligraphy
_ were produced in a roughly comparable ``open studio''
environment. Scholar-artists created their work in private for a
few friends, never intending public display. In ``apartment art,''
a traditional idea has become avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   The mingling of new and old may well prove to be the wave of the
future. Where, in the early 1980s, much new Chinese art sought to
shake itself free from tradition by looking Westward, in the 1990s,
artists are reclaiming those traditions, if only to question them
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Much new art takes as its subject one of the most cherished of
China's high-art forms, the written word, with its history of
obsessive, ritualistic copying from century to century. The
Beijing-based artist Qiu Zhijie has copied out a classic text
called the ``Orchid Pavilion Preface'' a thousand times on a single
scroll until the surface of the paper has turned black. Another
Beijing artist, Song Dong, writes with plain water on a flat stone.
The words evaporate within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Both artists have work at P.S. 1. So does the conceptualist
Zhang Peili, an influential figure with a solid and growing
international reputation. He is represented by a 1992 video that
takes a sly, iconoclastic, new-media look at the authority invested
in words.
</P>
<P>
   He hired the star newscaster of China's state-controlled
television station, Xin Zhibin, who had been the first to report
the Tiananmen massacre, and filmed her reading a dictionary
definition of water as if it were a news report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes playing with language has touched an official nerve.
Wenda Gu began his career in China in the mid-1980s as an
academically trained calligrapher and ink painter. But when in 1986
he exhibited pieces that incorporated invented Chinese characters,
the government closed the show. The work was perceived as
subverting a sacrosanct tradition, and (the authorities suspected)
as carrying coded political messages.
</P>
<P>
   Gu moved to the United States a year later and has since
produced fictional versions of both Western and non-Western
languages. His spectacular P.S. 1 installation, ``Temple of
Heaven,'' commissioned by the Asia Society for the show, amounts to
a kind of visual Babel, with floor-to-ceiling scrims of invented
letters and pictograph characters shaped from human hair.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chinese emigre to the United States, Xu Bing, also
deconstructs language. His monumental installation, ``A Book From
the Sky,'' was an avant-garde landmark when it first appeared in
Beijing in 1988. Reconstituted at P.S. 1, it consists of hundreds
of hand-printed books filled entirely with Chinese-looking nonsense
characters.
</P>
<P>
   In an art world much concerned at present with questions of
cultural identity and diaspora, both artists are quintessential
global figures, a role with advantages as well as pitfalls. On the
one hand, their work gets attention on the expanding circuit of
international biennials and triennials. At the same time, their
positioning between cultures requires that they sustain a careful
balancing act, neither playing down their ``Chineseness'' too much
nor turning it into an exoticizing chinoiserie.
</P>
<P>
   (Although both artists exhibit in mainstream New York
institutions _ Xu has an installation at the New Museum in SoHo
through Jan. 10 _ they seem to occupy a social position at the
periphery of the local art world, keeping close ties to friends and
colleagues in China. A third artist, Cai Guo-qiang, a veteran of
two Venice Biennales and short-listed for the Guggenheim's Hugo
Boss prize two years ago, is now based in New York but speaks no
English.)
</P>
<P>
   Similar negotiations of identity are evident in vanguard art
emerging in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where artists are trying to
create work that both acknowledges but disengages itself from
Chinese tradition. And the conflict is increasingly evident in
China itself. Zhang Peili _ who has a very funny video piece
currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art _ recently observed
that although a decade ago he wanted only to escape from tradition,
he has revised his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like living with your father and grandfather in the same
house,'' he said. ``You have different life styles; you probably
won't get along very well. There will be many problems. But once
you start to live apart, your feelings change. Affection develops.
You miss each other. After all, this is a bond of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a bond that, like all family ties, can take unpredictable
directions. Historically, every time Western influence has gained
ascendance in China, a revivalist wave of traditional culture has
followed. Whether this will prove true once again remains to be
seen. (In fact, traditional styles are still widely practiced, as
in the case of a strain of ``new literati'' painting.) But there is
no question that some recent Chinese art has a distinctly
nationalistic, implicitly anti-Western bent.
</P>
<P>
   One example is an arresting installation at P.S. 1 entitled
``Borrowing Your Enemy's Arrows,'' by Cai Guo-qiang. It consists of
a wooden fishing boat suspended in midair and pierced with
thousands of arrows, and illustrates the legend of a Chinese
general who in a naval battle sent an empty boat toward his enemies
to attract their fire and then used their arrows against them.
</P>
<P>
   Is China's new art based on such opportunistic strategies,
fulfilling Mao's famous directive to make foreign things serve
China? Some of it is certainly geared to turning a fast profit in
the Western market, especially while ``Chinese'' is hot in the way
``Korean'' was a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the most original work has more challenging things on its
mind: How to forge a shaping role within a China that is itself in
a crisis of change, and in a larger world where multinational
business and telecommunications have made the very issue of
cultural identity seem almost as irrelevant as it is urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever directions Chinese art follows, a Western audience will
have to take note of it and learn to meet it on its own terms. The
China of the Forbidden City may still be an enigma, but in a world
of shrinking physical size and eroding cultural boundaries, it is
also the house just across the street.

FBI RELEASES ITS FILE ON SINATRA 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI's 1,300-page file on Frank Sinatra, most of
which was released Tuesday, contain old rumors about his ties to
organized crime, details about a youthful arrest for seduction and
adultery and new information about why he escaped military duty in
World War II: a perforated eardrum and mental instability.
</P>
<P>
   While the documents fail to answer many questions that dogged
Sinatra for much of his career, they will provide grist for
biographers and historians seeking to separate fact from innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   One fact emerged from a tip by gossip columnist Walter Winchell,
who forwarded to the FBI an anonymous letter repeating a rumor that
Sinatra had paid a $40,000 bribe to doctors in New Jersey in order
to escape the draft.
</P>
<P>
   After checking with the draft board in Jersey City, N.J., the
FBI determined that Sinatra had been properly rejected as 4-F. An
FBI agent related that ``Sinatra's classification appeared to be
regular and that he was disqualified because of a perforated
eardrum and chronic mastoiditis and that his mental condition was
one of mental instability.''
</P>
<P>
   In a draft board report, one examiner evaluating Sinatra had

   ``During the pyschiatric interview, the patient stated that he
was neurotic, afraid to be in crowds, afraid to go in the elevator,
makes him feel that he would want to run when surrounded by people.
He had comatic ideas and headaches and has been very nervous for
four or five years. Wakens tired in the a.m., is run down and
undernourished. The examining psychiatrist concluded that this
selectee suffered from pyschoneurosis and was not acceptable
material from the psychiatric viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   A Sinatra biographer, Michael Freedland, said Tuesday that the
information regarding Sinatra's physical and psychiatric
examinations was new.
</P>
<P>
   Freedland, whose book ``All the Way'' was published this year by
St. Martin's Press, said: ``It's amazing that somebody who has
6,000 girls screaming at him at the Paramount Theater in New York
could claim that he is disturbed by crowds. It is unbelievable. He
thrived on crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer who supervised Sinatra's medical examination, Capt.
Joseph Weintrob, said that since Sinatra was being rejected because
of his hearing problems, ``the diagnosis of pyschoneurosis, severe,
was not added to the list'' and that emotional instablity was
substituted because ``this would avoid undue unpleasantness for
both the selectee and the induction service.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said it had withheld 25 pages and blacked out some
passages in the released material to protect the privacy of third
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra saw the file well before his death on May 14 at the age
of 82. He had requested it under the Freedom of Information Act in
1979 and 1980, and after he died the file became available to
others. It was released Tuesday to journalists and others who had
requested it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rumor concerning Sinatra and the draft led the FBI to gather
information concerning his arrest in 1938 on sex charges.
</P>
<P>
   One FBI report said that, independent of the draft rumor
investigation, it had come to the bureau's attention that Sinatra
had a criminal record in Bergen County, N.J. From the Bergen County
Jail in Hackensack, ``there was obtained an enclosed picture of
FRANK SINATRA and the following information regarding the two
occasions on which SINATRA was held in the Bergen County Jail,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``FRANK SINATRA, Arrest (NU)42799, Bergen County Sheriff's
Office, Hackensack, New Jersey was arrested on November 26, 1938
charged with Seduction. Disposition was marked, `Dismissed.'. FRANK
SINATRA, Arrest (NU)42977, was arrested on December 22, 1938,
charged with Adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the acts with which Sinatra was charged is against
the law today, but his initial charge in 1938 stated that: ``On the
second and ninth days of November 1938 at the Borough of Lodi'' and
``under the promise of marriage'' Sinatra ``did then and there have
sexual intercourse with the said complainant, who was then and
there a single female of good repute.'' This, the charge stated,
was ``contrary and in violation of the revised statute of 1937.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that Sinatra was released on $1,500 bond and
that the complaint was withdrawn when it was determined that the
woman involved was married. A complaint of adultery was
substituted, with Sinatra's bond being lowered to $500. That
charge, too, was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the FBI file concern Sinatra's links to mobsters.
In one report he is mentioned in connection with his old friend
Jilly Rizzo, as well as criminals like Aniello Dellacroce, Carlo
Gambino, Joe Gallo and Anthony Carillo, in a case involving an
effort to extort $100,000 from a New York stockbroker. Sinatra
always denied involvement with mobsters and he was never formally
charged in this or other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The report says only that Sinatra joined Gambino and Rizzo in
investing $100,000 in a stock that turned worthless. Sinatra,
according to the material, told an FBI agent that he had never
heard of the stock in question although the investment might have
been made by his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the report reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the information of the Bureau, Aniello Dellacroce has been
identified as the `underboss' of the Carlo Gambino `family' of La
Cosa Nostra (LCN).'' It further notes that ``Frank Sinatra has been
identified as the noted actor-singer.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no reference in the documents to Judith Campbell Exner,
perhaps because of the prohibition against releasing information on
third parties who are still alive. Ms. Exner has said that she had
a relationship with Sinatra, and he introduced her to President
John F. Kennedy, and that she then carried on simultaneous affairs
with Kennedy and Chicago mob leader Sam Giancana.
</P>
<P>
   Another mob-related investigation concerned the Cal-Neva casino,
in which Sinatra held the majority interest. The FBI was trying to
determine whether Sinatra had made any under-the-table payoffs in
order to get a loan from the teamsters union, which Sinatra denied.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report said: ``SINATRA mentioned that DORIS DAY had
secured a similar type loan from the Teamsters for a motel that she
owns, and he had asked her if she had had to cut anybody in, and
she advised that it was not necessary, that it was a straight
loan.''
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that his draft board's medical
examination found the skinny singer underweight, but just by four
pounds. The examination confirms something else: Ol' Blue Eyes,
indeed, had blue eyes.

<P>
   Next year will bring less variety among U.S. airlines'
frequent-flier programs and the disappearance of miles that expire,
an expert on loyalty programs predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer, a magazine for
frequent travelers, said this week that he expected that features
of programs offered by airline marketing partners _ Northwest
Airlines and Continental Airlines, AMR's American Airlines and U S
Airways, and UAL's United Airlines and Delta Air Lines _ would
change next year to more closely resemble one other.
</P>
<P>
   ``1999 will be the year that domestic programs become singular
frequent-flier programs rather than dual programs.'' Petersen said.
``You'll see the programs of alliance airlines edging closer to
each other. Members of each program will win something and lose
something.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Petersen said he expected that participants in U S
Airways' program would be required to abide by mileage-redemption
rules of American Airlines' program, which he said were stricter
than those of U S Airways.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said Northwest's recent decision to eliminate its
mileage-expiration requirements _ bringing it in line with the
Continental program, which has no expiring miles _ would ultimately
force American and United to follow suit; unlike their respective
marketing partners, U S Airways and Delta, these two carriers still
offer mileage that expires. ``You're going to see the complete
death of expiring miles,'' Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted that there would be more lawsuits next year by
disgruntled frequent fliers against airlines, following preliminary
resolution of a 10-year-old class-action suit against Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the Cook County, Ill., Circuit Court, the suit involves
claims that Delta violated contractual rights of participants in
its loyalty program when it changed some rules in 1988. The
preliminary approval affects close to 600,000 frequent fliers;
final approval is expected in January.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen said he believed that the resolution of the Delta suit
``would open up the gate for many legal challenges of the airlines,
about the number of free seats available and changes in awards.
It's going to be a lawyer's heyday.''
</P>
<P>
   No Long-Haul Changes
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration emergency order issued last
week, affecting fuel storage in Boeing 747s, will not force
operators of these planes to change their flight patterns, despite
initial reports to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   The order required pilots of all 747s to shut off the pump in
the center fuel tank once the fuel reached a certain level. It also
required operators of long-range 747-400s to stop using a fuel tank
in the horizontal stabilizer in the tail, an action that could cut
the distance the plane could fly. Both measures were taken to
prevent fuel-tank explosions but are unrelated to the 1996
explosion of Trans World Airlines flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines like United, Northwest and Cathay Pacific, all of which
operate the 747-400s, said last week that they might need to change
long-haul routings or add refueling stops in order to comply with
the FAA's order. However, these carriers subsequently devised
inspection systems that would allow them to operate safely, or they
are choosing to carry less cargo to compensate for any decrease in
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Charge and Go
</P>
<P>
   Budget Rent-a-Car, a subsidiary of Budget Group Inc., this week
will start renting electric vehicles at its Los Angeles
International Airport location.
</P>
<P>
   Offered in conjunction with EV Rental Cars, a privately held
company based in Calabasas, Calif., the cars will be available at a
special daily rate of $39.95 through early February.
</P>
<P>
   Budget, which already rents electric cars in France, initially
will have about 15 electric vehicles in the airport fleet,
including models by DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor, General Motors,
Honda and Toyota. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, a
partner in this program, is also adding an electric bus to Budget's
airport-shuttle bus fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Budget said it planned to increase its fleet of electric
vehicles at the Los Angeles airport to 60 cars by next spring; it
also expects to eventually expand the fleet to other locations
throughout California. According to the rental-car company, there
are now more than 300 charging stations for electric vehicles
throughout Southern California.

TV NOTES: REVISITING ANCIENT EGYPT AND 1968 AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a combination of what one Fox executive called ``Fox hype and
Discovery Channel content,'' the Fox network will broadcast the
live excavation of several previously unopened Egyptian tombs in a
two-hour program March 2.
</P>
<P>
   The network announced the deal Tuesday, predicting everything
from the possible discovery of a mummy to an expedition to an
undisclosed location that ``may reveal one of the most significant
discoveries of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The special is a result of a long courtship of Egyptian
officials in charge of antiquities by Fox executives and an
independent producer, Peter Isaacson, a former actor who once
appeared in the NBC comedy ``CPO Sharkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives did not disclose exactly what the network was
paying for the rights to this event, though they said most of the
money was going for the benefit of archaeological work and the
preservation of the Egyptian monuments. Fox will market the program
internationally as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Egyptian officials involved is Dr. Zahi Hawass, a
widely renowned archaeologist and Egypt's undersecretary of state
for the Giza Plateau. He is also well known as the chief debunker
of numerous speculative theories about the planning and
construction of the monuments of Egyptian civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Fox plans to give a lot of time to those theories, some of which
include the notion that space aliens may have inspired the
construction of the Pyramids or that the great Egyptian
civilization of the second millennium B.C. was only a follow-up to
the civilization of the lost continent of Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be mentioning Atlantis,'' said Nancy Stern, the
supervising producer of the program. ``But we also have Dr. Hawass
debating the advocates of that theory.'' Indeed, Fox has already
filmed Hawass with two authors who have advanced the Egypt-Atlantis
connection in a heated debate in a Cairo coffee shop, Ms. Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
   About half the special will be devoted to the live opening of
tombs, at 3 a.m. Cairo time. One of these is in the pyramid of
Queen Khamerernebty II (wife of the Pharaoh Menkaure), and one is
called the ``Tomb of the Unknown,'' which has been undisturbed (Fox
executives say) for some 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The program, with former NBC correspondent Arthur Kent as host,
promises to include much historical and archaeological background,
an attempt at some re-creation of life in ancient Egypt, and even a
trip with Hawass into a crypt on the neck of the Sphinx. But it is
the live tomb opening that moves the show into the more familiar
realm of the Fox special.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darnell, the Fox executive vice president in charge of
specials, acknowledged that the subject matter was not typical of
either his network or his department, which has built a name (and
ratings) for itself in recent years with specials like ``When
Animals Attack'' and ``World's Scariest Police Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   While denying that the program would ultimately be called ``When
Good Mummies Go Bad,'' Darnell played with the idea: ``Like, we
discover there was a pit bull in there, and that's what actually
killed the pharaoh.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the executive who made the comparison to the Discovery
Channel, which, coincidentally, has scheduled its own Egypt special
12 days later, a study of what is believed to be the submerged old
city of Alexandria as it was in the time of Cleopatra, before it
was swallowed up by the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell said other Fox executives, like chairman David Hill,
liked the subject matter for its historical value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the hype factor,'' Darnell said. ``I'm sure our
promotion department will create a hyped event: Do be there, don't
be square, for the live tomb opening.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first such excavation on live television.
Geraldo Rivera made television history of a kind in 1986 when he
opened a vault supposedly belonging to Al Capone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found nothing,'' Darnell said. ``We know we'll find
something. We may find treasure. We may find another Rosetta Stone.
Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   But Darnell said he wouldn't mind matching something Rivera did
find: lots of viewers. ``He got a 38 share,'' Darnell said, proving
he had done his own digging into the past. That is still the
highest-rated syndicated special in the history of television.
</P>
<P>
   _ By BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   Tumultuous Era
</P>
<P>
   ABC News is putting a program on the air Thursday night that is
unusual for two reasons. First, a two-hour documentary is rare in
broadcast television these days, with the notable exception of PBS.
Second, the subject matter, the United States in 1968, sounds
almost too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The film's title, ``The Whole World Was Watching,'' sums up the
challenge faced by the producers in looking back at 1968, when the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were
murdered, the Vietnam War was escalated with the Tet offensive, and
students rioted in the streets at the Democratic National
Convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't jumping up and down with excitement when we got the
assignment,'' said Paul Fine, who is a co-producer of the program
with his wife, Holly Fine. But they realized that a sizeable number
of young people might have heard tales of the tumultuous '60s and
early '70s without really learning anything in depth about that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when they screened the film for their 25-year-old son,
Fine said, ``he was fascinated to see people his age who really
felt they could change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Sawyer and Connie Chung, who were in their early 20s
during that era, are the reporters for the documentary, with each
woman handling two of the four segments examining the lives of
people involved in events of 1968 to see how they have changed in
the 30 years since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection of people was brilliant,'' Ms. Chung said,
praising the Fines, who left CBS News last spring, after 16 years
as producers for ``60 Minutes'' and ``CBS Reports,'' and who have
won dozens of major awards, including three Peabodys and 10 Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found people who were profoundly affected by the times,''
Ms. Chung added, ``and yet who still have relevance to us today.''
</P>
<P>
   The people interviewed range from some well-known figures _
Coretta Scott King, Lady Bird Johnson (who reveals how she learned
that her husband, Lyndon B. Johnson, did not intend to run for
president in 1968), Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayres, the former
Weathermen anti-war radicals _ to less familiar ones, like Lloyd
Bucher, the former commander of the Navy intelligence ship Pueblo,
which was captured along with its crew by the North Koreans in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still unanswered questions inside this story; it
doesn't have pat lessons,'' Ms. Sawyer said. ``There are questions
you can still debate today.''

 WASHINGTON: your cravenness.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, the committee is certain to report out at least one and
perhaps as many as four articles of impeachment against Clinton by
Saturday. Underscoring that reality, the committee's Republicans
time and again showed little patience for White House attempts
Tuesday to explain away some of Clinton's statement's across the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Inglis, R-S.C., asked Craig if Clinton had lied ``to
the American people when he said I never had sex with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't believe that he did,'' Craig answered. ``He does
not believe that he lied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing thing,'' shot back Inglis. ``You're taking
back all of his apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the committee room some Republicans seemed slightly
mollified. ``The jury is still out, but I've gained a little more
respect for the defense team,'' Bilbray said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress is mercurial and the political mood can change in
an instant. There is still a critical week to go before the
ultimate impeachment votes. And it remains a problem for Clinton
that the one and only member of the Republican leadership who has
become engaged in the impeachment debate, Rep. Tom DeLay, the House
majority whip, openly supports impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said that sometime in the next week, Clinton himself
will have to reach out to Republicans and fight for his own
survival instead of relying on lawyers, academics and surrogates.
``It will be the president himself who will have to engage,'' he
said. ``Because this is one that is too important to his presidency
not to be directly involved.''

 WASHINGTON: these issues.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. ``The only
person who can save him from impeachment is him,'' said LaHood, who
has often displayed an independent streak from his leadership.
``He's got to get out from behind the shroud of his attorneys and
his staff who spent the entire year maligning Ken Starr and Henry
Hyde and trying to dig up dirt on members of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, and
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Republican chairman of the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the undecideds watched Tuesday's all-day hearing at home
or ensconced in their Capitol Hill offices, and several said they
planned to read through several hundred pages of background
material the White House presented to the Judiciary Committee on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the historic nature of the impending vote, many
undecided members of Congress were scattered across the globe,
unable to pay attention to Tuesday's testimony because of other
pressing congressional business or equally consuming vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., was in New Zealand to discuss trade
issues, along with other members of the Ways and Means Committee.
Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La., spent the day deer hunting in the wilds of
Maryland. And Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., was in London at a
meeting of the International Maritime Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they did not bother to watch the hearing on Tuesday
because they were already familiar with the facts of the case and
did not expect to be enlightened by new testimony on behalf of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearings don't make much difference,'' said Rep. Scott Klug,
R-Wis., Wisconsin, who said he remains undecided. ``Most of the
hearings at this point sound like a bunch of lawyers fighting a
personal injury case. Lots of legalistic polka dancing on the head
of a pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz Belart, R-Fla., said he has been reading up on
the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and listening closely
to his constituents about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first topic of conversation,'' Diaz Belart said.
``I'm sure in the next days it will become something very much at
the forefront of people's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Several undecided Republicans said that they were pleased that
the panel of witnesses presented by the White House on Tuesday did
not criticize Starr, and that Clinton's lawyer, Gregory Craig, had
adopted a more conciliatory tone with the committee's Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But one undecided Republican, Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio, said Craig
had not helped the president's case when he said that the president
had not necessarily lied about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, everyone in the country knows the president didn't tell
the truth,'' Ney said. ``Ask my children. Everyone knows it. The
president said he misled the country. For him to play coy is
absurd. Playing straightforward is what we need. He didn't do him
any justice.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Ney, who watched several hours of the hearing before flying
back to his district in rural, eastern Ohio, said he would not vote
for impeachment just because of a poor performance by the
president's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   A few moderate Republicans said privately that they had been
contacted either by White House officials or Democratic colleagues
in Congress. But most said they had not been lobbied strenuously by
either side.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said that he and other
Democrats have been calling their Republican friends, urging them
to buck their leadership and vote for a motion to censure the
president. Acknowledging that the chances of that happening were
not good, Ackerman said he has been telling undecided members that
they must be prepared to be remembered in history as someone who
voted ``to throw out the president for lying about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they understand that,'' Ackerman said. ``But a lot of
them fear for the political lives in their districts. And they are
fearful about whether there will be retribution from the Republican
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who opposes impeachment, said
lobbying by the White House and its allies at this late date could
only hurt the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were thinking of voting for impeachment, and the White
House generated calls urging me to vote against it, I think I might
be less inclined to accommodate them,'' he said. ``Because the
thought that I would vote based on political pressure would be an
insult to me. Contrition won't do it, honesty will. That's their
best hope.''

HEARING LOOMING, KRAFTS GO ON PR BLITZ IN CONNECTICUT

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ On the eve of Wednesday's public hearing to
bring the New England Patriots here, team owner Robert Kraft and
his son Jonathan went on a statewide public relations blitz,
meeting with newspaper editorial boards, attending a pep rally at
the Civic Center mall, and later donating $15,000 to youth
football.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders at the state capital seemed to delight that
Kraft's tour of the state might distract the media from growing
problems with the initial agreement Kraft signed with the state. As
attorneys put the finishing touches on legislation that will
authorize more than $350 million in state borrowing to build a new
68,000-seat home for the football team, union organizers and some
key legislators tried to publicly pressure the team and the state
into making some concessions, arguing that Connecticut is being too
generous to the Patriots' owner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promise of several thousand new jobs stadium
construction would bring, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO
Tuesday took to the airwaves and the streets to urge members of the
state legislature to view the deal with skepticism
</P>
<P>
   John W. Olsen, whose union represents 24,000 workers in more
than 600 affiliated unions in Connecticut, said he is concerned
that the state may have ``better public works projects'' to finance
than a football stadium. But if the state decides to borrow money
to build it, Olsen said, it should done at the expense of working
men and women of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many aspects of this represent the height of corporate
welfare,'' Olsen said. ``I just want to remind everyone that Mr.
Kraft was the fellow who said he was buying the Patriots to keep
them in Boston. Our schools are crumbling and our roads and bridges
are cracking..Do we really think that this is the only deal we can
have, to have a public works project?''
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million deal will essentially give Kraft free use of
the state-owned stadium and contains lucrative guarantees that will
protect him from falling revenues in years the team cannot sell all
of its expensive club seats and luxury boxes. Meanwhile, the
state's own figures show Connecticut will just break even on its
$350 million investment over 30 years. No direct taxpayer money
will be used in building the stadium if all of the state's
financial assumptions, which some have dubbed widely optimistic,
are met.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen insisted that he was not against the stadium project but
that neither he nor ``any worthwhile legislator'' knows enough
about the deal to approve it. He called on members of the General
Assembly to be thorough in their work, beginning with a hearing
scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is such a good deal, why isn't it put out there fully,
and for a couple of weeks, so that everyone can take a good hard
look at it,'' Olsen said. ``If it is that good, what's the rush?''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut AFL-CIO also launched a radio campaign Tuesday
urging lawmakers to get guarantees that the proposed stadium will
mean good jobs and wages.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what impact the union's campaign Tuesday will have
on the stadium issue in Hartford. A small group of legislators
already aligned with organized labor are expected to press Kraft on
some of the issues. But their numbers have never appeared large
enough to stop a deal they do not like.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the AFL-CIO unions, especially those in the building
trades, endorsed Rowland's successful candidacy for governor this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the proposal is scheduled for December 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a close vote, it might make a major difference,'' said
state Representative Demetrios Giannaros, D-Plainfield, who is also
a professor of economics at the University of Hartford. ``I think
that while most legislators want to bring the Patriots to Hartford,
the majority are waiting to here more specific information.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the memorandum of understanding signed by Governor John
Rowland and Kraft commits both sides to a so-called project labor
agreement that would require union wages and benefits, or to comply
with prevailing wage law, Olsen said he will lobby members of the
General Assembly for tough language to secure those standards.
Olsen also called on Kraft to make similar promises to workers who
will eventually staff the hotel and activities center.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently trying to score points with fans and shore up any
wavering support, Kraft Tuesday brought along players Tebucky
Jones, a first round defensive back who grew up in New Britain,
along with linemen Chad Eaton, Bruce Armstrong and Ed Ellis, a
Hamden native.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to hear the enthusiasm that's been restored here
today,'' said Ellis, Hamden native, referring to criticism of the
lucrative stadium deal.''It's really good to be back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones: ``I don't need a map to get here...Let's start
building that stadium now.'
</P>
<P>
   Star quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was expected to attend
Tuesday's events, was at Mass General Hospital having his broken
finger tended to.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Mayor Michael Peters presented Kraft with a golden key
to the city and, in return, got a Patriots jersey with his name and
the number 1 on it.
</P>
<P>
   The obviously pro-Patriots crowd, an assortment of office
workers, shopkeepers and parents with kids seeking autographs who
turned out in the middle of the day were handed blue and white
pompoms leftover from the Patriots/Jets game while a speakers
blared recorded the fight song from the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The college's football team will benefit greatly from playing in
the new facility and getting attention from the NFL coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots spokesman Don Lowery said the city organized the rally
and the charity event right after it, during which PopWarner
players from across the state got to ask questions of the team
members still on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want to come to Hartford?'' one boy asked.
</P>
<P>
   Several players simply said yes and they moved on to the next
question. ``Do you guys think you will change your name to the
Hartford Patriots?'' No, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The rally capped the day for Kraft who visited six newspaper
editorial boards, including the Hartford Courant and the New London
Day, answering questions about just how sweet the deal is for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft avoided reporters, saying he would answer all questions
about any changes to the agreement during the marathon hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have been floated,'' said team vice president
Andy Wasynczuk. ``But We haven't heard'' of any changes that have
actually been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key theme I've heard here is, is this a sound investment
and how does it compare (to other deals) around the country?''

NETTER DIGITAL HIRES SUTRO TO HELP WITH GROWTH PLANS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares in Netter Digital Entertainment rose 38
percent on word that the company has retained an investment bank to
help it grow.
</P>
<P>
   The digital-effects and television production house, based in
North Hollywood, has hired Sutro &AMP; Co. to evaluate alternatives
such as establishing partnerships with other companies and raising
new capital to meet long-term growth plans, said Netter spokesman
Chad Kalebic.
</P>
<P>
   Netter, which produces the ``Babylon 5,'' ``Crusade'' and
``Voltron: The Third Dimension'' television programs, hopes among
other things to expand its 3-D and special-effects animation
services for the television, film and video-game industries.
</P>
<P>
   The company is growing. For its 1998 fiscal year ended June 30,
revenues were up 26 percent to $32.3 million. But the company's
sales are dependent on just a handful of projects, putting it in a
precarious position if one or two fall apart, said analyst Debra
Fiakas at HD Brous &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their projects tend to be big and can be subject to fits and
starts,'' she said. ``That isn't always conducive to promoting
consistency and a fully valued stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Netter shares closed up 62.5 cents Tuesday at $2.25.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a management shake-up that had been the subject of months of
speculation, Gary Wendt resigned on Tuesday as the head of GE
Capital Services, the huge financial-services arm of the General
Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, 56, viewed as the executive largely responsible for
creating the powerhouse that fuels General Electric's impressive
earnings growth, was replaced by Dennis Dammerman, General
Electric's long-time chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being named chairman and chief executive of GE
Capital Services, Dammerman, 53, was appointed a vice chairman of
the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   While General Electric and analysts and investors sought to play
down the significance of Wendt's departure and the possibility of
any changes at GE Capital, the impact of his resignation is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital, which consists of 29 businesses ranging from credit
cards to truck leasing, provided about 40 percent of General
Electric's profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be run the same way,'' said Marvin
Roffman, the president of Roffman Miller Associates, a Philadelphia
money-management and independent research firm. He predicted there
would be be ``a lot of changes in the company over the next few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarded as a visionary who is extraordinarily skillful at
assessing risk and doing the right deals, Wendt oversaw GE Capital
for the last dozen years. Over that period, its assets grew from
$24 billion to $300 billion, and profits rose from $300 million to
nearly $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the reasons for the changes, John F. Welch Jr.,
General Electric's 63-year-old chairman and chief executive
officer, emphasized that the moves were part of the company's
overall efforts to put in place a younger team of executives and
prepare General Electric for his retirement in two years. ``We're
trying to get all the ducks in a row,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Nayden, 44, who had been serving as president and chief
operating officer at GE Capital Corp. which represents the bulk of
GE Capital Services, was promoted to chief executive. Keith Sherin,
40, the vice president of finance and financial services at GE
Medical Systems, replaced Dammerman as chief financial officer for
General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt's departure, which was reported in Tuesday's Wall Street
Journal, came as little surprise. Despite his much-publicized
success in running GE Capital, he and Welch were believed to have
strained relations. During his very public and messy divorce
proceedings, Wendt admitted that he and Welch were not close, and
people who know both men said that they did not get along.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for the executive changes, according to
Welch, was his desire to create a stable environment for the
company before he stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt ``was not a candidate'' to become the next chief executive
of General Electric, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Welch would not say whether Wendt was precluded from
competing with GE Capital in the future, the company said that he
had agreed to stay on in a consulting role until the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt did not comment on Tuesday's events, although he issued a
statement in which he thanked Welch for his support and described
the business as ``well positioned'' and ``staffed with bright and
enthusiastic people well qualified to help maximize GE shareholder
values in the future!''
</P>

   While General Electric's stock initially dropped $1.75 on the
news, it closed on Tuesday at $90.4375, down 37.5 cents. Analysts
and investors generally applauded the way the move was handled and
the decision to place the group under the supervision of Dammerman,
a highly regarded financial executive who played a key role in
cleaning up the mess created by General Electric's ill-fated
acquisition of Kidder Peabody, which was later sold to PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Dammerman ``surely knows as much as there is to know about GE
and GE Capital,'' said Jeanne G. Terrile, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Dammerman is viewed as one of Welch's closest advisers and one
of the candidates to succeed him as chief executive. But analysts
say that the job was more likely to go to a younger executive with
more operating experience. Among the executives' names bandied
about were Jeffrey Immelt, the head of GE Medical Systems, and W.
James McNerney Jr., the head of GE Aircraft Engines.

U.S. APPEALS FOR ARAB SUPPORT IN OVERTHROWING SADDAM  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Clinton administration made an open appeal
Tuesday for Arab support in its campaign to overthrow President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said in remarks
prepared for a speech at Stanford University, ``Saddam's continued
misrule of Iraq is harmful to the Middle East as a whole.'' He laid
out economic and political reasons why the region should welcome a
new Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner the situation in Iraq is normalized,'' he said,
``the sooner the people of the Middle East can get on with the
business of building a more stable region and the more likely we
are to realize our goal of seeing the region integrated, with
consent of its people, into the international system.''
</P>
<P>
   His address was for an event to honor a former secretary of
state, Warren Christopher, on the publication of his new book, ``In
the Stream of History.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger acknowledged that the recent American preoccupation with
the overthrow of Saddam was linked to a realization that
Washington's long-term policy of containment of Iraq was under
serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through constant confrontation, our policy of containing Iraq
has been successful,'' Berger said. ``But that does not mean that
by itself it is sustainable over the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded that sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, might not be viable indefinitely. Russia and
France are likely to renew pressure in coming weeks to lift at
least the oil embargo on Iraq if arms inspections now being resumed
there go relatively smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the U.N. Security Council are lukewarm at best
in supporting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this standoff continues,'' Berger said, ``the
harder it will be to maintain the international support we have
built for our policy. Even the toughest of all sanctions regimes in
history becomes harder to sustain over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger's speech follows one on Thursday by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright at Emory University. She said the American
policy of containment of Iraq had changed to one of ``containment
plus regime change.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also said the United States was working with Iraqi
opposition groups. President Clinton first announced that policy
publicly on Nov. 15, when he withdrew the threat of American
bombing of Iraq after Saddam ended a ban on arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Even officials within the administration have doubts about the
efficacy of supporting the splintered Iraqi opposition. But exiles
say that there has been a notable increase in American activity
along those lines as Washington looks for allies in a broader range
of groups than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas Mehdi, chairman of the Union of Independent Iraqis, which
links dozens of small groups based in the United States, said in an
interview Tuesday that exile organizations had been told by
American officials and officials in the region that the American
government had made overtures to several opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   One is a Shiite Muslim organization led by Mohammed Bakir
al-Hakim, based in Iran and apparently operating with the knowledge
of that country's government. Others include Kurdish parties or
parties led by members of Iraq's Kurdish minority.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said in Washington recently that the
open appeal to opposition groups was ``a very fundamental change''
in American policy, but that it was still in its fledgling stages.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who acknowledged that ``change will take time,'' offered
some general incentives to Saddam's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also stand ready to help a new government in Iraq that
respects the rights of its people and meets its obligations to the
world,'' he said. ``We would work to ease economic sanctions
against such a new Iraq as quickly as possible. We would work to
relieve Iraq's massive economic debts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berger's broadest appeal was to Iraq's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At stake is the stability of Arab and Muslim states, our
future relationship with them and our fundamental strategic and
economic interests in the Middle East,'' he said. ``At stake is our
ability to fight terror, avert regional conflict, promote peace and
protect the security of our friends and allies.''

 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theatergoers who admired Diana Rigg's grand, actressy,
haute-couture appearance in the Euripides ``Medea,'' which came to
Broadway from London in 1994, are in for a shock when they see the
``Electra'' now at the Ethel Barrymore Theater.
</P>
<P>
   This production also has its quota of high-fashion, post-modern
effects, but neither these, nor the occasional tin-eared line, can
get in the way of the primal intensity of the Sophocles text.
Played without an intermission, ``Electra'' runs only a little more
than 90 minutes, while leaping the centuries with the speed of
light-years.
</P>
<P>
   Though you may come out of the theater quibbling about various
aspects of the production (as I did), you may also be surprised to
find that it haunts your consciousness for days afterward. Not just
the fine, stern, unfancified performances by Zoe Wanamaker and
Claire Bloom, but the play itself.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that it is 2,400 years old or that its concerns seem
arcane in our world, ``Electra'' remains an eerily fundamental,
theatrically dynamic work.
</P>
<P>
   In Electra, daughter of the hero and king, Agamemnon, who was
murdered by her mother, Clytemnestra, and her mother's lover,
Aegisthus, we have a primitive, starkly realized Hamlet figure, one
who has been stripped of all doubts and is committed to revenge.
Also like Hamlet, Electra has become a trial to her family. Though
years have passed since Agamemnon's murder, Electra continues to
mourn him noisily and to harangue anyone who will listen with tales
of the lovers' treachery. There is a curse on the House of Atreus.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Electra is not allowed off the premises of the family
compound. She is a rabid, foul-tempered public spectacle: a tiny,
eccentric wretch, hobbling around in her father's old British Army
greatcoat, which dwarfs her and drags on the ground. The hair she
hasn't yet pulled out of her head in paroxysms of grief stands up
in lunatic tufts. In repose, which isn't often, the figure she cuts
reminds you of Giulietta Masina's Cabiria on a terrible day. Yet
she is anything but pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Electra is a strong, aggressive woman, impatiently awaiting the
return of her brother, Orestes, whom, she sent away for safekeeping
on the day of the murder. He was then a small boy. On this day,
which is the time of the play, the now grown Orestes at last comes
home. The rest of the tragedy can be played out as it must, the
gods appeased and the cycle of violence ended.
</P>
<P>
   Or so audiences in Athens (circa 418 B.C.-410 B.C.) were told by
the Chorus at the end. Contemporary audiences don't have that
reassurance. We have two choices: we can accept the play as we
understand the Athenians saw it, which keeps the events at a polite
distance; or we can see it in our own terms _ violence breeding
violence that breeds more violence, with no end of it in sight, all
set in the interior landscape explored by Freud.
</P>
<P>
   The gods are dead but, for us, the good doctor from Vienna
marches on. For the time being, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sophocles' ``Electra,'' which I had read but never seen before
this production, seems to be a much more vital, more profoundly
disturbing work than any of the ``Medea'' versions I have seen. In
addition to Diana Rigg's, they would include the Robinson Jeffers
adaptation done on Broadway in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Anderson, later to become a real Dame, more or less
declaimed the text in various vocal moods while standing, sitting
and sweeping around in front of a great Mycenae house that looked
like the Supreme Court Building in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medea'' is much less complex in dramatic structure, being
virtually one long monologue audited by the Chorus, the Nurse and
others, and interrupted by the brief appearances of Jason, the
husband, and Creon, the king. No wonder actresses love to play the
role: there is scarcely anybody to upstage them. The actual
dramatic confrontations are kept to a minimum. It is a great show
of conflicted nobility and sacrifice: the woman pays, and dearly.
</P>
<P>
   Euripides is considered to have brought a degree of humanity to
Greek drama lacking in the work of Sophocles, his contemporary. Yet
the ``Electra'' of Sophocles appears to be a far more theatrical
work.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Electra's confrontation with her mother when
Clytemnestra, cool and in complete control of herself, points out
the perfectly reasonable motive for the murder of Agamemnon. Weak
man that he was, she says, he had sacrificed Iphigenia, her
daughter and Electra's sister, to insure fair winds to Troy. She
could never forgive him for that. Why didn't Menelaus, Agamemnon's
brother and the husband of the purloined Helen, sacrifice one of
(italics)his(end italics) children?
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, Electra says in effect. The gods demanded the
sacrifice after Agamemnon shot a deer while hunting in a sacred
grove. Then she backtracks a bit. Even if the story about the deer
is not true, Iphigenia's sacrifice, which made possible the
successful Trojan campaign, was hardly worth the backstairs murder
planned and executed by Clytemnestra and her lover.
</P>
<P>
   The two women are equals in furious family combat, as well as in
the performances by Zoe Wanamaker as Electra and Claire Bloom as
Clytemnestra. Their scene is the production's most stunning and
rewarding section. Ms. Wanamaker suddenly has a living being on
whom she can direct her sarcasm and loathing. It's as if she takes
new heart in hate. She almost struts in her rags with pent-up
satisfaction. Yet as viciously as she attacks, she can never
penetrate the barrier of steely serenity that appears to protect
Clytemnestra.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloom is as spectacular an image in her way as Ms. Wanamaker
is in hers. With her head held high, her right profile turned to
the audience, wearing a skin-tight scarlet gown, she sits in a
once-exquisite, now soiled, satin-backed 18th-century chair amid
the rubble that now clutters the forecourt to the House of Atreus.
Her voice is carefully pitched, almost musical. Electra's is lower,
sandier, as if she slept too many nights outside, using her
father's greatcoat as a sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as effective is the later, tantalizingly drawn out
recognition scene in which Orestes (Michael Cumpsty), identifying
himself only as a friend, turns up in Mycenae to confront Electra
with what he says is the urn containing Orestes' ashes. This sends
Electra off into another fit of grief, the depth of which prompts
Orestes at last to reveal himself.
</P>
<P>
   Their reunion is sweet but necessarily brief; Orestes, attended
by his faithful old servant (Stephen Spinella) and a friend Pylades
(Ivan Stamenov), must dispatch Clytemnestra before the return of
Aegisthus (Daniel Oreskes). When Orestes emerges from the house,
having killed their mother, Electra, in her joy, licks his
blood-splattered arm. Expiation of this kind is intoxicating. The
murder of Aegisthus is something of an anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The production, directed by David Leveaux, began life last year
in England at the Chichester Festival, before moving to the Donmar
Warehouse in London. It was recreated by Leveaux earlier this year
at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., with a new cast
supporting the star. The credits of all concerned are impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The American-born, London-bred Ms. Wanamaker (daughter of the
late Sam Wanamaker) won the Olivier Award for her ``Electra''
performance. Leveaux was the director of the hit Roundabout Theater
Company revival of Eugene O'Neill's ``Anna Christie,'' with Natasha
Richardson and Liam Neeson in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The new adaptation is by Frank McGuinness, the Irish playwright
who wrote ``Someone Who'll Watch Over Me,'' as well as the
adaptation of last year's celebrated revival of ``A Doll's House''
with Janet McTeer.
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness' adaptation of ``Electra'' is laudably clean,
efficient and free of hackneyed language most of the time, but
adaptations of this sort are tricky. A single misstep can throw you
off for minutes at a time as when, at the beginning of the play,
Orestes says of the House of Atreus, ``Let me put this house back
on its feet.'' Back on its feet? A house? But maybe that was a
last-minute insert to touch corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wanamaker and Ms. Bloom are splendid. Also extremely good
are Marin Hinkle, as Electra's loyal, pragmatic sister,
Chrysothemis, and Pat Carroll as the Chorus. Cumpsty and Spinella
are both fine actors, but they are unfortunately miscast, possibly
even misdirected.
</P>
<P>
   Cumpsty is too old to play with conviction an Orestes gone, one
would suspect, no more than 20 years. He also seems physically
uncomfortable in those stylized moments when, remaining still,
supposedly attending the action or speech of another, he seems as
inanimate as a totem pole.
</P>
<P>
   As Spinella was too young to play the lawyer in the recent
revival of ``A View From the Bridge,'' he is even more out of the
age bracket to be convincing as Orestes' loyal old servant. There
is nothing much wrong with his readings, but his voice is youthful.
</P>
<P>
   In some perverse way, this is made even more obvious by the
remarkably snowy-white hair that he is now sporting. Hair of that
fluffy brilliance may be home grown but it looks as if it had been
picked in a cotton field.
</P>
<P>
   The post-modern set by Johan Engels (who also did the costume
design), which takes a bit of time getting used to, is visually
arresting and works quite well. This House of Atreus looks like the
brick-walled back alley of a great antique store.
</P>
<P>
   The store may front on a fashionable boulevard, but the alley is
a mess. Among the debris: wrecked chairs of worthy provenance and a
slab of marble leaning against the remnant of an ancient column, in
this way to suggest a partly collapsed bier.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Wanamaker's Electra, it intrigues the mind as well as
the eye. Far better this than another mockup of the Supreme Court
Building. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>

   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &QL;
<P>
   Diana Son's ``Stop Kiss,'' now at the Shiva Theater in the
Joseph Papp Public Theater, is an artfully constructed, well acted
comedy-drama that has been directed with skill by Joe Bonney. I
suspect it could move tomorrow to a larger house for an extended
run.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of piece that makes people feel good in direct
relation to the pain they suffer vicariously after each situation
that makes them laugh. Read on; you will understand what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   At its center: the brutal beating of two young women (one of
whom may never fully recover) on a park bench in Greenwich Village
at 4 a.m. The perpetrator: a young thug who seems to have gone
berserk at the sight of their kissing. The words he called them
can't be reported in a family newspaper, though gay-bashing can and
is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that near-fatal kiss was the first time that Callie
(Jessica Hecht) and Sara (Sandra Oh) had openly acknowledged the
extent and meaning of their feelings for each other. It seems that
Sara, a third-grade teacher newly arrived from St. Louis, has known
she was gay for some time.
</P>
<P>
   For Callie, who delivers traffic reports for an all-news radio
station, the awareness that she loves another woman is a great
liberating breakthrough. She is tired of meeting her old college
friend George just for sex, while dating other guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop Kiss,'' which is performed without an intermission, is
cannily composed of short scenes that recall how Callie and Sara
met and fell in love, alternating with scenes that follow the
progression of the police investigation and Sara's rehabilitation.
There is never any doubt about what happens, only about the
physical and emotional consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Son writes insistently quirky dialogue for ordinary people
in a commonplace world that suddenly reveals its ugliness. Yet for
all of the play's honesty and largeness of spirit, something about
it doesn't ring quite true: ``Stop Kiss'' has been nontraditionally
cast in the way of a progressive television sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Callie is white, Sara is Asian, Callie's lover, George, is
black, though there is never a single mention of these important
differences or of the polarized world they inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   This can't be explained away by the fact that Callie and her
friends live in the Village and its environs. Rather, it seems to
suggest that Callie, Sara, George and the others exist in a world
as unreal and disconnected as that of a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or Ms. Son is saying that this is the way things
should be. Here, only gay-bashing is acknowledged. Life is perfect
except for one thing, and because of that one thing, Sara may be a
wheelchair case for life.
</P>
<P>
   There is possibly more to be said in ``Stop Kiss'' than Ms. Son
has yet written. Even at this stage, though, the play demonstrates
a professionalism you don't often find downtown or up.

CHRISTMAS COULD MAKE OR BREAK GARDEN BOTANIKA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CONSTANCE SOMMER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This holiday shopping season could determine the
future of Garden Botanika, the troubled bed and bath retail chain
based in Redmond, Wash., the company's president said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a fragile state,'' said Michael Luce, president and
chief executive. ``Certainly the holiday season is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Incorporated in 1990, Garden Botanika today owns and operates
274 stores across the country, selling products ranging from
cosmetics and fragrances to skin care items, bath and body care
goods and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing natural ingredients and targeting young working
women, the company looked promising enough for investors to bid its
stock up to $35 a share soon after it went public in May 1996. But
continued financial losses _ coupled with the closing of eight
stores this year and the conversion of five others into clearance
centers _ steadily drove the share price down well below a dollar.
It closed Tuesday at 62.5 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Now more store closings may be in the offing. In a report filed
on Dec. 1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Garden
Botanika said it plans to close an undisclosed number of stores
before the end of its fiscal year, on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following the holiday season, the Company plans to review the
productivity of each of its stores with a view toward closing those
stores that fail to meet performance standards,'' Garden Botanika
wrote in the report.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company is banking on November and December's sales
figures to stave off a possible bankruptcy filing, Luce
acknowledged yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's out of the question,'' he said. ``But I
don't think that's likely at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   That's largely because the company's most recent sales figures
are not spelling out disaster, he said. November sales decreased by
3 percent compared to the same month the year before, but Garden
Botanika attributed most of the decline to the last week of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal customers who joined the company's discount sales program
may be responsible for much of that downturn, as well as for the
leap in sales on Tues., Dec. 1, Luce said. The program promises 20
percent off all purchases by members on the first Tuesday of every
month.
</P>
<P>
   Had the company's accounting period extended through Dec. 1, the
picture would be considerably more upbeat, he said. Luce refused to
discuss December's sales numbers so far.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Botanika rings up as much as half of its yearly business
in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ends on Jan. 30. The retail
industry average is slightly less than 25 percent of sales occuring
during the holiday season, according to the National Retail
Federation.

PHILADELPHIA TO GET NEXT DISNEYQUEST THEME PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co., underscoring its strategy of
diversifying its hugely successful theme parks, has decided to
expand its DisneyQuest indoor theme parks with a new site in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant will announce today that it plans to
open a five-story, 80,000-square-foot facility in the City of
Brotherly Love by the summer of 2000. The first DisneyQuest opened
in Orlando, Fla., in June, and another under construction in
Chicago is set to open next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to move ahead with the concept highlights Disney's
relentless pursuit of a broader customer base than the families
that flock to its theme parks in Florida, Southern California,
Japan and France. DisneyQuests include a gravity-defying virtual
roller coaster dubbed CyberSpace Mountain and a Virtual Jungle
Cruise on air-supported rafts paddled through roaring rivers and
surrounded by dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiNunzio, vice president of Disney Imagineering, said the
Philadelphia facility will feature several attractions not seen in
Florida but retain the core concept. He also said the pace of
expansion might pick up beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build a national brand with a presence in
large metropolitan markets,'' he said. ``Florida's been a great
laboratory for us. We're being asked to look at additional sites,
so I think we will accelerate our expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNunzio said customer reactions to the first DisneyQuest have
been high with CyberSpace Mountain and the Create Zone, a studio
area where customers can design their own attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has broadened its portfolio of attractions in recent
years with the Club Disney play-park chain, a cruise line, Animal
Kingdom in Florida and the ESPN stores and restaurants. It is
building a California Adventure park in the parking lot at
Disneyland in Anaheim that is scheduled to open in 2001.

AMY FISHER SEEKS TRIAL AND CLAIMS AFFAIR WITH LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
   (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Amy Fisher is seeking to withdraw her guilty
plea and go to trial over the 1992 shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco,
charging that her former lawyer, Eric Naiburg, lied to her and had
a sexual relationship with her that clouded his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher, 23, made the charges in an affidavit filed Tuesday
in Nassau County Court by her new lawyer, Bruce Barket, who argued
that Naiburg's personal and sexual relationship with Ms. Fisher
constituted a conflict of interest that interfered with his ability
to effectively represent her.
</P>
<P>
   All of the charges were denied Tuesday by Naiburg, who said he
was stunned by the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Barket said that Naiburg lied to Ms. Fisher when he told her
that if she agreed to plead guilty to assault and illegal
possession of a weapon, the Nassau County district attorney's
office would agree to help her enter a work-release program and
obtain parole within three years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that Naiburg's interest in his client was obscured
by their relationship. ``Rather than consider all possible
strategies available to the defense,'' Barket said in his argument,
``Naiburg became obsessed with personally exploring Ms. Fisher's
sexual proclivities in a manner designed to satiate his own
perverse needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office has repeatedly denied that anyone
ever promised Naiburg help in getting Ms. Fisher into a
work-release program. The district attorney, Denis Dillon, said
that he intended to oppose the motion and would file the necessary
response in due course.
</P>
<P>
   If the case does go to trial, Ms. Fisher, if found guilty of the
original charge of attempted murder, could be sentenced to 12 1/2
to 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit he signed several months ago, Naiburg said he
had had an informal agreement with John Klein, the prosecutor in
the case, on the matter of early parole. Reached by telephone
Tuesday at his office in Hauppauge, Naiburg reiterated that he had
such an informal agreement, but described it as ``unenforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an understanding that if Miss Fisher behaved herself
in prison, Dillon would support parole,'' Naiburg said. ``However,
Amy committed at least 30 violations of prison rules by the time
she first came up for parole.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher admitted to shooting Mrs. Buttafuoco, the wife of her
lover, Joey Buttafuoco, in May 1992. Prosecutors had charged that
Ms. Fisher committed the crime after Buttafuoco decided to end
their affair. A bullet remains lodged in Mrs. Buttafuoco's neck,
but she has recovered from her injuries, and she and her husband,
who served four months in jail for statutory rape, have since moved
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In her affidavit, Ms. Fisher said that within a week of being
released on bail from the Nassau County jail in 1992, she began an
intense relationship with Naiburg that included kissing and the
acting out of sexual fantasies. But, she said, they did not engage
in intercourse ``because he said he did not want to do to me what
Joey did to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Naiburg denied all of the charges in Ms. Fisher's two-page
affidavit. ``These statements are a desperate attempt by a
desperate woman to gain her freedom without regard to human
decency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am offended, angry and beside myself. There is not one line
of truth in the entire affidavit. Each line, chapter and verse, is
a lie,'' Naiburg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of the last of a long line of individuals of whom she
has alleged improper conduct,'' he said, noting that the most
recent to be accused of sexual misconduct by Ms. Fisher were eight
prison officers. He said the accusations were ``dismissed as being
incredible, as will be the charges against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher, who is serving a 10-to-15 year term in the state
correction facility in Albion, provided Barket with dozens of
poems, notes and letters that Naiburg sent to her in prison over
the last six years. One of the poems submitted to the court to show
that Naiburg was besotted with Ms. Fisher included the following
lines:
</P>
<P>
   I came to know a different Amy
</P>
<P>
   One as charming as the devil
</P>
<P>
   I came to care quite a bit
</P>
<P>
   And that is on the level!
</P>
<P>
   Naiburg said Tuesday that he regretted writing to Ms. Fisher and
described the release of the poems as ``embarrassing.'' But he said
the correspondence in no way suggested an improper relationship or
indicated that he was acting other than as ``a friend, a father
figure trying desperately to cheer her up when she was morose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited her on many occasions and sometimes I would put my
arm around her or kiss her on top of the head, but only in a
fatherly way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State law governing professional conduct by lawyers does not
specifically prohibit them from having sexual affairs with clients,
court officials said. But various elements of the law have been
invoked occasionally to discipline lawyers who were involved
sexually with clients.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are required to maintain independence from a client, for
example, and to avoid a personal interest in litigation. They are
also supposed to avoid conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of misconduct against lawyers are investigated by
disciplinary or grievance committees created by the Appellate
Division of the state court system. After investigation, a case
goes to an independent panel that holds hearings and issues a
report, with recommendations on possible penalties. Final decisions
are made by judges in the Appellate Division. Penalties in such
cases can range from censure to suspension to disbarment.

AT&AMP;T BUYING IBM'S NETWORK IN $5 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire the global
data network of IBM Corp. for $5 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also said they had agreed to provide each
other $9 billion in outsourcing business.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 people, many of them in the Northeast, would
change employers under the agreement, with 5,000 people
transferring from IBM to AT&AMP;T and at least 2,000 going from AT&AMP;T to
IBM. Most of those workers would, however, stay in substantially
the same jobs and would probably not have to move.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, Tuesday's agreement seemed to be the fourth corner
piece of the puzzle that Michael Armstrong has been trying to put
together to make sense of the company's future since he took over
as chairman last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he arrived at AT&AMP;T, the No. 1 long-distance
company, Armstrong said the company needed to strengthen its
strategies for breaking into the local communications market, for
expanding its international presence and for beefing up its
advanced data services, especially those based on Internet
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, AT&AMP;T has agreed to acquire Teleport
Communications Group Inc., a local phone company for businesses,
and Tele-Communications Inc., which as the No. 2 cable television
company has links into millions of homes. The company also formed a
$10 billion joint venture for the international market with British
Telecommunications, Britain's biggest phone company. With the IBM
deal, AT&AMP;T is now set to make a serious splash in the data market.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Internet service, which is a major part of its data
network, has more than a million individual users in 59 countries.
More important, it has local dial-up ports into its network all
over the world. That is a big plus in attracting the large
corporate customers that are the grand prize for communications
companies.
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, the No. 1 computer company, Tuesday's agreement ended
an auction process that publicly began in September, when the
company said it had hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to vet bids for its
network. As the pace of technological change continued to
accelerate in both the communications and the computer industries,
IBM decided that it no longer made sense to run a communications
system of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this agreement, the network will receive the management
focus and resources necessary to maintain its standing as a
world-class provider of connectivity to IBM and millions of
customers,'' Louis Gerstner, IBM's chairman, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 employees of the IBM network business that will switch
to AT&AMP;T are equally distributed, according to an IBM spokesman,
among Somers, N.Y.; Schaumburg, Ill., and Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   According to AT&AMP;T, the IBM network will generate about $1.2
billion in revenue from IBM's existing customers in the first year
after the deal is completed. The companies expect to finish the
deal around the middle of next year. Because the IBM system also
handles a large amount of IBM's internal corporate communications,
IBM also awarded AT&AMP;T an outsourcing contract for its
communications, worth $5 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, AT&AMP;T, which was advised in the transaction by
Salomon Smith Barney, said it expected a revenue increase of $2.5
billion in the first 12 months after taking ownership of the
network. The company said the deal would not significantly dilute
its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said the sale would not have a significant impact on its
operating results, but at least one analyst expected that the deal
could result in a huge tax bill for IBM. Steven Milunovich, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch, estimated that IBM would report a
capital gain of $4 billion on the network sale, for a tax bill
totaling more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 billion price was near the high end of the range that
analysts had expected the network to bring. But the strategic
elements of the deal hit a nerve in the market Tuesday, and shares
of both companies rose.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a sweetheart deal for IBM,'' said Stephen Dube, an
analyst who follows IBM for Wasserstein Perella. The price, he
said, is more than four times the unit's $1.2 billion annual
revenue, a greater multiple than IBM is worth in the market
overall. ``AT&AMP;T had to do the deal and paid up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But to win IBM's auction, AT&AMP;T had to come to the table with
more than money for the network. It also agreed to outsource to IBM
much of its own software and computer-center operations, to the
tune of $4 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under that part of the agreement, more than 2,000 AT&AMP;T
management employees would go to work for IBM. Most are in Lake
Mary, Fla., and Middletown and Piscataway, N.J., an AT&AMP;T spokesman
said. Another 1,000 unionized AT&AMP;T employees would essentially work
for IBM, but would continue to be paid by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said: ``I think we had to do all these things. I
believe we had to give them top dollar. We did that. We had to put
some outsourcing contracts on the table that were durable and
meaningful, and we did, and we had to do some other things in terms
of working together in approaching small businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Berge Ayvazian, an executive vice president for the Yankee
Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston, said, ``What this
says is that AT&AMP;T recognizes that it is not best of breed on
application development and data-center operations, and IBM is not
best of breed in network services.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in the deal appears to be Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp., the Japanese giant that is the world's largest
telephone company. The telecommunications industry has been waiting
for years to see what NTT might do to expand overseas in a big way.
NTT is one of the largest subcontractors in putting together the
IBM network, so it will have increased ties with AT&AMP;T after the
deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong refused to tip his hand but said, ``There is no
question that the relationship of the network to NTT will
strengthen the relationship between AT&AMP;T and NTT.''

WORLD ILLITERACY RISING AS CHILDREN ARE DEPRIVED OF SCHOOLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story, sent and held yesterday, is now released for
publication; the time elements have been updated.)

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Nearly one-sixth of the 5.9 billion people in
the world cannot read or write, according to a survey published
Tuesday by Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   The study predicts that illiteracy rates will steadily grow into
the next century because only one of every four children in the
poorest nations is now in school. More than half those denied
educations are girls, Unicef, the United Nations children's fund,
says in its annual report, ``The State of the World's Children
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found worsening educational conditions in the former
Soviet Union, where levels had been high.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from deepening divisions between rich computerized
societies and those in the Third World without even the rudimentary
tools of knowledge, the report says, illiteracy has a direct
relationship to important health indicators and fertility rates.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming percentage of illiterates are in countries with
high population growth like India and Pakistan, where better
education for women and children could significantly reduce other
problems, the study reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10-percentage-point increase in girls' primary enrollment
can be expected to decrease infant mortality by 4.1 deaths per
1,000, and a similar rise in girls' secondary enrollment by another
5.6 deaths per 1,000,'' the report says. ``This would mean
concretely, in Pakistan for example, that an extra year of
schooling for 1,000 girls would ultimately prevent roughly 60
infant deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Fertility drops sharply as education rises, Unicef says. In
Brazil, the report found, illiterate women have an average of 6.5
children, and mothers with secondary-school educations have an
average of 2.5 children.
</P>
<P>
   Unicef and other organizations that work with children say
education should be guaranteed under the 1989 Convention on the
Rights of the Child. But the intentions of that treaty are being
overwhelmed by a host of problems, including economic crises in
countries like Russia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread ethnic conflict has made refugees of millions of
children and destroyed their schools at a time when international
aid for education projects is decreasing. Uprooted children are
often turned into soldiers by military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, is
lobbying governments to add money for classrooms for refugees and
communities where displaced people eventually return.
</P>
<P>
   Education often has to compete with more pressing immediate
needs like food and shelter, although refugee experts agree that
one of the most effective ways to create a sense of stability and
normality among displaced children, many of them orphans, is to
establish classrooms, however rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Schooling is also often denied to young people because
governments do not give schools a high priority or make it easy for
families to send children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often when we interview street kids they say they are on the
street because they were kicked out of school,'' said Yodon
Thonden, counsel in the children's rights division of Human Rights
Watch, a rights group in New York. ``Free education is not
necessarily compulsory, and sometimes there are costs, which places
education beyond the reach of many families, costs of things like
books or uniforms or shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its survey, Unicef found that once high educational levels
were in ``free fall'' in the countries that made up the Soviet
Union, as costs rise, unpaid or poorly paid teachers are
demoralized and buildings become dilapidated.

EX-MOUSKETEER DARLENE ON TRIAL FOR SECURITIES FRAUD SCHEME
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (bl) 
By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five afternoons a week, for four years in the
1950s and in countless re-runs since, Darlene Gillespie and her
fellow Mousketeers came bouncing out of television sets all over
the country, inviting baby boomers to ``come along and sing our
song and join our family,'' as members of Walt Disney's original
``Mickey Mouse Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ms. Gillespie, 57, sat alone and sober at the defense
table in a federal courtroom here, listening to closing arguments
in her trial on charges of securities fraud, conspiracy, perjury
and obstruction of justice stemming from what prosecutors say was a
scheme to buy stock without paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   And when she took a deep breath and let out a wistful sigh, that
old pledge of ``Forever let us hold our banner high!'' seemed a
long time ago indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its core,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Weiss told the
jury in his summation, ``this case comes down to a series of
lies,'' adding, ``Your job is to sort through the thicket of her
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that in 1992 and 1993, Ms. Gillespie and
her longtime fiance, Jerry Fraschilla, devised a scheme to
``free-ride'' by buying stock in a high-tech motor-making company
called Unique Mobility using bad checks and a made-up identity, in
the hope that run-ups in the stock price would let them profit
before their brokers caught on, while the brokers would be stuck
with any losses. Last month, Fraschilla, 61, was sentenced to 18
months in prison and ordered to pay $65,000 in restitution after
pleading guilty to 21 counts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Gillespie's lawyer, Charles Rondeau, told the jury
Tuesday that his client was the innocent victim of misleading
brokers and an unscrupulous boyfriend, as he declared, ``It is not
a crime to love the wrong people. The fact that she still lives
with Mr. Fraschilla is proof of the power he has over her.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Ms. Gillespie declined to be interviewed,
but this case is neither her first brush with the law nor the first
bump on the long road from her days with Bobby, Annette, Tommy,
Cubby and the rest, to a failed attempt as a country-western
performer, two decades as a surgical nurse, a fruitless, years-long
campaign to win residual payments from Disney and finally
conviction with Fraschilla last year on unrelated shoplifting
charges for stealing four women's shirts from a Macy's in Ventura,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Burgess, one of the original Mousketeers, who went on to
star as a dancer on ``The Lawrence Welk Show,'' and still performs
with other Welk veterans in Branson, Mo., told the Associated Press
that Ms. Gillespie had talent but bad luck. ``It made me want to
reach out and give her a big hug,'' he said. ``Maybe she fell in
with the wrong company.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, life has not been all milk and cookies for Ms.
Gillespie since her original run on the Mouse Club, broadcast
weekday afternoons on ABC from 1955 to 1959. Things began
promisingly enough: In the 1955-56 season, Ms. Gillespie was
featured in one of the program's regular serialized stories within
the show, ``Corky and White Shadow,'' about a sheriff's daughter
and her German shepherd and co-starring Buddy Ebsen.
</P>
<P>
   But in a suit she filed in 1990 against Disney and later settled
out of court, Ms. Gillespie contended that the studio failed to
promote her career as promised, and that as a result she never
became as famous as Annette Funicello, the beach-blanket sweetheart
who was the only Mousketeer kept on contract after the show ended
and who now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Official Mickey Mouse Club Book,'' by Lorraine Santoli,
Ms. Gillespie discussed her ambivalence about the Mouse Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the show was syndicated on television, I never told my
children that the pigtailed girl named Darlene was their mom,'' she
said. ``I thought perhaps it would embarrass them, or that they
would think the show silly.'' But she added that her children liked
the show and were proud when they eventually learned her secret,
``and that made it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   The original episodes remain in circulation today on the ``Vault
Disney'' feature on the Disney Channel, but as a contract player,
like most others in television from those days, Ms. Gillespie earns
no payments from the reruns, and she is currently suing both Disney
and the Screen Actors Guild in federal court in an effort to force
an arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply haven't paid her her due,'' Rondeau said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But in his closing argument Tuesday, the government prosecutor,
Weiss, said Ms. Gillespie took more than her due, or as he put it,
``Defendant Darlene Gillespie got greedy.'' Together with
Fraschilla, he said, Ms. Gillespie bought stock with defaced checks
they knew would eventually bounce, and conspired to create a
fictitious person to buy shares as well, a Michael Andrews, named
for a real Arkansas man who was the ex-husband of a woman
Fraschilla once tried to date, and then gave their creation the
Social Security number of the real Andrews' ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition to the Securities and Exchange Commission in
1993, when it began investigating the suspected trades, Ms.
Gillespie swore she had met Andrews at Fraschilla's office. But in
the trial last week, the real Andrews testified that he had never
met Ms. Gillespie or even been to California, or ever owned a share
of stock in his life. Ms. Gillespie's lawyer insisted Tuesday that
Fraschilla's late secretary, Ann Preble, had indeed introduced Ms.
Gillespie to a man named Michael Andrews, and that his client knew
nothing about any such deception. And he repeated Ms. Gillespie's
assertion that she wrote checks on a bank account with insufficient
funds to buy stocks on credit from one broker only on assurances
from that broker that the checks would not be deposited right away,
and with the understanding that they were effectively backed by her
holdings at another brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's case is all about what they argue are similar
circumstances,'' to their case against Fraschilla, Rondeau said.
``When you look at all the facts, you will see that they simply do
not support an intent to defraud.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gregory Bestor Craig, the newly hired special White
House counsel, brought a fresh and open face, an eager-to-please
earnestness, and a sackful of secondhand contrition to the House
Judiciary Committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His political skills were evident as he took a novel tack for a
presidential lawyer and spoke in familiar, even friendly terms
about what was ``very important to get straight.'' His legal skills
were evident as he politely challenged subtle assumptions in
Republican questions and gingerly disposed of inquiries about
``intimate touching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will now push the button of my mike,'' Craig said with a
disarming grin, after nervously beginning his defense only to
discover that he was performing unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would help,'' replied a suddenly indulgent Henry Hyde,
the committee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his unslicked silver thatch and unusual willingness
to address details of accusations against Clinton, when Craig came
up against the walls of the president's legal and political box, he
would go no further _ just like any other Clinton defender.
</P>
<P>
   Did Clinton ``lie to the American people people when he said, `I
never had sex with that woman?''' asked Rep. Bob Inglis of South
Carolina, and a pained expression darted across Craig's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he doesn't believe he did,'' Craig said, embarking
on an explication of dictionary definitions of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis was not impressed. ``You're taking back all of his
apologies,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   On display Tuesday were all the attributes with which Craig, who
was hired in September, has won over once-skeptical White House
aides. But those qualities may not have worked as well on the
audience that the White House is most concerned about, the
Republican moderates who will decide the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   It was an indication of Craig's ingenuous charm that he could,
with a straight face and no whiff of irony, appeal to the hardened
members of the House's most ideologically riven committee to ``open
your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was an indication of Craig's pedigree and connections
that, according to a White House official, one of the witnesses,
Samuel Beers, taught him at Harvard College, while another, Bruce
Ackerman, taught him at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Connections brought Craig to the White House. He knew President
Clinton from his days at Yale, and was close to Hillary Rodham
Clinton. She turned over space in her suite of offices to him when
he agreed to join the defense team.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal lawyer and onetime Capitol Hill staff member who was
most recently a senior State Department official, Craig bargained
hard for authority before he accepted the White House job,
insisting that he would report directly to the president, White
House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton announced that Craig would ``quarterback'' his
defense, his new colleagues began referring rather derisively to
him as ``The QB,'' a nickname that has stuck.
</P>
<P>
   In this Arkansas-inflected White House, it did not help Craig
that he is resolutely preppy, with a fondness for sweaters and
expressions like ``varsity effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have been toast,'' one of his White House peers
reflected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for the most part, he has fit in. ``It's a real tribute
to his temperament and his talent that he has gotten such universal
acceptance,'' said Paul Begala, a White House counselor.
</P>
<P>
   There is still some tension, White House aides said, between
Craig and Charles Ruff, the White House counsel. But for the most
part Craig, Ruff and David Kendall, the president's private lawyer,
have managed to divide responsibility among themselves. Any
disputes are refereed by John Podesta, the chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the monthslong divide between the political and legal
sides of Clinton's defense has been sealed up, partly because of
Craig's ability to mediate between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg comes pretty close to being fluent in both languages,''
said another senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``He's got a good political sense.''
</P>
<P>
   And his preppiness has begun to seem endearing, this aide said.
``I think that while some people in conversations with Greg might
think they'd been a member of a different fraternity than him in
college,'' he said, ``they basically like him.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeal was one reason that Craig was selected to open the
president's two-day defense before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a good first impression,'' one White House adviser
said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After congressional criticism that Clinton has not seemed
contrite enough lately, Craig went out of his way to deplore
Clinton's behavior as ``sinful'' and his testimony as
``maddening.''
</P>
<P>
   Several congressmen seemed to warm to this approach, at least at
first. ``Mr. Craig, I'm glad we're getting into facts,'' said Bill
McCollum of Florida, one of the president's most dogged critics. He
and other congressmen seized on Craig's seeming openness to
debating specifics, peppering him with questions about the
president's discussions with Betty Currie, his personal secretary,
and reading him quotations from Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to drag Greg further into it than we anticipated,''
said one senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had expected that the actual line-by-line
defense of the president would be left on Wednesday to Ruff, who is
more steeped in the details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ruff is coming,'' Craig said at one point, trying to
divert his questioners.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen bridled as it became clear that, for all his
approachable manner, Craig would not back away from the president's
contention that he did not commit perjury or obstruct justice when
he concealed his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders believe that he would face prosecution after
leaving office if he made such an acknowledgment. The argument over
perjury _ which turns less on facts than on interpretation _
inevitably sounds like hairsplitting, White House officials said,
since perjury has a precise legal definition. Hence, when the White
House tries to debate perjury, it inevitably irritates the
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bind Craig could not avoid. As he battled accusations
of perjury, he slid toward the legal language he mostly avoided,
arguing that it was important to ``particularize'' such matters.
</P>
<P>
   In carving out space between Ruff and Kendall, Craig has focused
on relations with Congress, White House officials said. The White
House is relying on a loose network of aides, Cabinet secretaries
and former officials to gather intelligence from Capitol Hill and
relay White House arguments against impeachment. Many in this
network are encouraged to refer their congressional contacts to
Craig, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton loyalist said that, in the end, the president would
have to contact wavering House members himself. ``He is still
trying to dodge and bob and weave,'' this person said. ``At some
point, the president is going to have to engage those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig kept his cool throughout the day. At one point he moved
toward the microphone and opened his mouth to answer a
congressman's accusation, then smiled wryly as it became clear the
man would not pause for a response.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally he showed a flash of impatience, as when Bob
Barr of Georgia pressed him on why Clinton had not fired a senior
aide, Sidney Blumenthal. Even then, his manner and grammar were
dignified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to finish,'' Craig said, as Barr talked over him.
``May I?''

 &HT;    Minorities forced to pay higher insurance premiums, report says
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ All across Texas, poor and minority drivers in urban
and rural areas are being forced to buy auto insurance from
companies that generally charge the highest prices, according to a
report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, a member of the House
Insurance Committee, said the report and its analysis of
company-by-company insurance sales in the first three months of
this year show that ``many lower-cost, standard insurers appear to
systematically deny coverage to consumers who live in poor and
minority areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In neighborhoods with a minority population of less than 14.2
percent, more than 84 percent of all drivers are insured by
cheaper, standard policies, the study said. By contrast, in areas
where minority population is 85 percent or greater, only 49.7
percent of drivers are insured by the less costly lines of
insurance, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poorest consumers _ those who most desperately need access
to standard insurance rates to be able to comply with financial
responsibility laws _ are forced to pay the higher rates charged by
non-rate-regulated county mutual insurers'' and the high-risk Texas
Automobile Insurance Plan Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Automobile Insurance Plan Association is a state
program meant to help the worst drivers get insurance, and its
rates are extremely expensive. On average, the study said, rate
regulated rates in Texas in 1997 were $800 a year. Non-rate
regulated rates averaged $1,300 a year or $500 more.
</P>
<P>
   County mutual companies, once made up of groups of individuals
pooling their resources, have become the most likely insurers for
drivers with poor records. Many are now associated with standard
insurance companies that use the county mutuals to insure bad
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The county mutuals tend to have higher rates than standard,
rate-regulated insurers, though generally lower than Texas
Automobile Insurance Plan Association rates.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam, consumer advocates and even insurance industry officials
say there is no correlation between bad driving records and income
or race. Even so, low-income Texans and minority drivers are more
likely to end up with the higher-priced insurance offered by county
mutuals and the automobile insurance plan, Burnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials denied any systematic attempt to
force anyone into higher-priced policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing sinister about their findings,'' Johns said.
Low-income and minority areas of the state ``may be where people
who have less than desirable driving records may live.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns said it would be ludicrous to draw any lines between race
and income and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race, or the color of one's skin, or economic condition has
nothing to do with insurance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Birnbaum, a former state association insurance commissioner,
said regulated insurance companies, those with generally the best
rates, appear to be avoiding low-income and minority areas across
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would the poorest consumers choose to buy from the
highest-cost providers of that product?'' Birnbaum asked. He could
not give details about specific companies because of state law and
a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam also announced a package of proposed laws including a new
system to regulate county mutual insurance rates; stronger laws to
keep good drivers from being forced into county mutuals and other
high-priced insurance; and improved enforcement of the mandatory
liability insurance law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of this study indicate that legislative action is
necessary and appropriate to address availability and affordability
problems in the Texas automobile insurance market,'' Burnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam also called on the Texas Department of Insurance to
investigate the sales practices of nine companies. After Birnbaum
produced a similar report last year, the department investigated
several companies and has proposed a $10 million fine _ the largest
in that department's history _ against Nationwide Insurance for
illegal discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum's report, which was censored to keep company-specific
information secret, was based on company reports to the Insurance
Department. Industry attorneys last year fought to make sure that
the records are secret.
</P>
<P>
   Under a court order and state law, legislators and their staffs
have access to such records for legislative purposes. They are
required to sign confidentiality agreements to use them and face
fines and jail time if they release specific details.
</P>
<P>
   When Burnam announced this year that he would hire Birnbaum to
review the ``millions of pieces of information,'' industry
attorneys sued to prevent that from happening. They argued that
Birnbaum had illegally released records while working for the
insurance department and should not be allowed access to the
company-specific data.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum denied any illegal releases in the past and said he
made certain no company-specific information was in the public
version of his report.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum and other consumer advocates have argued in the past
that consumers should have the right to know how insurers are
setting their prices and treating customers because they sell a
product Texans are required to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance company officials have successfully argued that if
other insurers knew how they were operating, competition would
suffer.

TIME WARNER AND CBS IN PACT ON DIGITAL TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In something of a surprise embrace, Time Warner Cable and CBS
Corp. announced Tuesday that they had signed an agreement for Time
Warner's cable systems to carry the digital television signals of
CBS' 15 television stations, by adding extra channels to the cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agreement will affect few customers now, it is the
first such pact. The television industry is just now starting the
transition from an analog to a digitalized system of signal
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   It comes in the midst of a feud between the cable industry and
some broadcasters over whether cable systems should be required to
carry broadcast stations' digital signals during what is expected
to be a lengthy transition. Federal law already requires cable
operators to carry the analog signals of broadcast stations in
their local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually all television will be transmitted digitally,
enabling networks to offer either high-definition pictures _ which
are vividly clear and detailed _ or additional channels of
programming or data.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, the United States' second-largest cable-systems
operator, has agreed to carry CBS' digital feed in either format.
CBS is producing five National Football League games in
high-definition format and is exploring transmission of added
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the 14 CBS-owned stations are transmitting
digitally now; eight more are expected to be doing so by the end of
1999. CBS hopes the agreement will serve as a model for its
affiliated stations to form similar agreements with Time Warner
systems in their markets, a network spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement involved no financial considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators, faced with the threat of federal ``must carry''
rules forcing them to carry local broadcast stations' digital
offerings, have argued that there is not enough bandwidth to do so
without dropping popular cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner has been upgrading the carrying capacity of its
system, and will be able to carry both the analog and the digital
signals of CBS in areas that have been upgraded, without dropping
anything else, Michael Luftman, vice president for corporate
communications, said.
</P>
<P>
   Upgraded systems will reach about 70 percent of Time Warner's 12
million customers by the end of this year, he said, and the company
expects all its systems to be digitally capable by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In upgraded areas, customers with digital television sets will
receive a slightly clearer picture on that CBS station, and a
greatly enhanced picture on NFL games (or whatever else CBS
eventually decides to broadcast in high-definition format).
Customers with analog TV sets will receive the normal picture.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, where about half the system has been upgraded, CBS'
analog channel would keep its normal place on the dial at Channel
2, and on upgraded systems an additional channel, at the
high-numbered end of the dial, would be added for CBS' digital
fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``If digital television is to flourish, broadcast television and
cable companies must work together to make sure that the signal
makes it to the people who count, our viewers,'' Jonathan Klein,
president of CBS' stations unit, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has been pressing both
industries to work out an accord, so that viewers can receive
digital television, particularly in its high-definition form, as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, William Kennard, chairman of the FCC, said, ``I
am encouraged by this news and hope that other digital carriage
agreements will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and NBC have also been in discussions with cable-system
operators, and both those networks have extensive cable holdings
themselves, so there had been expectations that they would have
come to an agreement before CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Luftman of Time Warner said the company expected the first
buyers of high-definition televisions to be its ``best customers.''
He added, ``The last thing we want is to have people call saying
they spent $8,000 to $10,000 on an HDTV set and they want to be
hooked up, and for us not to be in a position to do it.''

LANDMARK CINERAMA DOME THEATER TO BE PRESERVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Pacific Theatres announced a compromise agreement
with preservation groups over its plan to revamp Hollywood's
Cinerama Dome, the largest movie theater in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific, which originally planned to renovate the dome by
replacing the interior and removing the 86-foot-wide curved screen,
said Tuesday it will retain basic elements of the 937-seat
auditorium and will add state-of-the-art sound, projection,
lighting and acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific executives, who had previously claimed the theater was
outmoded and unable to compete effectively with more modern rivals,
admitted they were impressed by the flood of opposition to changing
the 35-year-old landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been moved by the passion and connection that people
feel for the Cinerama Dome,'' said Michael Forman, chairman of the
chain. ``Our goal always has been to ensure that it is the best
place to see a film in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain has also agreed to scale back the height of the
surrounding retail-entertainment center, which will include a
12-screen multiplex, restaurants and stores. The shopping center
will shrink from four stories to three in order to showcase the
50-foot-high dome. In exchange, preservationists agreed to support
the project.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is the only geodesic dome made entirely out of
concrete. ``The Cinerama Dome is the only theater of its kind in
the world and an important example of futuristic architecture,''
said Linda Dishman, executive director of the Los Angeles
Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   The project, one of several planned for Hollywood, will occupy
most of the massive parking lot surrounding the dome. Construction
will start next spring, with an opening date planned for May 2000.

SECRET REPORT INDICATES HUGHES SPACE CONCERN GAVE CHINA
TECHNOLOGICAL AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret Pentagon report concludes that Hughes
Space and Communications, without proper authorization, gave China
several pieces of technological insight that are crucial to
successful launches of satellites and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes provided a ``defense service'' to China that violated
American standards regarding helping Beijing make better satellites
and missiles, the report said, adding that prior review by the
State Department was required in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The company's assistance to China ``raises national security
concerns both with regard to violating those standards and to
potentially contributing to China's missile capabilities,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, in 1995, Hughes scientists helped
Chinese engineers to improve the sophisticated mathematical models
necessary to predict the effects of wind, high-atmosphere buffeting
and other natural forces on a rocket launch.
</P>
<P>
   These formulas are important to designing nuclear missiles and
launching satellites that do not explode or break apart. They help
technicians calculate the appropriate angle of launch, the shape of
the nose cone of the rocket, the tolerable limits of weather and
other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, the Pentagon said, had been using an
``oversimplified'' mathematical analysis that resulted in a series
of failed satellite launches. Hughes pointed out the shortcoming to
the Chinese in 1995, when its scientists helped investigate the
failed launch of a Hughes commercial communication satellite atop a
Chinese rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The company, and other American aerospace concerns, were eager
to use Chinese rockets because they are cheaper than American or
European competitors, but only if they could be made reliable. The
Pentagon report said that contact between Hughes engineers and
Chinese scientists allowed the Chinese to gain ``specific insight
into specific launch vehicle design and operational problems and
corrective actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says Hughes showed Chinese scientists flaws in
the way they were attaching the cargo to the rockets themselves,
including the strength of the rivets they used and the shape of the
nose cone. In the case of the Chinese launches, the cargo was
satellites, but the technology is also applicable to attaching a
nuclear warhead to a missile.
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified version of the Pentagon report was made
available by a government official who favors tighter controls on
satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for Hughes, which has denied any wrongdoing in
the case, said that the company's actions were approved at the time
by the Commerce Department, which she said was the ``appropriate
licensing authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report did not say whether China had used the
information for military purposes but it said it was not likely
thay the transfer had altered the strategic military balance
between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it taught them how to do, which they evidently didn't
know how to do, is analysis on the stresses on a launch vehicle as
it goes into the upper atmosphere,'' said one administration
official, who added that what Hughes taught the Chinese ``could be
directly applicable to military systems, although we have no
information that it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been examining whether Hughes and
Loral Space and Communications violated export laws when they
helped Chinese rocket scientists understand the causes of another
failed launch in 1996. That investigation has now been expanded to
include whether Hughes violated export control laws in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report is the first indication that Hughes gave
China valuable information in 1995 about another failed launch and
provides the most detailed account to date of what the Chinese
might have gained from their contacts with the American aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon did not see the entire picture. Some relevant
Hughes documents, unavailable for the Pentagon review, are being
analyzed separately by intelligence officials as part of the
criminal investigation, which subpoenaed them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its limitations, the Pentagon report is likely to
provide fresh ammunition to critics of President Clinton's 1996
decision to loosen controls over satellite exports to China, a
decision for which Hughes officials campaigned heavily within the
administration and which Congress reversed this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our suspicions that technology can be transferred in these
situations, that you can improve the reliability of Chinese
rockets/missiles, were well founded,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., who is chairman of a Senate committee that has examined
the issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The story of technology transfers has its beginnings in 1992,
when a Chinese-launched satellite exploded and Hughes conducted an
investigation for China. At the time, however, the investigation
was monitored by a Pentagon official who restricted the flow of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when the next rocket exploded for what the
Pentagon said were identical reasons, the Commerce Department
approved an accident review by Hughes without consulting the State
Department. The Commerce Department has acknowledged that this was
a mistake. As a result no Pentagon monitors attended the sessions
with the Chinese. The Commerce Department has acknowledged that
this was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in 1995 the CIA ignored warnings by one of its
scientists, Ronald Pandolfi, that Hughes may have provided crucial
ballistic missile technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   Pandolfi has now emerged as a key witness in the criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A Hughes document obtained by investigators in connection with
the 1995 review indicates that Hughes officials disliked the idea
of government monitors, according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the chairman of Hughes, C. Michael Armstrong, led a
lobbying effort to ease controls over satellite exports by shifting
authority from the State Department, which requires monitors, to
the less restrictive Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton named Armstrong to head his prestigious export
council. At the council's first meeting, on Feb. 13, 1995, Clinton
said ``I don't think we've done nearly enough'' on easing export
controls, according to a White House e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   That same day Hughes provided its first ``failure presentation''
to Chinese officials. By July, the company had completed its final
report. A month later the Commerce Department gave its blessing to
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   But Pandolfi, the CIA analyst, didn't like what he saw when he
visited Hughes' scientists in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they told him they were sharing and how far the company
had been willing to go, he thought it was questionable from the
standpoint of national security,'' said an associate of Pandolfi.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency killed Pandolfi's study and no one in Washington
paid any more attention to the issue. The Hughes report, though,
was carefully read in China.
</P>
<P>
   According to an administration official, the Chinese adopted the
recommendations contained in the Hughes report.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of satellite exports to China became the subject of
increased scrutiny last spring, after The New York Times reported
on the Justice Department inquiry into the 1996 review by Loral and
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the Senate subcommittee on proliferation looked into
the 1995 Hughes launch.
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, the under secretary of commerce for export
administration, told the panel that Hughes' release of its report
to the Chinese was ``appropriate and without risk to national
security,'' but his department should have referred the matter to
the State Department for prior review.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials told the committee that they had just
received the Hughes material from the Commerce Department a few
hours earlier so they could not yet assess the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Dorfman, the vice chairman of Hughes, assured the
committee ``no material technology was transmitted to the Chinese
that would help them build missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, in the wake of Congressional inquiries, Pandolfi
told his superiors that he had relevant information, including
detailed contemporaneous notes taken during his trip to Hughes in
1995. He was questioned by agents of the U.S. Customs Service and
aides of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they next wanted to question officials at
Hughes about what Pandolfi had learned on his trip. But before
those interviews took place someone at the CIA alerted Hughes _ a
major supplier of spy satellites to the intelligence community _ to
the investigators' next move.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the interviews at Hughes never took place. But now
the agency's tip-off is part of an investigation into whether the
CIA obstructed the investigations of Hughes. Agency officials deny
the CIA intended to obstruct any investigation.

   STOCKS FALL ON CONCERN ABOUT SLOWDOWN IN EXPORTS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for the first time in three sessions, led by Procter
&AMP; Gamble and other companies that depend on exports, after Union
Carbide warned that slow Asian sales would crimp fourth-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.49 points, or 0.5
percent, to 9,027.98. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped
6.32 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,181.38. The Nasdaq composite
index declined 5.89 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,034.75. In the
bond market, Treasury prices rose as the yield on the benchmark
30-year issue fell to 4.99 percent, the lowest since Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stock market and Broadcast.com plan to encourage
companies to make quarterly earnings conference calls accessible
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   TIME WARNER TO ADD DIGITAL SIGNALS
</P>
<P>
   In something of a surprise embrace, Time Warner Cable and CBS
announced that they had signed an agreement for Time Warner's cable
systems to carry the digital television signals of CBS' 15
television stations by adding extra channels to the cable systems.
Although the agreement will affect few customers now, it is the
first such pact.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA TO ISSUE INTERNATIONAL BOND
</P>
<P>
   Barring last-minute changes, China will raise at least $500
million from foreign investors on Wednesday, becoming the first
Asian country to issue an international bond since Russia devalued
its currency and defaulted on its debt in August. Moreover, it is
set to pay a lower interest rate than South Korea, Thailand or
other neighbors would if they tried to raise money now.
</P>
<P>
   INQUIRY INTO LONG-TERM CAPITAL
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management, the troubled hedge fund rescued at
the height of this fall's stock- and bond-market turmoil, has
continued to generate profits for the Wall Street banks that
injected fresh capital in September. But some government regulators
are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the
near-collapse of the hedge fund, people directly involved in the
matter said.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHTER RULES URGED FOR AUDITORS
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that some auditors may no longer be independent from
clients, securities regulators are questioning whether accountants
can police themselves and have asked the United States' five
largest accounting firms to strengthen internal controls.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT ASSAILS COMPUTER EXPERT
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Microsoft could not shake a computer-science expert
from his argument that Internet software should not be included as
part of the software giant's Windows operating system. David
Farber, a senior faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania,
argued that ``in general, designers have a huge amount of
flexibility in how to package these files.'' Central to the
government's antitrust suit is the contention that the company
bundled Internet software with Windows to put competitors at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   MANUFACTURERS ARE LESS UPBEAT
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are less optimistic about the coming year,
expecting revenues to rise at a slower pace than in 1998, while
nonmanufacturing companies are more upbeat, according to the
National Association of Purchasing Management. Three out of five
manufacturers said they were ``concerned'' or ``worried'' about
their prospects for next year, according to the group's semiannual
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ADVERTISING FIGURE TO STEP DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Sloves, a consummate ``suit'' with a strong creative
sensibility, who has been one of the leading figures on Madison
Avenue since the 1960s, is stepping down at the shop that he helped
to expand substantially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSUIT AGAINST AVANT PROCEEDS
</P>
<P>
   A federal court blocked Avant from selling its Aquarius software
and said a lawsuit brought by Cadence Design Systems that accused
Avant of copyright infringement and theft of trade secrets could
proceed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House opened its formal defense of
President Clinton Tuesday, addressing in detail for the first time
the facts and issues of the impeachment case against Clinton and
adopting a more conciliatory tone in testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers and three panels of anti-impeachment witnesses
conducted a grueling day-into-night tutorial for the 37-member
committee on why Clinton should not be removed from office for his
admitted misconduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as no fancy language can obscure the simple fact that
what the president did was morally wrong,'' said Gregory Craig, the
White House special counsel who led the defense effort Tuesday,
``no amount of rhetoric can change the legal reality that there are
no grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers assembled a battery of witnesses who
virtually conceded that Clinton's behavior was reprehensible, but
said his private misconduct was a less grave threat to the nation
than preventing the president from serving his tarnished final two
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders tried to blur the hard edges of
Clinton's fundamental point of defense _ that he misbehaved and
misled, but did not obstruct justice or commit perjury. His conduct
was surely sinful, said Craig, but just as certainly not
impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Tuesday night that Clinton is likely to
make some public comment on the committee's deliberations, perhaps
offering an additional statement of remorse to temper lingering
concerns among wavering Republicans. Officials did not say when or
in what form the president's remarks might come.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Craig and his swarm of nine friendly witnesses was
trying to put a gentler face on the president's defense, White
House lawyers released a 182-page rebuttal that once again harshly
attacked Kenneth Starr, accusing him of slanting the case against
the president by excluding exculpatory evidence in his impeachment
referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation from the president's men did not appear to sway
any minds on the bitterly divided Judiciary Committee. But the
debate, which was by turns tedious, riveting and mildly salacious,
was aimed more at a body of moderate Republicans outside the
committee who hold in their hands the president's fate.

WHERE IRON GIVES WAY TO BEAUTY AND GAMES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The evil spell is broken. Or so you may be tempted to
think while wandering through Gantry Plaza State Park, a new
waterfront promenade and pleasure ground in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The curse that reduced New York's landscape architects to
creating Disney versions of Central Park has been at least
temporarily lifted. At last, a designer and his client have waked
up and recognized that people expect cities to address a
fundamental question. What time is this place?
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Thomas Balsley, the two-acre park is part of Queens
West, the development project planned for a stretch of the East
River opposite the United Nations headquarters. Like Battery Park
City, Queens West will be a mix of residential and commercial
buildings. To date, only one building, a residential high rise
designed by Cesar Pelli, has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The project's public spaces, which will eventually expand to 19
acres, are off to a fine start. This is the kind of park that a
decade ago had people streaming to Barcelona and hailing it as the
new frontier in urban design.
</P>
<P>
   Gantry Park is even better than many of the small parks built in
Barcelona. Pasqual Maragal, its enlightened mayor, encouraged his
architects to take risks, and risks do not pay off equally well.
The miracle of Gantry Park is that it takes risks in a city that
has long been frightened of them. The payoff is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   With the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop and gorgeous light
bouncing off the river, the site itself is magnificent. Of course,
no one wants tall buildings to invade Queens. It's a blow to be
robbed of the contrast between vertical and horizontal boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   But if high-rise development is in the cards, then we may as
well exploit the opportunity it presents. Here's a chance to
transform this stretch of water into a place, as much lake as
river, a surface that both joins and separates two pieces of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Queens West is easily reached by subway from Grand Central (get
off at the Vernon-Jackson station). Sometime next year it will be
connected to midtown by ferry. If arriving by subway, you approach
Queens West via 48th Avenue. The street is bordered by another new
park, this one technically independent of Gantry Park but also
designed by Balsley. Here the focus is on active recreation, with
areas for basketball, handball, and other sports, as well as for
sitting and board games.
</P>
<P>
   The design, too, is sportif, with fixtures _ lights, seats and
sail-shaped metal canopies of perforated metal _ that subtly recall
the Nike whoosh.
</P>
<P>
   The skyline vista draws you down the street to the river and the
northern end of Gantry Park. The park takes its name from two
giant, hulking structures of blackened iron on the site, which used
to lift freight trains onto river barges. (As a reminder of this
past, Balsley has embedded lengths of rail track in the paving.)
</P>
<P>
   The gantries are as powerful as the triumphal arches and
classical monuments built by the City Beautiful Movement a century
ago. So is the brick power station, with its quartet of de Chirico
stacks, that looms nearby. Once it generated the energy to move the
trains. Now it houses tennis courts. Whack! The industrial city
gives way to games.
</P>
<P>
   Balsley, who designed the park in collaboration with Lee
Weintraub of Sowinski Sullivan Architects, has packed lots of
variety into a confined space. We're greeted by a circular area
that encloses a fog fountain, a shallow cauldron of seething mist
that in summer cools the air. Tables and chairs surround it. Beyond
is a large, hemispherical plaza for performances. With that
Manhattan backdrop it will be an exhilarating place for music.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza connects to two of four piers that project into the
river. Ferries will dock at one of these, on axis with 48th Avenue.
Or, you can proceed along one of the paths that lead away from the
plaza's southern edge. The widest path, paved with stone, defines
the water's edge in a series of graceful, serpentine arcs.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, it passes over a bridge that looks down on a
small river inlet. From there, you can make your way down almost to
the water. A second path, lined with gravel, takes you on an inland
ramble, through vegetation and stone blocks clustered in
crystalline formations. The blocks echo the Manhattan skyline and
partly take the place of benches. The overall effect is of a Cubist
rock garden.
</P>
<P>
   The piers are marine follies. Each is different in length, shape
and furnishings. One has a circular lunch bar, with stools and
awning. Another, the Star Gazing Pier, is outfitted with overscaled
wooden chaises. On the Fishing Pier, there's a large, free-form
table complete with running water, for dressing the catch of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the piers is the views they afford of
each other and the people using them: images of apartness and
togetherness, New Yorkers calling or not calling each to each.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this place special? Because it reveals the unknown.
Because Balsley has let himself enter into what Gaston Bachelard
called ``the poetics of space'' an inner world of images,
relationships, discovery and surprise. The nest. The shell. The
miniature. Intimate immensity. The dialectics of outside and
inside. These are all Bachelard's concepts. One sees them
spatialized here, in a profusion of forms.
</P>
<P>
   These are the qualities that also make Barcelona's network of
small parks so extraordinary. The city enjoys a robust tradition of
using buildings to articulate the unknown. It is most evident in
the Modernismo landmarks of Gaudi, Puig i Cadafalch and Domenech i
Montaner.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Guell, the Casa Mila and the Expiatory Church of the
Holy Family infused the public realm with a psychological
dimension. But the same Symbolist energies animate the endlessly
varied wrought-iron grille designs in the residential buildings of
the city's 19th-century Extension.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Barcelona's architects extended this tradition
into the post-Franco era. The city became, in effect, a vast
laboratory for research in social space. Some of the parks evoked
nightmares, bad memories of Franco's regime. But collectively, they
showed that design can help lift a city out of a dark chapter into
light.
</P>
<P>
   Projects this important don't happen without the leadership of
public officials. In Barcelona, designers were supported by Oriel
Bohigas, Mayor Maragal's consulting architect. For Gantry Park,
Balsley enjoyed the support of Rosina Abramson, former head of the
Queens West Development Corp., a subsidiary of the Empire State
Development Corp. But Ms. Abramson left in 1995. What assurance do
we have of continued leadership?
</P>
<P>
   Gantry Park is the second time in recent years that the state
development agency has fostered new ways of thinking about social
space. The first left a mixed legacy. In 1979, the Battery Park
City Authority created a bold program of parks and other spaces,
with excellent results. But it left architecture out in the cold.
Instead, it enlisted the talents of artists like Ned Smythe, Mary
Miss, Siah Armijani, Scott Burton, and R.J. Fleishman.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was worth making, but it set an unfortunate
precedent, sending the message that artists are superior to
architects in the imagination department. In doing so, the
developers turned their back on New York's tradition of engaging
architects to think boldly.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that tradition more evident than in the complex of
buildings directly opposite Gantry Park. In 1947 an international
group of architects gathered in New York and asked, What is the
United Nations to be? A world capital? A temple of peace? ``It is
too soon to use such fine phrases, non?'' countered Le Corbusier,
the group's guiding spirit. ``The U.N. simply does not exist yet.
The nations are not united. The U.N. is not proved. It is simply a
poste de combat.'' From this way of thinking evolved the idea that
the U.N. headquarters should be a place for experiment: a workshop
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   In Barcelona, Bohigas gave his architects a similar challenge:
We don't know what the post-industrial city will be. We don't know
how new communications will affect work, home, relaxation and the
relationships between them. We don't know how public spaces should
register their impact.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what Queens West will become, either. Is it too
late for it to be an extension of the United Nations? Could it play
a part in the city's ambition to act as host to the Olympic Games
in 2008? Could it become an international showcase for the world's
greatest architectural talents? Or, like Battery Park City, will it
become a line-up of dull Business Class buildings?
</P>
<P>
   At night, Gantry Park's piers are outlined with blue lights that
evoke airport runways. Are there any fresh ideas out there? Come in
for a landing.

<P>
   A new guide ranking the 50 top colleges and universities where
African Americans are most likely to succeed will be published next
month as a 10-page feature in the monthly business magazine, Black
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a host of national magazines that publish annual college
guides, including Time, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report,
Black Enterprise has ranked colleges based on responses from 1,077
African-American professionals in higher education at 987 colleges
and universities. They assessed things like academic strengths and
social environment. The study also factored in measurements like
graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the list are nine historically black colleges and
universities, beginning with Spelman College in Atlanta, Morehouse
College in Atlanta and Florida A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   After the top nine come Stanford University, Georgetown
University, Oberlin College and Swarthmore College.
</P>
<P>
   The list and rankings were developed by Thomas LaVeist, a
professor of health and public policy at Johns Hopkins University
and CEO of DayStar, the research company that conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   The primary standard, LaVeist said, was that the college or
university had to be an accredited four-year institution that has
an African-American enrollment of at least 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If an institution did not meet those criteria but was well-known
and would be of significant interest to black students, it was
added to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The educational professionals graded the institutions on a scale
of 1 to 5 from strongly recommended to strongly not recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Edmond, executive editor of Black Enterprise magazine,
said he hoped that the rankings would stimulate the dialogue on how
to achieve greater diversity on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any surprises in the rankings, Marjorie
Whigham-Desir, a senior editor who worked on the project, laughed
and said LaVeist was surprised. ``He went to the University of
Maryland's Eastern Shore campus, and then got his master's and
Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, and neither of them showed up
in the top 50.''

 WASHINGTON: President's fate.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans on the committee were insistent on
pinning down what they believe to be a pattern of perjury by the
president and evasions by his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., engaged in a sharp
exchange over what Canady said was a clear lie by Clinton, a
statement in his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit that he
could not recall having been alone with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval
Office area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Mr. Craig,'' Canady asked, ``is it your position here
today on behalf of the president that when the president gave those
answers in the deposition, he was telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig replied: ``That's correct, congressman. He answered the
question that it was possible that he was alone with her. This is
in the civil deposition, so all the description that I gave to that
civil deposition is accurate. It was evasive, it was misleading, he
tried to be narrowly accurate, but congressman, he did not violate
his oath.''
</P>
<P>
   An exasperated Canady said, ``It seems to me that the president
unequivocally denied that he had any specific recollection of being
alone with Ms. Lewinsky. And for you to contend today that that's
truthful, I think, is not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   As the damp, dreary day grew dark at mid-afternoon, a few rays
of hope appeared for the White House. Rep. Amo Houghton a moderate
New York Republican, announced that he would oppose impeachment on
the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, a frequent critic of Clinton, said
Tuesday night that the House should heed popular will and refrain
from impeaching the president. D'Amato, who lost a reelection bid
last month, said that tying up the Senate in a trial of Clinton
``doesn't make sense'' for the nation or the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   White House lobbyists also reported progress toward persuading
several other wavering Republicans to vote against any bill of
impeachment that reaches the House next week.
</P>
<P>
   William Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts,
was recruited Tuesday to appear as a witness on the president's
behalf on Wednesday and was reported to be making calls to
Republican friends in Congress to persuade them to vote against
impeachment.

&HT;        SANTORUM CALLS FOR PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark Stricherz  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 -- Wading into the national debate on
reforming the country's Social Security system, Sen. Rick Santorum,
R-Penn., outlined a plan Tuesday to allow recipients to invest part
of their benefits in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a White-House sponsored conference on overhauling
the 63-year-old program, Santorum, an economic conservative,
proposed that Social Security rely at least partly on the free
market, rather than solely on the federal government and it's
pay-as-you-go setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``An improved Social Security system will synthesize the
traditionally Democratic commitment to provide citizens with
security through government programs with the Republican commitment
to economic opportunity and individual freedom,'' he said, going on
to criticize the program as it was created in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the current system, individuals have no legal claim to
either their acccrued contributions or their anticipated benefits.
One of our most critical insights is that ownership changes
behavior. It creates hope, and a commitment to the future one's own
and that of one's country.''
</P>
<P>
   With 77 million baby boomers reaching retirement age beginning
in 2010, Social Security faces mounting insolvency. It is expected
to lose money by 2013. And by 2032, the program is expected to pay
only 75 percent of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Social Security is particularly urgent in Pennsylvania
and Johnstown, which have many elderly, 16 percent and and 19
percent respectively. Nationwide, 12.6 percent of the population is
65 years old or older and thus eligible for Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 9 main proposals Congress is considering to fix
the disability and retirement program, Santorum's plan would go
further than most in privatizing it. Privatization is a substitute
for raising payroll taxes, currently set at 12.4 percent and split
among employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a recipient earning $23,000 could set aside up to 4
percent of his or her monthly benefits. Under competing proposals,
such as that sponsored by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Judd Gregg,
R-N.H., workers would have to deduct 2 percent of benefits for
private investment.
</P>
<P>
   In allowing partial privatization, Santorum's plan hinges on
whether middle-class and poor beneficiaries can make money in the
stock market or other private investments. Presented as a populist
idea, Santorum expressed optimism that it will.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the
bottom 90 percent and that this gap is growing, Santorum said,
``Under a funded system with personal accounts, all workers will
have the chance to accumulate to real wealth. Such a system also
offers the opportunity for ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Among local lawmakers, reaction to Santorum's plan, which he
introduced during the fall, was frosty.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, expressed deep skepticism toward
any privatization proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very concerned about the stability and sureness of
payments and opposed to risking this stability by gambling in the
stock market,'' said Murtha in a prepared statement. ``In addition
... many retirees in our area are feeling a sharp pinch from
low-cost-of-living increases coupled with sharp increases in
medical and prescription drug costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Glassport, did not return repeated phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, Breaux, a leading moderate, was notably more
enthusiastic about Santorum's plan, calling it a ``step in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderates and conservatives argue that privatization will not
only create personal wealth but save the system from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   While Santorum presented his proposal as bipartisan -- a word
invoked repeatedly by Democrats and Republicans at the conference
-- it actually represents a dramatic change in the program, a
cornerstone of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   The program began as a social safey net, in which employers and
employees would contribute through a payroll tax. Under the system,
known as pay as you go, benefits are invested in U.S. Treasury
securities.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate prospects for reform may hinge on the first six
months of 1999, said lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw, Jr., the incoming House chairman of the
Social Security Subcommittee, said divided government may help
overhaul efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one party in power, you have the other party throwing
rocks,'' said Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, political leaders said the 1999 election cycle will
kick in during the summer, thus further politicizing an already
touchy subject.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event was the first of a two-day event. Political
leaders are more likely to hammer out specifics on Wednesday, when
they meet a closed-door, lawmakers-only session.

CHINA'S GLOBAL BOND OFFERING SENDS SEVERAL MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As most of its neighbors suffer through their worst financial
crises of modern times, China stands almost alone. It has held its
currency steady, kept its economy primed and continued its
long-running economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will collect its reward.
</P>
<P>
   Barring last-minute changes, China will raise at least $500
million from foreign investors on Wednesday, becoming the first
Asian country to issue an international bond since Russia devalued
its currency and defaulted on its debt in August.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, investors appear to be crowning China as Asia's best
borrower outside Japan: It is set to pay a lower interest rate on
its new debt than South Korea, Thailand or other neighbors would if
they tried to raise money today.
</P>
<P>
   With a $140 billion hoard of foreign exchange, China does not
need the fresh hard currency that this dollar-denominated bond,
known as a Yankee bond, will bring. The offering, in fact, is a bit
of muscle flexing by a country that wants everyone to heed Asia's
new economic order. Some bankers and investors say China is raising
fresh capital precisely because many of its neighbors cannot, at
least without paying far more for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are net lenders to the world, and they have low financing
needs. So they really don't need the money,'' said Charles Van
Vleet, a manager of the Putnam Global Fixed Income Fund who intends
to buy some of the China bonds. ``It's more like they are keeping
in front of their potential needs, waving the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists also see another message in the China bond,
which lead underwriters Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co. are expected to officially announce Wednesday. China
will join Argentina as the only developing country to raise big
money from foreign investors since the Russia crisis began. And the
two have something in common: Their currencies have not budged
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Like Argentina, China has fixed the exchange rate of its
currency, the yuan, against the dollar, and promised not to change
the rate for the foreseeable future. In contrast, Thailand, South
Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Russia and many other
developing countries have reduced the value of their currencies
against the dollar by big margins _ the so-called Asian contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that devalue their currencies get some benefits _
their exports are less expensive in dollar terms, for example. But
many find it harder to pay back their foreign debt, because it
takes more local currency to pay back the same amount of debt after
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from the Asian experience that devaluations
destroy wealth and living standards, and they force countries out
of global financial markets,'' said David Malpass, chief
international economist for Bear Stearns. ``China took a different
course, and they were able to retain their access to capital
markets even in a tough year.''
</P>
<P>
   Malpass sees a lesson for other developing countries, especially
Brazil. China's success in launching an international bond ought to
steel Brazil against critics who think it should weaken the value
of the real against the dollar, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There will be an interesting test in 1999 for Brazil in my
view. The controlled devaluation some academics are promoting would
close it out of international financial markets. China should be a
lesson,'' Malpass said.
</P>
<P>
   The China bond would also appear to relieve fears, at least in
the near term, that Beijing will buckle to market pressure and
allow the yuan to decline in value. To devalue shortly after
selling bonds abroad would be a slap in the face to investors, akin
to Russia's disastrous default and devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, countries that have plans to reduce the value of their
currency are ill advised to take on new debt before the
devaluation. That debt would quickly become more expensive to pay
in local currency terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not want to immediately incur a foreign-exchange
loss on a big bond issue, so that should bring some relief to those
who feared a devaluation in the short run,'' said Peter Askew, fund
manager of the T. Rowe Price International bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investors said that a global road show to advertise the new
China bond has been a relative success, despite continuing
uncertainty about economic reforms in Brazil, Venezuela and other
developing countries in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Investors now expect that the new 10-year Yankee bond's interest
rate, or its yield, will be pegged just below 300 basis points, or
three percentage points, over similar U.S. Treasury bonds. Market
sources said the spread could tighten a bit, to perhaps 280 basis
points.
</P>
<P>
   Given buoyant market demand, China might decide overnight to
increase the size of its offering to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was helped by a surprise announcement from a
leading credit-rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, that
reaffirmed China's sovereign rating at A3, which is considered a
strong investment-grade rating for an emerging-market country. The
agency also changed its outlook for China's rating from negative to
stable. Moody's attributed its decision to China's commitment to
protect its credit rating and to its strong exports.
</P>
<P>
   The offering and the high credit rating show that investors are
making a sharp distinction between Chinese companies, even those
owned by the state, and the national government. One prominent
Chinese nonbank financial company, Guangdong International Trade
and Investment Corp., recently defaulted on foreign debt payments.
Other such companies have also missed debt payments lately,
prompting many Western banks to freeze corporate lending there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a positive sign that China is beginning to shut
down these pseudo-guaranteed banks and letting some of these
state-owned companies fail,'' said Van Vleet of the Putnam fund.
``We do not see that as impacting them at the sovereign level.''

 &HT;    CLINTON LAWYERS SUBMIT WRITTEN DEFENSE
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT and BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal team laid out a detailed
contention Tuesday that he did not commit perjury, obstruct justice
or abuse the power of his office in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that Clinton's conduct in the sex-and-deception
scandal was ''wrong,'' the lawyers portrayed Clinton as the victim
of a biased investigation, a flawed report of the inquiry's
findings and erroneous conclusions by his political foes.
</P>
<P>
   None of Clinton's behavior posed the ''grave harm to the
Republic'' required to justify impeachment, his lawyers argued in a
184-page filing with the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wrongdoing alleged here does not remotely meet that
standard,'' the president's lawyers asserted in what amounted to a
written summary of two days of testimony that concludes Wednesday
before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The president's memorandum was signed by a battery of lawyers
led by Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall; special counsel to
the president, Gregory Craig, and White House Counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   It was immediately dismissed by the Judiciary Committee's
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., as a repackaging of White House
''legal hairsplitting and semantic gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote this week on three
articles of impeachment, charging Clinton with perjury, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the president at Tuesday's Judiciary Committee hearing
conceded that the new legal memorandum was unlikely to change any
minds on the committee, which has been bitterly divided for weeks
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the document was aimed at a small, but potentially
decisive, number of other House Republicans who the White House
believes still haven't formed a final opinion about the president's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the partisans are going to say 'nothing new'
...because their minds are made up,'' said White House spokesman
Jim Kennedy. ``But we do believe there are a lot of people who have
an open mind ...and will conclude that a reasonable case of
wrongdoing has not been made.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the committee likely to vote out at least one article
of impeachment this week and a full House vote expected next week,
not even the White House can say for certain how many such members
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said it was impossible to know how
many moderate Republicans might be swayed by the president's latest
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moderates are just getting hammered by the right wing and
as a consequence are keeping their heads down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde issued a statement three hours after the memorandum was
delivered to the committee. He appeared particularly peeved that he
received the report after its contents had already been reported by
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document, the contents of which we learned from
television news, appears to contain no new evidence or challenge
the truthfulness of any testimony the committee now possesses,''
Hyde said. ``What it also includes is more legal hair-splitting and
semantic gymnastics we have come to expect from this White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, appeared in no rush to read the document.
At least one Democrat, Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said the
document answered the criticisms from Republicans that the
president had offered no defense of the actual allegations
contained in the impeachment referral submitted by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said the president's brief shows that the president did
in fact acknowledge an ``inappropriate intimate relationship'' with
Lewinsky in his grand jury testimony, while denying that he had
``sexual relations'' with her, as defined by lawyers for Paula
Jones in her civil sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public needs to understand that the Republicans
want to impeach him over that distinction,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   In their new document, Clinton's lawyers attacked the
impeachment process on three fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ That the president has not committed perjury, obstruction of
justice or abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   _ That the charges, in any event, do not rise the the level of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ That Starr exhibited a ''bias'' against Clinton during his
investigation and in his report to the Judiciary Committee in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the memorandum charges that Starr, in his report,
knowingly omitted evidence that would suggest Clinton's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of perjury, the article of impeachment that appears
most likely to be approved by the committee, Clinton's attorneys
attempted to draw a fine distinction between lying and committing
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vast range of testimony that is imprecise, unresponsive,
vague, and literally truthful, even if it is not completely
forthcoming, simply is not perjury,'' the filing states.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law is aware of human foibles and shortcomings of memory.
...Perjury requires proof that a defendant, while under oath,
knowingly made a false statement as to material facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are duty-bound to draw a distinction between immoral
conduct and illegal or impeachable acts,'' the lawyers asserted.
''The record before this committee does not justify charges of
criminal conduct or impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Stressing Clinton's contrition, the lawyers stated in a preface
to the filing that ''he is profoundly sorry for the wrongs he had
committed and for the pain he has caused his family, his friends
and our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have done repeatedly, Clinton's lawyers argued that to
impeach Clinton on the basis on the evidence now arrayed against
him would set a dangerous precedent. It would shift the
constitutional balance of powers strongly toward Congress, they
argued, by letting presidential foes on Capitol Hill overthrow a
president on grounds that were solely political.
</P>
<P>
   ''This new impeachment weapon would be a permanent,
extra-constitutional power of Congress,'' the lawyers asserted, ''a
poison arrow aimed permanently at the heart of the Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Judiciary Committee approve any articles of
impeachment, those articles would then go to the full House for
debate and a floor vote, possibly as early as next week. The Senate
would conduct a trial on any articles approved by the full House. A
conviction in the Senate, which would require a two-thirds majority
vote, would result in Clinton's removal from office.

COMMENTARY: HILLARY ICON CLINTON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what IS it with Hillary?
</P>
<P>
   The president's head is on the block, and the first lady has
never looked more radiant. As her husband gets dragged through the
mud by bone-headed Republicans, she glows. She looks as if she's
traveling with her own pink baby spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Here she is on the cover of Vogue, looking Hallmark happy and
Hollywood glamorous. Here she is making the flashbulbs pop, with
Harvey Weinstein and Gwyneth Paltrow at the New York premiere of
Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love.'' Here she is at the White House,
posing with the Christmas gingerbread house, looking totally Norman
Rockwell. Here she is doing her Barbara Bush imitation, publishing
``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy,'' a book of letters from children to the
White House pets.
</P>
<P>
   But why is this woman smiling?
</P>
<P>
   Does she think these are her wages for her husband's sin? Or is
she offering up an emotionally airbrushed version of herself in
order to help her husband get past his ordeal?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, there is something a little eerie about that serene
smile.
</P>
<P>
   A very peculiar thing is happening. Just as she becomes the
single most degraded wife in the history of the world, Mrs. Clinton
is being promoted from celebrity into iconicity. The power elite is
deep into Hillary hysteria, treating the glossy, domesticated,
upswept, inauthentic version of the first lady like a combination
of Princess Di and Mother Courage. Dan Rather said she'd make a
good presidential candidate, and Time is considering beatifying her
as Person of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Costello, who worked as a press secretary for Rosalynn
Carter and Kitty Dukakis, said that ``At any moment, you expect the
lights to go up for the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical opera
`Hillary.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is more speculation now about what Mrs. Clinton will do in
the year 2000 than what her husband will do. Will she leave him or
stay? Will she run for Senate in New York, or take a Supreme Court
appointment from President Gore?
</P>
<P>
   But her iconicity is strangely contentless.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when there were large and real accomplishments
that she wished to achieve. Most notably, she wanted to reform
health care and restore the prestige of liberal social engineering.
But the halo beneath which she now moves has not been awarded to
her for something that she has done, but for something she has
endured. She was laid low by publicity, and so she will be raised
up by publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists will long ponder how it was that the first lady became
wildly popular only when she played the doormat. (Excuse me, I mean
played Tammy Wynette.) She became a heroine only, as Jane Mayer
wrote in The New Yorker, when she went from seeming too controlling
to seeming unable to control her own husband. It was easier for
many women to identify with that.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Mrs. Clinton hailed as ``a woman of stature and an icon
to American women,'' as the Vogue editor Anna Wintour puts it, only
after she's been demeaned in this gross, horrible, painful way?
</P>
<P>
   The tough woman who wanted to be a co-president had to be
brought down, so that out of the chrysalis could come a woman who
stands by her man and does not allow any of her real emotions to
show through.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is a hot blond material girl now, hanging out with
fashion types, movie stars and rich people, showing that she is as
attuned to the nuances of back-scratching and corporate huckstering
as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, she repaid the generosity of Weinstein, the
co-chairman of Miramax who is a big contributor to Clinton
campaigns and the Clinton legal defense fund. As Alex Kuczynski
reported in The New York Times, the first lady went to Weinstein's
premiere and spoke in praise of ``my friend Harvey.'' Sounding very
Tina Brownish, Mrs. Clinton raved about ``the buzz'' around
Miramax, and said the company ``has done a great service.''
</P>
<P>
   While in New York she also repaid Vogue for the glitzy cover and
puff piece, going to breakfast with Vogue editors. And she had
lunch with editors from Time, Teen People and People magazine,
talking up her campaign for teen-age celibacy _ a campaign that is
a little cringe-making, given her husband's fling with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will long ponder how Mrs. Clinton came in as Eleanor
Roosevelt and left as Madonna.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the White House set out President Clinton's
final defense before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, the
audience that mattered most was not the one in the cavernous
hearing room. Nor was it the nation's television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20 to 30 moderate Republicans who could swing a House
impeachment vote one way or the other and who urgently need a
compelling rationale if they are to oppose impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm desperately looking for a reason that it can be explained
away,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif. Of Clinton, he said, ``I
just wish he'd spent more time explaining himself than having
attack dogs go after these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the now-critical, down-to-the wire White House quest to
win over such Republicans, Gregory Craig, the White House special
counsel, on Tuesday tried to challenge the facts of the case built
by Kenneth Starr. He showcased figures like Nicholas deB.
Katzenbach, attorney general under President Johnson, to remind
Congress it is considering removing an elected president against
the popular will.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important of all, Craig re-emphasized the
contrition that had seemed to fade from White House statements in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, I would not be fairly representing President Clinton
if I did not convey to you his profound and powerful regret for
what he has done,'' he said. ``He has insisted and personally
instructed his lawyers that no legalities and technicalities should
be allowed to obscure the simple moral truth that his behavior in
this matter was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to wonder aloud how
impeachment could now be riding on whether or not Clinton is
perceived to be truly remorseful. ``You may judge the president as
what kind of man he is by the level of contrition,'' he said, ``but
not whether he should be impeached.'' Still, it has always been the
case that impeachment is as much a political process as a
quasi-legal one. And members of Congress say President Clinton and
his aides made a series of costly political missteps after the
mid-term elections, unable to believe that the Republicans'
surprising election losses would not stop them dead in their
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the euphoria from the November
election clouded their expectation about what would happen in the
Congress,'' said Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff
who has been participating in White House conference calls on
impeachment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democrats say, the White House, using its own internal
polling, began arguing that the force of public opinion was running
so strongly with Clinton that the Republicans would never proceed
with impeachment. ``The White House is so obsessed with polling
that it can't imagine anyone else would ignore it,'' said one
Democratic strategist.
</P>
<P>
   So when Republicans called Starr before the Judiciary Committee,
the White House played for public opinion and sought to heap more
discredit on a prosecutor already low in public standing.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private attorney who has jousted with
Starr in legal proceedings for four years, shook him by
aggressively questioning the conduct of his office. But he did
nothing to contest the facts that have left many Republicans
believe the president has committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   And when Clinton did answer 81 questions put to him by the
committee, his answers seemed so evasive and legalistic that
Republicans say that was a turning point. Many of the same
moderates Clinton needs to woo saw White House response as arrogant
and were alienated by it.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials argue that they have had to conduct a
difficult balancing act, aware of a political need for the
president to show he erred but unwilling to do anything that could
open Clinton to prosecution for perjury after he leaves office.
``Certainly, there's concern that there could be legal action,''
said a senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   But even on Tuesday the president's side at times seemed tone
deaf, with some witnesses condescending to or on the offensive
against the Republicans. Sean Wilentz, a Princeton professor, told
the panel's members that they risk ``going down in history with the
zealots and the fanatics.'' And he said, ``if you are at all
unsure, and yet you vote in favor of impeachment anyway for some
other reason, history will track you down and condemn you for your
cravenness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the committee is certain to report out at least one and
perhaps as many as four articles of impeachment against Clinton by
Saturday. Underscoring that reality, the committee's Republicans
time and again showed little patience for White House attempts
Tuesday to explain away some of Clinton's statement's across the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Inglis, R-S.C., asked Craig if Clinton had lied ``to
the American people when he said I never had sex with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't believe that he did,'' Craig answered. ``He does
not believe that he lied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing thing,'' shot back Inglis. ``You're taking
back all of his apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the committee room some Republicans seemed slightly
mollified. ``The jury is still out, but I've gained a little more
respect for the defense team,'' Bilbray said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress is mercurial and the political mood can change in
an instant. There is still a critical week to go before the
ultimate impeachment votes. And it remains a problem for Clinton
that the one and only member of the Republican leadership who has
become engaged in the impeachment debate, Rep. Tom DeLay, the House
majority whip, openly supports impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said that sometime in the next week, Clinton himself
will have to reach out to Republicans and fight for his own
survival instead of relying on lawyers, academics and surrogates.
``It will be the president himself who will have to engage,'' he
said. ``Because this is one that is too important to his presidency
not to be directly involved.''

WITNESS HOLDS GROUND AGAINST MICROSOFT LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. failed Tuesday to
shake a computer-science expert from his argument that Internet
software should not be included as part of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is
the charge that the company bundled Internet browser software with
Windows largely as a tactic to put competitors at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, designers have a huge amount of flexibility in how
to package these files, the same way you have a large amount of
flexibility in how you put things in a grocery bag, as long as you
don't crush stuff,'' said David Farber, a senior computer-science
professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is a government
witness. ``Software is infinitely malleable.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Holley, a lawyer for Microsoft, contended that _ no
matter how all those files got into Windows _ outside software
developers now depend on them when they write programs for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Farber countered that ``there is no absolute efficiency
given just because this is the way Microsoft has chosen to put all
of this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day, Holley got down to the level of
individual program files. He displayed a large poster listing 13
major files that testimony had shown are invoked when a computer
user seeks an Internet address using Internet Explorer, Microsoft's
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked Farber if each file could be deleted without
damaging Windows. When the witness answered no to the first two,
Holley pasted large red ``no'' stickers to the board, to reinforce
Microsoft's argument that Explorer is an inseparable, integrated
element of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrics fizzled, though, when Farber told him that the
questions made no sense. Several files in question, he said, were
key parts of the operating system invoked by all sorts of programs,
not just Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   By asking those questions, the professor told Holley: ``You're
asking me if I've stopped beating my wife.'' A moment later, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case,
asked Holley, ``Can we move on to another subject?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson showed interest in the discussion of individual computer
files. He heard similar testimony last year, when he was deciding
on the government's request for an order barring Microsoft from
bundling Internet Explorer with Windows 95. Early this year,
Jackson ordered Microsoft to offer Windows 95 in a form that hides
access to Explorer. But a Court of Appeals panel overturned his
ruling last summer.
</P>
<P>
   When the discussion Tuesday turned to one file used by Windows
and Explorer, the judge interrupted Holley to ask the witness, ``If
that code were part of Windows, is there any reason that Internet
Explorer, as an application, could not invoke it?''
</P>
<P>
   No, there was no reason, Farber answered. The very question
troubled Microsoft executives, who have labored since the trial
began to convince Jackson that Internet Explorer is not a
stand-alone application and never has been.
</P>
<P>
   Holley later asked Farber about a section from the appellate
court ruling, which is central to Microsoft's defense. The panel
ruled that it would be ``absurdly inefficient'' to require
consumers to stitch computer code together, a possible result if
Explorer were removed from Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Farber mumbled for a moment, suggesting that he had trouble with
the appellate court's language, but then explained, ``I don't want
to criticize the court.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Jackson smiled and said, ``Oh, go ahead.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ Joe DiMaggio's condition was so bleak on
Monday that his doctor advised that family and close friends be
called to his side for his possible death.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with the 84-year-old former Yankee center fielder
having rallied overnight, Dr. Earl Barron apologized to those same
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole load of family here,'' Barron said. ``I told
them this morning, `Look, I could no way have anticipated how this
was going to go. I just have to call it the way I see it.' That's
why I had these people come in. Because yesterday it really looked
dire. But if it were today, I would not have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who has been in Memorial Regional Hospital here since
Oct. 12 while battling pneumonia and the effects of lung cancer
surgery, still is in critical condition, Barron said. But his
condition has stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe had a terrific night,'' Barron said. He said the doctors
were cutting back on DiMaggio's sedation and some medication, and
``he's a little bit more alert.''

WHITE HOUSE BRIEF TAKES AIM AT STARR AND IMPEACHMENT PROCESS

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While President Clinton's lawyers presented a
conciliatory defense to the House Judiciary Committee, the White
House on Tuesday night released a detailed, 184-page legal brief
that portrays both the independent counsel and the impeachment
process as politically biased and blatantly unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which was prepared by a team of the president's
personal lawyers and the White House counsel's office, attacks
familiar targets while it lays out the most complete and fervent
defense of Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky case, offering
an exhaustive, point-by-point rebuttal to the allegations of
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President of the United States has not committed
impeachable offenses,'' the lawyers wrote in the document, which
was delivered on Tuesday night to the House Judiciary Committee.
``He repeatedly has acknowledged that what he did was wrong, he has
apologized and he has sought forgiveness. But his apologies, his
acceptance of responsibility and his contrition do not mean either
that the President committed criminal acts or that the acts for
which he is accused are impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House defense brief repeatedly attacks the independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's tactics and motives. And it questions the
accuracy of statements made in the hearing room by Rep. Henry Hyde,
the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. ``Patently false,''
the brief calls Hyde's summary of the president's testimony before
the grand jury last August.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hyde on Tuesday night dismissed the document,
saying it contains no new evidence'' and ``more legal hairsplitting
and semantic gymnastics that we have come to expect from this White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers argue that the Office of Independent
Counsel's long-running Whitewater inquiry had run into an
``investigative dead-end'' and that in 1997 Starr turned his
attention to the president's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In January 1998,'' the president's lawyers wrote, ``the OIC
finally succeeded in transforming its investigation from one
focused on long-ago land deals and loans in Arkansas into one
involving a different topic (sex) and more recent events in
Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief contrasted the Judiciary Committee's examination of
the evidence against President Nixon in 1974 with Starr's 445-page
referral sent to the House of Representatives on Sept. 9. The
president's lawyers said that, during the Watergate inquiry, the
committee interviewed witnesses and developed its own evidence.
But, the lawyers said, the current panel is relying solely on
Starr's report and its interpretation of the facts, without benefit
of interviewing critical witnesses or developing independent
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the impartial presentation to the Watergate committee
from Special Prosecutor (Leon) Jaworski, the referral is a document
advocating impeachment,'' the lawyers' brief states. ``It sets for
Mr. Starr's best case for impeachment, not a neutral presentation
of the facts. It reflects a careful selection and presentation of
the evidence designed to portray the President in the worst
possible light.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also says that Starr omitted 11 examples of
exculpatory evidence on issues including the concealment of gifts
to Ms. Lewinsky, the accusation that Clinton sought to find Ms.
Lewinsky a job in exchange for her silence and on the question of
whether Clinton coached Betty Currie, his secretary, to testify
falsely in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers also argue that Starr slanted the
evidence about Clinton's knowledge of Ms. Lewinsky's false
affidavit in the Jones suit and in his assertion that Clinton
falsely claimed to be unaware of the invocation of executive
privilege by his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referral repeatedly and demonstrably omitted or
mischaracterized directly relevant evidence that exonerates the
President of the very allegations leveled by the OIC,'' the lawyers
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, said on Tuesday night
that his office was reviewing the document, but he declined to say
whether prosecutors would respond.
</P>
<P>
   The immense task of searching for fissures in the public record
was taken on by a team of a dozen lawyers from the White House and
Williams &AMP; Connolly, the law firm representing Clinton. It was a
product of many weeks of work by a team led by David Kendall, the
president's lawyer, a White House senior aide said on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rewriting and editing of the 184-page document continued
until late Tuesday. Even at 6 p.m on Tuesday, six pages had been
rushed to the offices of Williams &AMP; Connolly for final review
before being released to the Judiciary Committee and news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers repeatedly challenge members of the
House of Representatives to carefully study the record ``to
separate fact from myth, the record from the rhetoric and the
sinful from the impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any consideration of charges of perjury requires a focused
look at the actual statements at issue,'' the lawyers wrote in
their brief. ``Again, we ask the committee: Please do not assume
the conventional wisdom. Look, instead, at the actual record.''
</P>
<P>
   That record begins with perjury, the allegation believed to be
the most likely article of impeachment to be approved by the House
Judiciary Committee. The White House lawyers argue that a high
standard of proof is needed to prove perjury. A defendant, while
under oath, knowingly must make a false statement about material
facts, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vast range of testimony that is imprecise, unresponsive,
vague and literally truthful, even if it is not completely
forthcoming, simply is not perjury,'' the lawyers wrote. ``The law
is aware of human foibles and shortcomings of memory.
Dissatisfaction with the president's answers because they may be
narrow, `hair splitting' or formalistic does not constitute grounds
for alleging perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers disputed the allegation that Clinton
lied under oath about the nature of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. The said Clinton acknowledged before the grand jury that
he had engaged in ``intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky, which he
said was ``wrong'' and not appropriate. They said the president
denied having had ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky, as it was
defined by the federal judge in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This simply is not a case of perjury,'' the lawyers wrote.
``In addition to the inconsequential subject matter of the
allegation _ the precise nature of the admitted physical contact
between the President and Ms. Lewinsky _ the factual record would
not support a prosecution for perjury. That record is one
essentially of `oath against oath,' a formula that centuries of
common law jurisprudence has rejected as the basis for perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest section of the brief is devoted to rebutting charges
that the president obstructed justice. These allegations, so
redolent of Watergate, have long troubled Clinton's lawyers the
most and they devoted 65 pages to trying to knock them down.
</P>
<P>
   In an elaborate dissection of Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury
testimony, the White House lawyers argue there is no evidence that
the president obstructed justice by discussing what should be done
with gifts the president gave the former intern and that were
subpoenaed in the Jones case. They also vigorously denied that the
president obstructed justice by aiding Ms. Lewinsky in a job
search.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers criticized the independent counsel for
presenting a ``misleading picture,'' since those efforts began
months before Ms. Lewinsky appeared on the witness list in the
Jones case. The brief rebuts four other obstruction charges as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also challenged the assertion by Starr that
Clinton abused the power of his office by invoking executive
privilege claims to conceal personal misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel's allegation that the President's
assertions of privilege constituted an abuse of power is baseless
and disingenuous,'' the lawyers wrote. ``The record demonstrates
that the White House acted at all times based upon a good faith
belief that its narrow assertions of privilege were appropriate and
its claims were well founded in existing law.''

   Sweet zzzzz's for Xmas are promised by  &UR; Jim DeCordova &LR; , inventor
of the Dreamcloud Dreamhelmet. This sleep ``cap'' is ``a wraparound
that bathes your head in a cloud of sweet dreams and peaceful
slumber ... A magical travel pillow that transforms into a muff and
hand warmer ... a fashion statement in three motifs.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCordova says he invented the Dreamhelmet to introduce the
concept of ``adventure sleep.'' The Teddy Bear design is in golden
corduroy, the Adventurer is in classic blue denim, and in the Cloud
9, ``the elegance of crushed iridescent alabaster velvet lofts you
gently to fashion heaven as you float transcendentally down the
runway of your sweet imagination.'' More information about this

LOUISVILLE PROGRAM SAVES UPS JOBS AND PROMOTES EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The cold night air flowed through the open
doorways and circulated around the cavernous building, chilling
Stephanie Anderson, 20, and her co-workers as they recently stood
beside the long conveyor belt. As packages of various size and
shape flowed down the belt, Ms. Anderson glanced at the shipping
labels. When she saw a ZIP code in North or South Carolina, she
snagged the package and placed it into a large plastic trolley car
behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson is one of a few thousand people doing the same
repetitive work on the midnight to 3 a.m. shift at United Parcel
Service's sorting center at the Louisville airport. But where some
might see boredom and wretched hours, she sees opportunity. By
working this particular shift for this particular company, she is
getting what she wants most: a free college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure doesn't seem worth it when I first walk in here,'' she
said. ``It's so cold, and the late hours and you've just left a
warm house to get here. But it sure seems worth it when I'm
registering for classes and I don't have to pay anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson is one of about 1,000 night-shift workers at United
Parcel's primary sorting center who began an innovative program
this fall that not only provides tuition at three local colleges,
but a tailor-made program for workers. In what experts say is the
first such cooperative arrangement of its kind, the company, the
three colleges and the state have scheduled classes to fit the
lives of employees who work in the middle of the night. The main
goal of the program _ other than the education of students _ is to
help the company retain workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't simply a matter of hiring people and putting them
through college,'' said John Kinney, human resources manager for
United Parcel's Louisville sorting center. ``It's a whole new way
of doing college.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes for the program, known formally as Metropolitan College
but more commonly as UPSU, are set up for the late afternoon and
early evening hours at the University of Louisville, Jefferson
County Community College and Jefferson Technical College. Courses
ended for the year by Thanksgiving so that students would be free
for extra work over the holidays, the peak shipping season.
</P>
<P>
   Workers enrolled in the program get free bus passes for public
transit and special bus routes have been set up _ paid for by
United Parcel _ that run each night from the three college campuses
to the company's sorting center.
</P>
<P>
   The program demonstrates the lengths to which companies must go
to retain even semi-skilled workers in economic good times and how
much help state and local governments will provide major employers
to keep them from relocating.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came about when UPS, the state's biggest employer,
though its headquarters are in Atlanta, passed word around
Louisville in November 1997 that it was thinking about moving its
main package sorting center out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The company had always had difficulty finding enough workers to
staff its midnight to 3 a.m. shift, hours mandated by flight
schedules that United Parcel uses for its overnight delivery
service. Indeed, in a typical year, turnover among the 5,500
package sorters is 100 percent. (There is also a three-hour daytime
shift.)
</P>
<P>
   The wages are well above the minimum _ $8.50 an hour _ and the
company provides full medical benefits. But since the basic work of
the center is to unload overnight packages from incoming planes,
sort the items on the basis of their destination and reload them
onto outgoing aircraft, the work can only be part time. And it
takes place in the middle of the night, a fact that students _ a
group that historically makes up a hefty percentage of United
Parcel's work force _ soon finds interfering with social and school
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student population, the folks who are looking for part
time work, tend not to want to work from 12 to 3 in the morning
moving packages,'' Kinney said. ``For the same amount of money they
can work at McDonald's or at a kiosk in a mall selling jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   And United Parcel officials foresaw even more trouble finding
workers in the years ahead, as their plans call for expanding the
primary package sorting center, whether in Louisville or elsewhere.
The idea is to raise the center's handling capacity by the year
2005 to 300,000 packages an hour from the current 175,000. The
center would need an additional 6,000 workers for the late-night
shift.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who had already offered United Parcel a number
of other incentives to keep the center in Louisville, like tax
breaks, came up with the idea of helping the company fill its
employment needs through the college program. Under the plan,
United Parcel pays half of a worker's tuition at one of the
colleges and the state pays the other half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've a pretty good history of doing things for businesses
like improving the transportation system or providing tax
incentives,'' said Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton. ``In this case, none
of that mattered if UPS couldn't get the employees it needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it took some persuasion on the part of the governor to
get the colleges to go along with the program, the heads of the
three institutions say it has helped them stabilize their
enrollments, which, like those of many colleges, have been
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought in 450 students this semester,'' said Dr. Richard
Green, president of Jefferson Community College, where enrollment
dropped to 10,000 this year from 12,000 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel officials say they hope the program will attract
about 2,200 of the 6,000 workers they will need in the expanded
sorting center. Some of the sorters, like Ms. Anderson, were lured
to United Parcel from other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had problems in the past with working at other jobs where
they'll say, `Oh, we'll work with you through school,''' she said.
``But when you've got to stay late for class, it's, `No, I'm sorry,
you've got to come in,' but with this program, they're paying for
my school. If they're going to do that, they're going to want me
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Patricia Carlton, 40, were not working at all, but
hope to take advantage of the opportunity to return to school. Mrs.
Carlton, who is married to a retired military officer and has two
children at home, learned about the program at her local
unemployment office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had put my education aside because of my children, my
family, my husband and moving around all the time,'' she said,
sitting in the cafeteria at Jefferson Community College. ``I
thought this was a good opportunity. It's late. But it's never
really too late.''
</P>
<P>
   She commutes from her home in Fort Knox, about a 45-minute
drive. Her new schedule means that her children and husband have to
fend for themselves more when it comes to things like meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're adjusting because it's my turn,'' Mrs. Carlton said.

SPORTS COLUMN: ADD REVIEW TO PLAYOFFS THIS SEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Embarrassing mistakes by officials in the National Football
League did not merely affect something as simple as ``a ball
game.'' Each error influenced one-sixteenth of a season, which is a
compelling reason for getting it right.
</P>
<P>
   The word from league headquarters is that there is a possibility
the owners can return instant replay in time for the playoffs in
January. It's not as if they would be inventing the wheel in double
time. The league operated with instant replay from 1986 through
1991, and has held experiments recently with better technology and
tighter application.
</P>
<P>
   Anything is better than the sight of Vinny Testaverde of the
Jets failing to get the ball over the goal line Sunday only to be
given credit for a touchdown. The officials did not operate out of
arrogance or dishonesty; they merely blew the call. However, in pro
football, human imperfection can cost 6 percent of a season.
</P>
<P>
   You want human imperfection? Take Richie Garcia's missing a kid
sticking his hands over the wall and turning Derek Jeter's fly ball
into a home run in the 1996 American League playoffs. Garcia blew
the call, but even then, who told the Baltimore Orioles to lose
that game in extra innings, and then lose three more games in the
next four?
</P>
<P>
   During the 1969 World Series, Gil Hodges mesmerized the umpire
by plodding deliberately to home plate, and methodically waving a
baseball with a smudge, persuading the entranced ump that Cleon
Jones had been hit on the foot with a pitched ball. The Mets
clinched the Series almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Don Denkinger blew a call at first base in the ninth inning of
the sixth game of the 1985 World Series. Who told St. Louis to lose
that game, and the next one, too?
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay might have solved all three of those disputes,
but at least baseball plays a 162-game season and now has three
tiers of post-season series. Hockey actually employs instant replay
for all 82 games and four tiers of Stanley Cup playoffs. The
National Basketball Association normally has the same structure,
but trapped in a lockout, it canceled its All-Star Game Tuesday,
heading toward oblivion. And none of those sports plays a one-game
championship, like football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's greatest fear is what happened yesterday happening
in the Super Bowl,'' Greg Aiello, a league spokesman, said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is a lumbering rush to judgment, with the whole
world watching, but, then again, so is every football game, with no
time for schmoozing or common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Back when there used to be such a thing as pro basketball, I
would sometimes see three referees put their little heads together,
with the two coaches eavesdropping, and sometimes the refs would
make a common-sense reversal of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL there are petty regulations about the length of
socks, and the Emotion Police penalize whacked-out monsters for
celebrating what they were born to do, create a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the fault of the officials. It is the cumbersome
charm of pro football. The industry takes itself seriously, and so
should we. There is already a climate of obedience and
regimentation. I mean, this is not exactly telling Earl Weaver he
can't toss his cap, or John Calipari he can't bounce up and down
like a 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The way the story goes, pro football scuttled instant replay
because it ate up too much time. Ha! In this sport, the ball is in
play for something like 12 minutes out of three hours. They want
faster games, they can cut down on substitutions and calling plays
from the bench and they could keep the clock running like in a real
sport, soccer.
</P>
<P>
   They could also cut down on commercials. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say instant replay was right only 80 percent of the
time. I'd settle. Eighty is a higher percentage than most elected
public officials tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The physical quality of football allows only one game a week,
with a finite number of plays. It would be great if the NFL could
eliminate some of the travesties of recent weeks. The officials did
not mean to make a mistake, and would not surrender their
credibility to the replay camera.
</P>
<P>
   The league is on the right path in limiting the number of
challenges to two per game at the cost of a timeout, with added
discretion for the officials to review their own call in the final
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With so much of a season decided by one honest mistake, the
players and coaches and fans deserve instant replay.

 Nancy Hass teaches journalism at New York University and writes
frequently about popular culture.  
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment, brief but breathtaking, takes place about two-thirds
of the way through Jon Alpert's ``Life of Crime 2.'' A 4-year-old,
left alone by his heroin-dazed mother, balances on the sill of an
open window. Three stories below looms an asphalt parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the scene defines good documentary filmmaking.
Painfully raw, it underscores what Alpert, a modern master of
cinema verite, has spent much of his life chronicling: the lives of
three drug-addicted petty criminals. Moreover, the unvarnished
peril slaps the viewer with a moral question about the very nature
of the documentary: should the filmmaker pull the child back?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, such challenges would seem to be the stuff of
which award-winning documentaries are made. But in fact, the film,
which will have its premiere on HBO on Tuesday at 10 p.m., is
considered unlikely to even be considered for an Emmy, a Peabody or
any of the dozens of other awards given each year for documentary
excellence. ``Life of Crime 2's'' subject matter _street violence,
explicit drug use, raunchy sex _ simply isn't Oscar material.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sense of redemption in this film,'' said Sheila
Nevins, who for 20 years has run HBO's documentary division, which
finances a majority of the documentaries made in America. ``That
violates an unspoken tenet of the traditional documentary world. No
matter how brilliant you are, no matter how deeply important the
film may be or how well it reflects contemporary reality, there are
some things that simply will never be honored. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   The sorts of films that win awards, she complains, as do many of
the filmmakers she champions, are those that present ``uplifting
messages on earnest topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Meema Spadola, 29, whose film ``Breasts'' was shown on HBO's
Cinemax channel last year, agrees. ``It's not that there aren't
wonderful documentaries made about AIDS babies,'' she said. ``It's
that the films that are more controversial, that don't have the
right sort of reverent tone, are dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments reflect an increasingly loud clash in the
documentary world between a safe, perhaps middlebrow culture and an
edgier, more irreverent approach, a discord that often seems to
underscore generational conflicts as well as commercial and
esthetic ones.
</P>
<P>
   The tension has grown in recent years because the stakes have
risen. Unexpectedly, documentaries are booming. Not as theatrical
releases, which still face distribution problems in this era of
suburban megaplexes, but on television and as video rentals.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of cable programming over the last decade has
helped create a huge market for documentaries and in the process
blurred the very definition of what makes a documentary, or at
least what makes a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Today, entire channels, like the History Channel and the
Discovery Channel, are virtually devoted to documentaries. General
interest channels have also beefed up their documentary offerings.
TNT and TBS expect to nearly double their documentary production
over the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most notable is the success of Ken Burns, whose lavish
documentaries of the Civil War and baseball defied expectations by
scoring competitive ratings. ``This is a golden era for
documentaries,'' said Michael Cascio, a senior programming
executive at A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   But many young documentary makers fret that the burnished glow
extends only to the safest films. Influenced more by the edginess
of independent feature films, they say that their work is
marginalized because it does not fit the conventional mold. The
implication, some filmmakers say, is that the younger generation of
viewers will be turned off to documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the documentary world consider it ``a sort of disgrace''
for a documentary to be popular, Ms. Nevins said. ``Either you are
making historical work or you are making inspirational stories.
There is no room, either in most commercial venues or on the awards
circuit, for more challenging subject matter.'' Even the
International Documentary Association, which holds itself up as the
arbiter of the art of the documentary, has an ``underlying agenda
of nobility,'' she contends.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Ms. Nevins said, is that the IDA Awards favor films
like HBO's ``I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary
School'' over more controversial fare.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy McLane, the IDA's executive director, disputes the notion
that her organization shies away from controversy. ``The only thing
I worry about is whether we are doing a good enough job recognizing
international filmmakers,'' she said. Awards hold outsize sway in
the life of a documentary maker, not only because they are often
the only public acknowledgment of a film but because awards can
directly affect future financing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For many filmmakers, however, awards are a double-edged sword.
``Considering the films that get honored, I'm not sure it's the
kind of recognition you want,'' said Nick Broomfield, a maker of
controversial documentaries on the life of Heidi Fleiss and the
death of Kurt Cobain. His most recent film, ``Fetishes,'' was shown
on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disturbing sense that the old guard cling to the
idea that documentaries should somehow be medicinal,'' Broomfield
said, ``that they have to be edifying to be worthwhile. Ironically,
that really violates the very nature of documentary.''
</P>
<P>
   The only award Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini got for
``Off the Menu: The Last Days of Chasen's,'' a well-received but
unfashionably piquant film about the closing of the landmark
Hollywood restaurant, came from the Hamptons Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even they were really nervous about the subject matter,''
Ms. Berman said. ``It wasn't enough that it was about some really
interesting themes, like the obsession with celebrity and the
change in the Hollywood old guard. It wasn't on the list of
pre-approved, really serious subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   When it became apparent that their less-than-grave subject
matter would never cut it with awards judges, one of Ms. Berman's
backers suggested, only half-jokingly, that they rename the film
``Survivors Who Ate at Chasen's.''
</P>
<P>
   To many young documentary makers, there is no more trenchant
symbol of the clash between the two filmmaking styles than the
Academy Award for best documentary. The winners have long limned _
though often brilliantly _ predictably poignant subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ``The Long Way Home,'' a Holocaust documentary, got
the nod. Other recent winners include ``Maya Lin: A Strong, Clear
Vision'' and ``Anne Frank Remembered.'' But ``Hoop Dreams,'' the
downbeat saga of two inner-city basketball players, was never
nominated. ``Crumb,'' a riveting but scatological look at the art
and family life of the underground comic book creator Robert Crumb,
received the 1995 IDA Award, and was named best film of the year by
many critics, but it didn't crack the Oscar committee's top 15
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Even Entertainment Weekly, the most mainstream magazine
imaginable, loved it,'' said Terry Zwigoff, the director of
``Crumb.'' ``So you can imagine I thought it was pretty weird that
it didn't even get a nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Marshall, a feature-film producer who is on the Oscar
documentary committee, acknowledges that the academy members who
judge the documentaries are largely older and tradition-bound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty horrified at some of the subjects the younger
documentarians choose to work on,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter
that the way in which those subjects is handled is sometimes truly
masterful. They can't get past it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall has been working to change the process, to recruit
younger, more progressive academy members to judge the
documentaries. ``It's a cycle that needs to be broken,'' he said.
``Those more open-minded members have to find out that there are
really incredible films to look at it, that some of the best work
in film today is being done in documentaries.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the documentary old guard is opening itself
to a more progressive strain. Last month, the IDA gave its career
achievement award to Ms. Nevins. And while HBO has produced more
than its share of earnest, heartwarming documentaries _ it has
received six Oscars for films like ``One Survivor Remembers'' and
``Common Thread: Stories From the Quilt'' _ it is also financing
Ms. Spadola's new film about how men feel about their penises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few years ago, I never would have gotten an IDA
award,'' Ms. Nevins said. ``I was scary and bad. I'm still scary
and bad, but maybe this means not as many people are running away
from what I'm trying to say.''

A RELAXED TYSON SETS HIS RETURN TO THE RING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN GURNICK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Mike Tyson, the former two-time heavyweight champion
whose legal status is again tangled, Tuesday officially announced
his return to the boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Looking physically fit and relaxed, Tyson appeared at a news
conference to promote a Jan. 16 fight against Francois Botha at the
MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nev. While Botha was also on the dais at
the ballroom in the Hollywood Athletic Club, the 20-minute news
conference was all about Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The Botha fight would end Tyson's 18-month exile from boxing,
which began after the Nevada State Athletic Commission suspended
him for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in a June 1997 championship
fight. Tyson's boxing license was reinstated in October.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's life outside the ring became snarled last week in
Maryland, when he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges
stemming from a traffic accident in August. Earlier Tuesday, Marion
County Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford in Indiana decided she
would wait to rule on whether Tyson violated his parole from a 1992
rape conviction until he was sentenced in the Gaithersburg, Md.,
court. Tyson served half of his six-year sentence after being
convicted of raping a woman in Indianapolis in 1991. His probation
is set to expire in March.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing is expected to take place in February. With his
no-contest plea, Tyson, 32, could face up to 20 years in prison and
be fined $5,000. He reached out-of-court settlements with the two
men who accused him of assault.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Tyson refused to answer questions about his court case,
but said he was pleased to be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much for talking,'' he said. ``You know what I do. I
put guys in body bags, when I'm right.''
</P>
<P>
   Joined at the news conference by his new management team, which
included the former basketball star Magic Johnson in an
as-yet-undefined role, Tyson did not work up a sweat as he evaded
pointed questions ranging from a possible return to prison to a
change in boxing style from his unbeaten early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I'm on parole and trying to be very nice up
here,'' he said with a smile. ``If I appear to be something you're
not acquainted with, understand my situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, in an interview with The New York Times, Tyson
briefly addressed the prospects of more prison time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went back to prison, it wouldn't be because I violated
anyone,'' he said. ``I didn't do anything to go back. If they send
me back to prison, I can handle it. I'm not a wimp. I'm no chump.
I'm not afraid of anything, except God.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as going back, they can send me back for 50 or 60
years; I can deal with that. As long as I can get this fight over
with and get some security for my family, I can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his handlers insisted this fight was about Tyson's
legacy and not money, Tyson left no doubt about his motivation when
asked at the news conference if he would be interested in taking on
48-year-old Joe Bugner after Botha, 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price is right, I'll fight a lion,'' said Tyson, who
owes millions to the Internal Revenue Service but will earn a
reported $30 million for the pay-per-view fight against Botha. The
South African defeated Axel Schulz in 1995 for the International
Boxing Federation heavyweight title but had the fight declared a no
contest when he tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   As the questions continued, Tyson appeared to lose interest in
answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being a very good boy,'' he said when asked about past
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain his looser attitude, he said: ``Probation
officer. Yeah, I'm having a ball.'' &QL;

CLINTON DEFENSE WITNESSES QUERIED ON PERJURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee
aggressively pressed White House defense witnesses Tuesday about
whether President Clinton lied under oath about his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But despite intense and repeated questioning, White House
counsel Greg Craig refused to budge on the perjury issue as GOP
lawmakers sought to justify what will almost certainly be a
decision later this week to recommend impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an effort by the president to testify accurately but
not to disclose information about his relationship. That may be
blameworthy, it may be wrong. You may judge that he crossed the
line. But in fact there is no testimony, no proof, that President
Clinton knew he was wrong ... and intentionally lied,'' Craig
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony Monday opened two days of hearings in which
Clinton's lawyers, former members of Congress, constitutional
scholars and historians will try to head off GOP efforts to force a
vote by the full House next week on whether Clinton should be
impeached. The panel is expected to vote out some form of
impeachment resolution by week's end that would require a special
session of the lame-duck 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In their questioning of Craig and other Clinton witnesses, the
21 Republicans on the judiciary panel generally ignored the legal
and historical arguments against impeachment to emphasize their
assertion that ``the facts'' of the Lewinsky scandal clearly show
the president knowingly lied under oath and ought to be removed
from office because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he lie to the American people when he said `I never had
sex with that woman?''' asked Rep. Robert Inglis, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't believe that he did. He does not believe that he
lied,'' Craig said, though he admitted Clinton's testimony may have
been ``evasive, incomplete, misleading, even maddening ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``How could his testimony be those things without being a lie?``
asked Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis later added: ``There's nothing new here ... the score is
zero facts and zero evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Republicans focused much of their questioning on the
grave nature of perjury and protecting the rule of law, Democrats
on the committee and the White House defense team contended that
the allegations against the president do not amount to impeachable
offenses and that Clinton truly regrets his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic defense is aimed more at undecided Republicans
still home in their districts than at committee members. Only five
Republicans have announced against impeachment so far, but the
White House took heart from a CNN report that veteran Rep. Amo
Houghton, R-N.Y., will announce his opposition Wednesday at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also will call moderate Republican William Weld,
the former Massachusetts governor and former Justice Department
attorney under President Reagan, as a witness. The White House
evidently hopes Weld will sway wavering Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The defense strategy is also directed at the American people
whom many Democrats fear have lost track of the proceedings during
this holiday season. Public opinion surveys show two-thirds of the
people oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., noted the committee vote favoring
impeachment was ``a foregone conclusion'' regardless of the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will of the people is about to be ignored in the hope that
the people won't care enough to say anything,'' said Meehan, adding
the testimony is important to help sway the 20 to 30 undecided
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came in from California last night, and people at home,
many of them, were asking me when is this going to be wound up?
They thought it was over, and people are getting ready for the
holidays,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. ``So I think this
hearing today is very important in terms of informing not just the
committee and the House, but the American public that something is
actually happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House appeared to be caught off guard last week as it
became clearer that the move toward impeachment by the full House
was gaining momentum. The impeachment amounts to an indictment that
would force a trial to be held in the Senate to determine whether
Clinton should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   After their surprisingly strong showing in the Nov. 3 elections,
the Democrats appeared to have quashed the impeachment push,
interpreting their success to mean the public wants to put the
year-long sex scandal behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But an all-or-nothing strategy by Republicans and complaints of
Clinton's continued arrogance revived the impeachment movement. Led
by House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who has refused to consider any
compromise punishment such as censure, impeachment proponents have
gained enough strength to make a vote of the full House too close
to call.

IN RUSH TO REPLAY, SOME OWNERS CALL FOR A PAUSE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day after the National Football League called for a vote by
its owners on whether to use instant replay during the playoffs, it
became clear that the short time frame involved could hinder its
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to cure anything by going into it
half-cocked,'' Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, said in a
statement. An opponent of replay in the past, he added, ``We're
absolutely opposed to rushing into replay.''
</P>
<P>
   But even an advocate of replay like Dennis Green, the Minnesota
Vikings' coach, said he wondered if the league wasn't moving too
quickly, reacting too fast to criticism of calls that might have
been reversed if replay were in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who are for it but won't vote for it
because they don't want to rush something in,'' he said. ``I've
looked at the lay of the land, and it does not look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL knows that its quick and unexpected decision to seek a
vote on post-season replay may not succeed. The league announced
its intentions Monday, a day after a head linesman at the
Jets-Seahawks game incorrectly ruled a touchdown for the Jets'
Vinny Testaverde on a 5-yard quarterback sneak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having replay in the playoffs remains a possibility, not a
probability,'' said Joe Browne, the league's senior vice president
of communications.
</P>
<P>
   So far, teams have not received the league's proposal, because
it is not complete, but a detailed plan was expected to be ready
for an anticipated vote next week. But a vote may not occur if
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue cannot change enough votes to get the
24 needed for passage. And it is by no means clear that those votes
would be there, despite a series of high-profile officiating errors
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say anybody who wants to change the system in the middle
of the season is not thinking in an orderly process about how the
game should be run,'' said Lamar Hunt, the owner of the Kansas City
Chiefs, a longtime replay opponent.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``To jam something through in so short a time is
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition appears to center on the short time left to
implement an effective system before the first playoff game on Jan.
2. Some opponents said they might reconsider their stance when the
league next votes on full-season replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a completely open mind when the subject comes up
at our annual league meetings in March,'' Mara said in his
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The basic outline of the plan being tweaked by league officials
would let each coach challenge two plays a game. If a coach has
used up his challenges, the referee can review a disputed play in
the last two minutes of the game. The league must decide whether a
coach would be penalized with a timeout if his challenge fails to
result in a reversal.
</P>
<P>
   The referee would view replays from a television monitor on the
sidelines, watching the same network videotape seen by viewers to
make the decision. In replay's earlier incarnation from 1986 to
1991, replay judges sitting in stadium booths reviewed the replays
before ruling to affirm or reverse the on-field call.
</P>
<P>
   The league needs three more team votes, from the 21 that failed
to pass the most recent replay proposal in March.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wilson, the Buffalo Bills' owner, has changed his previous
opposition to replay because of two key calls that went against his
team in a Nov. 29 game against New England. Rich McKay, Tampa Bay's
general manager, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that
the Buccaneers may change to a yes vote, but Tony Dungy, the team's
coach, told ESPN that he opposed the rush to replay.
</P>
<P>
   Even a consistent backer of replay like Ron Wolf, the general
manager of the Green Bay Packers, withheld his complete endorsement
of a playoff version. ``I don't know what it is,'' he said. ``We
haven't gotten anything from the league. So until it crosses my
desk, I don't know what we're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' position was clouded when it was reported during
the Packers-Buccaneers game on ``Monday Night Football'' that Mike
Holmgren, the Green Bay coach and a replay proponent on the
league's competition committee, said he did not advocate the rapid
imposition of replay for the playoffs and Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such ambiguity for William Bidwill, owner of the
Arizona Cardinals. ``We remain a no,'' said Paul Jensen, a
Cardinals spokesman. `` B. feels the game should be played on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Giants, Buffalo, Kansas City, Tampa Bay and Arizona,
the other replay naysayers last March were Chicago, Cincinnati,
Oakland and San Diego. Bill Johnston, a Chargers spokesman, said
that the team's president, Dean Spanos, would change votes for
playoff replay but would not vote for the challenge system for the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The technical logistics of reviving replay may be easier than
the politics. An on-field monitor would be connected to the network
transmission of the game, as it was during preseason replay
experiments last summer and in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff replay would create a more extensive array of camera
angles than during the regular season to assess disputed plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just can't have enough cameras,'' Hunt said, ``to
catch every key play at every position.''

 &HT;    Texas lowers auto rate standard
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The lowering of a key factor in the price Texans pay
for auto insurance could signal another round of rate cuts next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer, who's preparing to leave
office to become a senior aide to Republican Gov. George W. Bush,
Tuesday lowered the statewide auto insurance benchmark rate 5.5
percent, effective Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   In Travis County, the benchmark rate will drop up to 7.2
percent. That maximum drop would be for typical drivers who buy the
required level of liability insurance and optional insurance to
protect themselves from underinsured and uninsured drivers. The 7.2
percent cut means the benchmark rate would drop from $363 to $337
for those drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Insurance defines a typical driver as a
man 25 to 64 or woman 21 to 64 with no at-fault wrecks or major
traffic convictions who generally drives to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide benchmark rate is an average of benchmark rates
set in more than 50 auto insurance territories in Texas. Insurers
use those rates to help determine the rates they charge their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bomer said he lowered the statewide benchmark rate _ and most of
the underlying territorial benchmark rates _ because the amount of
money insurers pay in claims continues to ``lag well behind'' the
money they collect to pay for those claims. He said fewer lawsuits,
safer cars, less drunken driving and other factors have reduced the
number and cost of claims. Insurance premiums must be lowered to
reflect that, Bomer said, echoing consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to close this gap so that consumers don't pay too much
for their car insurance,'' the commissioner said. ``All the
evidence justifies a substantial rate reduction that still should
leave the companies a fair profit on their Texas business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the benchmark rates are a key factor in each company's
rates, their lowering doesn't mean every company will lower rates
or do so at an equal pace. Bomer and consumer advocates urge
consumers to shop around and compare rates.
</P>
<P>
   Regulated auto insurers, who cover the majority of cars in
Texas, can set their rates 30 percent above to 30 percent below the
state-set benchmark in each area. After the new state rates take
effect in February, companies will have 30 days to file their own
rates.
</P>
<P>
   When companies filed their rates last year _ after Bomer lowered
the statewide benchmark by 5 percent _ the commissioner and
Insurance Department officials persuaded many companies to further
reduce rates, saying the rates they filed remained too high based
on the number and costs of claims.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Slivinske, a spokeswoman for the trade group Texas
Insurance Organization, said that while the cost of some types of
claims has fallen, other costs have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner's decision failed to set an adequate
benchmark rate for the Texas marketplace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns, president of Southwestern Insurance Information
Service, another industry group, said the entire benchmark rating
system should be replaced because it relies on old information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information on which the commissioner's decision was based
is not a true reflection of what is going on in the auto insurance
market today,'' Johns said. ``The auto benchmark decision today was
based on data 18 months to 2 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming legislative session, which will begin Jan. 12,
insurers are expected to back proposals to replace the benchmark
system with one that allows companies to set their rates without
regard to a state rate. The department would be able to take action
against companies if the rates filed appeared excessive.

JUDGE STRIKES DOWN N.J. BAN ON CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a New
Jersey law banning what abortion opponents call partial-birth
abortion, saying the measure was unconstitutional because it would
threaten the health of women by denying them access to the safest
medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing a permanent injunction against the law, which
legislators passed in 1997 over the veto of Gov. Christie Whitman,
the judge ruled that the measure was so vaguely worded that it
would ban some of the most common abortion procedures at any point
during a pregnancy and failed to make exceptions for cases in which
the health or life of the mother was at risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson said the law also violated the
rights of health care providers because it would have allowed the
state to fine doctors and strip them of their licenses if they
performed certain procedures protected under the Supreme Court's
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has concluded that the act threatens a woman's
constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy,'' the judge wrote
in her 48-page decision. ``It is in the public interest to prevent
the act from taking effect and thereby protect the woman's right to
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar laws have been struck down by federal courts in at least
10 states.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the law said it was intended to outlaw only one
specific procedure, known as the intact dilation and extraction, or
D&AMP;X. In the procedure, doctors pull the fetus' legs into the
uterus, then use a sharp object to puncture its skull so it can fit
through the cervix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law prohibited only those cases in which the babies are
partially delivered, then killed,'' said Marie Tasy, legislative
director for New Jersey Right to Life. ``Once the baby is out of
the womb, it's no longer covered by Roe. To us, this is a human
rights issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The law would have placed the first restrictions on abortion in
New Jersey since the Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973, and the battle
illustrates how abortion rights opponents have gained influence in
the state during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   After lawmakers approved the ban last year, Whitman, a
Republican notable for her longtime support of abortion rights,
tried unsuccessfully to persuade legislators to adopt her approach,
which would have allowed the procedures in cases when the mother's
life or health were endangered. But abortion opponents argued that
her plan offered too big of a loophole. And the
Republican-controlled Legislature, led by two possible candidates
for governor in 2001, voted to override Whitman's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, whose ambitions for national office have been hampered
by her support of abortion rights, ordered her attorney general not
to defend the law in court when it was challenged by Planned
Parenthood. But Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President
Donald DiFrancesco set aside $300,000 from the Legislature's
general fund to pay the lawyers' fees, and after Tuesday's ruling
they released a joint statement indicating they might appeal the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman applauded Thompson's ruling, but restated her
willingness to sign legislation that would ban late-term abortions
except in cases where the life or health of the mother was at risk.
</P>
<P>
   As written, the New Jersey law would have outlawed ``an abortion
in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally
delivers a fetus before killing the fetus and completing the
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's ruling was handed down following a four-day hearing
conducted in October, in which medical professionals presented
sharply contrasting views of how the statute would affect health
care providers. The proceedings also included many of the polemics
that have characterized the nationwide debate over so-called
partial-birth abortions. Twenty-eight states have enacted bans
similar to New Jersey's and Congress has twice passed national bans
on the procedure, only to have President Clinton veto them both.
</P>
<P>
   Lenora Lapidus, legal director for the American Civil Liberties
Union of New Jersey, argued the case before Thompson and described
the measure as a virtual ban on abortions because most abortion
procedures could result in medical complications that would be
outlawed by the statue. Talcott Camp, staff attorney for the ACLU's
Reproductive Freedom Project, said the law would have had a
chilling effect on doctors who perform abortions by pressuring them
not to perform the safest forms of abortion for fear that they
might be fined or stripped of their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's so sad about this,'' Ms. Camp said. ``They're
trying to restrict abortions but they're doing it in a way which
endangers the health of the women involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Collier, the lawyer hired by the Legislature to
defend the law, argued that the statute was clearly intended to ban
only a small subset of abortions in which the fetus was
intentionally killed after it had moved partially through the birth
canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not abortion,'' he said, ``that's infanticide.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier said he hoped to appeal the decision and argue that the
judge erred by interpreting the law too broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a judicial obligation to interpret the Legislature's
words in the most narrow way possible,'' he said. ``But she
interpreted them in the broadest way possible, the way Planned
Parenthood asked her to. She took the easy way out.''

 &HT;    Texas lowers auto rate standard
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The lowering of a key factor in the price Texans pay
for auto insurance could signal another round of rate cuts next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer, who's preparing to leave
office to become a senior aide to Republican Gov. George W. Bush,
Tuesday lowered the statewide auto insurance benchmark rate 5.5
percent, effective Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   In Travis County, the benchmark rate will drop up to 7.2
percent. That maximum drop would be for typical drivers who buy the
required level of liability insurance and optional insurance to
protect themselves from underinsured and uninsured drivers. The 7.2
percent cut means the benchmark rate would drop from $363 to $337
for those drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Insurance defines a typical driver as a
man 25 to 64 or woman 21 to 64 with no at-fault wrecks or major
traffic convictions who generally drives to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide benchmark rate is an average of benchmark rates
set in more than 50 auto insurance territories in Texas. Insurers
use those rates to help determine the rates they charge their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bomer said he lowered the statewide benchmark rate _ and most of
the underlying territorial benchmark rates _ because the amount of
money insurers pay in claims continues to ``lag well behind'' the
money they collect to pay for those claims. He said fewer lawsuits,
safer cars, less drunken driving and other factors have reduced the
number and cost of claims. Insurance premiums must be lowered to
reflect that, Bomer said, echoing consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to close this gap so that consumers don't pay too much
for their car insurance,'' the commissioner said. ``All the
evidence justifies a substantial rate reduction that still should
leave the companies a fair profit on their Texas business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the benchmark rates are a key factor in each company's
rates, their lowering doesn't mean every company will lower rates
or do so at an equal pace. Bomer and consumer advocates urge
consumers to shop around and compare rates.
</P>
<P>
   Regulated auto insurers, who cover the majority of cars in
Texas, can set their rates 30 percent above to 30 percent below the
state-set benchmark in each area. After the new state rates take
effect in February, companies will have 30 days to file their own
rates.
</P>
<P>
   When companies filed their rates last year _ after Bomer lowered
the statewide benchmark by 5 percent _ the commissioner and
Insurance Department officials persuaded many companies to further
reduce rates, saying the rates they filed remained too high based
on the number and costs of claims.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Slivinske, a spokeswoman for the trade group Texas
Insurance Organization, said that while the cost of some types of
claims has fallen, other costs have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner's decision failed to set an adequate
benchmark rate for the Texas marketplace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns, president of Southwestern Insurance Information
Service, another industry group, said the entire benchmark rating
system should be replaced because it relies on old information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information on which the commissioner's decision was based
is not a true reflection of what is going on in the auto insurance
market today,'' Johns said. ``The auto benchmark decision today was
based on data 18 months to 2 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming legislative session, which will begin Jan. 12,
insurers are expected to back proposals to replace the benchmark
system with one that allows companies to set their rates without
regard to a state rate. The department would be able to take action
against companies if the rates filed appeared excessive.

 WASHINGTON: against impeachment.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, after months of bitter name-calling and
diversionary tactics, both sides engaged in a sober debate on the
merits of the case against Clinton. The president's witnesses,
while not answering all the specific factual accusations, presented
a detailed argument as to why the president's offenses were serious
but were not the basis for a constitutional cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the flurry of paper and the cacophony of testimony, Clinton
was silent on all matters legal. He opened a two-day White House
conference on Social Security before flying to Nashville to attend
a memorial service for Albert Gore Sr., the father of the vice
president. He returned to Washington this evening to receive an
award for his peacemaking efforts in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team assembled by the White House offered few new
arguments against impeachment, but there was a discernible shift in
approach. Led by the soothing Craig, the White House witnesses,
with a few pointed exceptions, attempted for the most part a
strategy of apology rather than argument. None raised objections to
the possibility of a Congressional vote of censure as a way of
expressing displeasure short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy League scholars, congressional veterans of the last
impeachment debate and former Watergate prosecutors all carried the
White House message that Bill Clinton is not Richard Nixon and that
sexual misconduct does not constitute a great offense against the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Craig implored members of Congress, and through them a
nationwide cable television audience, to listen to Clinton's case
before deciding on the momentous step of impeaching and removing a
popularly-elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we begin this undertaking,'' Craig said at the outset of
the marathon presentation, ``I make only one plea to you, and I
hope it is not a futile one, coming this late in the process. Open
your mind. Open your heart, and focus on the record. As you sit
there listening to me at this moment, you may already be determined
to vote to approve some articles of impeachment against this
president. That is your right and your duty, if you believe the
facts and the law justify such a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the White House would present a powerful case
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the close of tomorrow, all the world will see one simple
and undeniable fact: whatever there is in the record that shows
that what the president did was wrong and blameworthy, there is
nothing in the record in either the law or the facts, that would
justify his impeachment and removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and its Democratic allies in Congress held out
little hope of averting a committee vote on one or more articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone was expecting any movement from the
members of the committee,'' one White House strategist said
tonight. ``The committee long ago determined they were not going to
be an audience for our defense. That's not who we are addressing
today and tommorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Tuesday offered the 20 to 30 Republicans who
appear to be undecided on impeachment what many of them have
demanded _ more contrition and less legal artifice; more facts in
defense of the president's actions and less spin.
</P>
<P>
   Craig conveyed to the committee what he said was Clinton's
``profound and powerful regret'' for his actions and equivocations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has insisted and personally instructed his lawyers that no
technicalities or legalities should be allowed to obscure the
simple moral truth that his behavior in this matter was wrong,''
Craig said in his opening remarks. ``The president wants everyone
to know _ the committee, the Congress and the country _ that he is
genuinely sorry for the pain and the damage that he has caused and
for the wrongs that he has committed.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone thought that was to be a prelude to a confession
to perjury, obstruction of justice or abuse of power, they were
disappointed. Craig vigorously defended the president's misleading
testimony before a judge in a civil case and a criminal grand jury,
using the same legal contortions that have maddened prosecutors and
Republican opponents all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's testimony was evasive, incomplete, misleading,
even maddening,'' Craig said, ``but it was not perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C.,, tried to pin Craig down on the
president's statements about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he lie?'' when he said that he had not had sex with Ms.
Lewinsky, Inglis repeatedly demanded to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly misled and deceived,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis repeated, ``He doesn't believe that he lied?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he does not believe that he lied, because his notion of
what sex is is what the dictionary definition is,'' Craig answered.
``I understand you're not going to like this, congressman, because
you will see it as a technical defense or a hair-splitting, evasive
answer, but sexual relations is defined in every dictionary in a
certain way, and he did not have that kind of sexual contact with
Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning session before the committee included scholars from
Harvard, Princeton and Yale who had previously expressed opposition
to impeachment, as well as Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who served as
attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Wilentz, professor of American history at Princeton,
angered several Republican members of the committee by warning them
that what he characterized as an unjustified vote to impeach
Clinton would bring them the opprobrium of history.
</P>
<P>
   Wilentz argued that Clinton's alleged offenses _ even if all
were proven true _ do not warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe they do rise to that level, you will vote for
impeachment and take your risk at going down in history with the
zealots and the fanatics,'' Wilentz said. ``If you understand that
the charges do not rise to the level of impeachment, or if you are
at all unsure, and yet you vote in favor of impeachment anyway for
some other reason, history will track you down and condemn you for
your cravenness. Alternatively, you could muster the courage of
your convictions. The choice is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress do not take kindly to such lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., said that he did not appreciate being
called a fanatic and a coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of name-calling by the president's defense is
disappointing and demeaning to this proceeding,'' Buyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach made the point that impeachment was devised by the
authors of the Constitution as a means to remove a president who by
his behavior had so compromised his position that he could not
longer fulfill the functions of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach said that most instances of perjury would not
undermine a president's ability to remain in office. And he noted
that Clinton continued to enjoy high public-approval ratings and
therefore had not squandered his mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am correct, then it seems to me the fundamental question
is simply whether the president has done something which has
destroyed public confidence in his ability to continue in that
office,'' Katzenbach said. ``If the public doesn't believe that
what he has done seriously affects his ability to perform his
public duties as president, should the committee conclude that his
acts have destroyed public confidence essential to that office?''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, professor of law at Yale University, said that
the House was confronted with the question of whether Clinton's
conduct represented ``an assault on the fundamental principles of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it does not, Ackerman added that if such were the
case, ``our history over the last two centuries would be littered
with bills of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman also asserted that any articles of impeachment voted by
the current lame duck Congress would expire when the new Congress
takes office in January. He said that the new Congress, with five
fewer Republicans, would have to vote again on articles of
impeachment before a Senate trial could take place.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars were replaced at the witness table in the afternoon
by three former Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee who
voted to approve articles of impeachment against Nixon in 1974 _
Elizabeth Holtzman of New York, Robert Drinan of Massachusetts and
Wayne Owens of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared as ``the three ghosts of impeachment past,'' as
Owens put it.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan, now a law professor at Georgetown University, called the
drive toward impeachment an act of ``vengeance'' and he predicted
that it would lead to an explosion of anger among the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., thundered, ``Do you seriously believe
that any member of this committee or this House will be driven by
vengeance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave God to judge,'' replied Drinan, a Jesuit priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe God's messenger should not be prejudge that,'' Gekas
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holtzman, who served as U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
after leaving Congress, argued that there is a huge difference
between impeaching one of hundreds of appointed federal judges and
removing from office the nation's lone elected president.
</P>
<P>
   She expanded on her point in response to a question from Rep.
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many on this committee and many in the country
believe the president's conduct to be reprehensible and
unacceptable,'' Ms. Holtzman said. ``I do not disagree, and I'm not
here to excuse that conduct. Let us remember, however, that the
goal of impeachment is not to punish a president but to protect the
nation. Impeachment now will punish the nation, not protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightfall brought the day's two final witnesses, Richard
Ben-Veniste and James Hamilton, prominent Democratic lawyers and
former Watergate prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Veniste criticized Starr for conducting a crusade against
the president and employing relentless and unfair tactics to bring
him down.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who once advised Clinton to aggressively employ all
legal methods to thwart the numerous investigations plaguing his
presidency, said that Clinton's offenses were ``low crimes'' worthy
of censure, not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If all lying politicians were chased from office, Hamilton told
the weary committee, ``I fear the halls of government would be
seriously depleted.''

   WASHINGTON _ I am a bit old for this sort of thing, but if I
were to be asked for a Christmas list this year, my top wish would
be that the Monica Lewinsky affair could be erased from the 1998
calendar. That, of course, is not to be. The issue is with us. We
members of the House of Representatives will make a stab at
reaching a decision on impeachment by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   If I were granted a second wish, it would be that we stick to
the facts and not political fantasies as we work to resolve
something that has become a tumor in our society. No one is
comfortable here in Washington these days. We feel sullied and
sidetracked, our loyalties stretched to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fight the problem, decide it,'' George C. Marshall used
to say. It can become oddly enjoyable raking over the details,
lamenting the moral lapses. It helps sidestep the unadorned
thinking required to decide tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   But decide we must, and in a larger sense the main issue is how
to heal, rather than further divide, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Far wiser heads than mine have devoted considerable thought to
the legal and ethical ramifications of impeachment. But all eyes
will probably be on the members of the House next week, when the
issue is likely to go to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   God willing, I will be there. I intend to vote against
impeachment. This may seem a bit premature, since the Judiciary
Committee has yet to send an article of impeachment to the entire
House. But the prosecution has presented its case and given us the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there was conduct unbecoming, and I deplore it. If a
plant manager in the company I used to work for engaged in such
conduct, we would have disciplined him immediately. Maybe even
dismissed him. But we wouldn't have burned him at the stake.
</P>
<P>
   Of course morals and decency and the laws we live by are all
important. But can anyone argue that these threads are made
stronger if we dismiss someone from office instead of issuing a
strong rebuke?
</P>
<P>
   What we are facing is a practical, pre-ordained outcome. Since
there are insufficient votes to impeach in the Senate, President
Clinton will not be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   We may wish it were otherwise. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this case should not be compared to judgments in
the military or other walks of life. Forty-three million Americans,
knowing full well the history of similar charges against the
president, voted Clinton into office _ not once, but twice. And I
say this as someone who went down to the wire supporting George
Bush and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   For 218 people in the House _ the number needed to send a bill
to the Senate _ to consider overturning that verdict strikes me as
a bit presumptuous. For me, at least, an action qualifies as a
``high crime'' only if it is directed against the state, not
inflicted on oneself.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that when the only tool you own is a
hammer, sooner or later everything begins to look like a nail. We
should search for other tools in our tool chest.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to make a plea to the House Rules Committee to
allow another option. Why not recognize our limited field of action
and at the very least end this sad chapter in our history with a
strong statement of rebuke rather than nothing at all?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way, it is almost Christmas time. Anyone for a touch
of forgiveness?

of forgiveness?

ADVERTISING: A CO-CHAIRMAN OF LOWE STEPS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marvin Sloves, a consummate ``suit'' with a strong
creative sensibility, who has been one of the leading figures on
Madison Avenue since the 1960s, is stepping down at the shop that
he helped to expand substantially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Sloves, 65, who has worked on the account-management side of
agencies from Leo Burnett Co. to Scali, McCabe, Sloves to Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS, will retire on Dec. 31 from Lowe, part of the Lowe
Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is the time to go,'' Sloves said Tuesday in a
telephone interview. ``As I write at the end of every memo, onward
and upward.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four years as co-chairman at Lowe, based in New York, the
agency has more than doubled its billings, to $740 million from
$300 million, and opened an office in San Francisco. Lowe has
attracted accounts like Eddie Bauer, Excite, Heineken USA, KPMG
Peat Marwick and Sun Microsystems, while expanding relationships
with big clients like Coca-Cola, Gillette and Mercedes-Benz of
North America, a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Sloves is relinquishing his post as co-chairman with the
expiration of a two-year extension on what had originally been a
three-year contract that he signed in 1993. Beginning Jan. 1,
Sloves will serve as a consultant to Lee Garfinkel, co-chairman of
Lowe, who is also the agency's chief creative officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will still be involved with the agency as chairman emeritus
and as a counselor and adviser to Lee for at least two years,''
Sloves said.
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkel, 43, will become the sole chairman as Sloves retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to maintain what we've created,'' said Garfinkel,
who joined Sloves for the interview, ``and keep pushing the
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in trade publications like The
Delaney Report that Sloves, a robust man who clearly still relishes
the advertising business, had discussed with Frank Lowe, chairman
and chief executive at Lowe Group, staying on at Lowe beyond Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Sloves, asked whether he sought to continue as co-chairman for
at least a little longer, replied: ``No, no, no, I never really
thought about it. It was the end of my contract. We mutually felt,
the company and myself, that this is a good time for me to stop
helping Lee run the company operationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe praised Sloves effusively in a statement, calling him ``one
of the legends of our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloves joined Lowe as a vice chairman in November 1993 when Lowe
Group acquired Scali, McCabe, a well-known creative New York
agency, from WPP Group PLC. Scali, McCabe, which created
cutting-edge campaigns for brands like Perdue chicken and Volvo
automobiles, was merged to form Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months later, near the end of a tough year for the
merged agency, Sloves and Garfinkel, who had also been a vice
chairman, were named co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption by Sloves of day-to-day responsibilities with
Garfinkel played a large part in re-energizing and turning around
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an extraordinary four years,'' Sloves said.
</P>
<P>
   Sloves recalled that his first job in advertising was in Chicago
``in approximately 1960, in the research department at Burnett, as
an assistant research analyst on, of all things, Marlboro
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to report every single Friday to Leo Burnett himself,''
Sloves added, ``because he was very involved with Marlboro.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloves relocated to New York in about 1963, working for such
agencies as Ted Bates Advertising and Papert, Koenig, Lois. He and
a group of employees from Papert, Koenig started Scali, McCabe
along with the copywriter Ed McCabe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like I'm living in the past, but if I
were a client, what I would want is personal attention from my
agency, someone who will die if I don't do well and cheer if I do
well,'' Sloves said. ``That's missing from the advertising business
as it gets conglomeratized and bureaucratized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've always felt that successful agencies are agencies
that grow from within,'' he added, ``not only wooing new business,
which is part salesmanship, but being rewarded by clients with more
business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sloves has been especially close to executives at Mercedes-Benz,
an account that Scali, McCabe landed in 1992 to replace Volvo, and
resigned after a scandal involving a faked commercial. The account
came to Lowe with the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's here because of me,'' Sloves demurred.
``It's here because the agency does all the work for Mercedes, soup
to nuts: sales promotion, television, direct marketing, media.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Lowe in 1992, Garfinkel, a copywriter with a dry
wit, who began in advertising in 1978, worked on accounts like
Subaru and Pepsi-Cola at Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &AMP; Beaver in New
York and the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way do I think I embark on this journey alone,''
Garfinkel said, referring to his duties as the sole chairman.
``Over the last year, more executives have been taking on more
managing duties.'' They include Gary Goldsmith, vice chairman and
executive creative director; Robert Kantor, president for U.S.
operations, and Alan Jurmain, executive director for media
services.
</P>
<P>
   As for reports that Garfinkel's name is to be added to the
agency's, there are no immediate plans for this to be done. That's
adspeak for something that will happen fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   Sloves is not the only longtime agency executive to announce
retirement plans in recent days. Jack Cohen, a specialist in print
and outdoor media, will retire on Jan. 1 after 41 years in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, 64, has been director for print and outdoor media buying
at DDB Needham Worldwide in New York, a unit of the Omnicom Group,
since 1983, working for such clients as Amtrak, Hershey Foods and
Mobil. Cohen joined a DDB Needham predecessor, Doyle Dane Bernbach,
in 1960, and before that spent three years at the old Cunningham &AMP;
Walsh agency.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Needham has named no successor to Cohen, who will continue
as a member of the board of a media organization known as the
Certified Audit of Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sloves and Garfinkel will no longer be co-chairmen at
Lowe, there is a tie they will always share.
</P>
<P>
   Sloves, who has a collection of boxing memorabilia inspired by
his father, Herman Sloves, who fought under the name Johnny Murray,
was looking one day at a list of his father's fights, Garfinkel
said, ``when I said, `Let's see if Marvin's father ever fought my
uncle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Garfinkel said, his uncle, Jack Gritzhandler, who fought
under the name Jack Gritz, once boxed Sloves' father in the
mid-1920s, ``and his father knocked my uncle out.''

   NEW YORK _ At age 46, John Grass is the head groundskeeper for
the Mehlville School District outside St. Louis. He earns $30,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Philip Ozersky is a research scientist at the Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He, too, earns $30,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Grass caught Mark McGwire's 63rd home run and
Ozersky caught the 70th and last of McGwire's record-breaking
season. For Grass, Ozersky and a few others who caught historic
home runs this season, the jackpot is five weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday at Guernsey's, a New York auction
house, announced an auction Jan. 12 at The Theater at Madison
Square Garden to sell seven baseballs from this year's home run
derby. The balls are the 63rd, 67th, 68th and 70th homers by
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and the 61st, 64th and 66th by
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs own the ball from Sosa's 61st home run and say they
will donate the auction proceeds to Sosa's foundation. The owners
of the other balls are represented or advised by Mike Barnes, a
28-year-old lawyer and agent from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he expected the 70th home run ball to bring more
than $1 million and the others to bring more than $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The highest price ever paid for a baseball was $110,000 at a New
York auction this year for the ball Babe Ruth hit for the first
home run in Yankee Stadium history. For the McGwire-Sosa balls,
Barnes said, ``The sky is the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have written offers of more than $1 million for No. 70,''
Barnes said. ``Most buyers are collectors or plan to donate the
balls to museums. It's a matter of ego. You're buying a piece of
American history, not a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   To people who believe the huge potential prices are incongruous,
Sosa, who attended the news conference, took a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad much of this money will go to charity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlan Ettinger, Guernsey's president, said he expected half the
proceeds to be donated to charities. He said the owner of one ball
was a veterinary student who said he would use part of his money to
repay student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Grass, who owns McGwire's No. 63, said he didn't care how much
he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to take care of my family,'' he said. ``I have a
son, two daughters, a grandchild, six brothers and two sisters.
That's a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky, who owns McGwire's No. 70, was looking more to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got the ball,'' he said, ``I was trying to live my
life out. This is a lot different from my life as a research
scientist. I will give some of this to charity, a significant sum,
I hope. I'm not married, but I'm trying to provide for my kids when
I have them.''

JAPANESE SCIENTISTS REPORT SUCCESS IN CLONING CALVES FROM ADULT
COWS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs lede graf, to add ``report,'' and graf 18)  (htv) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Japan report that they have cloned eight calves
from cells they gathered from a slaughterhouse, creating eight
identical copies of a single cow. Though half of the calves died,
some biologists say the results indicate that the cloning of cows
may be at least as efficient as in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Cows are the third adult animal to be cloned. The first was a
lamb named Dolly whose birth was announced in February 1997. She
had been cloned from an udder cell.
</P>
<P>
   Then came mice, announced last July. And suddenly cloning, which
just two years ago had been thought biologically impossible, is
looking like it might be entirely feasible, if not easy, according
to cloning experts.
</P>
<P>
   It still seems surprising to some scientists. After all, an
adult cell, like an udder cell, has reached its final destiny in
the body and under normal circumstances never changes into
something else. But with cloning, an adult cell would have to
reverse its development somehow and become an early embryo cell,
able to direct the development of an entirely new animal that was
the identical twin of the adult that provided the original cell.
</P>
<P>
   But now, ``cloning is becoming routine,'' said Dr. R. Michael
Roberts, a professor of animal physiology at the University of
Missouri and the chief scientist for the Department of
Agriculture's competitive grants program in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A paper by the Japanese scientists, led by Dr. Yukio Tsunoda of
Kinki University in Nara, Japan, describing their cloning of a cow,
will be published on Friday in the journal Science. Science lifted
its usual restrictions on announcing the results before publication
of the scientific paper after The Express in London wrote about the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Tsunoda and the others say that one reason to clone cattle would
be to reproduce exact copies of animals that are superb producers
of meat or milk. In fact, said Roberts, on a recent visit to Japan
he saw a calf that other researchers asserted they had cloned from
cells taken from the ear of a prize bull. The scientists who
created that clone have not yet published their results, Roberts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that several Japanese groups say they are
successfully cloning adult cows and bulls, although Tsunoda's group
is the first to publish results. Dr. Randall Prather, a cloning
researcher at the University of Missouri, said that he and others
are predicting that more than 50 calves that are clones of adults
born in Japan by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But what surprised many cloning experts was not just the fact
that a cow was cloned but the ease with which Tsunoda's group
accomplished its task.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is true, it's startling,'' said Dr. Barry Zirkin, a
reproductive biologist at Johns Hopkins University School of
Hygiene and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the cloning process, the Japanese scientists gathered
two types of cells from a Japanese beef cow whose entrails had been
discarded in a slaughterhouse: cumulus cells, which cling to eggs
and nurse them, and cells from the lining of the cow's Fallopian
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then they used these cells to create embryos, slipping either a
cumulus or Fallopian tube cell into another cow's egg from which
the genetic material had been removed. The researchers attempted to
add cumulus cells to 99 cow's eggs, of which 47 took up the cumulus
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the resulting embryos survived in the laboratory for
eight to nine days until they were ready to be transferred to
surrogate mothers. With the Fallopian tube cells, the researchers
used 150 eggs, got 94 of them to take up cells, and ended up with
28 embryos. Tsunoda's group transferred 10 of their 46 embryos to
cows that could serve as surrogate mothers. Eight calves were born.
Four of the calves died at or soon after birth; the others survived
and appear perfectly normal, the scientists state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In contrast, when Dolly was created, Dr. Ian Wilmut and his
colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Scotland began with more than
400 eggs, ended up with just 29 embryos that they could transfer to
surrogate mothers and just one live lamb, Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese investigators assert that although half of their
calves died, the deaths appeared to have nothing to do with the
fact that they were clones. One died of pneumonia stemming from
heat stroke, two others died from aspirating large amounts of
amniotic fluid at birth, the fourth died from complications during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say they are not convinced those four calves
were entirely normal. Nonetheless, they say, they are impressed
with the astonishing efficiency of the cow cloning _ 80 percent of
the embryos transferred to surrogate mothers survived until birth.
With in vitro fertilization, said Dr. George Seidel, an animal
physiologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, about 50
percent of transferred embryos survive until birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great results, no doubt about it,'' said Dr. Mark
Westhusin, a reproductive physiologist at Texas A&AMP;M University who
is working on the cloning of cattle and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, scientists say, there is much more work to be done to
understand how cloning works, and why. But, some say, with
successful cloning in three species, and with the process becoming
more efficient exponentially, it is hard to doubt that humans will
be cloned, sooner rather than later. Others urge caution, saying
that before humans are cloned, scientists would have to know much
more about the technique's safety and long-term consequences. Some
question the impact on society if, for example, a woman could give
birth to her own identical twin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible with humans? Perhaps,'' Zirkin said. ``But I'm
not sure this speaks to that. Different species are just very very
different. And the ethical issues on whether it should be tried
remain the exactly the same. Until those issues are appropriately
debated and discussed, it would be a mistake to think in those
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dr. Lee Silver, a molecular biologist at Princeton
University, he already knows of two qualified fertility specialists
who want to clone. And so, he says, ``anyone who thinks that things
will move slowly is being very naive.''

SKI CROWD POLES APART FROM NORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As much as I like cold weather, part of me wishes it hadn't been
so chilly Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then we would have found out whether the people who filed into
the Orpheum Theatre in downtown Phoenix to see Warren Miller's
``Freeriders'' would have decked themselves out in ski-lodge finery
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing they would have. Miller's 49th annual
ski-and-snowboarding movie played over the weekend at the Orpheum
and at Gammage Auditorium in Tempe. Miller's movies have a rabid
following; I was curious to find out just who goes and, more
importantly, why.
</P>
<P>
   They're not really movies in the traditional sense in that they
don't have plots (although you could say the same thing about Adam
Sandler movies). They're more like ski-themed travelogues with
MTV-like production. That means a soundtrack filled with bands of
the moment (``Freeriders,'' for instance, includes music by the
Samples and the extremely overrated Dave Matthews Band).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they're also nearly ski trade shows with lots of
sponsors on hand and plenty of prizes given away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won something just walking in the door,'' Doug Terrell of
Phoenix said. Naturally, he already owned a pair of goggles, so he
gave his prize to friends.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING `JAZZED'
</P>
<P>
   Terrell attended last year's movie, as did everyone else I spoke
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a snowboarder of 14 years,'' he explained. ``You rarely
get to see it on a big screen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right about that. This made once by my count.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the look of the crowd surprised me _ scads of fleece
pullovers and multicolored sweaters, a real ski look. I figured
with snowboarders you'd find skateboardlike fashions. Yet I saw
only one kid wearing the chain for a bathtub stopper as a necklace
and pants baggy enough in which to hide a VW Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Linda Ahumada of Scottsdale, who wore a navy
business suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to look good,'' she said of herself and her
husband, Ron (multicolored sweater). They were there with their
teenage sons and talked about the movie as if it were a
motivational film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really gets you jazzed,'' she said. ``After we leave, we
can't wait to go skiing.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I figured I'm game. I have an open mind. So I watched, and
although the movie was entertaining enough, what with expert skiers
slicing down mind-bending runs on snow so fresh it looked like
great mounds of whipped cream while high-adrenaline rock blared
away, I could tell by the energy in the room that I just didn't
quite . . . get it.
</P>
<P>
   I realized the problem right away. To me, skiing is _ I know
this is going to sound ridiculous _ a recreational activity. To
this crowd, it's pretty much a religion. It's like Bob Costas and
baseball, only with cooler clothes and weirder haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   BEING `ON THE EDGE'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost cultish, in a good sense,'' Carol Brown said.
She's 51 and a skier, as is her son, David, 16. David, in fact, is
an ``extreme'' skier, as were most of the skiers and snowboarders
in the movie _ extreme in this case apparently a synonym for
``having little sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best of the best,'' David gushed. ``It's who you
want to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   His mom explained the appeal of the movies: ``Wouldn't it be
nice to be on the edge, just for a little while?''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. But as I explained to my wife, with the right music
and camera work and narration, you could produce an exciting movie
about making ham sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's something about skiing,'' she said, staring at the
screen with a faraway look in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Egad, she was one of them, too! I felt like Kevin McCarthy in
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' ``They're here already! You're
next!'' I screamed, only not really, because tickets were $13 and
that would have been rude.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, could have been worse. They may be nuts over skiing.
But at least they dress well.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House opened its formal defense of
President Clinton Tuesday, addressing in detail for the first time
the facts and issues of the impeachment case against Clinton and
adopting a more conciliatory tone in testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers and three panels of anti-impeachment witnesses
conducted a grueling day-into-night tutorial for the 37-member
committee on why Clinton should not be removed from office for his
admitted misconduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as no fancy language can obscure the simple fact that
what the president did was morally wrong,'' said Gregory Craig, the
White House special counsel who led the defense effort Tuesday,
``no amount of rhetoric can change the legal reality that there are
no grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers assembled a battery of witnesses who
virtually conceded that Clinton's behavior was reprehensible, but
said his private misconduct was a less grave threat to the nation
than preventing the president from serving his tarnished final two
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders tried to blur the hard edges of
Clinton's fundamental point of defense _ that he misbehaved and
misled, but did not obstruct justice or commit perjury. His conduct
was surely sinful, said Craig, but just as certainly not
impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Tuesday night that Clinton is likely to
make some public comment on the committee's deliberations, perhaps
offering an additional statement of remorse to temper lingering
concerns among wavering Republicans. Officials did not say when or
in what form the president's remarks might come.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Craig and his swarm of nine friendly witnesses was
trying to put a gentler face on the president's defense, White
House lawyers released a 182-page rebuttal that once again harshly
attacked Kenneth Starr, accusing him of slanting the case against
the president by excluding exculpatory evidence in his impeachment
referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation from the president's men did not appear to sway
any minds on the bitterly divided Judiciary Committee. But the
debate, which was by turns tedious, riveting and mildly salacious,
was aimed more at a body of moderate Republicans outside the
committee who hold in their hands the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans on the committee were insistent on
pinning down what they believe to be a pattern of perjury by the
president and evasions by his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., engaged in a sharp
exchange over what Canady said was a clear lie by Clinton, a
statement in his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit that he
could not recall having been alone with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval
Office area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Mr. Craig,'' Canady asked, ``is it your position here
today on behalf of the president that when the president gave those
answers in the deposition, he was telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig replied: ``That's correct, congressman. He answered the
question that it was possible that he was alone with her. This is
in the civil deposition, so all the description that I gave to that
civil deposition is accurate. It was evasive, it was misleading, he
tried to be narrowly accurate, but congressman, he did not violate
his oath.''
</P>
<P>
   An exasperated Canady said, ``It seems to me that the president
unequivocally denied that he had any specific recollection of being
alone with Ms. Lewinsky. And for you to contend today that that's
truthful, I think, is not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   As the damp, dreary day grew dark at mid-afternoon, a few rays
of hope appeared for the White House. Rep. Amo Houghton a moderate
New York Republican, announced that he would oppose impeachment on
the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, a frequent critic of Clinton, said
Tuesday night that the House should heed popular will and refrain
from impeaching the president. D'Amato, who lost a reelection bid
last month, said that tying up the Senate in a trial of Clinton
``doesn't make sense'' for the nation or the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   White House lobbyists also reported progress toward persuading
several other wavering Republicans to vote against any bill of
impeachment that reaches the House next week.
</P>
<P>
   William Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts,
was recruited Tuesday to appear as a witness on the president's
behalf on Wednesday and was reported to be making calls to
Republican friends in Congress to persuade them to vote against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, after months of bitter name-calling and
diversionary tactics, both sides engaged in a sober debate on the
merits of the case against Clinton. The president's witnesses,
while not answering all the specific factual accusations, presented
a detailed argument as to why the president's offenses were serious
but were not the basis for a constitutional cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the flurry of paper and the cacophony of testimony, Clinton
was silent on all matters legal. He opened a two-day White House
conference on Social Security before flying to Nashville to attend
a memorial service for Albert Gore Sr., the father of the vice
president. He returned to Washington this evening to receive an
award for his peacemaking efforts in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team assembled by the White House offered few new
arguments against impeachment, but there was a discernible shift in
approach. Led by the soothing Craig, the White House witnesses,
with a few pointed exceptions, attempted for the most part a
strategy of apology rather than argument. None raised objections to
the possibility of a Congressional vote of censure as a way of
expressing displeasure short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy League scholars, congressional veterans of the last
impeachment debate and former Watergate prosecutors all carried the
White House message that Bill Clinton is not Richard Nixon and that
sexual misconduct does not constitute a great offense against the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Craig implored members of Congress, and through them a
nationwide cable television audience, to listen to Clinton's case
before deciding on the momentous step of impeaching and removing a
popularly-elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we begin this undertaking,'' Craig said at the outset of
the marathon presentation, ``I make only one plea to you, and I
hope it is not a futile one, coming this late in the process. Open
your mind. Open your heart, and focus on the record. As you sit
there listening to me at this moment, you may already be determined
to vote to approve some articles of impeachment against this
president. That is your right and your duty, if you believe the
facts and the law justify such a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the White House would present a powerful case
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the close of tomorrow, all the world will see one simple
and undeniable fact: whatever there is in the record that shows
that what the president did was wrong and blameworthy, there is
nothing in the record in either the law or the facts, that would
justify his impeachment and removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and its Democratic allies in Congress held out
little hope of averting a committee vote on one or more articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone was expecting any movement from the
members of the committee,'' one White House strategist said
tonight. ``The committee long ago determined they were not going to
be an audience for our defense. That's not who we are addressing
today and tommorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Tuesday offered the 20 to 30 Republicans who
appear to be undecided on impeachment what many of them have
demanded _ more contrition and less legal artifice; more facts in
defense of the president's actions and less spin.
</P>
<P>
   Craig conveyed to the committee what he said was Clinton's
``profound and powerful regret'' for his actions and equivocations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has insisted and personally instructed his lawyers that no
technicalities or legalities should be allowed to obscure the
simple moral truth that his behavior in this matter was wrong,''
Craig said in his opening remarks. ``The president wants everyone
to know _ the committee, the Congress and the country _ that he is
genuinely sorry for the pain and the damage that he has caused and
for the wrongs that he has committed.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone thought that was to be a prelude to a confession
to perjury, obstruction of justice or abuse of power, they were
disappointed. Craig vigorously defended the president's misleading
testimony before a judge in a civil case and a criminal grand jury,
using the same legal contortions that have maddened prosecutors and
Republican opponents all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's testimony was evasive, incomplete, misleading,
even maddening,'' Craig said, ``but it was not perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C.,, tried to pin Craig down on the
president's statements about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he lie?'' when he said that he had not had sex with Ms.
Lewinsky, Inglis repeatedly demanded to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly misled and deceived,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis repeated, ``He doesn't believe that he lied?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he does not believe that he lied, because his notion of
what sex is is what the dictionary definition is,'' Craig answered.
``I understand you're not going to like this, congressman, because
you will see it as a technical defense or a hair-splitting, evasive
answer, but sexual relations is defined in every dictionary in a
certain way, and he did not have that kind of sexual contact with
Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning session before the committee included scholars from
Harvard, Princeton and Yale who had previously expressed opposition
to impeachment, as well as Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who served as
attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Wilentz, professor of American history at Princeton,
angered several Republican members of the committee by warning them
that what he characterized as an unjustified vote to impeach
Clinton would bring them the opprobrium of history.
</P>
<P>
   Wilentz argued that Clinton's alleged offenses _ even if all
were proven true _ do not warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe they do rise to that level, you will vote for
impeachment and take your risk at going down in history with the
zealots and the fanatics,'' Wilentz said. ``If you understand that
the charges do not rise to the level of impeachment, or if you are
at all unsure, and yet you vote in favor of impeachment anyway for
some other reason, history will track you down and condemn you for
your cravenness. Alternatively, you could muster the courage of
your convictions. The choice is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress do not take kindly to such lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., said that he did not appreciate being
called a fanatic and a coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of name-calling by the president's defense is
disappointing and demeaning to this proceeding,'' Buyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach made the point that impeachment was devised by the
authors of the Constitution as a means to remove a president who by
his behavior had so compromised his position that he could not
longer fulfill the functions of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach said that most instances of perjury would not
undermine a president's ability to remain in office. And he noted
that Clinton continued to enjoy high public-approval ratings and
therefore had not squandered his mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am correct, then it seems to me the fundamental question
is simply whether the president has done something which has
destroyed public confidence in his ability to continue in that
office,'' Katzenbach said. ``If the public doesn't believe that
what he has done seriously affects his ability to perform his
public duties as president, should the committee conclude that his
acts have destroyed public confidence essential to that office?''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, professor of law at Yale University, said that
the House was confronted with the question of whether Clinton's
conduct represented ``an assault on the fundamental principles of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it does not, Ackerman added that if such were the
case, ``our history over the last two centuries would be littered
with bills of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman also asserted that any articles of impeachment voted by
the current lame duck Congress would expire when the new Congress
takes office in January. He said that the new Congress, with five
fewer Republicans, would have to vote again on articles of
impeachment before a Senate trial could take place.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars were replaced at the witness table in the afternoon
by three former Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee who
voted to approve articles of impeachment against Nixon in 1974 _
Elizabeth Holtzman of New York, Robert Drinan of Massachusetts and
Wayne Owens of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared as ``the three ghosts of impeachment past,'' as
Owens put it.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan, now a law professor at Georgetown University, called the
drive toward impeachment an act of ``vengeance'' and he predicted
that it would lead to an explosion of anger among the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., thundered, ``Do you seriously believe
that any member of this committee or this House will be driven by
vengeance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave God to judge,'' replied Drinan, a Jesuit priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe God's messenger should not be prejudge that,'' Gekas
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holtzman, who served as U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
after leaving Congress, argued that there is a huge difference
between impeaching one of hundreds of appointed federal judges and
removing from office the nation's lone elected president.
</P>
<P>
   She expanded on her point in response to a question from Rep.
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many on this committee and many in the country
believe the president's conduct to be reprehensible and
unacceptable,'' Ms. Holtzman said. ``I do not disagree, and I'm not
here to excuse that conduct. Let us remember, however, that the
goal of impeachment is not to punish a president but to protect the
nation. Impeachment now will punish the nation, not protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightfall brought the day's two final witnesses, Richard
Ben-Veniste and James Hamilton, prominent Democratic lawyers and
former Watergate prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Veniste criticized Starr for conducting a crusade against
the president and employing relentless and unfair tactics to bring
him down.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who once advised Clinton to aggressively employ all
legal methods to thwart the numerous investigations plaguing his
presidency, said that Clinton's offenses were ``low crimes'' worthy
of censure, not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If all lying politicians were chased from office, Hamilton told
the weary committee, ``I fear the halls of government would be
seriously depleted.''

RON ALEXANDER, 68, WHIMSICAL EDITOR OF THE TIMES' METROPOLITAN
DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ron Alexander, who spent almost three decades as a
reporter for The New York Times and made Metropolitan Diary one of
the paper's most popular weekly features, died on Monday night at
his home in Manhattan. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander died of complications from Parkinson's disease, said
Edward Frantz, his companion. The disease was diagnosed in 1989.
Alexander fought its ravages while continuing to edit Metropolitan
Diary until last spring.
</P>
<P>
   As whimsical and offbeat as many of the features he wrote,
Alexander joined The New York Times in 1970 and initially reported
on men's fashion for The New York Times Magazine. His light touch
soon led to feature assignments and a stint reporting on parties
for a column called Evening Hours. He took over Metropolitan Diary,
which first appeared in 1976, in June 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The feature, consisting of anecdotes, observations, light verse
and reminiscences mailed in by readers, has inspired a fierce
following. Eight to 10 items are selected for use each week, chosen
from several hundred submissions received. Some years ago, The New
York Times dropped the column from its national edition, but so
many letters of protest poured in that the paper reversed its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alexander was a shy man, he did behave
uncharacteristically on occasion. One evening, on a No. 10 bus, he
spotted a young woman reading Metropolitan Diary. He couldn't
resist tapping her on the shoulder and asking which item she
enjoyed most. She looked somewhat startled, so he explained that he
was the editor of the column. She shunned him but a few days later
he received a letter that obviously came from her. ``I think you
should know there's someone going around town claiming to be you,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, Alexander was on assignment at a party at the
New York Public Library. He approached Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
who made a few remarks about the library's glories. A year later,
at another party at the library, he approached Mrs. Onassis and
requested another comment, suggesting that they talk about animals
since a number of authors were being honored that night as
`Literary Lions.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had your choice,'' he asked. ``what animal would you
be?''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at him as if he were deranged, he recounted later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you just repeat what I said last year?'' she asked. ``No
one will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   At their third, and final, library encounter, he walked over to
her and said ``I always know each year I'm going to see you at this
event.'' ``How nice,'' Mrs. Onassis replied, then added with
concern, ``But what do you do the rest of the year?''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's byline was prized by those readers fond of his
quirky stories. A memorable one was ``A Town Celebrates the Lowly
Lima Bean,'' about a day in West Cape May, N.J.; another dealt with
the popularity of red and yellow neckties (for which he won an
award from the tie industry). But he also wrote serious articles
about consumer affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was born in Manhattan on March 3, 1930. After
attending Syracuse University and graduating from Hofstra College
in 1953, he worked for Fairchild Publications, and was associate
editor of Men's Wear Magazine from 1954 to 1960. After writing
advertising copy for a year he joined Gentleman's Quarterly and
later Esquire Magazine, for which he interviewed movie stars, wrote
about fashion, and edited manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was a movie buff. One of the most conspicuous
decorative items in his apartment was a larger-than-life cardboard
cutout of Betty Grable, his favorite star.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Frantz, he is survived by a sister, June
Alexander of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Alexander's compilation of vignettes, conversations
and observations from his column was published by William Morrow &AMP;
Co. under the title ``Metropolitan Diary.'' In his preface, he
wrote about his zest for ``Metropolitan Moments'' _ stories that
were sly and sassy, funny and sometimes touching, like the vignette
about a boy ``having a heartbreakingly tough time selling homemade
lemonade on a late-summer afternoon.'' He also wrote about what his
column was not _ ``a series of random `Only in New York' cliches,''
a ``putdown of city people or an outlet for the praise of
overzealous grandparents.''

VACCO'S FIGHT OVER ELECTION GRINDS TO HALT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CLIFFORD J. LEVY and JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The increasingly unruly process of determining who
won last month's election for state attorney general ground to a
standstill Tuesday, as both sides resorted to arcane bureaucratic
maneuvers in a broadening battle that has now ensnared the courts,
the Giuliani administration and even the New York City Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco had
been stymied in his highly unusual bid to get the police to verify
the registration of tens of thousands of people in the city who his
lawyers assert may have been ineligible to vote. But Vacco's allies
on the city Board of Elections responded by throwing up their own
obstacles, refusing to validate the results in the city _ where
Democratic challenger Eliot Spitzer holds a huge lead _ and send
the figures to the state, as is customary.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the complete, unofficial count showed Spitzer with a
statewide margin of 26,011 votes, out of 4.2 million cast. Vacco
has refused to concede, contending that there may have been
widespread abuses in the city that gave Spitzer his edge.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling over the results, in one of the closest statewide
races in New York in this century, has raised the extraordinary
prospect that neither man will be anointed the next attorney
general by the time Vacco's term ends Dec. 31. That would leave a
void that could affect the entire state government. Some officials
in both parties have questioned privately whether the Democrats
might consider blocking the certification of Gov. George Pataki's
re-election if Spitzer's apparent victory is delayed or overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the confusion Tuesday arose from differing
interpretations of a court hearing held Monday by a state judge who
is handling Vacco's challenge to the results. The incumbent's
allies had sought to invoke a rarely used state law that allows the
election authorities to deploy police officers to check voter
registrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vacco camp seemed to believe that the judge had ordered the
Board of Elections to use the police officers. But the judge
apparently did not issue such an order, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said that until there was one, he would not deploy the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats on the city board, which is divided evenly between
the two parties, said they would block a move to turn to the police
in the absence of an order, asserting that Republicans were trying
to intimidate voters in minority areas.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are to meet Monday before the judge, state Supreme
Court Justice Thomas Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the state Board of Elections is required to
certify the results of the election Tuesday. At the hearing Monday,
Keegan is expected to determine whether there is merit to the
attorney general's complaints, and then to either delay the state
certification or dismiss the case, a move that Spitzer's lawyers
say they will seek.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the Giuliani administration requested a conference
call among Keegan, the city and the two campaigns to clarify what
the role of the city and the police should be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when the city board met to verify the totals from the
Nov. 3 election, the Republicans refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, lawyers for Spitzer said that they would go to
state Supreme Court in Albany on Wednesday to force the city board
to reconvene to certify the results. ``The Republicans are playing
the certification game at their own peril,'' said Steven Goldstein,
a spokesman for Spitzer. ``If the city board will not certify
Spitzer, then you're talking about not certifying Pataki as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of police officers conducting door-to-door
investigations of voter eligibility drew sharp protests from
several prominent black and Hispanic Democrats, who maintained that
the the proposal reflected the Republicans' insensitivity to
minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about voter fraud, because there was none,'' said
Assemblyman Keith Wright, a Harlem Democrat who is chairman of the
Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican State Committee chairman William Powers issued a
statement saying that the comments by Spitzer's allies were an
``outrageous and desperate'' attempt to divert attention from what
he said was widespread fraud.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOGICALLY, the NBA's All-Star Game had to go, and so it went
Wednesday, leaving Philadelphia in a lurch.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Philly. This is war. Say a prayer for peace while you
figure out how, on short notice, to make up for the millions in
lost economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   You could always pawn the Liberty Bell, or perhaps, if you ask
nicely, the players will hold a benefit on your behalf, too, after
they take care of their poverty-stricken brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, staging an All-Star Game five or six weeks into a
thrown-together season would have been pretty silly. But
symbolically, at least, the stakes of the ongoing lockout _ 23
weeks old and counting _ just got elevated to a new level by its
inevitable cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we have real consequences. The NBA's deputy
commissioner, Russ Granik, called the star showcase ``the only
landmark left,'' and, yikes, raised the specter of the whole
season's being lost.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some folks might call that a blessing, considering
how the only season that matters is the one that starts at the end
of April, never mind how expensive attending those preceding 82
exhibition games has become.
</P>
<P>
   But I suppose it would be difficult to begin the playoffs
without some kind of preliminary knockout competition to establish
the seedings.
</P>
<P>
   While common sense, as well as the historical record of the
other sports' labor battles, dictates a solution will be reached
before Armageddon, there remains no tangible evidence that either
the players or the owners are capable of compromising enough to
forge a settlement. And compromise _ by definition, a major meeting
of the minds requiring true concessions _ is the only way out of
the canyon-sized hole into which they've dug themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Two truths are self-evident if the NBA is going to resume
playing:
</P>
<P>
   The players can't be guaranteed any more than 50 percent of the
gross revenues. Why? Because they don't deserve any more, or less,
than that. Period.
</P>
<P>
   The owners can't put anything approaching a hard cap on
salaries. Why? The players know the equity value of the franchises
is increasing at 20 percent to 25 percent a year. If an owner can't
control his costs, he can always sell the business and still make
out like Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   So market forces must be allowed to do their thing. If the
league's revenues continue to grow, then both sides will be happy
together. If they don't, then both sides will have to cry on each
other's shoulders. Very simple stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Every day that passes, however, threatens near-term profit
margins for everybody, and the latter sobathon scenario becomes a
more likely long-term outcome. By and large, fans haven't missed
the NBA, because of an extra-interesting football season and the
fact that since the thump-thumpers never began to play, nobody has
any emotional investment in what hasn't been.
</P>
<P>
   How many of you truly care about the NBA in November and
December under the best of circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when baseball shut down cold in 1994, a crescendo
finish to the season was beckoning. There were hot races raging in
both leagues and individual battles galore. The customers felt
robbed, cheated and deprived. The anger from coast to coast was
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series would be lost, and baseball wouldn't be
completely well again for four seasons, when a pair of burly
populists hellbent on erasing poor Roger Maris from the record book
assured the sport a full recovery just this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how much time basketball will need to overcome
its losses, financial as well as emotional. The NBA was already
experiencing an image slump before the lockout because of a glut of
dreadful teams and the general insolence of its twentysomething
superstars, most of whom show no appreciation for lives so
wonderful they would move Jimmy Stewart to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they probably couldn't care less about the financial
hardship being incurred by those who don't deserve it and can least
afford it: The ordinary people who supplement working-class incomes
by moonlighting at the arenas selling popcorn, securing the doors,
etc. They're the ones who deserve to be the beneficiaries of
``charity'' games.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning, amazingly, would like us to believe we have no
understanding of the extent of the players' financial obligations,
as though they're the only ones with mortgages to pay, kids to feed
and cars to maintain. Never mind that their weekly paychecks, by
and large, come in five- or even six-figure chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Any NBA player who has spent three or more years in the league
even at or near its minimum wage should _ should _ have established
a solid financial base. His core needs should be well-covered, more
so than probably 95 percent of the real world's work force.
</P>
<P>
   If he has wasted his money, that's his fault. Nobody is entitled
to be set for life after just a few years of child's play
marginally disguised as honest labor.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the owners have been such pillars of decorum
themselves. They appear as out of touch with reality as the punk
element, considerable proof of which can be found in letters such
as the ones Rockets season-ticket holders received offering them
the golden opportunity to roll their lockout refunds over into down
payments on next year's tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Surely none of you is letting Leslie Alexander keep your money,
on which he has been earning interest since midsummer. If you have,
you are also part of the problem here.

D'AMATO URGES REPUBLICANS TO VOTE AGAINST IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a farewell party given by his staff, Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Tuesday night that it would be ``a
grave mistake'' for the Republican Party and the nation if the
House impeached President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who after 18 years in the Senate was defeated last
month by Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer, led Whitewater hearings
in the Senate two years ago that were sharply critical of the
president, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and many of their top aides.
</P>
<P>
   During the Senate race, D'Amato refused to state his views about
the impeachment referral. Polls show New Yorkers overwhelmingly
oppose the removal of Clinton, and on Tuesday D'Amato said for the
first time that he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting that we ignore the misdeeds of the
president,'' D'Amato said. ``But I am suggesting that we look to
what the people are saying. I'm not saying we give the president a
gold star. But for the Senate to spend weeks and weeks mired in
this doesn't make sense. If we want to be a unified national party
and have a country that is unified, we have to get this behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said House approval of any articles of impeachment
``would result in great and unnecessary discord.''

RESCUED HEDGE FUND STILL BRINGS PROFITS TO WALL ST. 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management, the troubled hedge fund rescued at
the height of this fall's stock- and bond-market turmoil, has
continued to generate profits for the Wall Street banks that
injected fresh capital in September. But some government regulators
are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the
near-collapse of the hedge fund, people directly involved in the
matter said.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund, which was almost certain to face bankruptcy in
September without a $3.6 billion rescue package financed by 14 Wall
Street banks and brokerage houses and orchestrated by the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, has staged at least a temporary recovery. In
November its portfolio rose about 20 percent, or more than $700
million, mostly aided by a surge in global debt markets.
</P>
<P>
   The November rise means that the 90 percent equity stake
controlled by the banking consortium has earned a healthy return
since September, in tandem with rises in stock and bond markets.
But the fund's original investors, who saw the money they put into
Long-Term Capital almost entirely wiped out by the turmoil of
recent months, have still recovered only a sliver of their
pre-August stake.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fund's financial situation has stabilized, it still
faces scrutiny from regulators. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has been talking to investors who put money in the hedge
fund, which is based in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is conducting what was described as a preliminary
inquiry into whether the fund's partners violated any securities
regulations in trying to raise fresh money for the fund during the
August-September crisis. The inquiry was first reported Tuesday in
The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry appears to stem from concerns voiced by investors or
potential investors who were approached to put up new money when
markets turned against the fund in late summer. At issue is whether
Long-Term Capital partners made clear to potential investors that
the fund's capital was running dangerously low, and whether
investors were made aware that any fresh money raised might be used
to pay mounting margin calls to nervous bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC declined to confirm or deny the existence of an inquiry
into Long-Term Capital. The hedge fund issued a statement saying
that it had complied with all applicable securities laws. A person
close to the fund said that the SEC had not got in touch with
Long-Term Capital in recent weeks and that the fund had no
knowledge of any official inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Other government officials have also explored issues surrounding
the troubles of Long-Term Capital, including its relationship with
banks and investors. All these investigations are seen as
preliminary, meaning that no formal investigation is taking place.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One government official described inquiries as natural given the
large size of the fund and the high-profile nature of the rescue.
The inquiries could lead to a full investigation, or be dropped
without any action taken, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Long-Term Capital said it was true that the fund
was seeking to raise money from investors during the period when it
faced grave difficulties, as has been widely reported. But no money
was raised, they said, and the need was eliminated when the Wall
Street consortium provided funds and assumed majority ownership.
</P>
<P>
   All investors approached were sophisticated and would have been
given the opportunity to examine the fund's books in detail before
committing any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``All such prospective investors were invited to discuss the
situation with authorized persons at Long-Term Capital or to visit
the office in Greenwich for an in-depth evaluation, and many took
the opportunity to do so,'' the statement said.

ALL-STAR GAME CANCELED AS SEASON SLIPS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time since 1951, there will be no
National Basketball Association All-Star game. It's Day 162 of the
lockout. No new bargaining talks are scheduled. Do you think the
season is in peril?
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the All-Star game, the league's signature
regular-season event, had been expected for a week, but
Commissioner David Stern's announcement on Tuesday revealed the
dire straits the season is in. ``This is just a result of the
inexorable march of the calendar,'' Stern said. ``There just isn't
enough time left to have a season and an All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game had been scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Stern spoke to Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell on Tuesday
morning, and it is possible that Philadelphia would be awarded the
game in 2002. The Golden State Warriors, who play in San Francisco,
will host next season's game, and the 2001 game is likely to go to
the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union executive director, said Tuesday in a
statement: ``Sadly, the owners have elected to cheat millions of
fans and the city of Philadelphia out of a wonderful spectacle.
Unfortunately for the owners, their effort to further intimidate
the players will not succeed. We have already offered unprecedented
concessions and are willing to negotiate even further but we will
only accept a deal that is fair to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners should either come to the table now and negotiate
in good faith to end the lockout or take us up on our offer to
bring in a mediator who will examine the issues from a neutral
perspective and help settle the differences. There is still enough
time to limit the damage caused to our sport but only if the owners
turn constructive rather than destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter last week deemed Jan. 1 as a date in which a deal must be
imminent to salvage the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be right. I don't know,'' NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stern: ``If we and our players, who are ultimately going to
have to work together to rebuild this sport, can't make this deal,
I don't think there is that much hope for the sport itself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Philadelphia officials estimated that the city and its business
will lose out on about $40 million because of the All-Star game's
cancellation. Eighteen hotels, which had set aside more than 5,000
rooms for the league, had expected to make more than $6 million.
Two weeks ago, the league canceled Jam Session, a four-day event of
displays and interactive events linked to the game that had been
expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Philadelphia
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation also will mean a substantial loss in
advertising revenue for NBC and Turner Broadcasting. Last year the
game drew a 10.6 rating, meaning 10.6 million households with
televisions were tuned into the game at New York's Madison Square
Garden. Only the Christmas Day game draws a similar regular-season
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Sports drew a 2.7 rating for its All-Star Saturday show
last season, a rating 1 point higher than its regular season
average of 1.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all other NBA fans, we are disappointed by the
cancellation of the All-Star game,'' said Dick Ebersol, president
of NBC Sports. ``But we continue to be hopeful that an agreement
can be reached and the season will resume next month.''
</P>
<P>
   But both networks have clauses in their contracts with the NBA
to recoup the losses through added games or reduced rights fees in
subsequent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The league did shed some light Tuesday on what kind of season
might be salvaged if an agreement is reached. Granik said the NBA
is willing to extend the playoffs until the end of June, which is
about 10 days later than usual. But they would not go into July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The households using television drops off so dramatically as
you approach July 4 weekend that I don't think that's a realistic
possibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, if a season is held, some of the younger, running
teams in the league may reap immediate benefits. To hold a
representative season, teams may be required to play three nights
in a row. Also, cross-country travel will be significantly cut
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect, that whatever number of games is agreed upon,
you're going to see a conference-type schedule with perhaps some
mix of inter-conference games,'' Granik said. ``But not every team
is going to see every other team at home. I think that's going to
be virtually impossible.''

NASDAQ TO TEST INTERNET BROADCASTING OF CONFERENCE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials of the Nasdaq stock market and Broadcast.com plan to
test a program they hope will encourage publicly traded companies
to make quarterly earnings conference calls accessible over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq president Alfred Berkeley III described Internet
broadcasting as a way to level the playing field for individual
investors who do not have access to the same company data as
institutional investors. With Internet broadcasting, anyone with a
computer and an Internet connection could participate in an
earnings call with executives.
</P>
<P>
   Many public companies already broadcast their quarterly earnings
conference calls over the Internet. For the pilot program, Nasdaq
will offer its top 100 companies four live audio broadcasts of
quarterly earnings calls each year. Eventually, Nasdaq and
Broadcast.com hope to make the service available to all Nasdaq
companies.
</P>
<P>
   To take part in an Internet call, investors will sign on to the
Web site of either Broadcast.com or Nasdaq, where they can listen
and ask questions, much as they would during a telephone conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would disclose specific terms of the deal, but
Broadcast.com is charging Nasdaq a licensing fee for its services,
which Nasdaq will offer free to participating companies.

 Powerless Pacific Exchange  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The lights dimmed and the computers crashed at the Pacific Exchange
yesterday, halting stock and options trading for the day and
leaving the city's bourse as the Financial District's main casualty
of the power interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial institutions in areas that lost power, such as
discount broker Charles Schwab in downtown San Francisco and mutual
fund giant Franklin Resources in San Mateo, shrugged off the
interruption of electrical service, relying on backup sources of
power or routing business to unaffected facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the brokerage firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the San Francisco stock
trading room stayed in operation supported by a diesel generator.
At BancBoston Robertson Stephens, though, trading was cut back when
the firm was forced to switch to backup power, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Several institutions, including Franklin and Wells Fargo Bank,
no longer have their most vital data operations in the Bay Area,
having moved facilities to seismically stable areas after the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Among banks, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and many smaller
institutions closed branches in affected areas, and ATMs stopped
functioning without electricity. But major banks have located their
back office operations and data centers outside the city. With
power unaffected at those facilities, the banks were able to
restore service quickly in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Pacific Exchange were at a loss to explain why
their operations failed when most other major financial
institutions continued to function.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told us this couldn't happen,'' said Robert Greber, the
exchange's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Greber said the exchange was connected to three separate power
grids, which should have provided backup power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been assured that our power was redundant and there was
no need for an uninterrupted power supply,'' Greber stressed.
``This is really a black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Greber said the exchange will add a backup power source outside
the prime electrical grid when it revamps its options exchange
floor in connection with its pending merger with the Chicago Board
Options Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On the exchange's options trading floor, normally a frenzy of
activity as traders try to outshout each other to buy and sell
stock options contracts, business screeched to a halt shortly after
8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Computer screens flickered ``as the generators tried to kick in,
and then everything went dead,'' said Ted Thomsen, an exchange
employee. ``Everybody cheered because they thought they could go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange routed stock trades to its Los Angeles trading
floor. But buying and selling of the 800 stock options issues
handled in San Francisco stopped altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange handles an average of 18 million shares of
stock and more than 200,000 options contracts a day, spokesman
Morrison Shafroth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing money because I can't get commissions when I don't
trade,'' said an options broker, who declined to give his name,
waiting outside the exchange on Montgomery Street. ``And my
customers are out there doing business with another broker.''
</P>
<P>
   At Schwab, backup power sources provided electricity at the
firm's downtown headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's telephone service centers are located outside San
Francisco except for a few specialized business units, such as the
one that handles active traders. Calls were routed to facilities in
Phoenix and Indianapolis, spokeswoman Tracey Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica didn't consider the outage serious enough to
activate its disaster recovery plan designed for major calamities.
While 20 area branches and 180 ATMs shut down when power went out,
few data or back office facilities were hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a printer in our automated clearing house that was not
working,'' said Jack Arrington, the bank's chief of data operations
in the West, about the San Francisco unit that handles electronic
payments for corporate customers. ``We were able to print the
information at an alternate site.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit card giant Visa, based in Foster City, may have found the
ultimate solution to power blackouts. Visa would face disaster if
its worldwide processing of credit card payments were interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The outage ''had absolutely no implications,'' said Kristina
Scott, a Visa spokeswoman. ``We have our own power and we're not on
utility power.''

 Web Site Says Shell May Buy Chevron   By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Dutch Web site reported Monday that Royal Dutch/Shell plans to
acquire San Francisco's Chevron for $65 billion, generating jitters
at the oil company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A Chevron representative had no comment on the rumor, which was
reported on  &LR; www.dutchstocks.com &LR; , a Web site that tracks Dutch
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street shrugged off the rumor, and Chevron shares rose just
25 cents to $82.44 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But coming in the wake of last week's giant Exxon-Mobil merger
announcement, the rumor could not be dismissed, either by Chevron
employees or oil industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the story was not widely reported in the United States,
analyst Albert Anton of Carl. H. Pforzheimer &AMP; Co. in New York said
he had seen the same speculation in a trade publication he declined
to name. He also said several clients had called to ask him whether
he considered such a deal likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course anything could happen, but a Royal
Dutch/Shell-Chevron combination would have problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them would be the fact that Royal Dutch/Shell is a
holding company owned 60 percent by Netherlands-based Royal Dutch
and 40 percent by London-based Shell.
</P>
<P>
   So a stock swap with Chevron would be a very complex merger, in
which Chevron shareholders would have to accept some Royal Dutch
and some Shell shares.
</P>
<P>
   A cash transaction would be simpler, but Anton said the European
giant might not want to borrow the $65 billion it would take to
swallow Chevron, which has a current market value of roughly $54
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chevron and Shell have competing gas stations in
California and across the Southern United States, a fact sure to
invite antitrust scrutiny at the Federal Trade Commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts could not conclusively debunk the possibility
of such a deal, given other mergers and the drop in crude oil
prices, which have squeezed industry profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron has been pretty vague about how it is going to
respond'' to these conditions, said Brian Eisenbarth with Collins &AMP;
Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which employs 34,000 worldwide and 8,300 in the Bay
Area, is already one of the world's lowest-cost oil producers,
Eisenbarth said. Other companies are merging to bring down their
cost of oil production. Still, if oil mergers continue and Chevron
doesn't get hitched, ``they might get left behind,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Royal Dutch/Shell rumor, other unconfirmed reports
had Chevron pairing up with Atlantic Richfield or Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron has not commented on those rumors either. ``It is our
long-standing policy not to comment on rumors or speculation about
anything that may or may not be under consideration,'' spokeswoman
Dawn Soper said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Dutch Web site, Royal Dutch/Shell would offer
about $100 per share for Chevron at a December 14 analyst meeting
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch is scheduled to meet with analysts in New York on
the same day, said one industry watcher. Chevron is scheduled to
brief analysts on December 16, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be sheer coincidence, but it means top officials
from both companies will be in the city at about the same time,''
he said.

 How to Get Your Web Site in the Limelight  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I am a small e-commerce business owner trying to grow my
business online. How can I promote it, the inexpensive way, besides
getting listed in the search engine?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Getting your name listed on search engines such as
Yahoo and Excite is definitely a place to start. It can help spread
word of your business and requires simply filling out a form at
each site. But so many businesses are lining for free references
that it might take days or weeks to get listed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is important to use all means available _ online
and off _ to promote an e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco consultant Mitchell Friedman, who teaches college
courses about public relations on the Internet, says this includes
setting up links to your site from other sites; identifying
newsgroups, forums, chat rooms and other appropriate venues to
promote your venture; and using mailing lists to inform potential
customers via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman recommends several Web sites: You can locate
appropriate mailing lists at  &LR; www.liszt.com &LR; , create a free mailing
list of your own at  &LR; www.listbot.com &LR; , discover news groups at
 &LR; www.dejanews.com &LR; , find Web forums at  &LR; www.forumone.com &LR;  and
create your own forum by visiting  &LR; www.delphi.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   America Online and CompuServe also offer many forums that might
be places to discuss your work. However, you need to subscribe to
these proprietary services to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, you should mention your Web site in all printed
materials (such as business cards, brochures, letterhead,
advertising, invoices and phone directory listings) and any other
ways you reach prospects, including voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Relocation Checklist
</P>
<P>
   Q: My two partners and I have a technology consulting business
that we have been able to run out of a live/work space in the
Mission District. We recently agreed to lease actual office space
and wonder if there is some sort of checklist to help a company
plan its move?
</P>
<P>
   A: There isn't the same standard checklist for businesses
planning to take off for a new location. Beyond obvious chores like
getting a new phone lines and letterhead and changing your mailing
address, San Francisco's Burr, Pilger &AMP; Mayer accounting and
consulting firm has some suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   You might start by analyzing your physical space requirements.
Specifically, what are your current needs? Is there room for future
growth? Do you want to be a subtenant or have one?
</P>
<P>
   Landlord-tenant negotiations can be especially complex, says
Jenise Gaskin, a Burr, Pilger partner. ``Three years ago, there was
plenty of space available and tenants were able to negotiate all
sorts of improvements,'' she said. ``Now that's much harder so
there are plenty of hidden costs if you have to pay for walls or
put in computer wiring.''
</P>
<P>
   It is important to ask whether tenant improvements are included
in the lease. Can you put the improvements out to bid, or are you
required to use a specified contractor? What about
repair/maintenance costs for your space and common areas?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Moving arrangements &LR; . Do you have to use union or nonunion
movers? When can you move in? During business hours? Should you get
damage insurance?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Utilities. &LR;  What is covered in the lease and what is
considered ``extra?'' How is the building metered for public
utilities? &UR;  &LR; Is each space metered separately? Is the building
air-conditioned, and if so, what are the hours of operation?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Insurance. &LR;  What is a tenant's liability? Check the lease for
minimum coverage required by landlord. You also are required to get
Workers' Compensation insurance for any workers and might consider
comprehensive general liability, nonowned auto liability, fire and
theft property loss, earthquake damage, business interruption, and
errors and omissions coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Parking and storage. &LR;  What is available and what are the
costs?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Options &LR; . Can you get options for additional space or first
right of refusal for upcoming space in the building? Can you get an
option for a lease extension?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Real estate taxes &LR; . If taxes and operating costs increase over
time, what is considered the ``base year?'' Is there an adjustment
if the building is not fully occupied?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Rules and regulations. &LR;  What sort of security and safety
training does the building owner provide? How often are fire drills
conducted? What are the procedures for after-hour arrivals and
departures, and delivery of packages? How does the janitorial
service operate? Are there sign requirements or restrictions? Does
the building regularly perform air quality testing and what are the
results?
</P>
<P>
   If you are moving, you probably need new equipment such as
phones, answering and/or paging service, fax and copy machine,
computers and network cabling, postage meter and furniture. You can
rent, lease or buy.
</P>
<P>
   If you are hiring more employees, you should check the laws for
a company your size. If you need to offer health insurance to
attract employees, consider HIPC (Health Insurance Plan of
California) for organizations with fewer than 50 employees. Obtain
federal and state employer ID numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are plenty of self-help books, Gaskin advises
getting an attorney to review your lease on new office space before
signing it. You might also study the literature or consult
professionals on the appropriate structure for your business (such
as partnership versus incorporation) as well as tax and other
filing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Year-End Bonuses
</P>
<P>
   Q: My company is doing OK but not great but wants to reward its
employees. Any suggestions for making employees feel good and
giving them incentives to work even harder without breaking the
bank?
</P>
<P>
   A: Awards can be tricky. Bonuses should not generally be a
surprise, says Jim Horan, an El Sobrante business consultant and
owner of Rent.a.CFO. He believes employees should know what the
specific goals are all year and realize if they are on track or
not. While surprises are nice, they do not re-enforce desired
behavior year-round.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for most small businesses to impress their employees
with year-end cash grants because either it's never enough or they
know a neighbor, friend or fellow employee who got more. And if you
gave $1,000 last year and can only afford $500 this year, it's
bound to be taken badly.
</P>
<P>
   If your company has limited cash, Horan recommends other types
of recognition as inexpensive as a catered lunch, specially printed
T-shirts or plain old praise.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling ``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus'' author
John Gray's observation that men get ``the same number of points''
whether they give a single rose or a dozen, it might be better to
give a single rose 12 times a year. In other words, recognize
employees throughout the year for their accomplishments. Make it
part of your culture, and if you can afford it, make it part of
your business plan and budget.

 Blackout leaves HP without sound, video extravaganza  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hewlett-Packard just can't catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   The Palo Alto company, which has been stuck in financial low
gear for some time, had hoped to boost its image yesterday with a
high-profile introduction of its latest mega-computer. A satellite
news conference and a multimedia presentation were scheduled to
take place simultaneously in New York, London and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the San Francisco event turned into a low-tech
affair when the Blackout of '98 left the Fairmont Hotel operating
on backup generators.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of a sound and video extravaganza, the audience of
reporters and analysts got a bunch of talking heads, as HP
officials, armed only with notes, extolled the virtues of the new
HP 9000 V2500 Enterprise server.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing manager Patrick Rogers, noting the irony of the
situation, proclaimed, ``If the San Francisco power grid were as
reliable as our new server, we wouldn't be standing here in the
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   With the V2500, HP is upping the ante in its running battle with
Sun Microsystems, and, to a lesser extent, IBM _ both of which also
boast high-end computers for managing entire corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have taken turns holding the technological lead in
the market for such computer systems, which typically cost more
than $1 million. For the past year, Starfire system from Mountain
View's Sun has generally been considered the top dog, because of
its speed and its ability to use up to 64 microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The HP V2500 uses up to 128 of the company's new PA-8500 chips,
giving it what analysts call the best performance yet in a
commercial computer. In a fully loaded configuration, the system
rivals the performance of a mainframe or a supercomputer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have looked at it say it's faster than anything
else by a big margin,'' said David Wu of ABN AMRO Chicago Corp.
</P>
<P>
   HP is taking direct aim at Sun, which has sold Starfires as fast
as it could build them. ``People tend to compare the high-end
performance of Sun and the high-end performance of HP, so this is
absolutely targeted at Sun,'' said Bill Russell, who runs HP's
Enterprise Systems and Software group.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sun and HP have been taking market share at the expense of
other companies, including IBM and Digital Equipment. ``We have
been gaining momentum and this is going to add to it,'' said
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the high-end server business is one of the strongest
areas for HP, a company that also makes personal computers,
notebooks, printers and scanners. Some 1,500 V-class systems have
been shipped since the line's introduction a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said it will take more than continued success
at the high end to pull HP out of the doldrums. The company's
test-and-measurement business continues to be hurt by economic
turmoil in Asia, and price pressures have pinched margins in the PC
and printer markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a few more things besides a high-end server,'' said
Wu. ``They need a quick intermediate server to replace their
K-class series, which is a little long in the tooth. And they need
a recovery in the semiconductor industry to help their
test-and-measurement business.''

 Why Wall Street Should Dim the Lights on PG&AMP;E Stock, Teach It
a  Lesson  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Perhaps investors should short-circuit PG&AMP;E stock.
</P>
<P>
   If America Online goes down for hours at a time, its stock
generally gets jolted. But when the power company turns out the
lights on one of the biggest cities in the country, its shares go
sideways. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though PG&AMP;E's own incompetence brought San Francisco to a
screeching halt for about four hours, PG&AMP;E shares went unpunished
by closing at $32.19, down a mere 13 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Is that any way to rail against the power company when they turn
off the juice?
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though some act of God, such as a terrifying temblor
or wicked storm system, ripped through the utility's
infrastructure. Yesterday's debacle was caused by human screw-up.
Sure, people make mistakes; we all make mistakes. (Need I mention
how many of mine you point out regularly?) But a major utility with
a $13 billion market-capitalization ought to have systems and
safeguards in place that make this kind of failure rare and
infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   What if a couple of United Airline pilots just kind of messed up
and smashed a Boeing 727 into the side of Mount Tamalpais? I
suppose that airline's public relations spin meisters would only
have to say: ``Oops. S_ happens. A couple of our employees made a
mistake.'' I just don't think that would fly, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   But we have been conditioned by utility companies to put up and
shut up. Last year, there seemed to be in inordinate number of
power outages in my particular neighborhood in San Francisco.
PG&AMP;E's most-often used excuse was that a certain substation in our
energy grid was being sabotaged. Sure, from time to time, nut cases
will slash lines, flip switches or do whatever they do. But after
more than a few instances, a bill-paying consumer yearns for
reliable service. After a while, it gets old having to empty the
refrigerator every time the power company fails to deliver its
product.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer choice can't come soon enough. California supposedly is
on the vanguard of energy deregulation, eventually leading to a
break-up of the monopolies that provide our gas and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   However, consumers won't have total choice. PaineWebber
financial analyst Barry Abramson in New York reminds us that a
monopoly still will control the power lines and infrastructure that
deliver the energy to our homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Still), it's not as though you will have no recourse. There
will be penalties (meted by regulators) for bad care of lines and
infrastructure,'' Abramson says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, economic fines might have an impact on a utility's
profit and loss statement. Of course, yesterday's blackout is
likely to have little bearing on the financial performance of
PG&AMP;E's stock. But it seems less than a coincidence to know that
Wall Street doesn't think much of PG&AMP;E shares.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18 financial analysts that follow the stock, not one but
two of them actually recommend that their clients ``sell'' the
shares, and a whopping 12 analysts rate PG&AMP;E a ``hold,'' according
to Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analyst Robin Diedrich of Edward Jones in St. Louis is
one of the bears that has slapped PG&AMP;E with a ``sell.''
</P>
<P>
   While she is ``fairly positive'' on the energy utility group,
Diedrich says she is bearish on PG&AMP;E because it has been earning
fewer profits than California guidelines allow.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, investment in PG&AMP;E has lagged behind that of its
peers. The value of the Dow Jones Utilities index has increased
about 23.4 percent during the past 12 months, including dividends,
compared with only a 17.6 percent rise for PG&AMP;E shares, Diedrich
says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, PG&AMP;E shares are surrounded by uncertainty because
the utility is in the midst of a rate-hike request before the state
Public Utilities Commission, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that (PG&AMP;E) still has some issues before them,''
Diedrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Such as getting affordable power to its customers on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   GUSHER: Is Chevron in play? As suggested in this column last
week, the San Francisco energy giant is ripe for a merger. A Dutch
Web site is reporting that Royal Dutch-Shell is negotiating to buy
Chevron in a $65 billion stock swap. But if this deal isn't real,
consolidation in the energy patch still seems inevitable.

HAPPY ENDINGS NEED $2.74 A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing hasn't said which players will receive the
proceeds from an exhibition game scheduled Dec. 19 in Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the president of the NBA players union does not
want to embarrass those who are ``in need.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are out there.
</P>
<P>
   The faceless, the forgotten, the forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Or Ewing, for that matter. The Knicks center figures he will
survive the owners' lockout, even though he is losing $244,000 per
game. His concern is for others, the less fortunate. He has seen
them around Times Square, standing in the cold holding signs that
read, ``Will Dunk For Food. God Bless You.''
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to (itals)them (end itals)?
</P>
<P>
   The NBA average salary is $2.6 million. But many players earn
much less. Those making the NBA minimum had to live on $272,500
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with no regular income, some players who are accustomed to
living well _ ``We have a lot of expenses,'' Alonzo Mourning said _
apparently have fallen on what the real world calls Hard Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at people who play pro sports, not a lot of them
are financially secure,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much money they've made throughout their
careers, if they're in need now, it's up to us to try to help
them.''
</P>
<P>
   So players will stage a kind of all-star game, near the casinos.
The exhibition will replace the real NBA All-Star Game, which was
canceled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some money will go to charity. The rest will be distributed to
the NBA needy.
</P>
<P>
   A $1,000 donation _ the price of a courtside seat _ figures out
to $2.74 a day for a year.
</P>
<P>
   That small love offering could go a long way toward saving an
NBA player who grows more anxious and depressed with each passing
day.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be gifts under the tree?
</P>
<P>
   How many players may look into a child's big round eyes and say,
``Sweetheart, I'm not sure we'll have Christmas this year . . .''?
</P>
<P>
   It breaks your heart.
</P>
<P>
   But you can help by attending the game. (Please bring a can of
food, or a toy.) Or you can support the cause by upgrading your
cable TV package and watching the game on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, life imitates art. The plight of
down-on-their-luck NBA players brings to mind the Frank Capra movie
classic we enjoy every holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   George Bailey is a 6-foot-9 forward at tiny Bedford Falls
College. George quits school after his junior year. The Golden
State Warriors sign him to a three-year, $4.1 million contract with
an extension that will pay him $20 million a year over the next six
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly wealthy beyond his dreams, George buys a Mercedes for
himself and a Jaguar for his wife, Mary. Everyone remarks how she
looks like Donna Reed.
</P>
<P>
   They put a down payment on a $1.4 million home with a tennis
court and pool.
</P>
<P>
   They purchase three kids.
</P>
<P>
   And a small boat.
</P>
<P>
   And a cabin in Vail.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful life.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, the greedy owners crunch the numbers and decide
the players are making too much money, so they impose a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's paychecks stop. The bills keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   George hocks his Rolex and sells his golf clubs through the want
ads.
</P>
<P>
   One morning while he's finishing breakfast, the last Pop Tart, a
repo man tows his Mercedes. Next day, Mary's Jag disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The house gone, the family moves into the boat.
</P>
<P>
   George becomes despondent. He wishes he had never been born.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, at wit's end, George decides to jump off the
Golden Gate Bridge, but suddenly Mary appears in the mist waving a
check _ his cut of the proceeds from a benefit game staged by NBA
stars for players in financial need.
</P>
<P>
   George can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   He weeps, grateful beyond words.
</P>

   LOS ANGELES -- The landmark Frederick's of Hollywood building,
Tinseltown's shrine to Lycra, spandex, stiletto heels and feather
boas, now carries a $4.5 million price tag, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The art-deco building at 6608 Hollywood Blvd., with its
distinctive hot-pink awnings, is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places and is home to such trendy products as the H20
water-bra collection and marabou baby-doll nighties inspired by the
hit film comedy ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick's, famous for its catalogs featuring scantily clad
models, alluring window displays and in-store lingerie museum, will
remain a tenant for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has agreed to stay in the office and
warehouse portion of the building for two years and will lease the
boulevard frontage for the next decade, said John Tronson, an agent
with Ramsey-Shilling Co., the real estate company handling the sale
for the clothier.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Frederick's will relocate its office and warehouse
functions to another site yet to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just decided to kind of test the waters and see if someone
is interested in acquiring the building and leasing it back so we
can maintain our presence here. We don't want to leave the
boulevard because we are Frederick's of Hollywood,'' said Ed
Zorehkey, the company's real estate and retail development
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1937, the structure is on a half-acre lot and includes
8,100 feet of retail space and a penthouse. Frederick's bought the
building in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Dudley, executive managing director at Julien J. Studley
Inc., a Los Angeles commercial real estate company, said the
building is coming on the market as Hollywood is in a recovery
mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since both the east and west ends of Hollywood Boulevard are
getting renovated, I would not be surprised to see some
cutting-edge, Melrose-type retailers moving up to Hollywood,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Studley just negotiated a deal for the House of Blues to move
its corporate headquarters from the 8400 block of Sunset Boulevard
into the Hollywood district.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Tronson said some Hollywood buildings have made
big appreciation gains in the late 1990s. For example, a
300,000-square-foot office building at 6255 Sunset Blvd. that was
bought for $15 million a year ago was sold for $30 million in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just as much growth in this market remaining,'' he
said.

BIDWILL, TOBIN SPLIT ON INSTANT RE PLAY  
 BAD CALLS DON'T FAZE CARDS OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This instant-replay deal might not be such a bad idea, Cardinals
Coach Vince Tobin said Tuesday after his team was victimized in
three of its past four games by questionable calls.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Tobin supports a movement by the NFL office to
bring an electronic second-look to playoff games this season,
Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill, a longtime opponent of instant
replay, said Tuesday the rash of bad calls against his team has not
caused him to change his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Two other owners who have been longtime opponents, Detroit Lions
owner William Clay Ford and Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson, have
said they are tired of lousy officiating and are likely to vote the
other way this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game should be left on the field,'' Bidwill said.
``Nobody's perfect. Players, coaches, officials, they all make
mistakes. But players don't get a second chance if they drop a
pass. Coaches don't get a second chance to change a call on
third-and-short, unless there's a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play the game, the way other sports do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill's continued employment doesn't hinge on a potential
game-turning play being negated by a bum offside call, or a referee
reaching for his flag on an obvious pass interference penalty in
the end zone on the final play of the game and then freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were denied chances to win their past two home
games by officials' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   First was a no-call against Dallas Cowboys cornerback Kevin
Smith, who was clinging to receiver Rob Moore's chest in the end
zone. Instead of having one final play from one yard away, the
Cardinals lost the critical NFC East showdown, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the Cardinals needed seven points to regain the
lead against the New York Giants. Jake Plummer ran 30 yards on a
quarterback draw to the New York Giants' 3-yard line in the closing
6 minutes. The play was brought back by a phantom offside call
against wide receiver Ronnie Anderson, who says he asked the
official before the snap if he was properly aligned. Anderson was
not involved in the play. The Giants won, 23-19.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, an apparent fourth-quarter touchdown pass from
Plummer to Moore in a tight game at Kansas City was nullified. The
official ruled that Moore was out of bounds. A replay showed that
he was in. The Cardinals later scored to cut their deficit to seven
points, but they used an additional 2{ minutes doing so before
suffering a 10-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a proponent of instant replay even though our
organization is against it,'' Tobin said. ``I had experience with
it when I was coaching in the USFL. I liked the opportunity to have
a challenge. I don't have a problem with the challenge system that
some coaches do. If something happens where another look at it
might help rectify it, then I think we should do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said Monday that it will ask owners to vote on whether
to bring back instant replay for this season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin believes the Cardinals have been victimized by officiating
in several other games during his tenure with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three years it seems there have been very, very
controversial pivotal calls, and most have gone against us,'' he
said. ``I keep waiting for it to even out. But I'm sure every team
has a litany of them as well, and I do recognize that it is a very,
very difficult job. There are so many subjective judgments that
have to be made instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in our league they are under a lot more scrutiny. On every
call there are a bunch of cameras looking at it from every angle
and a bunch of guys up in the booth who are second-guessing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest NFL proposal would permit two challenges per game per
team. It comes in the aftermath of a 32-31 New York Jets' victory
over Seattle on Sunday in which Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde
was awarded a game-winning touchdown when replays showed he was
tackled short of the goal line. The league issued an apology to the
Seahawks for the blown call.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said game films also substantiate the Cardinals' claim
that Anderson was lined up correctly on the controversial penalty
against the Giants. The league has not gotten back to the
Cardinals, according to Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 25 yards from the ball,'' Tobin said of Anderson. ``It
looks like he's got his foot at or behind the line of scrimmage. He
doesn't move or flinch. And he has no material outcome on the
play.'' &QL;

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
In an unprecedented move, the NBA on Tuesday announced the
cancellation of the 1999 All-Star Game, which was scheduled to be
played in Philadelphia on Feb. 14. It will be the first season
without an All-Star Game since the showcase event was born in 1951,
the league's second year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All-Star Weekend, which includes such events as the slam-dunk
contest, the 3-point shootout, the rookie game and the
fan-interactive ``Jam Session,'' is just the latest casualty of the
161-day lockout that has caused the league to cancel 258
regular-season games to date.
</P>
<P>
   Many are beginning to wonder if the season is next, since there
is no end in sight to the lockout and no further bargaining
sessions are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern announced the All-Star Game
cancellation, saying it would be ``unfair to the city of
Philadelphia'' to hold out hope that All-Star Weekend might be
salvaged, even if a new labor agreement is reached with the
National Basketball Players Association in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a result of the inexorable march of the
calendar,'' Stern said. ``There just isn't enough time left to have
a season and an All-Star Game. In other words, you would like to
have some kind of season before the All-Star Game, and that's
slipping away from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our focus now will be to see whether there is a season
itself to salvage without the All-Star Game. We apologize to the
city of Philadelphia, but we promise to bring the All-Star Weekend
back as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be until 2002, since next year's game is being
hosted by the Golden State Warriors and the 2001 game is expected
to go to the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Union executive director Billy Hunter saw Tuesday's announcement
by Stern as just another weapon in the ongoing labor war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the owners have elected to cheat millions of fans and
the city of Philadelphia out of a wonderful spectacle,'' Hunter
said. ``Their effort to further intimidate the players will not
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the ``wonderful spectacle'' is expected to cost
Philadelphia an estimated $35 million, but the league has been
negotiating with the mayor's office to figure out ways to ``soften
the economic blow'' of losing the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the economic mess that triggered the lockout _ how
to equitably divide $2 billion _ has proved far more challenging
and rancorous than anyone on either side imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The last meeting between the two sides was Thursday's marathon
session that contributed little toward ending the stalemate. One of
the biggest issues remains the ``timing-rules'' change, which would
force a team that signed another team's free agent to forfeit the
right to go over the salary cap to re-sign its own free agents
under the Larry Bird exception. It is a change that is opposed by
the players as adamantly as it is coveted by the owners.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the negotiations said the NBA promised a new
proposal, only to offer ``the same proposal, only with the
timing-rules change phased in over a period of years. That wasn't
really a change.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues still to be hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported that the players had agreed to the owners'
demand for a 200-percent tax to be used with a proposed escrow plan
to slow salary growth. In this plan, players would have 15 percent
of their salaries withheld at the beginning of the season, to be
refunded to the owners should salaries rise above a specified
percentage of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Players, wanting owners to share in the responsibility for
slowing salaries, proposed that the highest-spending owners be
taxed for wild spending that forced salaries to go over that
specified percentage, but feel that 200 percent is too drastic a
penalty and would restrain salary growth too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too restrictive,'' said one source of the 200-percent
tax. ``We do agree that there should be some kind of tax and
penalty involved during the last three years of this escrow
arrangement. If an owner really wants to sign a guy, they'll do it,
and there should be some sort of tax involved. But do you make that
tax so prohibitive that nobody is going to want to venture outside
of whatever that agreed-upon limit is? No.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season on the line and time running out, the union gave
the owners three options in that meeting last Thursday: Cancel the
season; stay in the room and hammer out a deal, regardless of how
long it takes; or get a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The league reportedly declined on all three.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunter: ``The owners should either come to the table now
and negotiate in good faith so that they may end their lockout, or
take us up on our offer to bring in a mediator that will examine
the issues from a neutral perspective and help settle the
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Until those differences are settled, what is left of the season
remains in jeopardy. And losing the remainder of the season could
be a colossal public-relations disaster for a league that has
always prided itself as being fan- and corporation-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with the ramifications of losing the first part
of our season,'' Stern said. ``We understand the fan reaction. We
understand network reaction. We understand sponsor reaction, and we
understand licensee reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are our businesses, and we are dealing with those on an
ongoing basis. The negative is extraordinary. We can only imagine
that it would be geometrically multiplied if we lost the entire
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if an agreement could be reached this week, the league
could not start play until around Jan. 10. The reason is that any
new agreement would have to be drawn up and ratified, a process
that could take up to two weeks, and around three more weeks would
be needed to make trades, sign free agents and have an abbreviated
training-camp period.
</P>
<P>
   A Jan. 10 start date would leave the Rockets with 50 games on
their schedule, which officially ends April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Tuesday that the NBA is
willing to extend the playoffs until the end of June, perhaps to
accommodate an extra week or two being tacked on to the regular
season. Finding arena space wouldn't be a problem, since all arenas
must be available anyway in case the local team makes the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While it would seem that a 56-game schedule, with every team
playing the others twice, on a home-and-home basis, would be
feasible should an agreement be reached soon, Granik said the
league is not planning on such a balanced schedule and would
perhaps go with fewer than 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect that whatever number of games is agreed upon,
you're going to see a conference-type schedule with perhaps some
mix of interconference games,'' Granik said. ``But not every team
is going to see every other team at home. I think that's going to
be virtually impossible.''

   Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator,
questioned the impartiality of a decision on Nov. 25 by the Law
Lords, England's highest court, denying the general immunity from
arrest on charges of human rights violations. The lawyers
complained that a judge, Lord Hoffmann, was a director of a
fund-raising charity associated with Amnesty International, which
joined the case against the general. A spokeswoman for Amnesty
International said Lord Hoffmann was an unpaid director of the

SEC WANTS ACCOUNTING FIRMS TO STRENGTHEN CONTROLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that some auditors may no longer be
independent from clients, securities regulators are questioning
whether accountants can police themselves and have asked the
nation's five largest accounting firms to strengthen internal
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Independence from the companies they audit is considered crucial
for auditors, whose job is to protect investors by making sure that
the financial statements prepared by a company's management are
correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent last week to the Big Five accounting firms,
Lynn Turner, the chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange
Commission, asked the firms to look at whether their internal
controls and training programs were adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing instances where people in these large firms are
not complying with the independence standards,'' Turner said
Tuesday. ``We've got a real issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt had asked the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the largest organization
of accountants, to strengthen and accelerate the process for
disciplining members who violate the profession's rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, securities regulators have become increasingly
concerned about auditing quality because of the growing number of
accounting frauds at public companies audited by the big firms.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference attended by hundreds of accountants in
Washington Tuesday, Richard Walker, the SEC's director of
enforcement, said accounting fraud had become his staff's top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Melancon, the institute's president, said the number of
accounting fraud cases was minimal compared with the thousands of
audits done every year. ``We don't condone fraud or inappropriate
behavior,'' he said. ``But no one has zero defects.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's top regulators also said they were concerned
that the accounting firms had reduced the amount of testing they do
during their audits and could be missing some errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that there has been such a substantial
reduction in auditing work that things are getting by that should
not,'' said Walter Schuetze, chief accountant in the SEC's
enforcement division. ``Sometimes it's impossible to believe that
an audit was really done.''

INJURED ENDS TAKE IT EASY AT PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Injured defensive ends Simeon Rice (bruised ribs) and Andre
Wadsworth (bruised calf) are expected to play Sunday at
Philadelphia, but they might spend little, if any, time on the
practice field, Coach Vince Tobin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the ends can play, the club will activate additional
defensive linemen to help get it through. Both starting tackles
will be out.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swann had successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee
Monday in Vail, Colo., by Dr. Richard Steadman, the Cardinals said.
Steadman did not return telephone calls asking for details of the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, out for the season, is expected to be placed on injured
reserve. His roster spot likely will go to Mike Moten, a member of
the practice squad. Moten would provide depth. The starting
assignment goes to Rashod Swinger.
</P>
<P>
   The other tackle, Mark Smith (ankle), definitely is out for the
Eagles game and could miss the New Orleans game the next week. The
starting assignment goes to Bernard Wilson, a starter most of the
previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said it is likely that rookie end Jomo Cousins, who has
been inactive, will be active this week to guard against recurrence
of injuries to Wadsworth or Rice. Carl Simpson also is available.
He can play inside or outside on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries also are wreaking havoc with the linebackers. Mark
Maddox will get his second start in the middle because Ron McKinnon
(knee) is not ready. Outside, the club wants to see Tony McCombs
(toe) in practice before it is ready to pronounce him ready to
return to the lineup. If he can't, Patrick Sapp and Terry Irving
will play in his spot.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin has not ruled out rookie running back Michael Pittman, who
suffered a broken hand in last week's loss to the New York Giants.
Pittman has been a contributor on special teams and in
short-yardage rushing situations. Tobin said the level of pain and
the type of cast on Pittman's hand will be factors in whether he
can play. &QL;

 &HT;    GOP says president's team not making many converts
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House struck back Tuesday, trying to fend
off President Clinton's impeachment with an impassioned plea to
undecided Republicans to ``open your mind, open your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee heard from several waves of
Clinton supporters, and the White House released a 182-page report
that sought one more time to rebut the charges laid out in
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever there is in the record that shows whatever the
president did is wrong . . . there is nothing in the record that
would justify his impeachment and removal from office,'' White
House special counsel Gregory Craig told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Craig used the words ``misleading,'' ``evasive'' and
``maddening'' to describe Clinton's testimony about his sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But he never said directly that Clinton lied, to the
consternation of committee Republicans who said they were
increasingly frustrated by what they see as the president's lack of
contrition. There is little dispute that the panel will approve at
least one article of impeachment this week, probably along party
lines. Indeed, committee member Charles Schumer, a New York
Democrat who will cross over to the Senate in January, complained
that the divided panel of 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats is ``just
going through the motions.'' Late Tuesday, the White House released
a report that sought to contrast the allegations against Clinton of
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of presidential power
with President Nixon's actions during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plans to continue trying to woo moderate
Republicans today by calling former Massachusetts Gov. William
Weld, himself a moderate Republican, to testify on Clinton's
behalf. Clinton nominated Weld last year as ambassador to Mexico,
but his nomination foundered amid objections from Senate
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's presentation, like much of the Clinton defense, is aimed
at undecided, mostly moderate Republicans, who could decide whether
the House passes an impeachment resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Given that three Democrats will likely vote for impeachment,
Democrats need 14 Republicans to cross the aisle to stop
impeachment _ if all 435 House members take part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got some good news Tuesday when New York Republican Rep.
AmoHoughton joined the ranks of lawmakers opposed to impeachment.
But it was unclear whether enough colleagues would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the little I saw, I'm not certain a lot of what is going
on will change people's minds,'' said fellow New York Republican
Jack Quinn, who estimated that as few as 10 Republicans remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continued to push hard for an alternative to
impeachment. A censure of the president would allow the House to
punish Clinton properly, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, scholars, former House Democrats and
ex-prosecutors invited by the White House to appear before the
committee agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a historian, it is clear to me that the impeachment of
President Clinton would do great damage . . . to the rule of law,
much greater damage than the crimes of which President Clinton has
been accused,'' said Sean Wilentz, a Princeton University history
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Wilentz were Nicholas Katzenbach, former U.S. attorney
general under President Johnson; Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law
at Yale University; and Samuel Beer, a professor of government at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The general theme among White House witnesses was that even if
Clinton were guilty of everything Starr charged, his transgressions
did not rise to the level of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To make that case, the White House brought in three former
Judiciary Committee Democrats from the Watergate era: former Reps.
Wayne Owens of Utah, Elizabeth Holtzman of New York and Robert
Drinan of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan, a Catholic priest, took direct aim at the
Republican-propelled drive for impeachment, likening it to the
politically drenched attempt to drive Andrew Johnson from the
presidency after the Civil War. ``The only time in American history
that has seen anything like the process this fall . . . occurred in
1868,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan's assertion that Republicans were motivated by vengeance
and vindictiveness and Wilentz's comments that impeachment
supporters were ``zealots'' or craven drew an angry response.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.) called Wilentz's remarks
``despicable,'' while Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.) promised he would
meet later ``in the parking lot'' anyone who said vengeance was
driving the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   A third panel of witnesses included James Hamilton, former
assistant chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee, and
Richard Ben-Veniste, former chief of the Watergate task force in
the special prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were particularly upset that Clinton's lawyers did
not call witnesses who could testify to the facts of the
allegations against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero for three,'' said Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), complaining
that none of the witnesses on the three panels fulfilled Craig's
promise to dispute the facts of the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the White House report that was released late Tuesday
and the scheduled testimony today by White House counsel Charles
Ruff would form the basis of Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Amid testy exchanges with the witnesses, Republicans said they
believed the evidence showed a clear-cut case for perjury and
possibly obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) suggested the White House defense was
nothing more than an effort ``to raise the bar'' on impeachment so
that only improprieties that rivaled Nixon's could constitute
grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans also chastised the president for his
unwillingness to admit his wrongdoing openly and completely,
without resort to legalisms, and for his hubris.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the faults of the White House,'' Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.)
said, is that it has a tendency ``to break out the champagne or
light up the victory cigar a little bit early sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats, as well as several witnesses, said
Republican pique at Clinton or the belief that he has been
insufficiently remorseful are not grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may wake up next week and find that we voted to impeach the
president because he was not contrite enough,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   One question confronting the committee is what will happen if
the full House approves articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman argued impeachment would die when the 105th Congress
expires Jan. 3, along with all other pending legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But a report by the Congressional Research Service contradicted
the professor, saying impeachment is the one piece of unfinished
business that does carry over from one Congress to the next.

MERCURY TEENAGER HAS NEW TEACHER 
 EX-SUNS STAR CHAMBERS HELPS STEPANOVA

<P>
   Maria Stepanova has a holiday secret that doesn't take much to
unravel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury's 6-foot-8, still-teenage center _ she doesn't turn
20 until Jan. 23 _ has been in the United States since early
November, first touring with the Russian Junior National Team that
beat the likes of 22nd-ranked George Washington, then for the past
few weeks training here with Coach Cheryl Miller. And strength
coach Robin Pound. And an English instructor.
</P>
<P>
   And Tom Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched the Suns revive themselves during the
pre-America West Arena, pre-Charles Barkley days knows what the
6-10 Chambers is teaching Stepanova.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are endless for Maria,'' said Miller, who
has free time for such projects because of a broadcasting career
put on hold by the NBA lockout. ``I was talking to Danny (Ainge),
and he said she might be the female version of Tom Chambers. And
it's so true.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can square up, face the basket and put it on the floor,
and that's what we want her to do. I want to bring her away from
the basket because what other big player wants to do that? She can
knock it down, and that'll give her room to put the ball on the
floor and get to the rack.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the pick and roll that Kevin Johnson and
Chambers worked so masterfully from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing with Chambers ``gave her a lot of new incentives,''
Stepanova said Tuesday through an interpreter, Platon Perepelkin.
``He shows her what she needs to put emphasis on.''
</P>
<P>
   And the pick and roll?
</P>
<P>
   Her two-hour daily English classes include not only the alphabet
but basic basketball phrases, so the pre-translated words bring a
smile: ``It's supposed to be a secret,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she has ``two little KJs'' in 5-7 Michele Timms and
5-4 Kristi Harrower and dreams of the magic they could work with
Stepanova. Not to mention the options created with Stepanova and
6-3 Jennifer Gillom, runner-up as the WNBA most valuable player, in
the lineup together.
</P>
<P>
   Little of that was possible last season because half of the
Mercury, including Stepanova and the Australian point guards,
missed training camp because of the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanova had some moments _ 11 points in 10 minutes vs.
Washington, 15 points and eight rebounds in a two-point win over
Detroit _ but mostly sat the bench while the 34-year-old Gillom
carried the load.
</P>
<P>
   Then after not playing Stepanova a minute in the five preceding
games, Miller turned to her in the second half of the deciding game
of a playoff semifinal series against Cleveland. The WNBA's
second-tallest player responded with six points, two rebounds, one
assist, one steal, one block and six fouls in an uninhibited nine
minutes that left the Rockers reeling and the Mercury looking
confidently toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, you can't expect a whole lot from a 19-year-old
because she's still growing into her body,'' Miller said. ``It's
the mental part I'm excited about. I'm telling you, the kid is so
dang amazing. She's very, very willing to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   And a good employee, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Timms, who was here during the last
off-season, Stepanova and Toni Foster have shouldered appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Miller and Stepanova will meet with a woman who was
recently severely injured in a biking accident and came out of a
coma inquiring about the Mercury. On Thursday, Stepanova will
surprise homebound seniors and disabled residents when she delivers
lunch to them in conjunction with the Glendale YWCA Meals on Wheels
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a second home,'' Stepanova said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she calls her parents almost every day and will leave
after a Mercury holiday party on Dec. 17. She'll be accompanied by
her English books and workout charts as she heads overseas to play
a partial European season. &QL;

COMMENTARY: MUSIC NEEDED TO COMPLETE MOTHER'S CAROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christmas is in the air, even if the air has been
springtime warm. Maybe it was nature's way of getting even with all
those stores that hasten the holiday mood ever earlier each year
with their displays of Santa dolls shaking their moneymakers among
the plastic fir trees and Mylar garlands. If things keep up like
this, don't be surprised if they start piping in the Christmas
carols in June.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, last June was when Gene Gramm started
thinking about holiday music, and since then he has longed to hear
carols echoing through the hills. Forest Hills in Queens, that is.
</P>
<P>
   He was rooting through an old suitcase one day in his apartment
when he unearthed a folded sheet of paper that contained lyrics he
had written years ago, ``Good Night, Sweet Prince _ A Christmas
Night Carol.'' The words first floated into his mind on Christmas
Day in 1957, after he answered the phone while at home reading
``Hamlet,'' only to be told that his mother had died.
</P>
<P>
   Since rediscovering the song, Gramm has searched without luck
for a composer who will set to music the words that have stayed
with him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I being presumptuous in deciding that I am going to join
the pantheon of carol writers?'' asked Gramm, 79, a poet and
retired advertising copywriter. ``This is just something that is
unresolved and must be done. It is an unfulfilled mission to get
this thing written and make it actual. It's a carol. It's not a
poem. It goes beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sick at home during the holidays in 1957 and deep into a
fat volume of Shakespeare's collected works, when his brother
called to tell him that their mother had died in California.
Because he had a bad infection, he checked with his doctor to see
if he could get on a plane and attend the funeral, but his doctor
advised against it. He stayed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the day was a dazed blank to me,'' he said. ``I
don't remember much, except that the beginnings of the carol came
to me. I kept saying over and over again, `Good night, sweet
prince.' I even changed the gender to `Good night, sweet princess.'
That's all I remember.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought every now and then about fleshing out the lyrics, but
he never did it. It wasn't until he was teaching a copywriting
course in the mid-1980s that inspiration kicked in. He was telling
his students about how poetic metaphors come from life, and he
shared with them the few lines of the carol he had written. As his
students left the classroom, he sat down at a desk and started
scribbling.
</P>
<P>
   Good night, Sweet Prince, good night, Sweet Prince ...
</P>
<P>
   that star now has softened its light;
</P>
<P>
   and all other babes have been sleeping long since
</P>
<P>
   for this glorious day is now night.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote three more stanzas that also stayed pretty much in
darkness, stashed in a suitcase until last June. After he stumbled
across the lyrics, he set out to find a composer. A jingle writer
he knew from his advertising days was out of commission with a bum
hand. Another musician he met was intrigued but begged off because
he was facing eviction from his apartment. He sent a copy of the
lyrics to Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I was seriously going to pursue all this, I got
to get an authentic kosher seal of approval, and who's better than
the archbishop of New York?'' he said. ``He didn't say it was the
greatest carol to come down the pike since `O Holy Night,' but he
was encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all somewhat of a surprising mission for Gramm, since he
is Jewish, which is something he regards more as a cultural
identity than a religious one. But he said he grew up in Brooklyn
admiring Gandhi, Lincoln and Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll throw in St. Francis, too, because he was a poet,'' Gramm
said. ``Jesus and I did have something in common, though. We both
had Jewish mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Irving Berlin, and he wrote the most popular holiday tune
of all, ``White Christmas.'' Perhaps Gramm's memory of his mother
keeps him searching for the right notes. Setting his words to music
may set him at ease about that Christmas Day when he missed his
flight. So although flights of angels inspired him to lyricism,
he'll be restless until the once-buried words ring in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe hearing people singing it will bring me full closure,''
he said. ``Maybe that's the truth in this. Infection or not, maybe
I should have gotten on that plane.''

WHITE HOUSE LAWYER ACKNOWLEDGES CLINTON'S ``SINFUL'' CONDUCT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Casting President Clinton's sex scandal as
``sinful'' and ``maddening'' but ``not impeachable,'' a White House
lawyer Tuesday launched a climactic effort to end the impeachment
drama by appealing to a critical bloc of undecided House members
who might control the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch quest unfolded as the White House last night
presented the House Judiciary Committee with a 184-page rebuttal to
probable impeachment charges and Clinton's lawyer, Gregory B.
Craig, pleaded with the panel to draw ``a sharp distinction between
immoral conduct and illegal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As surely as we all know that what he did is sinful,'' Craig
said, ``we also know it is not impeach-able.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal, a central element in the full-bore effort to spare
Clinton the shame of facing formal impeachment charges, lays out
the most detailed response yet to evidence against the president,
although the document closely parallels previous White House
rebuttals to allegations stemming from Clinton's illicit affair
with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The report is intended to provide swing-vote Republicans with
enough doubts about the case to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While the document says Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky was
wrong, it suggests that testimony appearing to implicate him should
not be used against him without corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contradictory testimony from two witnesses does not indicate
that one has committed perjury,'' the document says. ``A perjury
case must not be based solely upon the testimony of a single
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats, moving to exploit broad public opposition
to the president's ouster, joined the 11-hour White House
counterattack by invoking a rash of potentially dire consequences
of a lengthy impeachment ordeal, including the prospect of a
crippled presidency harming domestic and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat,
questioned whether the global economy might be shaken and the US
export market ``might fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House effort featured several hours of testimony from
a battery of additional witnesses, including three former lawmakers
who sat on the Judiciary Committee that passed articles of
impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, who argued
that Clinton's conduct paled in comparison with the Watergate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a particulary pointed warning to lawmakers who are
considering voting for impeachment charges, a Princeton University
historian, Sean Wilentz, warned that any member who supports the
charges without being ``absolutely convinced'' that they warrant
Clinton's ouster ``will be fairly accused of gross dereliction of
duty and earn the condemnation of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans, united in their conviction that Clinton
committed ``high crimes'' that merit his removal from office, said
the White House defense effort failed to dissuade them from
approving several impeachment charges later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't score any points with anybody who has any respect
for the truth,'' said Representative Charles T. Canady, a Florida
Republican. ``The facts are still very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials said Clinton's final, two-day defense,
which ends Wednesday, was aimed beyond the hearing room at 15 to 30
undecided moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats who are
likely to determine if the full House sends articles of impeachment
charges to the Senate for only the second presidential impeachment
trial in history.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was too early to gauge the White House effort's
success, a congressional source said Representative Amo Houghton of
New York, a Republican lawmaker who has wavered on the impeachment
issue, has called a news conference Wednesday to announce his
opposition to removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise twist, the White House bolstered its effort to
sway the uncommitted lawmakers by calling a star Republican
witness, former Massachusetts governor William F. Weld, to testify
Wednesday that Clinton's misdeeds do not warrant his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies immediately siezed on the Houghton news and
Weld's willingness to break with Republican leaders to defend the
president as signs of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the beginning of the engagement of the American
public in the gravity of what we're about to do,'' said
Representative William D. Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee and a founder of a bipartisan group of panel
members. ``The reality has set in, and it is looming larger and
larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld, a former US attorney for Massachusetts and top Justice
Department official under President Reagan, is seen as enhancing
the White House effort to persuade undecided GOP lawmakers that
they can support Clinton without suffering a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Weld will testify a week after former US attorney general Elliot
M. Richardson, also a moderate Massachusetts Republican, argued
against Clinton's impeachment before the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very powerful,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Newton Democrat, in an interview. ``Bill Weld is an important
figure to moderate Republicans, and some of them who didn't want to
vote for impeachment are getting pounded by the right wing. Bill
Weld can help them understand the importance of withstanding
this.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one committee Republican after another in the hearing
room cited Clinton's alleged misconduct and continued to lash out
at his defense team's refusal to admit that the president
repeatedly lied under oath before a federal grand jury and a civil
deposition in a sexual harassment case that was filed against him
by Paula Corbin Jones and was settled last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Craig characterized the statements in questions as
``evasive, incomplete, misleading, even maddening,'' he maintained
Clinton's position that the statements did not meet the legal
standard for lies or acts of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina echoed many of his
GOP colleagues by telling Craig that Clinton's refusal to admit he
lied effectively negated his acknowledgment that he misled the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing thing, that you sit before us, and you are
taking back all his apologies,'' Inglis told Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats shared the sentiment, among them
Representative Tom Barrett of Wisconsin. Barrett joined
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat on the
committee, in calling on Clinton to address the nation again and
offer a fuller apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could acknowledge that people could take his statements as
lies without saying they are lies,'' Barrett said. ``I think it
would be helpful to bring some more Republicans around.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan underscored his view of the difference between the
Lewinsky scandal and Watergate by quoting several passages from
conversations on Nixon's Oval Office tapes. Notable among them was
Nixon's order to White House aides to obtain documents at the
Brookings Institution in Washington about President Lyndon B.
Johnson's handling of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``God damn, get it,'' Meehan quoted Nixon as saying. ``And get
those files. Blow the safe and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan then suggested to the former Judiciary Committee members
that Clinton's conduct ``doesn't even hold a candle to President
Nixon and what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House rebuttal struck the same theme. ``Unlike the
series of lies told by President Nixon, President Clinton's denials
bore no relationship to his use of the powers of the presidency,''
the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton's statement under oath that he did not have sex
with Lewinsky, the lawyers cite five dictionaries that define
sexual relations as intercourse or coitus. ``This is indeed what
President Clinton believed,'' wrote the lawyers, who went on to
quote Lewinsky as saying that Clinton ``does not consider oral sex
to be sex.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, the lawyers seem to attack Lewinsky, noting
``internal inconsistencies'' in some of the 10 different statements
she made about gifts from Clinton. For example, the Clinton lawyers
noted that Lewinsky said in one statement that Clinton ``didn't
really say anything'' in response to her comments about concealing
the gifts, while Lewinsky said in another statement that the
president responded by saying, ``Let me think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the arguments in the report are based on interpretation
of the Constitution's language on impeachment. For example, the
Clinton lawyers say that Clinton's actions were not impeachable
because they did not cause ``injury to the state,'' a standard of
English law, on which the Constitution's impeachment clause was
based.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House opened its formal defense of
President Clinton on Tuesday, addressing in greater detail than
before the facts and issues of the impeachment case against Clinton
and adopting a more conciliatory tone in testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers and three panels of anti-impeachment witnesses
conducted a grueling day-into-night tutorial for the 37-member
committee on why Clinton should not be removed from office for his
admitted misconduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as no fancy language can obscure the simple fact that
what the president did was morally wrong,'' said Gregory Craig, the
White House special counsel who led the defense effort Tuesday,
``no amount of rhetoric can change the legal reality that there are
no grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers assembled a battery of witnesses who
virtually conceded that his behavior was reprehensible, but said
impeachment was graver threat to the nation than allowing the
president to serve out his tarnished final two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders tried to blur the hard edges of his
fundamental point of defense _ that he misbehaved and misled, but
did not obstruct justice or commit perjury. His conduct was surely
sinful, said Craig, but just as certainly not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Tuesday night that Clinton was likely to
make some public comment on the committee's deliberations, perhaps
offering another statement of remorse to temper lingering concerns
among wavering Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Craig and his nine friendly witnesses was trying to
put a gentler face on the president's defense, White House lawyers
released a 184-page rebuttal that once again harshly attacked
Kenneth Starr, accusing him of slanting the case against the
president by excluding exculpatory evidence in his impeachment
referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation from the president's men did not appear to sway
any minds on the bitterly divided Judiciary Committee. But the
debate, which was by turns tedious, riveting and mildly salacious,
was aimed more at a body of moderate Republicans outside the
committee who hold in their hands the president's fate.

</P>
<P>
   But even as Craig and his nine friendly witnesses was trying to
put a gentler face on the president's defense, White House lawyers
released a 184-page rebuttal that once again harshly attacked
Kenneth Starr, accusing him of slanting the case against the
president by excluding exculpatory evidence in his impeachment
referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation from the president's men did not appear to sway
any minds on the bitterly divided Judiciary Committee. But the
debate, which was by turns tedious, riveting and mildly salacious,
was aimed more at a body of moderate Republicans outside the
committee who hold in their hands the president's fate.

SUBDUED TYSON TO FACE BOTHA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Tyson Part III promises to be kinder and
gentler. Obviously, he feels he has no other option. Tyson was at
the Hollywood Athletic Club on Tuesday afternoon to announce
formally that he will face South African Francois Botha on Jan. 16
at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Tyson's first fight since he bit Evander Holyfield's
ears and subsequently lost his boxing license for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tyson, wearing a black muscle T-shirt and maroon beret,
was more interested in protecting himself than selling the fight.
He shoved down the throats of those at the packed news conference
that his mission now is simply to be well-behaved in light of his
most recent legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   He will be sentenced Feb. 5 for allegedly punching a man and
kicking another after a traffic accident in Maryland in August.
After that, a judge in Indiana will decide whether that incident
was a parole violation and, if so, whether it was serious enough to
send him back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows I'm on parole and I'm trying to be very nice up
here. You have to understand the position I'm in,'' Tyson said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the news conference began, Tyson, surrounded by
his new handlers at the dais, slipped into a familiar position:
hands cupping face, seemingly bored stiff. However, when it was his
turn to speak, he came to life.
</P>
<P>
   He was neither the sullen Tyson of the Don King days nor the
friendly Tyson those close to him describe. Instead, he was mostly
sarcastic in a light-hearted, even humorous way in an overstated
effort to avoid saying the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked why he is so adept at finding trouble, he said
cheerfully: ``I'm sorry, but I learned my lesson. I won't do it
anymore. . . . I've been a bad boy, sir, and I'm sorry, sir,''
which drew laughs
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd jumped on heavyweight Jeremy Williams for
questioning from the audience why Tyson is fighting Botha and not
him, Tyson said: ``Let's be nice to this guy. Let's all be nice.''
Again, laughs.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was asked how many tune-up fights he'll need before
a third fight with Evander Holyfield, he said: ``I'm just here to
fight one fight at a time. I don't want no trouble from nobody,
sir.'' More laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 32, had his serious moments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he was asked why he selected Tommy Brooks as his
new trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody else wanted me, that's why,'' Tyson
responded, again joking before adding: ``He came down and worked
with me (in Phoenix) and we got along. I'm just glad he chose to
work with me. I'm happy. He didn't seem like a guy who just wanted
that paycheck. I've met a lot of guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was more ``The Mike Tyson Comedy Hour'' _ perhaps
with some underlying tension from so many years of tribulations _
than a thoughtful conference on his second boxing comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it was his way of trying to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was great,'' said Dan Goossen, who has signed to
promote Tyson's next two fights. ``I thought he was being honest.
And you can't ask for more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the hoopla surrounding Tyson was Botha.
</P>
<P>
   A casual fan might deem him the proverbial sacrificial lamb, a
la Peter McNeeley, Tyson's opponent when he fought for the first
time after his three-year prison term for rape. Tyson fed that
perception, saying, ``I know you guys don't think he's going to
beat me. Regardless of my layoff, I know no one believes that.''
</P>
<P>
   And few do. However, Botha is no McNeeley.
</P>
<P>
   He's 39-1, with 24 knockouts. He outpointed Axel Schulz in 1995
to win the vacant IBF heavyweight title, but the fight was declared
``no contest'' when he tested positive for steroids. He
subsequently was knocked out by then IBF champion Michael Moorer in
the 12th round in spite of a courageous effort that won him
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, he's not expected to play dead like so many of
Tyson's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never in my whole boxing career been intimidated and this
won't be the first time,'' he said. ``I know what the public
perception is, that this guy is a sacrificial lamb for Tyson. The
public doesn't know boxing like people in the business know boxing,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a rude awakening for him. This was a huge mistake
on their side.''

SECRET REPORT INDICATES HUGHES SPACE CONCERN GAVE CHINA
TECHNOLOGICAL AID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewriting in first dozen grafs)  (mk) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret Pentagon report concludes that Hughes
Space and Communications, without proper authorization, gave China
technological insights that are crucial to the successful
launchings of satellites and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, completed on Monday, Hughes scientists
helped Chinese engineers in 1995 to improve the sophisticated
mathematical models necessary to predict the effects of wind,
high-atmosphere buffeting and other natural forces on a rocket
launching.
</P>
<P>
   These formulas are important to designing nuclear missiles and
launching satellites that do not explode or break apart. They help
technicians calculate the appropriate angle of launch, the shape of
the nose cone of the rocket, the tolerable limits of weather and
other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, the Pentagon said, had been using an
``oversimplified'' mathematical analysis, resulting in a series of
failed satellite launchings. Hughes pointed out that shortcoming to
the Chinese in 1995, when its scientists helped investigate the
failed launching of a Hughes commercial communication satellite
atop a Chinese rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that Hughes had provided a ``defense
service'' to China that violated American standards against helping
Beijing make better satellites and missiles and required a State
Department review.
</P>
<P>
   The company's assistance to China ``raises national security
concerns both with regard to violating those standards and to
potentially contributing to China's missile capabilities,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, and other American aerospace concerns, were eager
to use Chinese rockets because they are cheaper than American or
European competitors, but only if they could be made reliable. The
Pentagon report said that contact between Hughes engineers and
Chinese scientists allowed the Chinese to gain ``specific insight
into specific launch vehicle design and operational problems and
corrective actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says Hughes showed Chinese scientists flaws in
the way they were attaching the cargo of rockets to the rockets
themselves, including the strength of the rivets they used and the
shape of the nose cone. In the case of the Chinese launchings, the
cargo was satellites, but the technology is applicable as well to
attaching a nuclear warhead to a missile.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Hughes, which has denied any wrongdoing in the
case, said that the company's actions were approved at the time by
the Commerce Department, which she said was the ``appropriate
licensing authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report did not say whether China had used the
information for military purposes, but it said the transfer did not
likely alter the strategic military balance between China and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it taught them how to do, which they evidently didn't
know how to do, is analysis on the stresses on a launch vehicle as
it goes into the upper atmosphere,'' said one administration
official who has read the report. The official added that what
Hughes taught the Chinese ``could be directly applicable to
military systems, although we have no information that it has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified version of the Pentagon report, consisting of 11
pages and a two-page appendix, was made available by a government
official who favors tighter controls on satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been examining whether Hughes and
Loral Space and Communications violated export laws when they
helped Chinese rocket scientists understand the causes of another
failed launching in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation has now been expanded to include whether
Hughes violated export control laws in 1995. Hughes is a subsidiary
of Hughes Electronics, which is owned by General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report is the first indication that Hughes gave
China valuable information involving the failed launching of 1995,
and provides the most detailed account to date of what the Chinese
might have gained from their contacts with the American aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon did not see the entire picture. Some relevant
Hughes documents, unavailable for the Pentagon review, are being
analyzed separately by intelligence officials as part of the
criminal investigation, for which they were subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its limitations, the Pentagon report is likely to
provide fresh ammunition to critics of President Clinton's 1996
decision to loosen controls over satellite exports to China, a
decision for which Hughes officials campaigned heavily within the
administration and which Congress reversed this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our suspicions that technology can be transferred in these
situations, that you can improve the reliability of Chinese
rockets/missiles, were well founded,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.,
said Tuesday. He is chairman of a Senate committee that has
examined the issue, and he requested the Pentagon report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The story of technology transfers has its beginnings in 1992,
when a Chinese-launched satellite exploded and Hughes conducted an
investigation for China. At the time, the investigation was
monitored by a Pentagon official who restricted the flow of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when the next rocket exploded for what the
Pentagon said were identical reasons, the Commerce Department
approved an accident review by Hughes without consulting the State
Department. As a result, no Pentagon monitors attended the sessions
with the Chinese. The Commerce Department has acknowledged that
this was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in 1995, the CIA ignored warnings raised that year
by one of its scientists, Ronald Pandolfi, that Hughes may have
provided crucial ballistic missile technology to China. Pandolfi
has now emerged as a key witness in the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A Hughes document obtained by investigators in connection with
the 1995 review indicates that Hughes officials disliked the idea
of government monitors, according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the chairman of Hughes, C. Michael Armstrong, led a
lobbying effort to ease controls over satellite exports by shifting
authority from the State Department, which requires monitors, to
the less restrictive Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton named Armstrong to head his prestigious export council.
At the council's first meeting, on Feb. 13, 1995, Clinton said ``I
don't think we've done nearly enough'' on easing export controls,
according to a White House e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   That same day Hughes provided its first ``failure presentation''
to Chinese officials. By July, the company completed its final
report. A month later the Commerce Department gave its blessing to
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   But Pandolfi, the CIA analyst, didn't like what he saw when he
visited Hughes' scientists in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they told him they were sharing and how far the company
had been willing to go, he thought it was questionable from the
standpoint of national security,'' said an associate of Pandolfi.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency killed Pandolfi's study and no one in Washington
paid any more attention to the issue. The Hughes report, though,
was carefully read in China.
</P>
<P>
   According to an administration official, the Chinese adopted the
recommendations contained in the Hughes report.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of satellite exports to China became the subject of
increased scrutiny last spring, after The New York Times reported
on the Justice Department inquiry into the 1996 review by Loral and
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the Senate subcommittee on proliferation, headed by
Cochran, looked into the 1995 Hughes launching.
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, the undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, told the panel that Hughes' release of its report
to the Chinese was ``appropriate and without risk to national
security,'' but his department should have referred the matter to
the State Department for prior review.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials told the committee that they had just
received the Hughes material from Commerce a few hours earlier so
they could not yet assess the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Dorfman, vice chairman of Hughes, assured the committee
that ``no material technology was transmitted to the Chinese that
would help them build missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, in the wake of congressional inquiries, Pandolfi
told his superiors that he had relevant information, including
detailed contemporaneous notes taken during his trip to Hughes in
1995. He was questioned by agents of the U.S. Customs Service and
aides of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they next wanted to question officials at
Hughes about what Pandolfi had learned on his trip. But before
those interviews took place someone at the CIA alerted Hughes _ a
major supplier of spy satellites to the intelligence community _ to
the investigators' next move.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the interviews at Hughes never took place. But now
the spy agency's heads-up is part of an investigation into whether
the CIA obstructed the investigations of Hughes. Agency officials
deny the CIA intended to obstruct any investigation.

PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE SEEMS TO HARDEN PARTISANSHIP

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Something is actually happening here,'' Rep. Zoe
Lofgren announced in a tone of quiet amazement, interrupting the
nation's mood of holiday bustle to voice the growing fears of House
Democrats that President Clinton could be impeached by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many in the country are not aware of that,'' the California
Democrat continued wide-eyed before the House impeachment hearing,
as if offering disturbing news just now dawning. ``They thought it
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   That it is far from over was made clear as Tuesday's marathon
impeachment hearing before the House Judiciary Committee ground
long and angry without a break for 11 hours. Presidential
defenders, finally having two days to make their case, sent in
waves of panelists and stung majority Republicans with some
rough-edged denunciations of them as cowardly partisans and
``vindictive'' lame ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, in turn, accused the witnesses of defending the
indefensible in Clinton's sex-and-mendacity scandal and
rationalizing his evasions. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
committee's chairman, announced a tight gavel at the outset and
made a smiling departure for a long break at the height of the
first panel's testimony. His vice chairman, Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc., cut off witness answers in enforcing a
five-minute limit that angry Republicans often consumed in
rhetorical questions with no time left for a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not a committee vote shifted either way and, if
anything, the combative edge of some of the president's defenders
only spiked the mood of entrenched partisanship as the issue moved
toward an expected party-line impeachment vote by the committee
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans bristled when one of Clinton's most ardent
defenders, Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz,
unapologetically pronounced judgment on members who would vote for
impeachment despite being unsure of how serious the accusations
were: ``History will track you down and condemn you for your
cravenness.''
</P>
<P>
   They sat unmoved by various concessions from the president's
defenders that Clinton had been ``sinful,'' misleading, narrowly
accurate at best, blameworthy and ``maddening'' throughout the
Lewinsky scandal _ all manner of words but ``perjurious,'' the key
allegation Republicans are honing for the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   But they were viscerally moved to anger when their motives were
described as rooted in vindictiveness and ``vengeance'' by the Rev.
Robert J. Drinan of Georgetown University, a Catholic priest and
former congressman who voted as a member of the same committee 24
years ago for the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon. Drinan predicted
``an explosion of public anger'' if Clinton is impeached that would
rival the furor over the ``Saturday Night Massacre,'' when Nixon
purged Justice Department officials trying to investigate his
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you use the word `vengeance'?'' Rep. George Gekas,
R-Penn., furiously demanded of the priest.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan did not retreat and said of his characterization, ``I'll
leave God to judge that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gekas shot back, ``Then maybe God's messenger should not
prejudge.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most eager in their nostalgia, the Democrats spent much of the
day reviewing the Watergate crimes and Nixon impeachment, arguing
that by misleading the nation in his sexual indiscretion, Clinton
in no way merited impeachment. After months of steeping in the
furtive tape recordings of the Clinton scandal, the nation was
treated by the Democrats to a few minutes of selected readings from
the Oval Office self-recordings of Nixon. (``Damn it, blow the safe
and get those files!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``This panel seems to be saying unless you've got the Richard
Nixon case you can't impeach anybody,'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Steve Buyer of Indiana, added, ``We
don't have a John Dean, someone on the inside to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, a New York Democrat and
Watergate impeachment veteran, warned the committee of ``government
shutdown No. 2'' if impeachment is approved and the Senate has to
spend months putting the president on trial. ``We never intended to
create a Grand Inquisitor,'' she said of the independent counsel
law she helped write for investigating presidents and cabinet
officials.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fresh partisan wrangling, the long day's journey was
most notable, perhaps, for the pessimistic concessions from various
committee Democrats that impeachment is certain to be voted swiftly
by the committee, with the president's survival in a full House
floor vote far from certain next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will of the American people is about to be ignored,''
declared Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., as Clinton's defenders denied
they were stepping around the facts of his misbehavior in citing
opinion polls registering opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Rep. Tom Barrett of Wisconsin, argued for the
path of presidential censure but did not sound too encouraged. ``I
long ago gave up any hope that this chapter of our history would
have a happy ending for the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton defense argument was two pronged with warnings of
the judgment of future historians and current constituents. ``Your
reputations will be darkened,'' insisted Wilentz, the historian, to
the angry Republicans, while former Attorney General Nicholas
Katzenbach testified that impeachment could never succeed without
public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vital fact,'' he told one Republican doubter, ``Those
who wish to ignore this might remember a quote from Bertolt Brecht,
which I'll paraphrase: `Maybe we should elect a new public.'''

CLINTON'S TESTIMONY WAS `EVASIVE' BUT NOT PERJURY, HOUSE PANEL TOLD &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House opened its defense of President
Clinton on Tuesday and for the first time disputed evidence that
prompted the House Judiciary Committee to begin considering his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to counter the panel's anticipated approval late this
week of articles of impeachment, a White House lawyer said the
president's case rests on the ``distinction between immoral conduct
and illegal acts'' growing out of his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sworn testimony about his relationship with Lewinsky
was ``evasive, incomplete, misleading, even maddening, but it was
not perjury,'' said Gregory Craig, a special counsel to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   While Craig took a conciliatory tone during his testimony,
several scholars, prosecutors and Watergate veterans summoned to
help defend Clinton were more combative, warning Republicans their
impeachment drive was extreme and could win them condemnation by
history.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the perjury accusations against Clinton are true, former
Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach said Congress would be unwise
to impeach the president and remove him from office unless the
public has lost confidence in his ability to perform his duties.
``For whatever reason,'' Katzenbach said, ``the public remains
unpersuaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Drinan, a Jesuit priest who served as a member of the
House committee that approved impeachment articles against Richard
Nixon in 1974, said Clinton's alleged crimes pale next to Nixon's
behavior. Drinan predicted an ``explosion of anger'' directed at
Congress if Clinton is impeached.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House defense effort unfolded inside the same
hearing room where the Judiciary Committee 24 years ago voted to
impeach Nixon over his role in Watergate, Clinton kept his focus
away from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kicked off a two-day conference on reforming Social
Security, then left for Tennessee to attend the funeral of the late
U.S. Sen. Albert Gore Sr., father of Vice President Al Gore. Later,
the president returned to Washington for two awards dinners
honoring his efforts to forge peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's witnesses before the sharply divided committee were
the first of two days of testimony the White House was to present.
On Thursday the panel begins consideration of articles of
impeachment against Clinton. The panel is expected to approve at
least one article alleging that the president lied under oath,
setting up a vote by the full House next week.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's blessing, Craig delivered a statement of
presidential contrition for his behavior in the Lewinsky affair and
subsequent investigations. ``The president wants everyone to know _
the committee, the Congress and the country _ that he is genuinely
sorry for the pain and the damage that he has caused,'' Craig told
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lewinsky, who has never appeared before the committee,
Craig said, ``We think in some areas she provided erroneous
testimony that is in disagreement with the president's testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering Craig's arguments, the White House late Tuesday
delivered to the Judiciary Committee a 182-page brief denying that
Clinton conspired with Lewinsky to lie under oath or tried to
influence the testimony of his secretary, Betty Currie, allegations
the panel's lawyers are considering as they draft articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the
document ``appears to contain no new evidence or challenge the
truthfulness of any testimony'' included in the report submitted by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the president's rebuttal to Starr's charges includes
``more legal hairsplitting and semantic gymnastics we have come to
expect from this White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Craig promised to present a ``powerful'' case that
there are no grounds for impeachment, Republicans on the committee
said they were not persuaded. The White House will sum up the
president's case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to hear any new facts and evidence here that would
lead us to conclude the president did not lie,'' said a disgusted
Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that Clinton worded his testimony to the grand jury
carefully to mislead but not to lie. ``As surely as we all know
that what he did is sinful, we also know it is not impeachable,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., repeated Clinton's
claim under oath in the Jones case that he had no ``specific
recollection'' of ever being alone with Lewinsky, and asked Craig
if the president was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was evasive, it was misleading, he tried to be narrowly
accurate, but congressman, he did not violate his oath,'' Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Canady responded, ``For you to contend that that is truthful, I
think, is not credible ... I don't see how anybody in the country
could believe that was a truthful answer in light of all the
evidence that is before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton historian Sean Wilentz riled Republican lawmakers when
he cautioned that anyone voting to impeach ``risks going down in
history with the zealots and fanatics.'' He went on to warn that
``history will track you down and condemn you for your
cravenness.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., responded that Wilentz's remarks are
``a despicable way to characterize such a serious vote as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gekas was angered again when Drinan warned that by pushing
Clinton's impeachment the committee would be branded ``in the
history books as dominated by vindictiveness and by vengeance and
by partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you use the word `vengeance'?'' Gekas furiously demanded
of the priest.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan, who teaches ethics at Georgetown University, did not
retreat. ``I'll leave God to judge that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gekas responded curtly: ``Then maybe God's messenger should not
prejudge.''
</P>
<P>
   If the full House approves Clinton's impeachment, the Senate
would then open a trial with Chief Justice William Rehnquist
presiding. It would be only the second trial of a president in U.S.
history, and witnesses Tuesday estimated it would tie up Congress
and the Supreme Court for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   This week's hearings are being held against a background of
public opinion opposed to impeaching the president. Three surveys
released on Tuesday found roughly two-thirds of Americans opposed
to impeaching the president, a number that has remained fairly
consistent over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, polls commissioned by CNN, USA Today and ABC
News indicate that three of every five people give unfavorable
marks to the way congressional Republicans are handling the
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The White House decided over the weekend to scrap plans to again
attack Starr, whose report to Congress in September alleged that
Clinton lied under oath, obstructed justice and abused his
presidential authority in trying to conceal his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the president's legal team disclosed that it was
scheduling an appearance today by former Massachusetts Gov. William
Weld, a moderate Republican who served as associate attorney
general during the Reagan administration. Weld, whose nomination by
Clinton to be ambassador to Mexico was rejected by the Senate, was
head of the Justice Department's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   Following Weld's appearance, White House counsel Charles F.C.
Ruff will summarize the president's defense and respond to
questions from committee members.

PATRIOTS' OWNER CAMPAIGNS FOR HARTFORD STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ A growing number of legislators may be
frowning or squirming, but a sea of pompom-waving grade-schoolers
and their parents gave Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England
Patriots, a boisterous welcome Tuesday as he arrived here to
bolster support for a state-subsidized football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft brought along five Patriots players to sign autographs for
young people at a charity event for the Pop Warner youth football
program. And he also brought checks to the Pop Warner league and to
a Connecticut organization for urban youth, called Leadership,
Education and Athletics in Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Kraft said he was not overly concerned
about the growing skepticism among some Connecticut lawmakers about
the stadium deal he negotiated with Gov. John Rowland. ``I want
there to be a good dialogue, and I want people to feel this is the
right thing for the community, and if they don't, then we shouldn't
come,'' Kraft said. ``This has got to be a two-way partnership to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is likely to encounter some of that skepticism firsthand
on Wednesday as he goes before the Connecticut General Assembly for
a daylong public hearing on the tentative agreement. Kraft said he
was impressed that the Connecticut Legislature had committed
millions of dollars to rebuilding Hartford even without the team,
and said he hopes to make rejuvenating the city an important part
of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be part of this city and want to be involved off
the field, putting private capital at risk to help revitalize the
city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kraft said he planned to continue his charitable
commitments in the Boston area and would continue to live there, he
promised to bring his philanthropy to Hartford, especially in the
areas of youth football and youth development.
</P>
<P>
   ``An NFL franchise is like no other business, because it has an
ability to touch a community and make the community feel good,'' he
said in the interview. ``If you love your family and you love your
community and your team is an extension of that, you take pride
when your family does well.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Tuesday by Quinnipiac College indicated that
Connecticut residents welcome the team but are concerned about the
cost. Those polled supported Rowland's plan by 51 percent to 39
percent. But the respondents said it is too generous to the
Patriots, by 49 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which has a margin of sampling error of 3.1 percent,
included 988 state residents and was conducted Wednesday through
Monday.

AWARD-WINNING SCHOOL TAKES ON OTHERS' FAILURES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHESTNUT RIDGE, N.Y. _ A red bandanna is pinned over his bed,
but 17-year-old Richard C. does not hang with the Bloods anymore.
After five arrests and a probation violation, Richard was taken
away from his gang a year ago and sent to the Edwin Gould Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the onetime gang member, tall and lanky with delicate
features that disguise a hair-trigger temper, is a peer group
leader. His 12 new ``brothers'' are a lot like the guys he knew on
the street: truants and graffiti makers, drug dealers and addicts,
car thieves and shoplifters. But the new group is striving to
reform. And while staff members at the residential treatment
facility support their efforts, it is the students who lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have kids who are growing up like you, telling you what
to do, it makes more sense,'' said Richard, who plans to join the
Marines after graduating in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they call me a juvenile delinquent,'' he said,
``but soon they'll be calling me lieutenant.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversions like Richard's have won national praise for the
Edwin Gould Academy, home to about 175 troubled New York City
adolescents from 12 to 21. About a quarter of the students had been
charged with one or more misdemeanors. The remaining students were
sent there by the city's Administration for Children's Services, at
a cost of $79,000 a year per child.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the youngsters were placed on an emergency basis, after
their parents or guardians died, or because they were abused or
neglected. Others had already been in foster care families, other
group homes or juvenile detention centers. They were placed at the
academy by social workers as a final option before being sent back
to a detention center or a psychiatric institution.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the academy, which opened eight years ago in a
cluster of hills in Rockland County, was one of 10 programs to win
the Innovations in American Government Award. The honor, which
includes a $100,000 prize from the Ford Foundation and Harvard
University, recognizes government programs that have developed new
ways to fight America's most critical problems.
</P>
<P>
   While most residential treatment homes have two staffs and two
directors, for education and for social services, Edwin Gould has
just one. Drug counselors, child psychologists and educators all
work for Tom Webber, superintendent and executive director. ``This
way, turf battles don't get in the way of serving the kids,''
Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from traditional practices, students run
their own group counseling and motivational sessions.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday, Edgar M., 16, who lives in the Malcolm X
House dormitory, asked the group there for help in recovering from
a phone call from his mother, who had abused and abandoned him.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Edgar saw her, he was 4. She left him at an aunt's
house and said she would be back after running a few errands. He
never heard from her again.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar, a native of Guatemala, said he thought he was over the
pain. But a few weeks ago, he said, his mother called. She was
living in California, and now has a 4-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The call sent him into a depression. He was sad and did not want
to go to his Narcotics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that my mom is raising that little girl the same way
she raised me,'' said Edgar, slumped forward. ``I can't seem to
stop thinking about that little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis R., 18., said, ``Maybe you are mad because your mother is
able to raise her, and she didn't have nothing to do with you.''
His idea was echoed by others in the group. Because most of the
residents are juveniles, they are identified only by their first
names and last initials.
</P>
<P>
   The room turned silent. Edgar rocked back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just going to have to let this go, because there's
nothing you can do about it,'' advised Otis, who was sent to the
academy after a couple of arrests, and who worries about his
9-year-old brother, who lives with his abusive father.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Edwin Gould said that although they did not
have the money to track how many graduates go on to become
self-sufficient adults, the majority at least make a promising
start.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first eight months, the average student improves
reading and math skills by more than 1.2 years. More than 50
percent of those who get high school diplomas here go on to
college.
</P>
<P>
   And each year, Edwin Gould administrators said, the situation on
the campus improves. From 1992 to 1993, students injured staff
members 66 times, and half of the girls became pregnant. Last year,
staff injuries were down to eight and pregnancies down to three.
</P>
<P>
   The campus is surrounded by trees, and swarms with Canada geese.
There are no security guards, bars or barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   The 45 girls live in two whitewashed three-story dormitories.
The campus for the 128 boys, set on a hill to the west, is a series
of two-story red brick cottages named for figures like Muhammad
Ali, Tito Puente and Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   There are proms, assemblies and holiday meals, although the
students say ``the food stinks.'' There are basketball, track and
football teams. At the end of each year, the school publishes a
yearbook and holds a graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Webber said: ``We make it very clear to the kids. We are not a
treatment center. We are not a juvenile justice facility. We are a
school. We're here to educate. I really believe that education is
the best treatment for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Each dormitory's residents, 12 or 13 students, gather in their
living room each day for a meeting students call ``group,''
focusing on the person who seems to be stumbling the most. A
counselor speaks only to keep the discussion going.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, students can also call informal meetings to
confront someone who is misbehaving or who seems withdrawn. They do
not go easy on one another. The sessions are blunt and serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something new to me,'' Onasia B., 15, said of the peer
sessions. She came to the academy last year after living in a group
foster home on Staten Island, where she was sent by her mother for
smoking marijuana, skipping school and staying away from home for
days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When adults tell you things,'' Onasia said, ``it's all about
consequences, like you either do what they say or you get
detention. But when peers talk to you, it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber, a wisp of a man who says he grew up the only white child
in his East Harlem neighborhood, once ran a storefront high school
for dropouts and gang members kicked out of other schools. Those
are the kinds of young people he wants at the academy, he said,
although the school is not equipped to treat adolescents who are
suicidal, heavily addicted to drugs or suffering from severe mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who have been pushed out of school,'' Webber said, ``and
who have gotten themselves into a gang, or who are getting into
trouble, those are kids who are trying to make something happen in
their lives.''

DEAL FOR SITE IN TIMES SQUARE FALLS APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For someone with a great chunk of property in the
middle of a resurgent Times Square, it looked like a perfect deal.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moss Jr., whose family roots in the theaters, burlesque
houses and nickelodeons of Times Square go back to the 1930s, was
going to sell Random House the right to build a new office tower on
a platform over his property for $92 million. He would keep the
billboards in front of the tower and a valuable ribbon of
storefronts on the east side of Broadway between 44th and 45th
streets, which could generate $12 million more a year in profit.
</P>
<P>
   Random House would get a nice home, albeit an expensive one,
across 45th Street from its new parent company, the German media
giant Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   But as often happens in a city crisscrossed with as many
oversize real-estate personalities as looming skyscrapers, a
seemingly sure thing can unravel over new demands or second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   That is apparently what happened to this deal on Broadway
shortly before Thanksgiving, though who is at fault depends on
which side is doing the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is full of examples where the most favorable deals
were derailed by the personality traits that seem peculiar to this
island,'' said Peter Hauspurg, chairman of Eastern Consolidated
Properties. ``Neither Moss nor Bertelsmann is going to be able to
duplicate a deal like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people say that Moss, 53, who has backed out of at least
two other deals in the past, was suffering from separation anxiety
as he got closer to selling his grandfather's legacy, and asked for
more money. Others say the Bertelsmann executives were in over
their heads and tried to gobble up some of Moss' precious retail
space at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The tough real-estate mechanics who don blue suits say they were
irked by Moss' casual, unprofessional wardrobe: open-collared
shirts, khakis and no jacket. His friends say the soft-spoken Moss
was not about to let the corporate deal makers take advantage of
him. Everyone involved, however, agreed that a deal made sense for
both Moss and Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Robert Sorrentino, operating chief at Bertelsmann, nor
Moss returned calls requesting comment. A dozen other people
involved in the project spoke on the condition that their names not
be used.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Thanksgiving, Moss and Random House and Bertelsmann
suddenly broke off more than six months of negotiations, to the
horror of the executives, lawyers, real-estate brokers, architects
and construction bosses who mill around such projects.
</P>
<P>
   No formal death notice has been issued by either side. In New
York real estate, one person involved in the talks cautioned,
``there's no concept of the fat lady singing.'' So maybe there will
be a resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But Moss flew home to Aspen, Colo., on Nov. 30 and Bertelsmann
quickly opened talks with other landlords, including one with a
project on Broadway and another with a project on Avenue of the
Americas. The two sides have not talked since.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called a New York closing,'' said Henry Elghanyian,
whose family owns Rockrose Development Corp. ``Some wise guy comes
in at the last minute saying, `We've gone too far to back out now,
so I want another 2 percent.' And the deal doesn't close.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say that Moss and Bertelsmann found common ground
early in the negotiations over the largest remaining development
site in Times Square. But when it came to the final details, the
bottom seemed to drop out of a deal they both thought had been
pretty much completed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A tanned, athletic man who, as one friend said, ``looks like he
just got out of a convertible on Hollywood Boulevard,'' Moss bought
the property on Broadway for $4 million in 1977, when Times Square
had fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   He had a sentimental attachment to the building because his
grandfather and father had opened the Criterion movie theater there
shortly after the three-story structure was built in 1936. At
various times it housed the International Casino, a Bond's clothing
store and, more recently, the Roundabout Theater.
</P>
<P>
   During the real-estate boom in the late 1980s, Edward Minskoff
and then Jerry Speyer, developers, thought they had deals to build
an office tower on the site. Neither of them came to terms with
Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can only get so far and then it dies,'' said one person who
has negotiated with Moss. ``He thinks he has something so amazingly
precious that he finds it impossible to think about selling it.
He's also dealing with his father's ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   But with real-estate values suddenly tripling in Times Square in
1997, Moss once again explored the idea of developing the site,
which is widely regarded as an ideal location on Broadway. The
billboards atop the building are worth a small fortune. Moss issued
eviction notices to the tenants. But by year's end, he seemed to
drop the idea and hired a broker to find some new, high-paying
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he began talking with Bertelsmann, which wanted to
move its most recent acquisition, Random House, next door to its
44-story headquarters on the east side of Broadway, between 45th
and 46th streets.
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested letting Bertelsmann build a 35-story tower
over Moss' existing retail space, allowing him to have his cake and
eat it, too. Moss and his family stood to get more than $90 million
_ 22 times what he paid for the land _ while still holding onto
retail space that could produce $12 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   By October, people involved in the negotiations expected the
deal to close no later than Halloween. But the talks dragged into
November. Nevertheless, Bertelsmann's new chairman, Thomas
Middlehoff, felt confident enough to hire a construction manager
(Plaza Construction) and an architect (Hellmuth, Obata &AMP; Kassabaum)
and to begin negotiations with the city over a tax break and a
neon-lighted pedestrian bridge between the Bertelsmann Building and
what would be known as the Random House Building.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal started to unravel in mid-November, people involved
with Bertelsmann said, when Moss made a new proposal: Demolish the
whole property, build Moss the retail space without charge, and pay
him for the space while the project is under construction. It would
have raised Bertelsmann's costs by $30 million or more, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Moss eventually retreated from that position, but then began to
question Bertelsmann's proposal to shut down his building while six
support columns were built for the tower overhead. The columns,
Moss contended, would take up valuable retail space.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann executives felt that Moss was reneging, while Moss'
side believed that the media company was grabbing for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a handshake deal,'' said one person on the Bertelsmann
team. ``Moss was making unreasonable demands. He said he would lose
a fortune in income because of those columns.''
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between the two sides seemed to widen at a Nov. 24
meeting that was supposed to bring them together. They stopped
talking. Moss left town. A day later, one person said he expected
Sorrentino at Bertelsmann to call Moss in Aspen, but the phone
never rang.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive said that Moss was raising ``reasonable
issues'' that top executives at Bertelsmann failed to appreciate,
in part, because they ignored the real-estate experts. ``I think it
blew up because these neophytes at Bertelsmann tried handling it
themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Bertelsmann began discussions with developers
about at least two other sites nearby. The logic of the
Bertelsmann-Moss deal remains, however, and real-estate executives
say it is not impossible for the two sides to get back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a significant deal that didn't die several
times along the way to being completed,'' said Stephen Siegel,
president of Insignia/ESG, a real-estate company.

BRONCOS STEP UP TO THE MIKE TO GLADLY PONDER PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Harald cq in 13th graf) 
 (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ed McCaffrey heard the question and smiled. He knew it
was coming. McCaffrey, one of the top five wide receivers in the
National Football League, was asked about the day five years ago
when he got a phone call from then New York Giants Coach Dan
Reeves. The team was going in another direction _ code for ``sorry,
Ed, we're cutting you. Have a nice life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no bitterness,'' McCaffrey said as the Broncos
prepared for Sunday's game against the Giants. ``They made a
mistake, that's all you can say. I still have a lot of friends in
that organization. We'll be friendly when I see them, but once the
game starts, it's all football. But I would be lying if I said
there was no extra motivation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost in midsentence, McCaffrey (55 receptions for 951
yards and 10 touchdowns this season) switched to his favorite
subject. The same topic his teammates, the coaching staff and the
owner Pat Bowlen are not shy to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more important than anything I want to do is keeping
this streak going,'' McCaffrey said. ``We have a goal, and we think
we can accomplish it. That's what I'm focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   That goal is to go 19-0, a record no team has attained in NFL
history.
</P>
<P>
   As each victory becomes more impressive, as each opposing player
treats a game with Denver (13-0) as if it is the most important of
his life, the pressure grows. Most teams in this situation would go
into hiding, fearing that talking about an undefeated season would
distract them.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the normal NFL way _ run and hide in the training
room during the week when the media enters the room. Can you
imagine if the Jets were in this position? Coach Bill Parcells
would fine any player who publicly used the word ``unbeaten'' or
any variation thereof.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't what is happening with the Broncos. Want to chat
about 19-0 with them? Pull up a chair. ``Why not talk about it?''
tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``We may be able to do something
special. I'm proud of that. I want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sharpe has never met a subject he didn't like to talk
about, including time travel, the War of 1812 and ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never cocky,'' he said. ``We never go into a game
thinking, `We're great, we can just show up.' But this is a very
confident team. We feel good about every game we go into. Of course
we're always going to be asked about going undefeated. I get asked
when I'm out walking somewhere. I can't go to the store without
being asked and it doesn't bother me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons is Coach Mike Shanahan, who had told his team
during a meeting several weeks ago not to be scared of chasing the
record because they had a chance to make history. It was a smart
move by a smart coach _ once the players saw how their leader
wasn't intimidated by the chase, they took the same position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot to lose,'' defensive end Harald Hasselbach
said. ``I think we've got more to lose than any other team. I know
what we expect of ourselves, anything short of that would just be a
failure, so we're going to do everything in our power to ensure
that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes these Broncos so dangerous _ besides great talent and
coaching _ is the belief that destiny is in their hands. They
trailed the Kansas City Chiefs by 10 points on Sunday going into
the fourth quarter, had three turnovers, a botched punt, a blocked
field goal and two key penalties in the second half _ but still
won, 35-31.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have not played as efficiently the past two weeks _
seven turnovers after committing only nine in the first 11 games _
but one never gets a feeling that Denver is in danger of losing a
game. Are the turnovers a result of the pressure of perfection?
Probably not. They have more to do with every team playing its best
as the Broncos get closer to 19 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play the Denver Broncos and you can have it any way you
want it,'' Sharpe said. ``We can stab you in the heart. Or we can
shoot you in the head. You pick. Either way, it's a death.''
</P>
<P>
   One more victory and the Broncos will earn the record for
consecutive victories at 19. Also, only the Broncos, the 1934
Chicago Bears and 1972 Miami Dolphins opened the season 13-0. And
like the Broncos, those two teams probably also felt their stomachs
tighten late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   More microphones from around the country are being stuck in the
faces of the defending Super Bowl champions with each passing week.
But don't expect to see irritation or empty locker rooms. Ask the
Broncos about their season, then clear your afternoon calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared to listen. And listen some more.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA coach Bob Toledo and assistant Mark Weber
were injured in an automobile accident Monday while recruiting in
Atlanta. Neither was seriously hurt, according to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo might have suffered a separated shoulder but did not go
to the hospital. Both he and Weber, the offensive line coach, had a
plethora of aches and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who hit them supposedly lost control of her car when a
balloon she was carrying obstructed her vision.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo continued recruiting and will return to Los Angeles
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting is too important,'' said Randy Taylor, director of
football operations. ``You can always get another shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo will miss about
two weeks with sprained knee ligaments but is expected to play in
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ayanbadejo suffered the injury on the first play of the Miami
game. He returned briefly before watching the remainder of the game
on crutches from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say yeah, I'll be back by Christmas, but I don't
know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Status pending: The final grade on UCLA's season _ success or
failure _ won't be determined until the Rose Bowl against
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season hasn't been a disappointment,'' quarterback Cade
McNown said. ``The (Miami) loss was a disappointment. What happens
in the Rose Bowl and how we respond will dictate what sort of
season it is.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster update: Reserve cornerback Eric Whitfield has been
reinstated after serving a one-game suspension for fighting.
Whitfield was involved in the same Oct. 4 fight that prompted
Jermaine Lewis' one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield will play in the Rose Bowl if he fulfills certain
obligations, UCLA said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' case has been dropped by the L.A. City attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just relieved it's over,'' Lewis said.
</P>

EDITORIAL CHANGE 
ENTER DERSHOWITZ 
TWO-FACED WRITER
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brill's Content, the six-month-old magazine that bills itself as
a watchdog of the media industry, has a new editor. Steven Brill,
chairman and editor in chief, said Tuesday that Michael Kramer had
left the magazine and that the editorial director, Eric Effron, had
taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Brill would not elaborate on why Kramer had departed. ``It's an
unhappy circumstance,'' he said, adding that he didn't say anything
more than that when he announced Kramer's departure to the staff
and was ``going to try my hardest not to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy circumstance?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with something internal, an internal personnel
issue,'' Brill said. ``Therefore, I just haven't wanted to talk
about the reasons for it.'' Kramer did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, Brill's singlemindedness has made him a
famously difficult boss; some staff members at other Brill
publications have said he has a hair-trigger temper and no patience
for small slip-ups. Some readers began to wonder if Kramer's days
were numbered when Effron, who had been editor and publisher of
Legal Times, a newspaper Brill owned in Washington, arrived in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Super-Lawyer
</P>
<P>
   It's appeals time again.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor who has been involved
in high-profile appeals for such defendants as Claus von Bulow and
Michael Milken, has joined the team representing Ronald Perelman,
the several-times-married billionaire who is fighting for custody
of his 3-year-old daughter, Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman, one of the not-so-anonymous parties in a case known as
Anonymous vs. Anonymous, lost a round in his custody battle with
his third wife, Patricia Duff, last week. The Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that their custody hearings
must be conducted in open court. Perelman had wanted private
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with advice from Dershowitz, Perelman's lawyers
appealed the decision. Adria Hillman, who handled Perelman's
divorce case, said she had approached Dershowitz because she knew
that he favored a balance between the public-interest need for open
courts and the privacy of individuals and their families. (
Dershowitz's secretary said he was in a class at Harvard Tuesday,
one of the few times, no doubt, when his cellular telephone is
turned off.)
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Warner, a lawyer for Ms. Duff, said of Dershowitz's
sudden presence on the case: ``It doesn't change anything. We think
that the decision opening the courtroom was correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Split Personality
</P>
<P>
   As Gil Schwartz, he is a senior vice president of communications
at CBS. As Stanley Bing, he writes about the corporate battlefield.
His double identity is ``probably the worst-kept secret in
corporate America,'' Schwartz said Tuesday. ``Fortunately, people
seem to learn it and then forget about it, which is fine with me,
because Stanley Bing finds Gil Schwartz to be an annoyance and an
intrusion into his life. Schwartz has to go to work everyday. Bing
would rather sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody is going to be busy for the next few months. David
Hirshey, executive editor of HarperCollins, said he had signed a
Bing book called ``What Would Machiavelli Do?'' Schwartz described
it as a lighthearted look at how the Renaissance-era statesman and
writer might handle 20th-century problems like ``living in a
downsizing environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Machiavelli is often seen as advising people to do nasty
things,'' Schwartz said, ``when in fact what he was was a superb
strategic thinker who wasn't burdened by squishy sentiment. It's
military and political strategy with a little bit of the World
Wrestling Foundation thrown in.''

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON DEFENSE COUNSEL'S BRIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from an 184-page legal
defense of President Clinton submitted by his counsel to the House
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, as provided by the White House and
with subheads taken from the original:
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the factual, legal and Constitutional defenses we
present in this document, the President has asked us to convey a
personal note: What the President did was wrong. As the President
himself has said, publicly and painfully, ``There is no fancy way
to say that I have sinned.''
</P>
<P>
   The President has insisted that no legalities be allowed to
obscure the simple moral truth that his behavior in this matter was
wrong, that he misled his wife, his friends and our Nation about
the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He did not want
anyone to know about his personal wrongdoing. But he does want
everyone _ the committee, the Congress and the country _ to know
that he is profoundly sorry for the wrongs he has committed and for
the pain he has caused his family, his friends, and our nation.
</P>
<P>
   But as attorneys representing the President in a legal and
Constitutional proceeding, we are duty-bound to draw a distinction
between immoral conduct and illegal or impeachable acts. And just
as no fancy language can obscure the fact that what the President
did was morally wrong, no amount of rhetoric can change the legal
reality that the record before this committee does not justify
charges of criminal conduct or impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The framers, in their wisdom, left this body the solemn
obligation of determining not what is sinful, but rather what is
impeachable. The President has not sugar-coated the reality of his
wrongdoing. Neither should the committee ignore the high standards
of the Constitution to overturn a national election and to impeach
a President. ...
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT DID NOT COMMIT PERJURY
</P>
<P>
   Will Rogers is reported to have said of a contemporary: ``It's
not what he doesn't know that bothers me, it's what he knows for
sure that just ain't so.'' Defending what the President actually
said under oath is much easier than defending phantom allegations
based on what some claim the President said. In analyzing the
allegation of perjury, we urge the Committee and the Congress to
focus only on what is actually in the record, not on popular
mythology, conventional (but incorrect) wisdom, or political spin.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has variously been asserted that in the grand
jury the President denied that he had a ``sexual relationship''
with Ms. Lewinsky and that he broadly reaffirmed his earlier
deposition testimony. In fact, in the grand jury, the President
admitted to an ``inappropriate intimate relationship'' with Ms.
Lewinsky that was physical in nature. In other words, any
consideration of charges of perjury requires a focused look at the
actual statements at issue. Again, we ask the committee: Please, do
not assume the conventional wisdom. Look, instead, at the actual
record.
</P>
<P>
   Specific Claims of Perjury
</P>
<P>
   With these principles in mind, it is apparent that there is no
basis for a charge of perjury here, either with respect to the
President's Jones deposition or his subsequent grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   1. CIVIL DEPOSITION of JAN. 17, 1998
</P>
<P>
   a. Nature of Relationship
</P>
<P>
   The primary allegation of perjury arising from President
Clinton's deposition testimony of Jan. 17, 1998, appears to be that
he lied under oath about the nature of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky when he denied in that civil case that he had a ``sexual
affair,'' a ``sexual relationship,'' or ``sexual relations'' with
Ms. Lewinsky. In the deposition, President Clinton asserted: (1)
that he did not have a ``sexual affair'' with Ms. Lewinsky within
the undefined meaning of that term; (2) that Ms. Lewinsky was
correct in her statement that she did not have a ``sexual
relationship'' with the President within the undefined meaning of
that term, and (3) that he did not have ``sexual relations'' with
Ms. Lewinsky as that term was defined by the Jones lawyers and
limited by Judge Wright. The allegation that President Clinton
perjured himself with respect to any of these deposition statements
is without merit.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is by now more than clear that the undefined terms
``sexual affair,'' ``sexual relations'' and ``sexual relationship''
are at best ambiguous, meaning different things to different
people, and that President Clinton's belief that the terms refer to
sexual intercourse is supported by courts, commentators, and
numerous dictionaries _ a point ignored in the referral and Mr.
Schippers' presentation to the committee despite the obvious
problem with premising a perjury claim on such ambiguous terms. As
one court has stated, ``(i)n common parlance the terms `sexual
intercourse' and `sexual relations' are often used
interchangeably.'' Dictionary definitions make the same point. For
example,
</P>
<P>
   Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines ``sexual
relations'' as ``coitus;''
</P>
<P>
   Random House Webster's College Dictionary defines ``sexual
relations'' as ``sexual intercourse; coitus;''
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines ``sexual
relations'' as ``coitus;''
</P>
<P>
   Black's Law Dictionary defines ``intercourse'' as ``sexual
relations;'' and
</P>
<P>
   Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary defines ``sexual
relations'' as ``sexual intercourse; coitus.''
</P>
<P>
   The President's understanding of these terms, which is shared
even by several common dictionaries, could not possibly support a
prosecution for perjury. How would a prosecutor prove these
dictionaries ``wrong?''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Irrespective of the view that ``sexual relations'' means
intercourse, the evidence is indisputable that this is indeed what
President Clinton believed. Perjury requires more than that a third
party believes President Clinton was wrong about the meaning of
these terms (a point on which the allegation plainly founders); it
also requires proof that President Clinton knew he was wrong and
intentionally lied about it. But the evidence demonstrates that the
President honestly held that belief well before the Jones
deposition. The genuineness of President Clinton's beliefs on this
subject is even supported by the O.I.C.'s account of Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony during an interview with the F.B.I.:
</P>
<P>
   ``(A)fter having a relationship with him, Lewinsky deduced that
the President, in his mind, apparently does not consider oral sex
to be sex. Sex to him must mean intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Ms. Lewinsky herself took the position that her
contact with the President did not constitute ``sex'' and
reaffirmed that position even after she had received immunity and
began cooperating with the O.I.C. For example, in one of the
conversations surreptitiously taped by Ms. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky
explained to Ms. Tripp that she ``didn't have sex'' with the
President because ``(h)aving sex is having intercourse.'' Ms.
Lewinsky reaffirmed this position even after receiving immunity,
stating in an F.B.I. interview that ``her use of the term `having
sex' means having intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in her original proffer to the O.I.C., she wrote,
``Ms. L(ewinsky) was comfortable signing the affidavit with regard
to the 'sexual relationship' because she could justify to herself
that she and the Pres(ident) did not have sexual intercourse.'' In
short, the evidence supports only the conclusion that the
President's responses with respect to these undefined terms were
truthful and at worst good faith responses to indisputably
ambiguous questions. The referral and the committee have adduced no
evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the President's statement in his deposition that he had
not had ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky as that term was
defined by the Jones lawyers and substantially narrowed by Judge
Wright also is correct. Neither the O.I.C. in its referral nor Mr.
Schippers in his presentation to the Committee laid out the
sequence of events that led to the limited definition of ``sexual
relations'' which was ultimately presented to President Clinton and
which he was required to follow. At the deposition, the Jones
attorneys presented a broad, three-part definition of the term
``sexual relations'' to be used by them in the questioning. Judge
Wright ruled that two parts of the definition were ``too broad''
and eliminated them.
</P>
<P>
   The President, therefore, was presented with the following
definition (as he understood it to have been amended by the court):
...
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
``sexual relations'' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
</P>
<P>
   (1) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner
thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person;
</P>
<P>
   (2) contact between any part of the person's body or an object
and the genitals and anus of another person; or
</P>
<P>
   (3) contact between the genitals or anus of the person and any
part of another person's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' means intentional touching, either directly or
through clothing.
</P>
<P>
   This definition substantially narrowed the meaning of the term
as it was used by the Jones lawyers. It rendered an overly broad
definition bizarrely narrow and contorted. But despite that
narrowing, and the resulting peculiarity of what was and was not
covered, the Jones lawyers chose to stick with it rather than ask
direct questions, as they were invited to do by the President's
counsel. When they asked the President about ``sexual relations''
with Ms. Lewinsky in the deposition, they did so with explicit
reference to this definition. (``And so the record is completely
clear, have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as
that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the
Court?'')
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that this narrow definition did not include certain
physical acts _ an interpretation shared by many commentators,
journalists, and others. See, e.g., Perjury Hearing of December 1,
1998 (Statement of Professor Stephen A. Saltzburg at 2) (``That
definition defined certain forms of sexual contact as sexual
relations but, for reasons known only to the Jones lawyers, limited
the definition to contact with any person for the purpose of
gratification.''); MSNBC Internight, August 12, 1998 (Cynthia
Alksne) (``(W)hen the definition finally was put before the
president, it did not include the receipt of oral sex''); ``DeLay
Urges a Wait For Starr's Report,'' The Washington Times (August 31,
1998) (``The definition of sexual relations, used by lawyers for
Paula Jones when they questioned the president, was loosely worded
and may not have included oral sex''); ``Legally Accurate,'' The
National Law Journal (August 31, 1998) (``Given the narrowness of
the court-approved definition in (the Jones) case, Mr. Clinton
indeed may not have perjured himself back then if, say, he received
oral sex but did not reciprocate sexually''). This interpretation
may be confusing to some. It may be counter-intuitive. It may lead
to bizarre answers. But it certainly was not objectively wrong. And
it was not the President's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Jones lawyers had the opportunity to ask questions
which would have elicited details about the President's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky but chose not to develop the issue.
As an alternative to relying on the definition provided by the
Jones lawyers, the President's counsel invited the Jones lawyers to
``ask the President what he did, (and) what he didn't do.'' Dep. at
21. The Jones lawyers ignored the invitation and stuck with their
definition even as it was limited. As the Supreme Court has
explained, ``(i)f a witness evades, it is the lawyer's
responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness
back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of
adversary examination.'' Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352,
358-59 (1973).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   b. Being Alone with Ms. Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's deposition testimony regarding whether he
was alone with Ms. Lewinsky at various times and places does not
constitute perjury. The fundamental flaw in the charge is that it
is based on a mischaracterization of the President's testimony --
the President did not testify that he was never alone with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Starr Referral and Mr. Schippers' presentation to the
Committee start from the incorrect premise that the President
testified that he was never alone with Ms. Lewinsky. See Ref. at
154 (``(T)he President lied when he said 'I don't recall' in
response to the question whether he had ever been alone with Ms.
Lewinsky.''); Schippers Presentation at 29 (``(T)he President may
have given false testimony under oath regarding his statement that
he could not recall being alone with Monica Lewinsky.''). In fact,
the President did not deny that he had been alone with Ms.
Lewinsky. For example, the President answered ``yes'' to the
question ``your testimony is that it was possible, then, that you
were alone with her?''. Dep. at 53.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever confusion or incompleteness there may have been in the
President's testimony about when and where he was alone with Ms.
Lewinsky cannot be charged against the President. The Jones lawyers
failed to follow up on incomplete or unresponsive answers. They
were free to ask specific follow-up questions about the frequency
or locale of any physical contact, but they did not do so. This
failure cannot be used to support a charge of perjury. Bronston,
409 U.S. at 360.
</P>
<P>
   c. ``Minimizing'' Gifts that Were Exchanged
</P>
<P>
   A separate perjury charge is based on the assertion that in his
deposition the President ``minimized'' the number of gifts he
exchanged with Ms. Lewinsky. Ref. at 151; Schippers Presentation at
29. Again, the evidence simply does not support this allegation. To
start with, even the charge of ``minimizing'' the number of gifts
concedes the only potentially material issue -- the President
acknowledged that he did exchange gifts with Ms. Lewinsky. There is
not much that is safe from a perjury prosecution if mere
``minimization'' qualifies for the offense.
</P>
<P>
   As weak as the ``minimization'' charge is, it is also wrong. A
fair reading of the President's deposition testimony makes clear
that, when asked about particular gifts, the President honestly
stated his recollection of the particular item. See Dep. at 75
(``Q. Do you remember giving her an item that had been purchased
from The Black Dog store at Martha's Vineyard? A. I do remember
that.''). Moreover, when the President could not recall the precise
items that he had exchanged, he asked the Jones lawyers to tell him
so that he could confirm or deny as the facts required. See ibid.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, this allegation is yet another complaint that
President Clinton was not more forthcoming (or that he did not have
a more precise memory on these issues), which is plainly not a
ground for alleging perjury.
</P>
<P>
   d. Conversations with Ms. Lewinsky About Her Involvement in the
Jones Case
</P>
<P>
   Both the Referral and Mr. Schippers' presentation allege perjury
in the Jones deposition with respect to President Clinton's
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the Jones
case. See Ref. at 160; Schippers Presentation at 32. Specifically,
it is alleged that the President committed perjury in his
deposition when he failed to (1) acknowledge that he knew that Ms.
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed at the time he had last seen and
spoken to her; and (2) acknowledge that he had spoken to Ms.
Lewinsky about the possibility that she would testify in the Jones
case. Ibid. Once again, the charge of false testimony is based on a
wholly inaccurate reading of the President's deposition. The
President acknowledged that he knew that Ms. Lewinsky had been
subpoenaed, that he was not sure when was the last time he had seen
and spoken with her (but that it was sometime around Christmas),
and that he had discussed with her the possibility that she would
have to testify.
</P>
<P>
   (1) The allegation that the President denied knowing that Ms.
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed the last time he spoke to her
illustrates the problem of taking selected pieces of testimony out
of context. Messrs. Starr and Schippers isolate the following
exchange in the deposition:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did she tell you she had been served with a subpoena in this
case?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I don't know if she had been.
</P>
<P>
   Dep. at 68. From this incomplete excerpt, they claim that the
President perjured himself by denying that he knew that Ms.
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed the last time he had spoken with her.
See Ref. at 163.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is unsupported by the evidence. First, the testimony
immediately following this exchange demonstrates both that the
President was not hiding that he knew Ms. Lewinsky had been
subpoenaed by the time of the deposition and that the Jones lawyers
were well aware that this was the President's position:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that
Monica Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you talk to Mr. Lindsey about what action, if any, should
be taken as a result of her being served with a subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Dep. at 68-70. It is evident from the complete exchange on this
subject that the President was not generally denying that he knew
that Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed in the Jones case. The
questions that the Jones lawyers were asking the President also
make clear that this is what they understood the President's
testimony to be.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the President's testimony cannot fairly be read as an
express denial of knowledge that Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed
the last time he had spoken to her before the deposition. Most
importantly, the President was not asked whether he knew that Ms.
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed on December 28th, which was the last
time he had seen her. When the President answered the question,
``Did she tell you she had been served with a subpoena in this
case?'', he plainly was not thinking about December 28th. To the
contrary, the President's testimony indicates that he was totally
confused about the dates of his last meetings with Ms. Lewinsky,
and he made that abundantly clear to the Jones lawyers:
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. When was the last time you spoke with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm trying to remember. Probably sometime before Christmas.
She came by to see Betty sometime before Christmas. And she was
there talking to her, and I stuck my head out, said hello to her.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Stuck your head out of the Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh-huh, Betty said she was coming by and talked to her, and I
said hello to her.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was that shortly before Christmas or -
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm sorry, I don't remember. Been sometime in December, I
think, and I believe -- that may not be the last time. I think she
came to one of the, one of the Christmas parties.
</P>
<P>
   Dep. at 68 (emphasis added). His statement that he did not know
whether she had been subpoenaed directly followed this confused
exchange and was not tied to any particular meeting with her. By
that time it is totally unclear what date the answer is addressing.
</P>
<P>
   The Referral ignores this confusion by selectively quoting the
President as testifying ``that the last time he had spoken to Ms.
Lewinsky was in December 1997 `probably sometime before
Christmas.''' Ref. at 163 (quoting Dep. at 68). Given his
confusion, which the Jones lawyers made no attempt to resolve, it
is difficult to know what was being said, much less to label it
false and perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   (2) The claim that President Clinton did not acknowledge
speaking with Ms. Lewinsky about whether she might have to testify
similarly is not a fair or accurate reading of the deposition. In
response to the question, ``Have you ever talked to Ms. Lewinsky
about the possibility that she might have to testify in this
lawsuit?'', the President's answer did not end with the statement
``I'm not sure.'' Instead, the President continued with the
statement ``and let me tell you why I'm not sure,'' at which point
he described his recollection of having spoken with Ms. Lewinsky
about how Ms. Jones' lawyers and the Rutherford Institute were
going to call every woman to whom he had ever talked. Ibid. It is
evident the President's answer referred to the time period before
Ms. Lewinsky was on a witness list -- i.e., when her participation
was still a ``possibility'' only. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky confirmed
the accuracy of the President's recollection of this conversation
in her testimony, a fact that also is missing from the Referral.
See App. at 1566 (8/24/98 FBI 302 Form Interview of Ms. Lewinsky)
(``LEWINSKY advised CLINTON may have said during this conversation
that every woman he had ever spoken to was going to be on the
witness list.'').
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the President did in fact accurately describe a
conversation with Ms. Lewinsky about potential testimony. That the
Jones lawyers failed to follow-up with questions that would elicit
whether that was the only conversation, or whether there were
additional conversations once Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list
and her testimony was no longer a mere possibility, is not perjury.
It is simply a confused deposition record that could have been
clarified contemporaneously.
</P>
<P>
   e. Conversations with Mr. Jordan About Ms. Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of mischaracterizing the President's deposition
testimony to construct a perjury charge is repeated in a final
perjury allegation regarding the President's deposition answers to
questions about conversations with Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky.
The Referral alleges that the President was ``asked during his
civil deposition whether he had talked to Mr. Jordan about Ms.
Lewinsky's involvement in the Jones case'' and that he ``stated
that he knew Mr. Jordan had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her move
to New York, but stated that he did not recall whether Mr. Jordan
had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the Jones
case.'' Ref. at 186; see also Schippers Presentation at 40. The
problem with this allegation is that President Clinton was never
asked ``whether he had talked to Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's
involvement in the Jones case,'' and he did not deny doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In support of the charge, the Referral quotes the following
exchange from the President's deposition about who told the
President that Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that
Monica Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Ref. at 186 (emphasis added in Referral). This exchange does not
address whether the President spoke with Mr. Jordan about Ms.
Lewinsky's involvement in the Jones suit. And the excerpt is itself
misleading. The Referral omits the President's next answer, even
though it is obvious from the text, and the O.I.C. was told by the
President in his grand jury testimony, App. at 518-19, that this
answer was intended to finish the President's response to the
previous question:
</P>
<P>
   A. Bruce Lindsey, I think Bruce Lindsey told me that she was, I
think maybe that's the first person told me she was. I want to be
as accurate as I can.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the President was not testifying that no one other than
his attorneys had told him that Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed.
The Jones lawyers did not pursue this by asking logical follow-up
questions, such as whether, if Mr. Lindsey was the first person
were there others, or whether Mr. Jordan had subsequently shared
that information with him. The bottom line is that President
Clinton did not deny, in the quoted passage or elsewhere, knowing
that Mr. Jordan had spoken to Ms. Lewinsky about the Jones matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the other two cited passages of the President's
deposition testimony help the O.I.C.'s case. In response to a
question about whether in the two weeks before January 17 anyone
had reported to him that they had had a conversation with Ms.
Lewinsky about the Jones case, the President replied ``I don't
believe so.'' Dep. at 72. The President was not questioned
specifically about whether he had ever spoken to Mr. Jordan or
anyone else about Ms. Lewinsky's involvement in the Jones case. The
President's response, accordingly, did not rule out all
conversations with Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's involvement in
the case, as the Referral suggests, but only in the two-week period
prior to the deposition and only conversations relaying accounts of
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. Even conversations with Mr. Jordan
about her involvement in the case would not have been covered. The
Referral does not identify any reports to the President about any
conversation that Mr. Jordan had with Ms. Lewinsky in that time
period -- instead, it recounts only that, ten days before the
deposition, Mr. Jordan may have told the President that the
affidavit was signed. See Ref. at 187.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the President's answer to the question whether it had
been reported to him that Mr. Jordan had ``met with Monica Lewinsky
and talked about (the Jones) case,'' Dep. at 72 (emphasis added),
obviously cannot be read to support this charge of perjury. In
response to this question, the President acknowledged that he knew
that Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky had met. The President's further
response -- that he believed Mr. Jordan met with Ms. Lewinsky to
give her advice about her move to New York was fully accurate.
Again, the President was not asked whether he was aware that Mr.
Jordan had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the
Jones case. Since he was not asked the question, it is implausible
to suggest that he lied in the answer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Grand Jury Testimony of August 17, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of impeachment repeatedly contend in the most general
terms that President Clinton committed perjury in the grand jury on
August 17, 1998. When this allegation is framed in specific terms,
it is often based on the false belief that President Clinton denied
in the grand jury having had any sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky.
For example, in the Committee's perjury hearing held last week,
Chairman Hyde discounted the Referral's charge that President
Clinton had lied to the grand jury about the commencement date of
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and then stated, ``I don't rank
that up with lying to the grand jury, saying he didn't have a
sexual relationship.'' Remarks of Chairman Hyde at Perjury Hearing
of December 1, 1998; see also Statement of Judge Charles Wiggins at
2 (``the President was called as a witness before the grand jury
and he repeated his story that he did not have a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Subsequently the President
acknowledged that his story was false or misleading and that he in
fact had such a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'')
</P>
<P>
   These accounts of President Clinton's grand jury testimony are
not accurate. In his August 17, 1998 grand jury testimony,
President Clinton acknowledged that he had engaged in
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. Section II.C,
supra. He also acknowledged that his conduct was ``wrong.'' Ibid.
What the President denied in the grand jury was having ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky only as that term was defined by the
Jones lawyers and substantially restricted by Judge Wright. He did
not go into the details of those encounters because of privacy
considerations, although he did testify that they did not involve
either sexual intercourse or ``sexual relations'' as defined at the
Jones deposition after Judge Wright struck two-thirds of it. Ms.
Lewinsky, on the other hand, was forced by the O.I.C. to describe
in graphic detail her recollection of these encounters. See
Schippers Presentation at 27.
</P>
<P>
   This simply is not a case of perjury. In addition to the
inconsequential subject matter of the allegation -- the precise
nature of the admitted physical contact between the President and
Ms. Lewinsky -- the factual record would not support a prosecution
for perjury. That record is one essentially of ``oath against
oath,'' a formula that centuries of common law jurisprudence has
rejected as the basis for perjury. As the Supreme Court has stated,
``equally honest witnesses may well have differing recollections of
the same event,'' and hence ``a conviction for perjury ought not to
rest entirely upon 'an oath against an oath.''' United States v.
Weiler, 323 U.S. 606, 609 (1945); see also Griswold v. Hazard, 141
U.S. 260, 280 (1891) (Harlan, J.) (``The difference in recollection
of gentlemen often happens, without any reason to suspect that any
of them would intentionally deviate from the line of absolute
truth.''). Mr. Starr admitted in his testimony before the Judiciary
Committee on November 19, 1998, that the O.I.C. credited Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony only where there was corroboration. Transcript
of November 19, 1998 Hearing at 235-36. On the narrow point at
issue here, however, there can be no independent corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the facts do not support a perjury count based on the
President's grand jury testimony. It is hard to imagine how what is
at most a difference of recollection over the precise details of
the admitted physical contact between President Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky could be considered grounds for a perjury charge, much
less grounds for impeachment.

REPORT BACKS METHADONE FOR ADDICTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL MACFARQUHAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new report published Wednesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association recommends the expanded use of methadone to
treat heroin addiction, noting that it can help reduce crime, slow
the spread of other infectious diseases and reduce the general
level of dysfunction suffered by addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The report counters the policy enunciated by New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani earlier this year that addicts should be weaned
off their dependence through drug-free programs rather than
methadone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest disservice that has been done to getting
effective treatment to heroin addicts is the inaccurate statement
that methadone is a heroin substitute,'' said Dr. Alan Leshner,
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which helped
develop the report. ``We think science should replace ideology on
how we deal with treatment in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the new report bearing the stamp of approval
from the nation's medical establishment would not change their
position. They said that since the city began implementing its
policy in September, 20 addicts had been moved from methadone to
abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the city focuses on methadone use, it becomes
increasingly clear that it is not a form of treatment that should
be emphasized as part of a national drug policy,'' said Anthony
Coles, a senior adviser to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by a 12-member panel that convened a year
ago, says that people addicted to heroin or similar opiates should
be recognized as having a disease and that methadone is the
preferred treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a drug-free state represents an optimal treatment
goal,'' the report said, ``research has demonstrated that this goal
cannot be achieved or sustained by the majority of persons
dependent on opiates.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that one of the most striking examples of the
effectiveness of methadone was that the death rate of those who
received treatment was 30 percent of those who did not. A fifth of
the 600,000 diagnosed heroin addicts in the United States receive
methadone.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs tend to be lower for addicts on methadone
because of the lower incidence among them of diseases like
tuberculosis, hepatitis, AIDS and others, the report says. They
also commit fewer crimes in trying to support their habit.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says that addicts on methadone tend to earn more
than twice as much as those not being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Toward this end, methadone programs should be linked to job
training, the report stated, since stable employment usually leads
to more effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you get with methadone is a stabilizing of the brain
rather than the destabilizing that you get with heroin,'' Leshner
said. ``People can be restored to functionality because they are
not experiencing these very dramatic highs and lows.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they were trying to achieve stable
employment in pushing those addicts being treated at the five city
hospitals toward abstinence. New York City has the highest
concentration of recovering heroin addicts in the country, with
about 36,000 treatment slots.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, the city treats about 2,100, or 6 percent, in addition
to about 350 people a day among the inmates on Rikers Island. Coles
said that among addicts enrolled in private or public treatment
programs in the city, 83 percent lived on either public assistance
or Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the myths associated with methadone, it doesn't
reintegrate addicts into society,'' Coles said.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to invest $5 million in developing a job
placement program for addicts who accept drug-free treatment as
their ultimate goal. It will train the staff at its clinics to
advocate abstinence, and by January it expects to accept bids from
an outside company that will help place addicts in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, many years, they have been giving methadone to these
people with no incentive to do anything else,'' said Luis Marcos,
president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that since the program started in September, the
number of addicts working has risen to 440 from 350.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos said that since September, city hospitals had admitted
into methadone programs only addicts who pledged to accept
abstinence as their ultimate goal, and that in that time 20 addicts
had moved off methadone.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he did not argue with the report's conclusions
that methadone treatment programs can help reduce crime, diseases
and other ills linked to heroin addiction. But he said more
emphasis should be put on abstinence.

RANGERS SIGN CLARK, STILL PURSUE CLEMENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers yesterday signed right-hander
Mark Clark to a two-year contract worth a guaranteed $9.3 million,
but this latest acquisition should not be interpreted as a sign of
surrender in the team's pursuit of right-hander Roger Clemens,
general manager Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash acknowledged receipt
of six trade proposals for Clemens, the five-time Cy Young Award
recipient who demanded a trade seven days ago to a organization
closer to his Houston-area residence or a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten through the first wave, and we're into the
serious contenders,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers appear to be one of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume we are,'' Melvin said. ``I haven't been told that
we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 30, provides the Rangers additional inventory and the
ability to include a member of their rotation in Melvin's trade
proposal for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us more depth to talk about trades,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ruben Mateo, the No. 1 prospect in the
organization's minor-league system, likely serves as the
centerpiece of the Rangers' proposal for Clemens. Melvin called it
``very unlikely'' that catcher Ivan Rodriguez or left fielder Rusty
Greer would be included in any proposal for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who this past season went 9-14 with a 4.84 earned-run
average for the Chicago Cubs, will receive $4 million for 1999 and
$5 million for 2000. The Rangers also hold an option for the 2001
season worth $5 million or can purchase it for $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good players on the club, and I think it's
going to be a good time,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark earned $5.05 million during 1998, but a disappointing
season forced him to accept a reduction in salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually went a hell of a lot better than my wins and
losses show,'' Clark said. ``I pitched into some tough luck. I
pitched a lot of ballgames into the seventh and eighth inning and
came out with nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Five times, Clark was in line for a victory before the Cubs'
bullpen surrendered the lead. The bullpen also allowed 19 of the 30
runners it inherited from Clark to score. That represented the most
runs charged to any National League pitcher after departing a game.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also received the least run support (4.3 per nine innings)
among members of the Cubs' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched deep into a lot of ballgames,'' said Clark, who
pitched at least six innings in 25 of his 33 starts. ``With the
runs that \Rthe Rangers\S score, that can lead to a lot of wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark pitched more than 200 innings in each of the past three
seasons, and Melvin cited that as one reason the Rangers viewed him
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out there every fifth day for the past three
years,'' Clark said. ``I don't think I've missed but one or two
starts in three years. The one thing I can say is that I've been
healthy for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs did not offer Clark, a Type B free agent, salary
arbitration. That means the Rangers will not be required to forfeit
a draft choice as compensation for signing Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin now will turn his attention toward acquiring left-handed
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so right-handed heavy, but \Rleft-handers\S are just not
out there,'' Melvin said. ``I've talked to clubs, but there's just
none available. Maybe they'll come available later.''

AFTER LONG DETENTION, EGYPTIAN IMMIGRANT FINALLY CHARGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Egyptian man who is bitterly fighting his
deportation has been charged with making false statements in a
decade-old immigration matter, leading to sharp criticism from his
lawyers about the government's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Nasser Ahmed has received national attention
because, until Friday, he had been held for more than two and a
half years in solitary confinement without being charged with a
crime, based on assertions that Ahmed is a member of an Islamic
terrorist group in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Citing national security concerns, the government has refused to
make public most of its evidence about Ahmed's suspected terrorist
connections, making his case one of about two dozen in the country
in which the authorities have moved to deport or exclude an
immigrant on the basis of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Defense lawyers for Ahmed denounced the new charge
against their client, contending that prosecutors had singled him
out in retaliation for his stand in the immigration dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a name for that,'' said one of his lawyers, Abdeen
Jabara. ``It's called selective prosecution. And it's also called
prosecutorial misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan said there would
be no comment on the new indictment or on why Ahmed has not been
charged with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors have already asserted in legal papers that
Ahmed, 38, is a member of an Egyptian-based extremist organization,
the Islamic Group, which has claimed responsibility for several
acts of terrorism. They have also described Ahmed as ``a loyal
supporter'' of the group's spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel
Rahman, who is serving a life prison term for his conviction in
1995 in a conspiracy to blow up the United Nations and other New
York City landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who acted as the sheik's legal assistant during the 1995
trial, has denied any role in terrorism or membership in the
extremist group, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, speaking by phone from the Federal Correctional Center at
Otisville, N.Y., said of the new charge: ``It really shows they
have nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been raising national security concerns for almost
three years now,'' he added, ``and it's boiled down'' to the false
statement charge.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed was charged with making a series of false statements from
1987 to 1990 in connection with his application for temporary
residence status.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University who
represents Ahmed, said he believed the criminal charge was an
attempt to buttress the case the government is to make next week
when Ahmed appears for a hearing before an immigration judge in
Manhattan. For that hearing, Cole said, the government has already
submitted more secret evidence to support deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars and other critics have attacked the use of
secret evidence on due process grounds, contending that it makes it
impossible for immigrants and their lawyers to mount an adequate
defense. The government defends the practice as justified to
protect sensitive counterterrorism intelligence sources and law
enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed was arrested in 1995 on a charge that he had overstayed
his visa, and was released on a $15,000 bond. He was arrested again
in April 1996, and the government cited classified evidence in
later hearings to support his continued detention.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ahmed and his lawyers were told only that the
information concerned his ``association with a known terrorist
organization,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the government declassified what he described as ``dribs
and drabs'' of evidence, including more than 100 pages of heavily
blacked-out transcripts of immigration proceedings. Charging that
the government is using ``guilt by association'' to attack his
client, he added: ``They are throwing around words like
`terrorist,''' but they indict him on a document fraud from 10
years ago.''

CARDINAL RULE: LIFE AT TOP IS TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanford didn't lose its second game of last season until Jan.
31. This year, the Cardinal already has two defeats, three
injuries, one Sports Illustrated cover subject (North Hollywood
High alumnus Arthur Lee) and a great big target on its back.
</P>
<P>
   It's the world of spotlight and survival. Arizona and UCLA have
lived there for years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't misread the situation. Stanford (5-2) lost on neutral
courts to two of the nation's best teams, many of its problems are
correctable and it remains the class of the Pac-10. But the No. 6
Cardinal is quickly learning life isn't easy at the top, regardless
of coaching, experience, size, depth or execution.
</P>
<P>
   First, the vaunted depth has dwindled. Sharpshooter Ryan Mendez
is out until Christmas with tendinitis. Second-string point guard
Mike McDonald is out five to seven weeks with a bad foot. And
reserve center Jason Collins, from Harvard-Westlake High, is out at
least two weeks with a dislocated bone in his wrist suffered Monday
against George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Montgomery strengthened the schedule to test his
veterans early and prepare them for the rugged Pac-10. After
thrashing UC-Davis, Southern Methodist and Southwest Missouri in
Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal left home _ and left its shooting
touch behind.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory over St. John's and loss to North Carolina in the
preseason NIT in Madison Square Garden, the Cardinal shot 33.6
percent _ evoking memories of past Stanford teams that played
brilliantly at home but struggled on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose to play at this level,'' Montgomery said. ``We knew
with this schedule that we'd be in position to lose a few games.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, perhaps empowered by his NCAA Tournament success, is
forcing the pace and shooting a beat too quickly. Guard Kris Weems
and small forward Peter Sauer are smothered by defenses designed to
limit their 3-point marksmanship. And center Tim Young's offense
was so offensive, Montgomery threatened to bench him in favor of
Collins. Young responded with 12 points against George Washington,
but the concern has not abated.
</P>
<P>
   More, the book on Stanford has changed. Instead of collapsing on
the big men, opponents are stopping the perimeter attack and daring
Young and Mark Madsen to beat them in one-on-one situations in the
low post. It's a sound strategy, given Young's ineffectiveness and
Madsen's style: He's best when moving off the ball and grabbing
offensive rebounds, not breaking down a defense with the dribble.
</P>
<P>
   What's ahead? The current glitches won't derail Stanford's
long-term progress. Most likely, the Cardinal will roll through the
Pac-10 and make a deep run in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   __ Unlawful schedule: As if New Mexico coach Dave Bliss doesn't
have enough problems with his best player, senior Kenny Thomas,
ineligible for 10 more days, now state lawmakers are hammering
Bliss about the Lobos' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. New Mexico Rep. Kiki Saavedra (D-Albuquerque)
called the schedule ``pathetic'' and ``a laugh at the taxpayers of
New Mexico'' in a recent interview with the Albuquerque Journal.
Other politicians have supported Saavedra and said they cannot give
tickets away.
</P>
<P>
   The Lobos' early-season schedule includes Arkansas-Pine Buff,
Texas-Pan American, Sacramento State, McNeese State and three bad
teams in the Lobo Classic: Cornell, La Salle and Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss, who sent a letter apologizing for Saavedra's comments to
Cornell coach Scott Thompson, said the schedule is purposefully
soft because of Thomas' absence. (He was suspended for the semester
because of an eligibility dispute dating to his freshman year.)
</P>
<P>
   The pols don't care _ and apparently don't have anything better
to do.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back for more: College of Charleston's upset of North
Carolina on Saturday was not the shocker it seemed. The Cougars,
who took eventual national champ Arizona to the wire in the 1997
NCAA Tournament, are once again a team to avoid in March.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Kresse has all five starters back to handle
Charleston's upgrade from the Trans-America Athletic Conference to
the Southern Conference. Senior forward Carl Thomas scored 20
points against the Tar Heels, and center Jody Lumpkin outplayed UNC
center Brendan Haywood. The Cougars won 24 games last year but were
a little young to stun Stanford in the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   This year, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the Pac-10: The Pac-10 is 3-6 this season against
teams ranked in the Top 25, with victories over Tennessee, Oklahoma
State and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Against the elite _ North Carolina, Kentucky, Connecticut and
Maryland _ the Pac-10 is 0-5. Unless the trend reverses, that could
hurt the league's chances of getting a fifth or sixth team in the
NCAA Tournament. And that could be UCLA or USC. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Washington's loss at Boise State wasn't close to the league's
worst defeat. That would be Washington State's 88-75 loss at
Alaska-Fairbanks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: This UCLA team plays harder than any version
since the last national-championship season. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State forward Mike Batiste returns Dec. 19 after serving
an eight-game academic suspension. . . .
</P>
<P>
   USC transfer guard Brandon Granville leads the Pac-10 in assists
(seven per game). . . .
</P>
<P>
   Arizona point guard Jason Terry is averaging 41 minutes per
game. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Circle Dec. 29 on the calendar. In addition to UCLA and USC
hosting Loyola Marymount and Arkansas State, respectively, Rhode
Island visits Pepperdine _ URI coach Jim Harrick's first appearance
in Southern California since his dismissal from UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Bay Area, the Newell Classic matches Stanford against
Temple and Cal against North Carolina. &QL; 
THE TOP 10
</P>
<P>
   __ 1. Maryland (10-0) _ Terps spank Stanford and DePaul within
36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   __ 2. Connecticut (6-0) _ Not even the best team on its campus.
</P>
<P>
   __ 3. Duke (7-1) _ Florida will feel the Devils' wrath tonight.
</P>
<P>
   __ 4. Cincinnati (5-0) _ Bearcats taking time off to study. Yuk,
yuk.
</P>
<P>
   __ 5. Stanford (5-2) _ Collins twins need to play more, Tim
Young less.
</P>
<P>
   __ 6. Kentucky (7-1) _ Cats began grueling month with Indiana on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   __ 7. North Carolina (8-1) _ Any more foul trouble and he'll be
Brendan Haypine.
</P>
<P>
   __ 8. Indiana (8-1) _ General Bob finally has players who like
him. It shows.
</P>
<P>
   __ 9. Arizona (4-0) _ Wildcats fans want a piece of UCLA . . .
football.
</P>
<P>
   __ 10. Purdue (7-1) _ Wing guard Jaraan Cornell might be Big
Ten's best shooter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Five to watch: Kansas, St. John's, Minnesota, Syracuse, UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Maryland at Kentucky &QL; 
Saturday, Rupp Arena &QL; 
Should be one of the best games of the season and the first road
test for unbeaten Maryland. Wildcats must control tempo to keep
Terps' athletes in check. Kentucky's December schedule includes
Kansas, Indiana, Maryland, Georgia Tech, Duke and Louisville. Terps
won't be challenged until Jan. 3 collision with Duke.

IRREVERENT MCMAHON IS AMONG 13 ENTERING HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jim McMahon, the able quarterback for Brigham Young
University and six professional teams, including the Chicago Bears,
blended his famous irreverence with maturing humility and candor
Tuesday as he addressed the topic, ``What Has Football Meant to
Me?''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a luncheon of the National Football Foundation
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel preceding the 41st annual awards
dinner. McMahon was one of 13 inductees to the College Football
Hall of Fame. Also present were the 17 senior football players who
have won $18,000 post-graduate fellowships given by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to school to play ball,'' McMahon, wearing a black
sweater jacket and a gold ring in his left ear, told a rapt
audience. ``I never really liked school. I was not a guy who could
sit all day in a classroom and keep interested.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, now 39 and the father of four in Northbrook, Ill.,
outside Chicago, grew up in San Jose, Calif. He soon learned, he
said, that he had to do some studying, ``to get the grades to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to college for five years, and I never got a degree,''
McMahon said. ``I always figured work was overrated. I'm lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brigham Young, where he was another in a long line of
outstanding passers, McMahon played for 15 years in the National
Football League, leading the Bears to a Super Bowl victory in 1986.
There were many injuries along the way but no lingering debility.
``My knees are fine,'' he said. ``No arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   His vocation now is that of a tournament golfer. ``I play on the
celebrity circuit,'' he said. ``We'll have 13 tournaments next
year, from April to December. That'll keep me busy.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also busy being a father of three boys. ``They're like
me,'' he said. ``They want to play sports. They don't want to go to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said he found himself explaining recently that
schoolwork was required to be eligible for sports. ``You'd have to
be brain dead not to get to be eligible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The days he enjoyed most in his playing years were game days,
not practice days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played to win,'' he said. ``I gave it my all. I played for
some good coaches and a few bad coaches _ some who had no business
being there. I always called it like I saw it. And that got me in
trouble.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Once Pete Rozelle, the National Football League's commissioner
at the time, fined McMahon for making critical comments. McMahon
responded by wearing a headband on game day with Rozelle's name on
it, and that caused a furor. Another headband once read Pluto. Few
knew what that meant, but Pluto was the nickname of McMahon's
college teammate, Dan Plater, whose brief professional career ended
when it was discovered he had a brain tumor. Plater had surgery and
occasionally serves as McMahon's caddie in golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, whose career ended in 1996, is not a big fan of
contemporary pro football. ``The games are terrible,'' he said.
``I'd like to go out there and play. But my wife won't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tagliabue, the present commissioner, has ``taken the fun
out of the game,'' McMahon said. ``Too many rules, regulations for
the players. They don't even let the veterans haze the rookies
anymore. So they don't learn respect.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said he respects football. ``I love the game,'' he said.
``Football has given me everything. I met my wife in college. Her
dad hoped she'd bring home a good Mormon boy. And they got me. But
we've been married 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be here. I've had a great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the brash old quarterback went off to meet his wife.
``Going shopping,'' he said.

HITCHCOCK, STARS FLOURISHING DESPITE SEASON'S ODD TWISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The past wrapped itself around Ken Hitchcock like a warm coat
last weekend when the Stars coach returned to the memories of his
youth in Western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, I'm really finding myself enjoying this more than
ever,'' Hitchcock said of returning to his childhood home of
Edmonton, Alberta. ``I'm finding myself a lot more reflective these
days, I'm able to look back to how I got here and where I'm going
from here. It's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been more perfect for Hitchcock, who is
enduring quite possibly his strangest season in professional
hockey. Already, the Stars coach has survived a delicate public
debate with newcomer Brett Hull, drawn the ire of his team for a
Thanksgiving Day practice and been the subject of a newspaper
report that he was ``losing the team.''
</P>
<P>
   All that while the Stars are off to a 15-5-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   And while the old Ken Hitchcock might have been a bundle of
nerves during the sometimes controversial moments of the season's
first quarter, the new Ken Hitchcock emerged from Alberta
introspective and positive _ a man saying he is learning more about
coaching, and more about himself, every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to improve on as a coach is I have to continue to
remove myself from the emotion of the game,'' Hitchcock said.
``That's something I talk to myself every day about. My job is to
make sound decisions at the right time. And to do that, you have to
be less emotional than your players.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been easy for Hitchcock, who said he has been
driven toward success since dropping out of college to sell
sporting goods in Edmonton 25 years ago. But he said he's learning
that being patient doesn't mean he's losing his drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect coaching a team to be this methodical roll up a
hill or something. It's not,'' he said. ``It's a lot of peaks and
valleys and hard, hard emotion. It's a lot of pushing and pulling
and dragging players, and you're going to have plenty of volatile
moments in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Those volatile moments have been more public this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock publicly reprimanded Hull for commenting on his
reduced ice time. And the Stars coach said afterward that the
sometimes tense experience that had Hull posting the ``no comment''
sign to the media for five days brought the superstar winger closer
to the group.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent incident, the ``Arizona Republic'' quoted a
source saying players had criticized Hitchcock's coaching technique
and that one player wanted to take a swing at Hitchcock. He also
said the end result was a team that came closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good lessons for us about how the media operates in
the '90s and how we as a team have to react to that,'' Hitchcock
said. ``And I think we're learning that you have to draw in closer
as a family in situations like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hitchcock is using those revelations to soften a coaching
style that players admit is often abrasive but typically
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that plays together and likes playing
\RHitchcock's\S game,'' winger Grant Marshall said. ``He expects us
to play hard, and we expect the same thing of ourselves. And every
time we've done that in this system, we end up winning a lot of
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's system is the same hard-skating style he developed
while coaching youth hockey in the Edmonton suburb of Sherwood
Park. It's the same demanding forechecking style _ one that can be
compared to basketball's full-court press _ that helped him post a
291-125-15 record with the Kamloops Blazers in major junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   It's a team-first style _ one that spreads playing time and
requires individual sacrifices _ that Hitchcock demands his players
adapt to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't care about about how much money you make, he
doesn't care about how old you are,'' said center Brian Skrudland,
who is in his 14th season and playing for his fifth NHL team. ``If
you're playing the best, you're the guy in the lineup. A coach can
earn a lot of respect that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was even joking about the ``Arizona Republic'' report
that the Canadian media kept bringing up last week. When asked how
things went after one practice, Hitchcock replied, ``Well, nobody
took a swing at me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, it took a little control on his part to keep his
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you that it didn't hurt at first,'' he
said of anonymous accusations that players said he was being
outcoached. ``But I'm finding that I can handle it much better.
Now, I find that I'm even more self-confident that I know what I'm
doing. I think you have to be that way or you end up coaching just
to satisfy people, and that never works.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Stars general manager Bob Gainey has helped him
steel his self-confidence from the brazen ``I'm right'' attitude
that he used to favor to more of a quiet self-assurance _ well,
quiet by Hitchcock's standards, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is able to show me the big picture,'' Hitchcock said.
``Whereas I want to fight every fight and battle every day against
anything that I see detracting from the team, Bob shows me how each
situation will affect the team down the road. He's really shown me
how to be more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been Hitchcock's biggest shortcoming in coaching, he
said. He wants results now, he wants to win every game, every
shift. But mostly he wants maximum effort. He earned some amount of
disdain from the players when he made them practice on Thanksgiving
after an abysmal 5-2 loss to the New Jersey Devils. But Hitchcock
said that practice wasn't for punishment's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``My background is that I believe in the supreme value of the
group. If I see anything threatening that, I probably don't have
the amount of patience I should,'' he said. ``And I'm probably not
an easy guy to play for if you don't respect the group. That said,
I find now I can bounce back a lot quicker from a loss, because
I've had a little more experience with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the new Ken Hitchcock.

MICHAEL ZASLOW, ACTOR PUBLICIZED LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Zaslow, an actor who played a victim of Lou
Gehrig's disease on the soap opera ``One Life to Live'' and who
struggled with the illness in real life, died on Sunday at his home
in Manhattan. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Brynn Thayer, who played his
wife on the show in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Zaslow won a daytime Emmy Award as best actor in 1994 for his
role as the villainous Roger Thorpe on CBS' ``Guiding Light,'' a
role he played at various times for 25 years. He was dismissed from
the show in April 1997, some eight months after the early symptoms
of his illness caused his speech to slur.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Zaslow appeared on ABC's ``One Life to Live,'' reprising
his role as the pianist David Renaldi, which he had played from
1983 to 1986. When Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, was diagnosed in late 1997, he incorporated the
degenerative nervous-system disorder into the life of his character
to raise awareness about it.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Susan Hufford, Ms. Thayer and other friends, he
founded Zaz-angels, an organization under the umbrella of the
Greater New York Chapter of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
Association, which works for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Zaslow's last appearance on ``One Life to Live,'' a Thanksgiving
segment, was broadcast on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Zaslow also appeared in the 1977 movie ``You Light Up My Life''
and the television series ``Law and Order.'' He appeared in the
Broadway productions of ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' ``Fiddler on the
Roof'' and ``Boccaccio,'' as well as in off-Broadway and regional
productions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Marika
Hufford-Zaslow and Helena Hufford-Zaslow, both of Manhattan.

GET RICH QUICK SCHEME: COWBOYS FOCUS ON PASS RUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANALYSIS
</P>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Kansas City team the Cowboys will face
Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium bears little resemblance to the boring
Chiefs teams of past seasons or the bumbling offensive group that
got off to a slow start this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs (5-8) may be out of the playoff chase, but their
offense is playing as well as any in the league. Kansas City has
topped the 30-point barrier in each of the past three games _ a
first in 10 years under conservative coach Marty Schottenheimer and
a first for the franchise since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said it's no coincidence that the
scoring explosion coincided with Schottenheimer's decision to go
with Rich Gannon at quarterback instead of Elvis Grbac. During the
three-game span, Gannon has completed 68 of 104 passes for 774
yards with seven touchdowns, two interceptions and a sizzling
quarterback rating of 102.1.
</P>
<P>
   He threw three touchdown passes in each of the past two weeks to
become the first Chiefs quarterback to accomplish the feat since
Steve DeBerg in 1990. Gailey said he likes Gannon's ball
distribution, considering that four Chiefs have caught at least 35
passes _ running back Kimble Anders (51), tight end Tony Gonzalez
(43) and wide receivers Derrick Alexander (40) and Andre Rison
(35).
</P>
<P>
   Gannon ``is playing pretty well,'' Gailey said. ``He is throwing
the ball deep and accurately. And he's got a lot of different
weapons. They are spreading the ball around like we've done and
made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   However, what worries Gailey and the Cowboys is not only
Gannon's arm but his legs. A scrambler, Gannon has hurt defenses by
moving around and creating plays on the corners. He has proved
dangerous throwing the ball on the move and taking off for big
runs.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys have had trouble lately with mobile
quarterbacks, namely Arizona's Jake Plummer and New Orleans' Kerry
Collins. The Cowboys have gotten pressure, but have not been able
to get sacks on a consistent basis and have allowed quarterbacks to
slip out of the pocket and make plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense has recorded five sacks in the past three
games, the worst three-game stint of the season. Defensive ends
Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman have recorded 1.5 sacks combined in
the past six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will likely use a linebacker or safety as a ``spy''
on the quarterback on obvious passing downs. But defensive line
coach Jim Bates said the key is staying in the rush lanes and
keeping Gannon in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to put a lot of emphasis on staying in the rush
lanes,'' Bates said. ``They have to be aware. But we don't want
them to be passive either. We want them to stay in the lanes with
aggressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   And sack the quarterback.

 NEW YORK SOUND STAGES HAVE TROUBLE WITH FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, dreams of creating Hollywood-on-the-Hudson
have tantalized politicians and entrepreneurs, only to collide with
the financial realities of a high-risk industry.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, it looked as if those dreams might finally be
realized, as several entrepreneurs announced plans for complexes of
sound stages like the studio back lots in Los Angeles. They
conjured up visions of more television shows flocking to New York
and increasing numbers of filmmakers choosing the city for indoor
filming as well as outdoor locations.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, only one of these projects _ the Hudson
River Studios, five sound stages atop St. John's Center in lower
Manhattan _ is viewed as a good prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The other proposals have not fared as well.
</P>
<P>
   In January, an independent film production company known as the
Shooting Gallery announced that it planned to build the largest
movie lot in the metropolitan area, complete with 15 sound stages,
in an old industrial park in Harrison, N.J., just outside Newark,
at an estimated cost of $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company has had to scale back its ambitions. Last
summer, it opened the $5 million Gun-for-Hire Film Production
Center in a nine-story building at 110 Leroy St. in lower
Manhattan. The center provides other independent filmmakers and the
producers of mainstream films like next year's ``For Love of the
Game,'' starring Kevin Costner, with the space and equipment they
need while they are working in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two young entrepreneurs _ one a computer consultant,
the other a movie set designer _ announced that they had signed a
lease with the city to develop the Brooklyn Navy Yard into a $160
million complex with a dozen sound stages, to be known as New York
Studios. But people on Wall Street and elsewhere who follow the
entertainment industry said it was unlikely that they would be able
to attract the financing to build a project of that size.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the developers have been unable to raise any capital,
according to an investment banker who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, and they are likely to miss a December deadline set by
the city to come up with a financing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the developers and the city remain optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Madigan, one of the developers, said the deadline for
financing, now reduced to $140 million, had been extended six
months, and he expressed confidence that backers would be found.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they, too, believe the site will be
developed. ``They are right on target,'' said Curt Ritter, a
spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Several other, less-publicized proposals are also on the back
burner, including a television production component at Donald
Trump's huge Riverside South project on the Upper West Side, and
the conversion of the city-owned Hudson River piers at 54th Street
into sound stages.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the entertainment industry issued earlier this
year, a nonprofit research group, Exploring the Metropolis,
concluded that ``New York's sound stages are insufficient in terms
of both size and number to meet today's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the report noted that an industry in which
television shows go on and off the air on short notice and films
are generally shot in a few months is naturally at odds with the
real estate business, which demands a higher degree of
predictability.
</P>
<P>
   A commitment from a major Hollywood studio to establish a
beachhead in New York would certainly satisfy that demand, but
there is no sign of such a commitment, especially since several
movie companies have added sound stages in Los Angeles in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Entertainment Company will announce next week that
it has agreed to manage New York Studios, if the Brooklyn Navy Yard
project ever gets off the ground. But Sony, which has been
tightening its belt, is not investing in the project, nor has it
promised to make any movies or television programs there, sources
both inside and outside the studio said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Madigan and his partner, Cary Dean Hart, are
aggressively trying to keep the Navy Yard proposal alive. In
November, they issued a news release saying the project would ``not
only be a gigantic, full-service Hollywood-style movie lot, but
will evolve as a waterfront entertainment hub and movie theme park
that will attract millions of visitors to a revitalized downtown
Brooklyn.''.
</P>
<P>
   One organization trying to help the film industry expand is the
New York City Investment Fund, a private company established by the
financier Henry Kravis to stimulate job growth. The fund decided
not to invest in the Brooklyn Navy Yard proposal, said Kathryn
Wylde, president of the fund. ``We would love to be in a position
to support them,'' she said, ``but unless and until they are able
to demonstrate that the business makes sense, it's going to be very
hard to.''

PATAKI'S 2ND INAUGURAL TO REPLACE COSTLY GALA WITH A HOTEL LUNCH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shunning a reprise of the lavish, three-day
inauguration gala in 1995 that shadowed his first term in office,
Gov. George Pataki announced Tuesday that he would celebrate his
second swearing-in with a decidedly more modest affair: an
$80-a-head reception in a hotel ballroom in Albany on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides explained the scaled-down celebration by saying
that the Republican governor's re-election in November was less
momentous than his 1994 defeat of Gov. Mario Cuomo, the three-term
Democrat. Accordingly, Pataki has decided to forgo laser lights,
19-gun salutes, orchestral tributes and a black-tie gala, which
entertained the 13,000 people who heralded his arrival in Albany in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   That inauguration, combined with the transition, cost $2.5
million. By rough estimates, the 1999 inaugural (there obviously
will be no transition costs) will be closer to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a second inaugural,'' said Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia
Mucha. ``And therefore, it will be significantly smaller in
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha said Pataki's decision did not reflect discomfort with
the political and legal hangover that was created by the way his
aides organized and financed the first inaugural. The first time,
Pataki's advisers created private committees to finance the
inaugural and the transition, and declined to disclose a list of
the donors or spending.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats sued to force Pataki's committees to release
some of the details of the operation. Those records, released under
court order, revealed that much of the money had come from
corporations doing business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The battle continues to this day. The Court of Appeals, the
state's highest court, is expected to rule later this month on a
continuing attempt by Assembly Democrats to force Pataki to divulge
even more detailed information about his committee's fund-raising
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   No such committee will be formed this time, Ms. Mucha said. The
guests at Pataki's 1999 reception _ estimated at 300 people _ will
write their $80 checks directly to the Omni Hotel in Albany. Ms.
Mucha said the checks would cover the costs of renting the space
and a lunch. Ms. Mucha said she knew no details of the
entertainment or menu.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Assembly Democrats, Pat Lynch, declined comment
on the planned celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's event comes at a time when he has suggested he might be
considering running for national office, and thus he would
presumably not want to stage the kind of lavish celebration that
would allow Assembly Democrats to create the problems for him this
time that they did the last time around.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha insisted, though, that that factor had not entered
into this decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's traditional to have second and third inaugurals be a lot
more low-key,'' she said.

CLAIBORNE MULLS TCU AND NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now that USC has had a couple of days to ponder
Texas Christian as its opponent in the Sun Bowl, the Trojans
believe the 6-5 Horned Frogs pose a big dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of in a lose-lose situation,'' linebacker
Chris Claiborne said. ``If we win by seven points, people would
say, `God, they only won by seven.' But if we lose, it's even
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Bowl is a long way off for Claiborne, who has a busy
itinerary this month. He gets to go to Orlando this weekend for the
presentation of the Butkus Award, for which he is a finalist with
Texas A&AMP;M's Dat Nguyen and Florida's Jevon Kearse. The honor goes
to the nation's top linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely excited,'' Claiborne said. ``It's good for me
and the university. I'm just looking to go there and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne will also meet with USC coach Paul Hackett today for
the first of several meetings in which his NFL stock will be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Hackett and I have a lot of talking to do,'' Claiborne
said. ``We'll talk and discuss my options. Hopefully, I can use him
as a measuring stick of where I am as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he has already talked to a couple of teams and will
speak to several more about Claiborne's pro prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is to gather as much information as I can and be
supportive of Chris,'' Hackett said. ``He's also my No. 1 recruit.
If he returns, that makes our defense infinitely better (next
season).''
</P>
<P>
   It figures to be impossible to keep Claiborne in school. He is
listed by draft guru Mel Kiper as the No. 3 pick in the first round
of Kiper's mock draft.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne said he isn't swayed by how the Trojans perform in the
Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just my own man,'' Claiborne said. ``I just have to do
what's best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hawaii interviews Young: University of Hawaii athletic
director Hugh Yoshida and four other members of a search committee
interviewed USC defensive coordinator Bill Young on Tuesday morning
as a possible replacement to Fred vonAppen, who was fired last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Young is one of several candidates for the job, including San
Diego Chargers coach June Jones, Utah coach Ron McBride and Arizona
assistant coach Duane Akina.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel good after you interview, but who knows?''
Young said. ``I think it's a job that will take a lot of effort and
a lot of work. I think it'sa program that can be turned around. I
don't know what the pecking order is. All the people have strong
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he expects Hawaii to hire a coach by this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be really disappointed if we lost him,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Hackett said he was optimistic wide receiver
Windrell Haynes (sprained big toe) would be able to return to
practice before the Sun Bowl. Offensive lineman Matt Welch did not
practice Tuesday because he has tests to undergo regarding heart
palpitations he experienced during the Notre Dame game. Welch is
expected to return sometime before Christmas.

GET RICH QUICK SCHEME: COWBOYS FOCUS ON PASS RUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Kansas City team the Cowboys will face
Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium bears little resemblance to the boring
Chiefs teams of past seasons or the bumbling offensive group that
got off to a slow start this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs (5-8) may be out of the playoff chase, but their
offense is playing as well as any in the league. Kansas City has
topped the 30-point barrier in each of the past three games _ a
first in 10 years under conservative coach Marty Schottenheimer and
a first for the franchise since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said it's no coincidence that the
scoring explosion coincided with Schottenheimer's decision to go
with Rich Gannon at quarterback instead of Elvis Grbac. During the
three-game span, Gannon has completed 68 of 104 passes for 774
yards with seven touchdowns, two interceptions and a sizzling
quarterback rating of 102.1.
</P>
<P>
   He threw three touchdown passes in each of the past two weeks to
become the first Chiefs quarterback to accomplish the feat since
Steve DeBerg in 1990. Gailey said he likes Gannon's ball
distribution, considering that four Chiefs have caught at least 35
passes _ running back Kimble Anders (51), tight end Tony Gonzalez
(43) and wide receivers Derrick Alexander (40) and Andre Rison
(35).
</P>
<P>
   Gannon ``is playing pretty well,'' Gailey said. ``He is throwing
the ball deep and accurately. And he's got a lot of different
weapons. They are spreading the ball around like we've done and
made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   However, what worries Gailey and the Cowboys is not only
Gannon's arm but his legs. A scrambler, Gannon has hurt defenses by
moving around and creating plays on the corners. He has proved
dangerous throwing the ball on the move and taking off for big
runs.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys have had trouble lately with mobile
quarterbacks, namely Arizona's Jake Plummer and New Orleans' Kerry
Collins. The Cowboys have gotten pressure, but have not been able
to get sacks on a consistent basis and have allowed quarterbacks to
slip out of the pocket and make plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense has recorded five sacks in the past three
games, the worst three-game stint of the season. Defensive ends
Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman have recorded 1.5 sacks combined in
the past six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will likely use a linebacker or safety as a ``spy''
on the quarterback on obvious passing downs. But defensive line
coach Jim Bates said the key is staying in the rush lanes and
keeping Gannon in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to put a lot of emphasis on staying in the rush
lanes,'' Bates said. ``They have to be aware. But we don't want
them to be passive either. We want them to stay in the lanes with
aggressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   And sack the quarterback.

REPLAY NOT THE ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right. What the NFL really needs is a bunch of confused,
middle-aged guys, crowded around a sideline Sony, trying to decide
if what they think they see is what they thought they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I'm not against instant replay. I think it's the closest
thing to root canal surgery going in sports.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the NFL's proposed new system for the
playoffs, whereby coaches can ``challenge'' an official's eyesight
at an opportune moment of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. That should make calls go the challenging coach's way in
those final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And behind which team's sideline will the TV replay monitor be
placed? Just wondering. Does the team with the TV get to help?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the NFL has an officiating crisis. In the past two
weeks alone, we've seen major officiating gaffes cost games for the
Buffalo Bills, Seattle Seahawks and Pittsburgh Steelers. We've seen
80-year-old Ralph Wilson, owner of the Bills, openly defy
whippersnapper commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   And we've seen reports, conspicuous by their timing, that
indicate the league might be willing to employ a shake-and-bake
replay system after a thorough preparation period of, oh, three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I'm not against instant replay. Some, I suppose, is better
than none at all.
</P>
<P>
   But for Tagliabue's office to even acknowledge that a playoff
revival of replay is being considered cleverly masks the real
point.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, the officiating stinks. The zebras can no longer keep up
with the cheetahs and the hyenas. It's as if things are happening
too fast for the men in striped shirts, a notion that lacks
scientific merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got robbed _ it was awful!'' Wilson said after not one, but
two, bad calls in the final minute cost his Bills a 25-21 defeat to
New England.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the old American Football League's original owners,
Wilson has been voting against NFL instant replay proposals for the
better part of 13 seasons. Bill Parcells, whose New York Jets
benefited from Sunday's mythical Vinny Testaverde touchdown, once
coached the Giants, who have voted against replays nine out of nine
times.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he would change his Jets vote in a minute if he
thought it would cure the problem. But the more important thing,
Parcells added, is that the officials get things right.
</P>
<P>
   Is that asking too much?
</P>
<P>
   These days, alas, the answer is probably yes. Officials in the
NFL have lost their edge. Though 112 strong, the corps of officials
is not deep in talent. More than one-third of them have four years
or less of pro football experience.
</P>
<P>
   They are paid anywhere from $1,200 to $4,000 to work a game. And
when it's over, they go home _ home to their ``real'' jobs of being
school principals and investment advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In all probability, none of them has ever been roused from a
quiet Monday night's sleep by an angry Tagliabue. Or an
even-angrier Tex Schramm.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue has bankers to call, I suspect. He is an owners
commissioner, and he must spend his days figuring out ways for the
league's Jeffrey Luries and Jerry Joneses to recoup their NFL
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Forget pass interference. The current commissioner deals more in
seat licenses and finding a team for the big TV market in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When Schramm ran the Cowboys, he was a member of the most
powerful and far-ranging inner circle in pro football _ the NFL's
competition committee. Pass interference may not have been easier
to call in the '70s, but almost without fail the competition
committee would script an annual official interpretation of it.
</P>
<P>
   The nuts and bolts of the game, the delicate balance between
offense and defense, the game's ongoing and projected trends _
Schramm and his committeemen would study the issues and prepare
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations invariably involved the way NFL games were
officiated. It was a league priority when Pete Rozelle ruled the
pro football earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, there's this vision of lawyer Tagliabue, trying to put
the league's genie back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects perfection. Referees aren't perfect. Clergymen
aren't perfect. Sportswriters aren't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But in the latter two cases, there is somebody to answer to.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring full-time officials would help. You wonder how many of
the NFL's weekend ``temps'' still have the problems of their
Monday-through-Friday jobs on their minds when Sunday comes. It's
only natural.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay? It'll do. Firing some officials? Absolutely, but
replace them with what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem remains. NFL officiating has to get better _ not
simply watched over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wilson, 80 years wise, knew what he was talking about last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner, were you listening?
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House opened its formal defense of
President Clinton on Tuesday, addressing in greater detail than
before the facts and issues of the impeachment case against Clinton
and adopting a more conciliatory tone in testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers and three panels of anti-impeachment witnesses
conducted a grueling day-into-night tutorial for the 37-member
committee on why Clinton should not be removed from office for his
admitted misconduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as no fancy language can obscure the simple fact that
what the president did was morally wrong,'' said Gregory Craig, the
White House special counsel who led the defense effort Tuesday,
``no amount of rhetoric can change the legal reality that there are
no grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers assembled a battery of witnesses who
virtually conceded that his behavior was reprehensible, but said
impeachment was graver threat to the nation than allowing the
president to serve out his tarnished final two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders tried to blur the hard edges of his
fundamental point of defense _ that he misbehaved and misled, but
did not obstruct justice or commit perjury. His conduct was surely
sinful, said Craig, but just as certainly not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Tuesday night that Clinton was likely to
make some public comment on the committee's deliberations, perhaps
offering another statement of remorse to temper lingering concerns
among wavering Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Craig and his nine friendly witnesses was trying to
put a gentler face on the president's defense, White House lawyers
released a 184-page rebuttal that once again harshly attacked
Kenneth Starr, accusing him of slanting the case against the
president by excluding exculpatory evidence in his impeachment
referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation from the president's men did not appear to sway
any minds on the bitterly divided Judiciary Committee. But the
debate, which was by turns tedious, riveting and mildly salacious,
was aimed more at a body of moderate Republicans outside the
committee who hold in their hands the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans on the committee were insistent on
pinning down what they believe to be a pattern of perjury by the
president and evasions by his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., engaged in a sharp
exchange over what Canady said was a clear lie by Clinton, a
statement in his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit that he
could not recall having been alone with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval
Office area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Mr. Craig,'' Canady asked, ``is it your position here
today on behalf of the president that when the president gave those
answers in the deposition, he was telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig replied: ``That's correct, congressman. He answered the
question that it was possible that he was alone with her. This is
in the civil deposition, so all the description that I gave to that
civil deposition is accurate. It was evasive, it was misleading, he
tried to be narrowly accurate, but congressman, he did not violate
his oath.''
</P>
<P>
   An exasperated Canady said, ``It seems to me that the president
unequivocally denied that he had any specific recollection of being
alone with Ms. Lewinsky. And for you to contend today that that's
truthful, I think, is not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   As the damp, dreary day grew dark at mid-afternoon, a few rays
of hope appeared for the White House. Rep. Amo Houghton a moderate
New York Republican, announced that he would oppose impeachment on
the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, a frequent critic of Clinton, said
Tuesday night that the House should heed popular will and refrain
from impeaching the president. D'Amato, who lost a reelection bid
last month, said that tying up the Senate in a trial of Clinton
``doesn't make sense'' for the nation or the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   White House lobbyists also reported progress toward persuading
several other wavering Republicans to vote against any bill of
impeachment that reaches the House next week.
</P>
<P>
   William Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts,
was recruited Tuesday to appear as a witness on the president's
behalf on Wednesday and was reported to be making calls to
Republican friends in Congress to persuade them to vote against
impeachment.

 &HT;    Lawyers go to battle over fees in tobacco settlement
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas' controversial tobacco settlement got more
controversial Tuesday as plaintiffs' lawyers who represented three
states against cigarette makers trained their guns on each other in
an effort to get as much as they can of a $500 million yearly cap
on attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   The swelling dispute grew with reports in two newspapers that
the Texas lawyers _ already vilified by politicians and tort-reform
advocates for seeking as much as $2.6 billion in fees _ were now
seeking 10 times that for their pay.
</P>
<P>
   Texans for Lawsuit Reform, one of several critics of the tobacco
settlement and the lawyers representing the state, called the $25
billion a ``public relations ploy'' to justify the lawyers'
original fees request.
</P>
<P>
   But sources involved on several sides of the tobacco fees fight
said the $25 billion figure was misleading. They said it was only
one projection offered by an independent financial analysis
commissioned by all the plaintiffs' lawyers involved in Texas,
Mississippi and Florida tobacco settlements _ and now scrambling to
get as much from the yearly limit as they can.
</P>
<P>
   In settling lawsuits with 49 states, the tobacco industry capped
at $500 million a year the amount it would pay out in attorney's
fees. So as the arbitrators decide how much tobacco must pay the
lawyers, what goes into one legal team's pocket must come from
another's. The arbitrators' decision could be announced as early as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas followed Mississippi and Florida in first settling a
nationwide assault on the once impregnable U.S. tobacco companies
to recover state payments for treating poor people with smoking
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $25-billion figure is totally ridiculous, totally
misleading,'' said one person who heard presentations last weekend
to three arbitrators chosen to decide how much the tobacco
defendants would pay attorneys who sued them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are jockeying for relative position,'' said of the
lawyers involved.
</P>
<P>
   All parties in the arbitration have agreed to keep their
proposals confidential until the arbitration panel rules. But
sources close to the five Texas lawyers Attorney General Dan
Morales hired to represent Texas _ as well as others without a
stake in the Texas fees _ said the $25 billion represented one
scenario posed by a Yale management professor hired by all private
lawyers in the fees arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Under the financial analysis, prepared by Yale professor William
Getzman and based on common assumptions for all states, Texas
lawyers could get as much as $25 billion over 50 years if
arbitrators were to award them 25 percent of what the state
recovered _ as Florida lawyers seek and as their contract with the
state specifies. Under that scenario, Florida lawyers would get
about $18 billion and Mississippi's lawyers would get $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Getzman would not comment. But one source with direct knowledge
of presentations that arbitrators heard in New York last weekend
said lawyers who represented Mississippi _ the first state to sue
and settle with the tobacco makers _ demanded no less than what
lawyers in any other state got.
</P>
<P>
   Under Getzman's calculations, that would mean Mississippi
lawyers would recover as much as Texas lawyers get and possibly
more than Mississippi _ the client _ got.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the Texas lawyers said their written
proposal to the arbitrators asked for the amount under their
contract with Morales _ 15 percent of the $17.3 billion Texas
recovered in its settlement, or $2.6 billion. But they noted that
they could have asked for more under the contract. The Texas
lawyers noted that their contract with Morales also specified that
they could ask for more than 15 percent if their expenses exceeded
a certain amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News reported that Morales had endorsed to
the arbitrators in New York the Texas lawyers' request for $25
billion. But that was wrong, the attorney general said in a
statement Tuesday. Morales insisted that he told the arbitrators he
supported the 15 percent the lawyers would get under his original
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no role, nor do I have any knowledge about the private
lawyers' arguments using various economic models to inflate the
value of the Texas judgment,'' he said. ``I was not present for
that portion of the panel discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas tobacco lawyers were led by Beaumont attorney Walter
Umphrey and included Harold Nix of Daingerfield, Wayne Reaud of
Beaumont and John Eddie Williams and John O'Quinn, both of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Another source said Getzman's calculations established that
tobacco companies would never pay more than $7 billion for legal
fees in total for all lawyers making claims because of the $500
million-a-year fees limit. Tobacco companies settled with Texas and
all other states but Minnesota by requiring their total obligation
for lawyers' fees could not exceed $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The limit does not have an inflation factor. That means that no
matter how much all attorneys get from arbitrators, the cigarette
companies will pay no more than $500 million each year even as time
reduces how much money is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reduced values of money over time, Getzman calculated
his $7 billion limit on what the tobacco companies would ever pay,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   One source surmised that the tobacco companies were the true
winners in the tobacco cases because of how the companies
structured the settlements to avoid bankruptcy _ and avoid a
bankruptcy trustee's control of their companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only can you live with it,'' he said, ``but you can make
out like a bandit.''

 WASHINGTON: against impeachment.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, after months of bitter name-calling and
diversionary tactics, both sides engaged in a sober debate on the
merits of the case against Clinton. The president's witnesses,
while not answering all the specific factual accusations, presented
a detailed argument as to why the president's offenses were serious
but were not the basis for a constitutional cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the flurry of paper and the cacophony of testimony, Clinton
was silent on all matters legal. He opened a two-day White House
conference on Social Security before flying to Nashville to attend
a memorial service for Albert Gore Sr., the father of the vice
president. He returned to Washington this evening to receive an
award for his peacemaking efforts in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team assembled by the White House offered few new
arguments against impeachment, but there was a discernible shift in
approach. Led by the soothing Craig, the White House witnesses,
with a few pointed exceptions, attempted for the most part a
strategy of apology rather than argument. None raised objections to
the possibility of a Congressional vote of censure as a way of
expressing displeasure short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy League scholars, congressional veterans of the last
impeachment debate and former Watergate prosecutors all carried the
White House message that Bill Clinton is not Richard Nixon and that
sexual misconduct does not constitute a great offense against the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Craig implored members of Congress, and through them a
nationwide cable television audience, to listen to Clinton's case
before deciding on the momentous step of impeaching and removing a
popularly-elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we begin this undertaking,'' Craig said at the outset of
the marathon presentation, ``I make only one plea to you, and I
hope it is not a futile one, coming this late in the process. Open
your mind. Open your heart, and focus on the record. As you sit
there listening to me at this moment, you may already be determined
to vote to approve some articles of impeachment against this
president. That is your right and your duty, if you believe the
facts and the law justify such a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the White House would present a powerful case
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the close of tomorrow, all the world will see one simple
and undeniable fact: whatever there is in the record that shows
that what the president did was wrong and blameworthy, there is
nothing in the record in either the law or the facts, that would
justify his impeachment and removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and its Democratic allies in Congress held out
little hope of averting a committee vote on one or more articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone was expecting any movement from the
members of the committee,'' one White House strategist said
tonight. ``The committee long ago determined they were not going to
be an audience for our defense. That's not who we are addressing
today and tommorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Tuesday offered the 20 to 30 Republicans who
appear to be undecided on impeachment what many of them have
demanded _ more contrition and less legal artifice; more facts in
defense of the president's actions and less spin.
</P>
<P>
   Craig conveyed to the committee what he said was Clinton's
``profound and powerful regret'' for his actions and equivocations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has insisted and personally instructed his lawyers that no
technicalities or legalities should be allowed to obscure the
simple moral truth that his behavior in this matter was wrong,''
Craig said in his opening remarks. ``The president wants everyone
to know _ the committee, the Congress and the country _ that he is
genuinely sorry for the pain and the damage that he has caused and
for the wrongs that he has committed.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone thought that was to be a prelude to a confession
to perjury, obstruction of justice or abuse of power, they were
disappointed. Craig vigorously defended the president's misleading
testimony before a judge in a civil case and a criminal grand jury,
using the same legal contortions that have maddened prosecutors and
Republican opponents all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's testimony was evasive, incomplete, misleading,
even maddening,'' Craig said, ``but it was not perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C.,, tried to pin Craig down on the
president's statements about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he lie?'' when he said that he had not had sex with Ms.
Lewinsky, Inglis repeatedly demanded to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly misled and deceived,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis repeated, ``He doesn't believe that he lied?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he does not believe that he lied, because his notion of
what sex is is what the dictionary definition is,'' Craig answered.
``I understand you're not going to like this, congressman, because
you will see it as a technical defense or a hair-splitting, evasive
answer, but sexual relations is defined in every dictionary in a
certain way, and he did not have that kind of sexual contact with
Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning session before the committee included scholars from
Harvard, Princeton and Yale who had previously expressed opposition
to impeachment, as well as Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who served as
attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Wilentz, professor of American history at Princeton,
angered several Republican members of the committee by warning them
that what he characterized as an unjustified vote to impeach
Clinton would bring them the opprobrium of history.
</P>
<P>
   Wilentz argued that Clinton's alleged offenses _ even if all
were proven true _ do not warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe they do rise to that level, you will vote for
impeachment and take your risk at going down in history with the
zealots and the fanatics,'' Wilentz said. ``If you understand that
the charges do not rise to the level of impeachment, or if you are
at all unsure, and yet you vote in favor of impeachment anyway for
some other reason, history will track you down and condemn you for
your cravenness. Alternatively, you could muster the courage of
your convictions. The choice is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress do not take kindly to such lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., said that he did not appreciate being
called a fanatic and a coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of name-calling by the president's defense is
disappointing and demeaning to this proceeding,'' Buyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach made the point that impeachment was devised by the
authors of the Constitution as a means to remove a president who by
his behavior had so compromised his position that he could not
longer fulfill the functions of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach said that most instances of perjury would not
undermine a president's ability to remain in office. And he noted
that Clinton continued to enjoy high public-approval ratings and
therefore had not squandered his mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am correct, then it seems to me the fundamental question
is simply whether the president has done something which has
destroyed public confidence in his ability to continue in that
office,'' Katzenbach said. ``If the public doesn't believe that
what he has done seriously affects his ability to perform his
public duties as president, should the committee conclude that his
acts have destroyed public confidence essential to that office?''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, professor of law at Yale University, said that
the House was confronted with the question of whether Clinton's
conduct represented ``an assault on the fundamental principles of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it does not, Ackerman added that if such were the
case, ``our history over the last two centuries would be littered
with bills of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman also asserted that any articles of impeachment voted by
the current lame duck Congress would expire when the new Congress
takes office in January. He said that the new Congress, with five
fewer Republicans, would have to vote again on articles of
impeachment before a Senate trial could take place.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars were replaced at the witness table in the afternoon
by three former Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee who
voted to approve articles of impeachment against Nixon in 1974 _
Elizabeth Holtzman of New York, Robert Drinan of Massachusetts and
Wayne Owens of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared as ``the three ghosts of impeachment past,'' as
Owens put it.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan, now a law professor at Georgetown University, called the
drive toward impeachment an act of ``vengeance'' and he predicted
that it would lead to an explosion of anger among the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., thundered, ``Do you seriously believe
that any member of this committee or this House will be driven by
vengeance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave God to judge,'' replied Drinan, a Jesuit priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe God's messenger should not be prejudge that,'' Gekas
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holtzman, who served as U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
after leaving Congress, argued that there is a huge difference
between impeaching one of hundreds of appointed federal judges and
removing from office the nation's lone elected president.
</P>
<P>
   She expanded on her point in response to a question from Rep.
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many on this committee and many in the country
believe the president's conduct to be reprehensible and
unacceptable,'' Ms. Holtzman said. ``I do not disagree, and I'm not
here to excuse that conduct. Let us remember, however, that the
goal of impeachment is not to punish a president but to protect the
nation. Impeachment now will punish the nation, not protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightfall brought the day's two final witnesses, Richard
Ben-Veniste and James Hamilton, prominent Democratic lawyers and
former Watergate prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Veniste criticized Starr for conducting a crusade against
the president and employing relentless and unfair tactics to bring
him down.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who once advised Clinton to aggressively employ all
legal methods to thwart the numerous investigations plaguing his
presidency, said that Clinton's offenses were ``low crimes'' worthy
of censure, not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If all lying politicians were chased from office, Hamilton told
the weary committee, ``I fear the halls of government would be
seriously depleted.''

`AMERICAN SONG,' FROM CALIFORNIA TO THE NEW YORK ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(rl) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hard times that brought America the Depression, the Dust
Bowl, unemployment and war in the 1920s, '30s and '40s are bringing
intelligent, warmly satisfying and touching entertainment to the
stage of Theater 3 in the form of ``Woody Guthrie's American
Song.''
</P>
<P>
   With a talented and versatile handful of singers and musicians,
this production of the Melting Pot Theater in its new home at
Clinton, N.Y., taps the prose and poetry of Woody Guthrie not only
to recall this great folk singer's music but also to evoke _ at a
time of record stock market highs and low levels of unemployment _
an era when one-third of the nation lost home and work and savings
but clung to pride and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   As this musical revue makes its way through more than two dozen
Guthrie songs, it conjures up dust storms, Steinbeck's Okies riding
jalopies and flat-wheeled freight trains west to the dream that was
California, wailing locomotive whistles, hobo camps, lonesome men
trudging the highways through rain-swept nights, and an army of the
dispossessed dreaming of food and a job and a home.
</P>
<P>
   Costumed by Deborah Shaw, these are gallused men in plaid
shirts, eight-piece caps and brown fedoras who welcome a coin
tossed in payment for a song plucked out on a battered guitar, and
women in high shoes and shawls and shirtwaists and skirts singing
as the sun goes down over a hushed jungle camp.
</P>
<P>
   But mixing music and biography, ``Woody Guthrie's American
Song'' also takes its wandering minstrel east to New York in its
second act, into an ambiance of Bowery bars and union militancy and
impending war.
</P>
<P>
   Always there are the stirring songs: ``Bound for Glory,''
``Worried Man,'' ``Ain't Gonna Be Treated This Way,'' ``Pastures of
Plenty'' ``I Ain't' Got No Home,'' ``Union Maid,'' ``Nine Hundred
Miles'' and, of course, ``This Land Is Your Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceived, adapted and directed by Peter Glazer, ``Woody
Guthrie's American Song,'' with orchestrations, vocal arrangements
and musical direction by Jeff Waxman, manages to find both the high
beauty and the earthy humor of Guthrie's love affair with America.
</P>
<P>
   The first-rate cast includes two veterans of the Melting Pot's
memorable production of ``The Portable Pioneer and Prairie Show'':
Sean McCourt (of ``Titanic'') and David Lutken (from ``The Will
Rogers Follies''), who draw most of the assignment of portraying
Guthrie; James Stein Jr. in a variety of roles, and the splendid
Ernestine Jackson and Lisa Asher, who bring their fine voices and
considerable acting skills to a gallery of strong women.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these players are at home on an assortment of
instruments, but Darcie Deaville, Joshus Martin, James David Jacobs
and Waxman, playing at least 15 instruments _ from fiddle and
harmonica to mandolin, bass and guitar _ are not to be overlooked
in this most satisfying homage to Guthrie and edifying lesson in
American history.

<P>
   Texans for Lawsuit Reform, one of several critics of the tobacco
settlement and the lawyers representing the state, called the $25
billion a ``public relations ploy'' to justify the lawyers'
original fees request.
</P>
<P>
   But sources involved on several sides of the tobacco fees fight
said the $25 billion figure was misleading. They said it was only
one projection offered by an independent financial analysis
commissioned by all the plaintiffs' lawyers involved in Texas,
Mississippi and Florida tobacco settlements _ and now scrambling to
get as much from the yearly limit as they can.
</P>
<P>
   In settling lawsuits with 49 states, the tobacco industry capped
at $500 million a year the amount it would pay out in attorney's
fees. So as the arbitrators decide how much tobacco must pay the
lawyers, what goes into one legal team's pocket must come from
another's. The arbitrators' decision could be announced as early as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas followed Mississippi and Florida in first settling a
nationwide assault on the once impregnable U.S. tobacco companies
to recover state payments for treating poor people with smoking
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $25-billion figure is totally ridiculous, totally
misleading,'' said one person who heard presentations last weekend
to three arbitrators chosen to decide how much the tobacco
defendants would pay attorneys who sued them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are jockeying for relative position,'' said of the
lawyers involved.
</P>
<P>
   All parties in the arbitration have agreed to keep their
proposals confidential until the arbitration panel rules. But
sources close to the five Texas lawyers Attorney General Dan
Morales hired to represent Texas _ as well as others without a
stake in the Texas fees _ said the $25 billion represented one
scenario posed by a Yale management professor hired by all private
lawyers in the fees arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Under the financial analysis, prepared by Yale professor William
Getzman and based on common assumptions for all states, Texas
lawyers could get as much as $25 billion over 50 years if
arbitrators were to award them 25 percent of what the state
recovered _ as Florida lawyers seek and as their contract with the
state specifies. Under that scenario, Florida lawyers would get
about $18 billion and Mississippi's lawyers would get $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Getzman would not comment. But one source with direct knowledge
of presentations that arbitrators heard in New York last weekend
said lawyers who represented Mississippi _ the first state to sue
and settle with the tobacco makers _ demanded no less than what
lawyers in any other state got.
</P>
<P>
   Under Getzman's calculations, that would mean Mississippi
lawyers would recover as much as Texas lawyers get and possibly
more than Mississippi _ the client _ got.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the Texas lawyers said their written
proposal to the arbitrators asked for the amount under their
contract with Morales _ 15 percent of the $17.3 billion Texas
recovered in its settlement, or $2.6 billion. But they noted that
they could have asked for more under the contract. The Texas
lawyers noted that their contract with Morales also specified that
they could ask for more than 15 percent if their expenses exceeded
a certain amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News reported that Morales had endorsed to
the arbitrators in New York the Texas lawyers' request for $25
billion. But that was wrong, the attorney general said in a
statement Tuesday. Morales insisted that he told the arbitrators he
supported the 15 percent the lawyers would get under his original
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no role, nor do I have any knowledge about the private
lawyers' arguments using various economic models to inflate the
value of the Texas judgment,'' he said. ``I was not present for
that portion of the panel discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas tobacco lawyers were led by Beaumont attorney Walter
Umphrey and included Harold Nix of Daingerfield, Wayne Reaud of
Beaumont and John Eddie Williams and John O'Quinn, both of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Another source said Getzman's calculations established that
tobacco companies would never pay more than $7 billion for legal
fees in total for all lawyers making claims because of the $500
million-a-year fees limit. Tobacco companies settled with Texas and
all other states but Minnesota by requiring their total obligation
for lawyers' fees could not exceed $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The limit does not have an inflation factor. That means that no
matter how much all attorneys get from arbitrators, the cigarette
companies will pay no more than $500 million each year even as time
reduces how much money is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reduced values of money over time, Getzman calculated
his $7 billion limit on what the tobacco companies would ever pay,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   One source surmised that the tobacco companies were the true
winners in the tobacco cases because of how the companies
structured the settlements to avoid bankruptcy _ and avoid a
bankruptcy trustee's control of their companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only can you live with it,'' he said, ``but you can make
out like a bandit.''

ALL-STAR GAME CANCELED AS SEASON SLIPS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT, Golden State Warriros play in
Oakland, sted San Fran.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time since 1951, there will be no
National Basketball Association All-Star game. It's Day 162 of the
lockout. No new bargaining talks are scheduled. Do you think the
season is in peril?
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the All-Star game, the league's signature
regular-season event, had been expected for a week, but
Commissioner David Stern's announcement on Tuesday revealed the
dire straits the season is in. ``This is just a result of the
inexorable march of the calendar,'' Stern said. ``There just isn't
enough time left to have a season and an All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game had been scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Stern spoke to Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell on Tuesday
morning, and it is possible that Philadelphia would be awarded the
game in 2002. The Golden State Warriors, who play in Oakland,
Calif., will host next season's game, and the 2001 game is likely
to go to the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union executive director, said Tuesday in a
statement: ``Sadly, the owners have elected to cheat millions of
fans and the city of Philadelphia out of a wonderful spectacle.
Unfortunately for the owners, their effort to further intimidate
the players will not succeed. We have already offered unprecedented
concessions and are willing to negotiate even further but we will
only accept a deal that is fair to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners should either come to the table now and negotiate
in good faith to end the lockout or take us up on our offer to
bring in a mediator who will examine the issues from a neutral
perspective and help settle the differences. There is still enough
time to limit the damage caused to our sport but only if the owners
turn constructive rather than destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter last week deemed Jan. 1 as a date in which a deal must be
imminent to salvage the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be right. I don't know,'' NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stern: ``If we and our players, who are ultimately going to
have to work together to rebuild this sport, can't make this deal,
I don't think there is that much hope for the sport itself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Philadelphia officials estimated that the city and its business
will lose out on about $40 million because of the All-Star game's
cancellation. Eighteen hotels, which had set aside more than 5,000
rooms for the league, had expected to make more than $6 million.
Two weeks ago, the league canceled Jam Session, a four-day event of
displays and interactive events linked to the game that had been
expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Philadelphia
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation also will mean a substantial loss in
advertising revenue for NBC and Turner Broadcasting. Last year the
game drew a 10.6 rating, meaning 10.6 million households with
televisions were tuned into the game at New York's Madison Square
Garden. Only the Christmas Day game draws a similar regular-season
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Sports drew a 2.7 rating for its All-Star Saturday show
last season, a rating 1 point higher than its regular season
average of 1.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all other NBA fans, we are disappointed by the
cancellation of the All-Star game,'' said Dick Ebersol, president
of NBC Sports. ``But we continue to be hopeful that an agreement
can be reached and the season will resume next month.''
</P>
<P>
   But both networks have clauses in their contracts with the NBA
to recoup the losses through added games or reduced rights fees in
subsequent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The league did shed some light Tuesday on what kind of season
might be salvaged if an agreement is reached. Granik said the NBA
is willing to extend the playoffs until the end of June, which is
about 10 days later than usual. But they would not go into July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The households using television drops off so dramatically as
you approach July 4 weekend that I don't think that's a realistic
possibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, if a season is held, some of the younger, running
teams in the league may reap immediate benefits. To hold a
representative season, teams may be required to play three nights
in a row. Also, cross-country travel will be significantly cut
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect, that whatever number of games is agreed upon,
you're going to see a conference-type schedule with perhaps some
mix of inter-conference games,'' Granik said. ``But not every team
is going to see every other team at home. I think that's going to
be virtually impossible.''

`CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE': PROVING THAT ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By   D.J.R . BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Denise Stoklos enunciates a program for the new
millennium in her one-woman show ``Civil Disobedience: Morning Is
When I Am Awake and There Is an Aurora in Me.'' But if you ignore
it _ that is quite easy to do _ you are likely to enjoy the
performance much more. The title comes from Thoreau's famous essay,
and Ms. Stoklos' message is that for the next thousand years,
thoughtful people have an obligation to dissent from any idea or
social arrangement that would constrain creative living. She draws
part of her text from Thoreau and ties it into ideas of Brazilian
educator and philosopher Paolo Freire. This would draw you to the
theater?
</P>
<P>
   No. But Ms. Stoklos should. The Brazilian actress, who for 20
years has staged inventions of a bewildering variety in more than
30 countries, is a master of illusion and surprise and has an
irrepressible sense of humor. In ``Civil Disobedience,'' while she
talks about certain of Thoreau's ideas, she gives the impression
that her body has a mind of its own, one bent on sending up the
ideals she is presenting.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Thoreau's declaration that to open people's minds he had no
choice but to write and speak out leads to a riff on Times Square
and its signs _ impressively ridiculed on eight television screens
that appear over her head. She conjures up the scene so well all by
herself that we can practically hear the sounds of traffic and
crowds, and the point of the sudden leap away from the woodsy
solitude of Walden Pond does not have to be labored.
</P>
<P>
   And when Thoreau observes that most lives are simply wasted, the
Stoklos version of waste is a long and hilarious routine of the
actress' putting on makeup, the viewpoint of the audience being
that of the mirror. Ms. Stoklos has a large repertoire of clowns'
tricks to reshape her face, but she also has some that seem
original. With tongue in cheek, or better yet, in upper lip, she
can so completely distort her profile that it is difficult to
believe she is not wearing some kind of hidden prosthesis, or even
a mask. She ends this routine opining that she's lower than a worm
and her exit is a vermicular crawl no human being should be capable
of.
</P>
<P>
   She can also be tartly entertaining about Thoreau's praise of
simple furnishings and such pleasures as the isolation as reading.
Her simple furniture includes, of course, the eight television sets
that are never turned off lest she miss something. And her reading
is one of the more emphatic texts of Gertrude Stein that, in Ms.
Stoklos' exaggeratedly regular rhythms, reduces the audience to
helpless giggling.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly Ms. Stoklos returns to philosophical meditations by
Thoreau and others and seems to be quite serious about them, but
the moment she moves, or looks directly at the audience, her body
completely undermines what her mouth is saying. The whole act is
like a conversation with an inspired lunatic whose skeletal
framework is rubber, not bone. If the coming millennium aspires to
what she does and not what she says it could be paradisal.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: UNFAZED BY EXCESS, PUNDITS CHATTER ON ... AND
ON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The beauty part of the television blowhard's calling
is that you never have to say you're sorry. When you are obliged to
talk as incessantly as demanded by that line of work, especially on
nonstop cable, you are bound to utter foolish, pointless, peculiar
things, and the louder, the more authoritative. But neither excess
nor error nor eccentricity can stay these spouters from their
anointed rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians can be kicked out of office, corporation executives
can lose their perks, athletes can be fined. But the privileged
cadre nicely named the chattering class goes on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Programs that started out as discussions have slid down the
slopes of entertainment into sheer blather. One might have thought
that NBC News worthies would by now have slinked away in chagrin at
the Monica merchandising that has been MSNBC's stock in trade for
months. But no, respectables like Tim Russert are still lending
themselves to that dubious enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The grapplings on CNBC, the Fox Network and elsewhere as
debaters vie in the ferocity stakes are about as reasoned as
wrestling matches. For viewers, the saving grace of a McLaughlin
gang or one of its clones is that half the time you can't make out
what any of them is saying.
</P>
<P>
   Over in more sedate precincts, one might assume that the
remarkably wrong predictions of the regulars on ABC's ``This
Week,'' who announced President Clinton's forced departure from
office a year or so ago, would have earned them a vacation. But
there's Sam Donaldson still delivering bombast and Bill Kristol
indulging in wishful analysis. George Will, who one assumes was
hired to bring a touch of class to the gab, is descending into
vituperation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus do the imperatives of show business impinge on the
discipline of journalism. Call it all talk, rarely listen
television. It's in the nature of a medium that never stops
running; any sound is preferable to the sound of silence.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit blossoms in all its glory on talk shows and call-ins,
but it infiltrates what used to be known as hard-news programs,
too. From the wackiest to the relatively conventional, the people
we are hearing often don't seem to be hearing themselves. Does
anybody care? Polls tell us that the nation doesn't particularly
like or trust journalists, but there's no escape. Nonstop news
abhors a vacuum; the model has become the mayhem of the Internet or
of upchuck radio.
</P>
<P>
   It's head-to-talking-head competition, not over anything as
rarefied as depth or analysis but simply over attention grabbers.
On the networks as well as on cable, Monica Lewinsky guaranteed
ratings; and what was actually heard amid the din was mostly
filler.
</P>
<P>
   The hawkers of those commodities tend to come on loud and fast
and are never caught in the dead air of reflection. Assertions
abound; reservations are risky. A pause for breath may send
millions of viewers to the remote control. So you repeat what you
or somebody said yesterday. If you're really stumped, take a call
from Freddy in Philadelphia. Does anyone notice that the callers
are given to parroting what they have just heard? That would be
like criticizing elevator music on esthetic grounds.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, words of sense do emerge, but they are quickly
drowned in the commotion. It may be imagination, but I think I've
detected more than once a look of alarm as some stunned sobersides
who actually has something original or interesting to say suddenly
realizes that he has accepted an invitation to bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict here is between freedom, or the illusion of
freedom, and responsibility, which brings with it some sort of
control. When communication is reduced to noise and populism runs
rampant, not only is everyone entitled to be heard, but courtesy
requires that all opinions be treated as of like worth. Expertise
becomes window dressing; the experts, too, after all, are competing
for who will be called back; stutterers need not apply.
Credentials, education, knowledge become a form of discrimination.
Standards become stuffy, elitist. Larry King is the great leveler.
</P>
<P>
   The loose-talk formula has appeal; it can be infectious. The
intelligent Will cannot fail to notice that in this contest anybody
can get away with anything; no one is called to account, so why
strain for some rigor of discourse when rival performers are
mouthing off on all sides without nice distinctions that might slow
down the hustle to be first to nowhere? If network news has been
getting soft at the edges, with graphic fripperies and an endless
supply of revelations of medical wonders, that's in part an effort
to keep up with or down with the cable crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In this universe of deafening interactive nonstop hot air,
journalists find themselves in competition not just with their
peers but with everybody. The lately liberated audience members
turn out to have a lot to say and is increasingly insistent on
saying it, and their hosts are in no position to tell them to stuff
it.
</P>
<P>
   A dedication to ratings is democratic, all right, but not a sure
route to information. Becoming informed sometimes requires that one
shut up and listen.

 &HT;    High court decision may affect college sports rules
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Had it been a game, Tuesday's legal argument
about college football before the Texas Supreme Court would have
been an NCAA victory by forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   With the opposition withdrawing from a lawsuit last week, an
Amarillo attorney representing the National Collegiate Athletic
Association played both offense and defense as he tried to persuade
justices to keep a one-time Texas Tech University football player
from being allowed to do an end run around intercollegiate athletic
rules.
</P>
<P>
   What the justices decide could affect whether the NCAA can
sanction a school after an ineligible player gets a court order to
let him play. The Supreme Court made no ruling Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NCAA's rules, it can later sanction a school if the
court order was wrongly granted.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, Tech and its player may have proved more
nimble than the courts. Before any court had a chance to decide if
the order was wrongly granted, the player finished his last season
and the courts dismissed the case as moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for a toothless bylaw if all that has to happen is
for an athlete or a school to go to a friendly court for a
temporary injunction,'' said the NCAA's public relations director,
Wally Renfro. ``It makes it very difficult for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case, the NCAA disqualified Tech football player Joel
Casey Jones when he was a fifth-year senior because of an
eligibility question related to its so-called 75 percent rule. The
rule requires student athletes to have completed three-quarters of
their course work by the ninth semester.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an All-State high school player from the Houston area,
had changed his major and claimed that Tech academic advisers
miscalculated under an NCAA rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tech asked for a waiver, but the NCAA denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones then requested _ and got _ a temporary order from a
Lubbock County state district court judge. The judge allowed Jones
to compete until a trial was held to decide his eligibility. But
the hearing to decide this was put off until the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA tried to get the 7th District Court of Appeals in
Amarillo to overturn the temporary order, but the court decided it
had no authority to hear the case because it was moot: the season
had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Absent that court ruling, the athletic association _ the
rules-making body for most college sports in the United States _
could not enforce its rule and sanction Tech, said Todd Lafferty,
the Amarillo attorney representing the NCAA. The trial judge never
reached that point.
</P>
<P>
   It placed the NCAA in a legal netherworld _ sort of a perpetual
time-out.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court does not overturn the appeals court, Renfro
said, then the NCAA rule that could allow it to force schools to
forfeit games in cases like this would be toothless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no relief,'' he said. ``There's no way to get to it.''
