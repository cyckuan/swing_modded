   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIKE Hampton might have lost the Cy Young Award, but he's about to
win the lottery. Hampy's blue mood soon will fade to green.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros couldn't afford to keep Randy Johnson last autumn,
and so the Big Unit did a Horace Greeley and headed west, where,
yes, he claimed the Cy Young for Arizona that Hampton tried to get
as an Astro. No regrets there, though, even if Johnson's continued
presence in the Astros' rotation would have given the locals the
best starting foursome in baseball, Atlanta or no Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But could said fact have guaranteed the Astros a World Series
berth? Not the way they hit, or didn't, in the postseason. Johnson
wouldn't have bolstered their cause against the Braves any more
than he did the Diamondbacks in their ill-fated series against the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   For the Astros, Johnson's price tag _ $13.1 million average for
1999-02 _ was cost-prohibitive, no matter how amazingly durable his
straw-shaped 36-year-old body proved to be, hardly a given going in
considering his history of back problems.
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros managed smashingly without him, in no small part
because of Hampton's 22 victories against only four defeats.
Johnson might have been the National League's most overpowering
lefthander, but Hampy was easily its most effective in terms of
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   And cost-effectiveness, too. Cripes, the Astros lost only five
of the 34 games he started.
</P>
<P>
   Now reality bites. Although Hampton is under contract through
the 2000 season thanks to a three-year, $12 million deal he signed
in early 1998, the Astros have little choice except to award him a
bountiful extension before spring training. It was about this time
last fall when they did the same for Shane Reynolds, who received
three additional years and lots of additional clams.
</P>
<P>
   Precedent has thus been set in concrete, even though Reynolds
delivered something of a down year after receiving his relatively
modest windfall. It's not an if for Hampton, rather a how long and
a how much.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the former, he figures to be offered the same extra
three years, locking him up through 2003, when he'll be 31, barely
entering his pitcher's prime. As for the latter, well, general
manager Gerry Hunsicker had been sighing about that mystery number
since last spring, before Hampy's near-Cy season. He was aware of
the pitcher's upside potential and was ``worried'' it would be
realized too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it has come to in baseball, with its silly-money
economics. If your responsibilities include the fiscal ones, as do
Hunsicker's, you find yourself in the bizarre position of almost
rooting against your players having exceptional seasons because of
the extreme financial consequences thereof.
</P>
<P>
   In the NL's Cy Young voting, Hampton wound up between Johnson
and Kevin Brown, whose $15 million average salary is the sport's
ultimate excess for the moment, until Ken Griffey Jr. negotiates a
Third World nation GDP-sized deal with his new team.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Brown and Johnson have walked the walk longer than
Hampton, who has just five full seasons behind him. To suggest he
receive something in the range of $13 million to $15 million as
well would be ludicrous. But does $8 million to $10 million per for
the next four seasons seem grossly out of line? No, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Should Hampy deliver a 2000 comparable to his formidable '99,
he'll be worth at least that on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' payroll has risen from $33.6 million in 1995 to
$56.4 million last summer, a 68-percent increase. Yet the latter
figure remains a veritable bargain _ the bloated Rangers bowed out
of the playoffs just as quickly for $80.8 million _ and can be
justified with the significant new revenues Enron Park will
generate.
</P>
<P>
   But at the current pace of inflation, the Enron factor will run
out of gas, so to speak, long before the Astros' 30-year lease
expires. The $92 million the Yankees spent for their World Series
championship in '99 might surpass what the Astros will ever be able
to budget if Drayton McLane Jr. intends to remotely break even on
what remains his worst business decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' most recent payroll was still $2 million less than
what the Yankees forked over in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough part,'' Hunsicker has said, ``is knowing you can
never catch up. Somebody out there will always be raising the bar,
spending more than it's possible for you to consider spending.''
</P>
<P>
   And while dollars dispensed with don't necessarily equate to W's
accumulated _ note the Dodgers ($76.6 million) and the Orioles
($75.4 million) _ the record shows only the fattest of cats have
finished on top each season since Minnesota's seven-game triumph
over the Braves in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Hampy, congratulations. Despite Monday's disappointment,
there will be a hefty pot of gold at the end of your rainbow.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ Dave Bliss could have stayed in the comfort zone at New
Mexico, continuing to coach a winning basketball program in front
of sold-out crowds, then retiring a few years down the road.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sounds like the way to go, doesn't it? A successful man in a
high-profile position who was offered a six-year contract at age 56
to keep doing what he was doing. What corporate executive wouldn't
jump to reach for a pen and put the ink to that deal?
</P>
<P>
   Most of us would take the smooth road and coast home to our
golden years, but Bliss chose a different path. He left the cushy
job to come to Baylor and take over a team that was winless in
conference play last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people say,'' Bliss said. ``They ask me, `Why
would you try this type of a challenge this late in your career?'''
</P>
<P>
   For Bliss, the answer to that question is a simple one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a coach,'' Bliss said. ``If you really love coaching, this
is coaching. You're not dealing with a pat hand. You're working
uphill and exploring new avenues. It's a tremendous challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, coaching is an adventure. We had 11 wonderful years at
New Mexico, but there comes a time in everyone's life when you want
to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baylor opens the regular season Saturday against Eastern
Washington, Bliss will walk onto the court at the Ferrell Center as
the most recognizable coaching hire in school history. Former
football coach Grant Teaff left Baylor as a big name, but he
arrived in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   So expectations are high for a man who takes over a basketball
team that is about as low as it can get after the Bears lost their
final 17 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor fans are desperate for a sign of hope. With the football
team experiencing one of its worst seasons in history, Bliss is
seen as the one person who can bring something positive to the
revenue-generating sports. But he knows he has a daunting task
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt football has struggled, and we probably will
struggle for many of the same reasons. I know people don't want to
hear that, but we probably were worse off than the football team.
We have our work cut out for us, and we have a tough climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is true about any bankrupt company, which we are. We have
to regain self-esteem, but know that it comes without a pity party.
It only comes through hard work. That lesson will help these
players far after their basketball days are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss has been teaching that lesson for 25 years. His head
coaching career started at Oklahoma, where he was the Big Eight
Coach of the Year in 1976 and 1978. His first NCAA Tournament bid
as a coach came at OU in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first year at OU we weren't doing very well,''
Bliss said. ``I was really down, and I thought I would be out of
there the next year and out of coaching, but I guess we're
survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss moved on to SMU to take on a major rebuilding task. He led
the Mustangs to a Southwest Conference title, three NCAA
appearances and one NIT bid in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``SMU was down,'' Bliss said. ``But we took it further down
before we got it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss moved on to New Mexico and guided the Lobos to seven NCAA
Tournament appearances in 11 seasons, but his record the last four
years really tells the story. New Mexico won at least 24 games and
reached the second round of the NCAAs in each of those seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave is his own person with his own style,'' said New Mexico
athletic director Rudy Davalos. ``But you can't fault him on
anything he did here.''
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and Bliss' teams have made 11 NCAA Tournament
appearances in his 24 seasons as a head coach. If you ask him to
name one person who is most responsible for his coaching success,
Bliss doesn't hesitate. That man is Indiana coach Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss started his coaching career as an assistant under Knight
at Army in 1967. He coached under Knight for four seasons at
Indiana before taking the head coaching job at OU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave is a very bright guy,'' Knight said. ``But what sets him
apart is his ability to see things differently. He understands that
different players have different needs. He is able to evaluate
people quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss said he has never heard Knight say those things about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, all I heard usually was him yelling at me,'' Bliss said.
``I'm kidding, but really he's like an older brother to me. I
talked to him on the phone last week, and he asked me how we were
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is I wouldn't be in coaching and I wouldn't be a lot
of things if it hadn't been for Bob Knight. Because of him, I've
been able to make a life out of a game. Outside of my parents, he
probably has had more to do with helping me than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Personality-wise, Bliss and Knight are quite different. Bliss
doesn't throw chairs, doesn't have a fiery disdain for the media
and doesn't have the cantankerous demeanor of his mentor. But Bliss
said he does have some fundamental beliefs that came from Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who have worked under him learned a respect for
certain things,'' Bliss said. ``You learn about things important in
all walks of life, like hard work, organization and priorities. And
in basketball you learn about shot selection, not beating yourself,
maximum effort and preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss is trying to teach those things to a Baylor team that shot
only 35.8 percent and averaged 17 turnovers in Big 12 play last
season. But the players feel Bliss can put them on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a special chemistry that coach Bliss has brought to
the team,'' said guard Tevis Stukes. ``Everyone can see it, so
we're all accepting our roles in his system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Bliss is a winner,'' said guard DeMarcus Minor. ``He's
won everywhere he's been. Shoot, if you can win at SMU, you can win
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss has not had a losing season since 1982 at SMU. It would
take a miraculous turnaround to avoid a losing season this year at
Baylor with a team that was 6-24 last year and has only nine
scholarship players. It could be a tough transition, but Bliss is
optimistic about the future of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big 12 is a terrific conference,'' Bliss said. ``Granted,
we're at the bottom right now, but Texas is a can-do place. The
spirit of this state is a philosophy that all things are possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has good players. Last year at New Mexico, four of our
five starters were from Texas and seven of our 12 players were
Texans. When I was at Oklahoma, Barry Switzer taught me to go to
Texas for players, and I never forgot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss had a chance to return to Texas in the spring of 1998 when
he talked to Texas A&AMP;M officials about the Aggies' job, but he
opted to stay at New Mexico when forward Kenny Thomas told Bliss he
would return for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss was tendered a new six-year deal at New Mexico before the
start of last season, but he never signed the contract. He had
decided he was ready for a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Baptist, I thought that I might end my career coaching
at a small church school,'' Bliss said. ``I just happened to pick
the largest Baptist university in the world.''

COMMENTARY: WHEN DOES A MISTAKE MUTATE INTO A GAFFE?
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has now joined a long list of
politicians who must cope with nagging bloopers. Asked recently by
a television journalist to name the leaders of Taiwan, Chechnya,
India and Pakistan, Bush managed only one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two weeks after that embarrassing exchange, Bush finds
questions about his foreign policy expertise lingering on as fodder
for Letterman and Leno. In his latest explanation, Bush told Matt
Lauer on NBC's ``Today'' show on Tuesday that he should have
handled the picky questions the way Bill Bradley, the Democratic
presidential candidate, did. That is, he should have responded that
he was ``not going to play pop quizzes'' and talked instead about
``how I intend to keep the peace.'' He used these phrases twice,
almost word for word, in the same interview, showing that he now
has a well-rehearsed answer to a question that he will hear from
time to time for the rest of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that most Americans would not do well naming
foreign leaders, the flunking of his mini-exam plays into the
concern that as a governor, Bush is under-informed about global
issues. ``A blooper sticks around if it reinforces a pretty solid
perception,'' said Robert Neuman, a Democratic media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be fair, but it is a hazard faced by most
first-time presidential candidates. Some of them discover,
painfully, that for all the long hours and hard work on any
campaign, a wounding gaffe can take place in a few unguarded
seconds. Fans and supporters often quickly forgive their
candidate's human failings. But for the media and the distant
public, an important _ or merely memorable _ mistake dangles from a
candidate's image like a noisy tin can, adding its dissonant clank
no matter what political music is being orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   Take the word ``potato,'' which has trailed former Vice
President Dan Quayle ever since he corrected a New Jersey student
in 1992 by adding an ``e'' at the end. Nothing short of a Nobel
Prize or a membership in Mensa would have erased that scarlet ``e''
from Quayle's record. The reason was that the public already had a
faint suspicion that the Indiana Republican was light in the
substance area. Similarly, the worry that the 1996 Republican
presidential nominee Bob Dole was too old at 73 expanded full-blown
into public debate when Dole mentioned the Brooklyn Dodgers, 39
years after the team had moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some gaffes last because they confirm our worst suspicions.
Others linger because they suggest something totally unsuspected.
When Jimmy Carter, a born-again Christian, admitted in Playboy
magazine in 1976 that he had ``committed adultery in my heart many
times,'' the verbal picture occupied cartoonists and gag writers
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Visual blunders can also be durable, especially when they come
at a photo opportunity arranged by the campaign. The Democratic
candidate Michael Dukakis went into the gaffers' hall of fame in
1988 when he donned a helmet and rode in an Army tank to boost his
image with the military. Unfortunately, the effect was less George
Patton than George Will.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the slips are verbal. In its latest issue,
George magazine has come up with its top 10 doozies, including one
from Thomas Dewey's whistle-stop tour in 1948. His train suddenly
started moving before the New York Republican, standing on the rear
platform, had finished his speech. Dewey could be heard shouting:
``What's the matter with that lunatic engineer? The man should be
shot at sunrise.'' Unfortunately, the candidate was speaking to an
audience of railroad workers. Similarly, in 1964 the Republican
nominee, Barry Goldwater, said at one point during his campaign
that ``This country would be better off if we could saw off the
Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mistakes, like Gerald Ford's 1976 declaration that ``there
is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe,'' land heavily on a
campaign. But some candidates get lucky. Sen. John McCain of
Arizona cracked a very tasteless joke recently about Chelsea
Clinton that might have blighted his reputation with women. But
McCain's contrarian image seems to be working, for the moment at
least, as a protective shield. Others carefully offend the right
audiences. When Richard Nixon's running mate Spiro Agnew said, ``if
you've seen one city slum, you've seen them all,'' he horrified
voters around the country. Most, however, were Democrats who were
never going to vote for him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even political pros are not always sure what makes a mistake
into a gaffe that never goes away. The half-life of a blooper
``depends on how many people are out there to getcha,'' says Jody
Powell, who was Carter's press secretary. Ronald Reagan's former
political adviser Lyn Nofziger adds that it also depends on how
long it takes to admit you got it wrong. ``President Reagan made
some awful bloopers, but he got away with it because it's all in
the way you handle it. If you don't try to duck and dodge and just
say I screwed up, people accept that,'' Nofziger says.
</P>
<P>
   If self-deprecation heals a self-inflicted wound, Bush is good
at such humor. He has been joking about the test ever since he
failed it, telling Lauer that he scored a 25. But the Texas
governor was also ready with answers on Russia, China, the World
Trade Organization and NATO. Maybe he failed the first foreign
policy pop quiz, but Bush clearly seems to have been studying for
the next one.

SIERRA CLUB LAUNCHES EFFORT TO PROTECT LEWIS AND CLARK TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Almost 200 years after Meriwether Lewis and William
Clark opened the American West, a major environmental group is
starting a campaign to preserve still-intact wildlands along their
routes, from a Nebraska prairie to the Columbia River estuary.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club has identified 34 sites, most in public
ownership, that it wants to keep from development as a true
celebration of the upcoming anniversary of the 1804-1805
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis and Clark's mission was to explore the lands of the
Louisiana Purchase and beyond to the Pacific. ... Our mission is to
protect their legacy, the wildlands and wildlife we have left,''
Sierra Club President Chuck McGrady said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the current Congress reluctant to create new parks and
wilderness areas, the Sierra Club will take its case to the public
with TV and radio announcements, a hikers guide, a series of
outdoor trips and even a toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its proposals _ such as breaching four dams on the Snake
River _ are certain to be highly controversial with irrigators,
loggers, power utilities and livestock owners associations.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the places proposed for protection in the club's
``Wild America'' campaign are in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. They
are, in some cases, many miles distant from the actual route taken
by the explorers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the famed antelope range of Steens Mountain is
near the Oregon-Nevada state line, more than 100 miles south of any
place where Lewis and Clark set foot.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is the small population of grizzly bears that
survives in the Cabinet Mountains of northwest Montana, far to the
west and on the other side of the Continental Divide from the
return route taken by Lewis in 1806.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether these places were exactly on the route is not the
point. What is important is for Americans now and for centuries to
come to experience the wildlands at which (Lewis and Clark)
marveled, and preserve a remnant of the wildlife they saw,'' said
Jim Young, the Sierra Club's deputy Northwest representative.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Clark encountered an Edenlike land as their Corps of
Discovery moved up the Missouri River in 1804. They were
ambassadors of American business and expansion, and marveled at the
wildness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``So magnificent a scenery in a country thus situated far
removed from the Sivilised (sic) world to be enjoyed by nothing but
the buffalo, elk, deer and bear in which it abounds ...,'' Clark
wrote in July of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The great American prairie has largely disappeared. Only about
550,000 undeveloped areas of grasslands remain across the West,
most of it in federally owned patches over 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement of the West, and exploitation of its vast resources,
would radically reduce the ``immence (sic) herds of buffalo, elk,
deer and antelopes feeding in one common and boundless pasture'' of
which Lewis wrote in his journal on an April day in 1805.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy million wild buffalo once roamed the Great Plains. By
1883, only 50 remained alive. At present, about 200,000 buffalo
live on the plains. Perhaps one-tenth that number are wild, much of
the population in Yellowstone National Park and a few patches of
refuge and parkland in the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   The grizzly bear ranged from coastal Oregon and California to
the plains of Nebraska. The bears numbered as many as 100,000;
today, fewer than a thousand survive in the Lower 48.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Clark ate their first salmon soon after crossing the
Continental Divide at Lemhi Pass, on what is now the boundary
between Idaho and Montana. They marveled at the great Indian
fishing encampment at Celilo Falls, alongside what Lewis described
as a Columbia River ``crowded with salmon.'' They survived on
salmon through a rainy winter encampment at Fort Clatsop.
</P>
<P>
   The upper Salmon River country of Idaho remains nearly as wild
now as it was then. But the great fish runs have disappeared from
the river, largely as a result of four dams built far downstream on
the Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   Celilo Falls, once the largest native meeting ground in the
West, was drowned long ago by The Dalles Dam. Sixteen million
salmon returned annually to the Columbia River when Lewis and Clark
passed through. Today, at most 2 million enter the river, less than
a half-million of them wild stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The public's interest in the epic, 8,000-mile Lewis and Clark
journey has soared, particularly since publication of Stephen
Ambrose's book ``Undaunted Courage'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The famed historian was inspired to write by a series of
life-transforming experiences that began with a canoe trip up the
Missouri River in 1976, at Lemhi Pass where Ambrose's family and a
group of his students from the University of New Orleans celebrated
America's bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service estimates that as many as 25 million
Americans will retrace part of the Lewis and Clark Trail during the
five years leading up to the expedition's 200th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The half-million-member Sierra Club has targeted places that
convey the images recorded nearly two centuries ago by Lewis and
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota and Nebraska, the club wants the last
free-flowing stretches of the Missouri River to be designated as
``wild and scenic.'' The river has been turned into four reservoirs
upstream in South Dakota, and downstream has been dredged into
shipping channels.
</P>
<P>
   A similar designation is being sought for the 51-mile-long
Hanford Reach in Washington state, the last free-flowing stretch of
the Columbia River between the Bonneville Dam and the Canadian
border. It is home to the river's only big, healthy wild salmon
run.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, the Sierra Club is supporting partial removal of
four Army Corps of Engineers dams on the lower Snake River as a way
of returning salmon to their wild habitat upstream in the
Snake-Salmon river system.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern Oregon, the Sierra Club would have Steens Mountain
designated as a national monument and protected from the
overgrazing and unregulated use of off-road vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The club would block a proposed mine in the Cabinet Mountains,
and curtail timber cutting in the heavily logged Yaak River valley
of northern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wild America'' campaign faces an uphill battle. Except for
along the Washington and Oregon coasts, the areas proposed for
protection fall within the congressional districts of legislators
who support continued logging, mining and oil and gas leasing. In
Montana and Idaho, a decade-old impasse between conservationists
and pro-development interests has blocked passage of statewide
wilderness bills _ proposals that include several areas singled out
in the Sierra Club campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lewis and Clark anniversary could very well create a
public climate for preservation. ``The Sierra Club is seizing this

AUCTION SETS RECORDS FOR 18 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices for artworks made in the last 30 years were so
high at Christie's Tuesday night that it seemed as if a bubble were
getting ready to burst. Bidders acted like spoiled children,
consistently ignoring the estimates and paying whatever it took to
outpace the competition, even though many works had been up for
auction in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of contemporary art totaled $13.2 million, above
Christie's high estimate of $12.8 million. Of the 60 lots offered,
56 found buyers. Records were set for 18 artists, ranging from Jeff
Koons to Chuck Close to Damien Hirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of an unhealthy market,'' said Edward
Nahem, a Manhattan dealer. ``There's just too much money around.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the evening's catalog featured Jeff Koons' ``Pink
Panther,'' a porcelain sculpture of a semi-nude blonde hugging the
cartoon character. Five bidders sought the work, which finally sold
to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.8 million, more than
twice its high estimate of $800,000. The seller was believed to be
Kent Logan, the San Francisco collector.
</P>
<P>
   Another telephone bidder bought Chuck Close's ``Cindy II''
(1988), a portrait of the photographer Cindy Sherman. Estimated at
$600,000 to $800,000, it sold for $1.2 million after five bidders
vied for it. The painting had sold for $231,000 at Sotheby's in
1992. Tuesday night's price was a record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were on the results of the work of two British artists,
Rachel Whiteread and Hirst, who are currently represented in the
Brooklyn Museum's ``Sensation'' exhibition. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who deemed the show offensive, tried to cut off city support to the
museum and threatened to evict it from its city-owned building. He
also questioned the financial interest behind the show, since
Christie's had donated $50,000 toward the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Did Christie's investment paid off? It's hard to say. Ms.
Whiteread had one piece in Tuesday night's sale: ``Untitled (Three
Tables),'' a 1996 plaster floor piece being sold by Gerald
Fagginato, the London dealer. Estimated at $100,000 to $150,000, it
went to an unidentified telephone bidder for $112,500.
</P>
<P>
   The sale included five works by Hirst, known for submerging dead
animals in formaldehyde. They performed well, but not so
spectacularly as many other works Tuesday night. The five are all
from different periods in his career. Three had been on the market
within the last 18 months, but that didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Way'' (1990-91) _ one of the artist's well-known
pharmaceutical works, actually a medicine cabinet filled with old
drug bottles _ set a record for the artist. Estimated at $250,000
to $350,000, it sold to an unidentified bidder for $354,500. Just
last year, it was sold at Sotheby's for $262,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loss of Memory Is Worse than Death,'' a 1994 piece consisting
of a steel cage filled with formaldehyde containers, masks, gloves
and a syringe, was estimated at $120,000 to $180,000. Simon de
Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe who is now a
private dealer in Geneva, bought the work for $178,500 _ quite a
handsome price, considering that it failed to sell at Christie's in
London in October 1998, when the estimate was $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hirst that didn't sell last year but soared above its
high estimate Tuesday night was ``Alone Yet Together,'' a 1993 wall
piece consisting of 100 dead fish floating in individual glass
blocks filled with formaldehyde. Estimated at $180,000 to $250,000,
it sold to de Pury for $277,500. Last year in London, it carried an
estimate of $170,000 to $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dead Head,'' a photographic self-portrait of Hirst at age
16 posing with a severed human head, was estimated at $25,000 to
$35,000. It sold to a telephone bidder for $74,000.
``N-(9-Acridinyl) Maleimide,'' from 1992, one of the artist's dot
paintings, was expected to bring $150,000 to $200,000; a telephone
bidder paid $173,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most exciting moment in the sale came when Martin
Kippenberger's ``Untitled'' (1998) went on the block. The painting,
showing a man dressed only in boxer shorts looking at himself in a
bubble-like mirror, was estimated at $40,000 to $60,000. Seven
bidders wanted it badly. When the bidding reached $500,000, the
audience began laughing in disbelief. It finally went to an
unidentified telephone bidder for $717,500, a record for the
artist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another huge price was paid for a 1986 ``Last Supper'' from Andy
Warhol's famous series of reflections on Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last
Supper'' (1495-97), based on reproductions of that famous image
rather than the image itself. Estimated at $400,000 to $600,000, it
sold to another telephone bidder for $772,500.
</P>
<P>
   The sale included property from several collections, among them
the O.R.S., Doron Sebbag Art Collection, owned by Tel Aviv art
patrons who support the Israel Museum. The first 12 lots in the
sale came from this collection, emphasizing both portraiture and
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The first lot was Thomas Struth's ``Musee du Louvre 4, Paris,
1989,'' a photograph of visitors to the Louvre stopping in front of
Gericault's ``Raft of the Medusa.'' Estimated at $30,000 to
$40,000, it sold for $178,500, a record for the artist, to Perry
Rubenstein, a Manhattan dealer. In May 1997, Sotheby's sold the
work for $39,100 in an auction of works from the Boston Children's
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The O.R.S., Doron Sebbag Collection also included works of
German artists like Gerhard Richter and Georg Baselitz. Richter's
``Gilbert, George (381-1,2),'' from 1975, a pair of blurred
paintings taken from photographs of the artist team Gilbert and
George, was estimated at $300,000 to $400,000; it sold to Anthony
d'Offay, a London dealer, for $431,500. In 1996, Christie's in
London had sold the work for $175,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the evening's few casualties was Bruce Nauman's ``First
Hologram Series: Making Faces (F,G)'' and ``Second Hologram Series:
Full Figures Poses (B).'' These three holographic images on glass,
from 1968-69, were expected to bring $200,000 to $300,000, but
nobody was interested and bidding stopped at $170,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, prices were stronger than many
dealers would have liked. A Charles Ray drawing, ``Untitled,'' of
an enraged Superman purposely rendered in the comic-book style of
Roy Lichtenstein, sold for $189,500, more than four times its high
estimate of $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemarie Trockel, the German-born artist whose work was
represented in this year's Venice Biennale, was included in Tuesday
night's sale. Her sculpture of a bronze deer lying on its side,
expected to bring $50,000 to $70,000, was sold to de Pury for
$85,000, a record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were paying a lot of money for talent that hasn't been
proven, while the classics are often being overlooked,'' said Marc
Selwyn, a Los Angeles dealer, leaving the sale Tuesday night. ``It
all seemed out of kilter.''

SPREWELL LEADS KNICKS TO 102-95 VICTORY OVER NUGGETS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Latrell Sprewell shook off his shooting slump on
Tuesday night and stepped into a mesmerizing zone that helped pull
the New York Knicks out of a dire situation. With his fists pumping
and his teeth gritted, Sprewell's burst of energy and 26 points
helped the Knicks break a three-game losing streak with a 102-95
victory over the Denver Nuggets at the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for a week with his shot, Sprewell shrugged off
a 1-for-4 start and came out invigorated in the second half. It was
almost a flashback to the game against Chicago in the first week of
the season. With his team lagging, Sprewell scored 16 points in the
third quarter and sustained his energy in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Sprewell supplied his team with oxygen. Suddenly,
everyone was alive and ready to hold off Denver's late surge. There
was Allan Houston putting down a key 3-pointer and the limping
Marcus Camby converting a 3-point play in the closing minutes of a
tight game.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell also had a couple of timely steals and nifty passes to
complete a dominant performance.
</P>
<P>
   His exuberance nearly got the best of him in the fourth quarter.
He had four fouls when a turnover was converted into a fast-break
dunk by Ron Mercer. As Sprewell ran with Mercer stride for stride,
he could not help fouling Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-point play not only left Sprewell with his fifth foul, but
it also gave life to a Nuggets team that seemed destined for a
double-digit loss, down by 89-80 before the play.
</P>
<P>
   After the Nuggets pulled within 5, Sprewell atoned with
back-to-back jumpers to give the Knicks (5-4) breathing room.
Houston added 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets were not considered a threat, but that did not
prevent Coach Jeff Van Gundy from calling an impromptu practice on
Monday, the Knicks' travel day. This was not about Denver, but more
a manifestation of Van Gundy's growing concern with a team that
started the season 3-0, but had dropped four of five games before
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well in the fourth quarter in Minnesota,'' he
said. ``And in Boston, we didn't play great. But we had a
commitment to winning. Against Miami, we didn't show a commitment
to winning, and that's what has disappointed all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the loss to the Heat on Sunday would wake up the Knicks.
If so, it wasn't apparent early against the Nuggets on Tuesday
night as the Knicks trailed at the half, 48-46. It took Sprewell,
snapping out of his recent shooting slump, to inject some energy
into the team with a third-quarter scoring binge. Similar to the
pick-me-up he gave the Knicks in the second game of the season in
Chicago, Sprewell was unstoppable as he slashed to the basket and
pulled up for his off-kilter jumpers, hitting five of his first six
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's 16-point third-quarter effort helped the Knicks forge
a 74-70 lead after three periods. But this was a resilient Denver
team; young and athletic, the Nuggets were fresher and livelier in
their pursuit of every loose ball in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   On one sequence in the second quarter, Mercer put up a jumper
over Houston that missed. The ball was batted back out by Antonio
McDyess and bounced around the floor in front of three Knicks
before George McCloud swept in and picked up the loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   He fired a pass to Raef LaFrentz, who dunked and drew a third
foul on Chris Childs. This hustle play gave the Nuggets, who had
trailed by 9 points in the second quarter, a 41-39 lead with 2:51
left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Denver maintained that edge until the intermission. Although the
Knicks hit 54 percent of their shots against a team that lives near
the bottom of the league in defense, they were outrebounded, 23-17,
turned the ball over nine times and made just 6 of 11 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets were shooting poorly from the field at 40 percent,
but went to the free-throw line 21 times, leaving the Knicks in
foul trouble up and down their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   About the only player clicking for the Knicks was John Wallace,
who had 12 first-half points. The rest were still struggling with
the issues that had haunted them over the last week, like
Sprewell's shooting problems.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous four games, Sprewell had shot 32 percent. On
Tuesday night, he began 1 for 4. He was missing everything,
including his pull-up jumper that kept rattling off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get discouraged,'' Sprewell said before the game.
``Just got to keep trying.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did. With the Knicks trailing by 8 early in the second
half, Sprewell went on a tear. On his way to hitting five of his
first six shots, he had two steals to help the Knicks go take a
66-65 lead with three minutes left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell picked a good time to go on a roll. As much of a team
player as Sprewell has been, the Knicks need him to score with so
many of their other options ailing. Larry Johnson has not been
effective since back spasms put him on the bench last week. And
Camby spent most of tonight limping and grimacing from the
tendinitis in his left knee.

BEHIND APPLE CUP HYPE LURKS AT LEAST ONE PRAGMATIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The sentimentality of Apple Cup week always evokes
some slop about final runs down stadium tunnels, senior-class
salutes and reflections about grand victories and agonizing losses.
</P>
<P>
   That works for a lot of fans and some former players. But there
are some in purple, such as Lester Towns, for whom the career
climax Saturday is unlikely to evoke industrial-grade wistfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' the Huskies senior linebacker and
tri-captain said. ``After the game, I'll be more emotional if Cal
beats Stanford. But you know, I've been here long enough. I got a
degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I'm ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Towns is a pragmatic, even melancholy, fellow not easily given
to gee-whiz soliloquies about Old Siwash. Nor is he likely to wax
rhapsodic to any reporter looking for tender anecdotes about his
tiny sanctions-compromised class, among whom there are just seven
others who will start Saturday against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as close as you might think _ not any closer than a
big class,'' he said. Then he laughed. ``We don't sit around and
drink tea and talk about things that happened our freshman year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a class limited to a maximum 15 scholarship athletes by the
1993 Pac-10 sanctions, Towns and his remaining peers know their
station in the cold business of big-time college sports.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, the business also included a head-coaching change
that outsiders have readily accepted as necessary and beneficial.
For insiders such as Towns, something was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to finish with the same coach,'' he said, without
rancor. ``He knows you. You get a new coach in here who doesn't
know you, and you don't really get to know him until halfway
through the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Towns misses his old linebackers coach, the garrulous Dick
Baird, a longtime player favorite under the tenures of Don James
and Jim Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know my position coach (Tim Hundley) half as well as I
knew Coach Baird, who I had for four years,'' said Towns, one of 10
starters on the defense from California. ``I think (a close
relationship) helps, especially coming from out of state. Without
family here, the transition is kind of hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position coach is someone you talk to every day. The head
coach, you hardly ever talk to. The position coach is more involved
with your life, helping you out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard to do with new coaches coming in. I think they
should take time to get to know players.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Towns and other loyalists, Lambright's
post-bowl firing and Neuheisel's hasty hiring left little time for
pleasantries. If the coaches didn't even bother to read the NCAA
rulebook, a gaffe that brought about minor sanctions, the works of
Miss Manners received no attention.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching change also brought change to the player hierarchy
favored by Lambright, who valued loyalty and seniority above all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors have always been captains here, but now we have
sophomores and freshmen standing up at meetings,'' he said. ``You
look at them and say, `Who are you? You haven't been here long
enough.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our seniors deserve to play more. If you're not
playing as a senior, that's sad. At least, special teams or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult change for Towns has been himself. After a
much-chronicled foot injury following his impressive sophomore
year, he hasn't been the same player. At 6-foot-3 and 240 pounds,
he's still the strongest Husky in uniform, one of the strongest
ever at Washington, but the speed and quickness that distinguished
him have diminished. Instead, there is sometimes a limp.
</P>
<P>
   The agents who inquired two years ago when he was going to turn
pro have stopped calling.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had evaluated his pro potential, a chagrined
Towns said, ``I don't know. I'm kind of scared to. Last year being
injured, this year not having a great year ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how my injuries hold up. I try not to get
injured. Once I do get a chance, I think everything will be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The glorious career that was mapped out in Towns' mind never
quite materialized. But he knows college football dreams don't come
with guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   And for the grunts of the industry, the players, it sometimes
doesn't come with a lot of sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how I'm going to feel when I get dressed and
they call my name the last time,'' he said, smiling. ``It's been
fun, and I might think I'll miss it. But who knows, I might get
drafted by the Seahawks and end up back here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fun, some fame and a college degree _ not to mention an
education. Towns learned when to move on and how to be OK with it.

   TEXT STARTS RIGHT HERE  &UR; KC-Heaster-Column _ Business  &UR; Aspiring
Royals owner Miles Prentice deserves respect
</P>
<P>
   By JERRY HEASTER
</P>
<P>
   Knight-Ridder Newspapers KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Is aspiring Royals
owner Miles Prentice going against the folk wisdom of the song that
admonishes gamblers to ``know when to hold 'em, know when to fold
'em, know when to walk away''?
</P>
<P>
   If so, is his apparently quixotic effort to keep his purchase
bid alive jeopardizing Kansas City's big-league baseball status and
its future economic potential in the bargain?
</P>
<P>
   The early reaction of some pundits hereabouts seems to be yes to
both questions. No sooner had Prentice vowed not to be deterred by
his rebuff at the hands of baseball's reigning moguls than some
fellow opinionmeisters began a spirited campaign to banish Prentice
to outside the pale.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a couple of years makes. It seems like
yesterday when the amiable New York lawyer arrived to begin his
one-man crusade to form a local ownership group to purchase the
Royals. He quickly won the hearts of Kansas City, and against long
odds recruited a platoon of affluent Kansas Citians willing to pony
up enough cash to bid for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice worked hard, played by the rules and showed the
patience of Job at every exasperating turn. His efforts were
rewarded by a boorish kiss-off from Major League Baseball's owners,
who rejected him without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone expected Prentice and his prospective ownership team to
capitulate, but they aren't going down without a fight. All of
which raises the question of whether their hard-nosed reaction
jeopardizes the future of big-league baseball in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to see how it could. If Prentice is willing to go
through the agony of resubmitting his bid, this shouldn't
discourage others from bidding. David Glass has emerged as the
seeming consensus candidate to save the hometown nine, and his
entry to the lists would be welcomed by many.
</P>
<P>
   It's his call, though, and if Glass wants to go for it,
Prentice's group shouldn't be viewed as anything more than a
competitive factor. It's as simple as Glass removing himself as a
Royals transition steward and initiating his own bid. He surely
must know by now that those who misjudged him before will never
again question his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Kansas City should show some class when it comes to
the way it treats Prentice and his group. Prentice performed a
valuable community service, not only by putting together a local
team of prospective buyers, but also by helping rally the community
around the Royals when a valid rallying point was badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dump Miles'' and ``hug David'' approach is unfair to both
Prentice and the area residents who threw their support behind his
effort to sustain the team's status as community property. In being
too quick to dismiss Prentice and his local partners, we risk
sullying our image in much the same way baseball owners did theirs
in the classless way they blew off the Prentice partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever develops, though, the critical consideration is
ensuring the Royals' continued presence in Kansas City. There is a
body of scholarship claiming to prove big-league sports aren't
meaningful contributors to a community's economic dynamism. Anyone
who believes this, however, fails to appreciate what differentiates
Kansas City from, say, Omaha or Des Moines.

ECONOMIC GOOD TIMES EXPECTED TO LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Chris Sieroty 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southern California's economic good times should continue over
the next two years but at a slightly slower growth rate than the
region has enjoyed since the mid-1990s, a survey to be released
today predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by the Southern California Association
of Governments, also predicts the regional economy will outperform
the nation's economy over the next two years as measured by job
creation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the area -- comprising Imperial, Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties --
will add jobs at a rate of 2.8 percent this year, followed by 2.6
percent in 2000, and 2.3 percent in 2001. The study is the first
comprehensive attempt by the regional planning agency to conduct a
two-year forecast for the six-county area.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that construction, services, state and
local government and wholesale trade sectors are all expected to
continue to experience growth during the next two years but at a
slightly slower rate than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The service sector, for example, is expected to slow down over
the next two years, but growth is forecast to remain impressive
with increases of 3.5 percent in 2000 and 3.1 percent in 2001,
after rising 3.7 percent this year. In Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, the growth in service jobs will outpace the region's with
4 percent this year, another 4 percent in 2000 and 3.7 percent in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The report underscores the impressive rebound that Southern
California has achieved from the severe recession in the early part
of this decade. The region's economic recovery began in late 1994
and SCAG's figures show that after several years of moderate
growth, the regional economy began to grow outpace the nation in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey attempts to gauge the economic picture of the
region to help businesses who are contemplating moving to Southern
California or expressing a desire to leave the area,'' said Bruce
F. DeVine, chief economist with SCAG.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed employment in state and local government
will continue to increase because of improving financial conditions
and continued hiring by local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Inland Empire, for example, state and local government
employment is expected to grow by 4.3 percent next year and 3.8
percent by 2001. By comparison, similar jobs in Los Angeles County
will grow by only 2.3 percent in 2000 and 2.4 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report shows that times are good but we need to plan for
the future to deal with the problems of transportation, housing
affordability and availability,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist
with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser also said local governments and businesses need to
re-examine their planning despite the inclination of many people to
avoid thinking about the future when times are good.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that for the second consecutive year,
construction was the fastest-growing sector in the six-county
region with 20,000 new jobs added during the first two quarters of
1999. The survey attributed the increase in construction employment
to an exceptionally strong housing market, driven by low mortgage
rates, continued asset growth and healthy gains in employment and
income.
</P>
<P>
   The survey predicts that regional payroll will grow at an
average rate of 2.1 percent over the next five years. Total payroll
in Ventura County is expected to increase by 1.7 percent next year,
while payroll growth in Los Angeles will slide from 1.9 percent
this year to 1.4 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Imperial County payroll employment is expected to increase 1.4
percent next year, while Orange County's payroll employment is
expected to grow at a 2.8 percent rate in 2000 and 2.6 percent the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in payroll will translate into relatively low
unemployment figures for the region. The average jobless rate in
Southern California is expected to be 5.5 percent in 1999 and 6.1
percent next year and 5.9 percent in 2001, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County, which accounted for half of the 182,000 jobs
added to the Southern California region so far this year, is
projected to have an average unemployment rate of 2.8 percent in
1999 and 3 percent next year. The low figures mean a continued
tight labor market for the county, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``2000-2001 Regional Economic Forecast for Southern
California,'' is a combination of two regional forecasts from
California State Universities Long Beach and Fullerton, DeVine
said. He added that SCAG commissioned the survey to promote the
idea of a regional economy which includes all six counties. &QL;

 McMILLAN SAYS PAYTON'S TIME HERE AT LAST  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was perhaps the perfect symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Gary Payton became the Sonics' all-time assists
leader, Sonics assistant coach Nate McMillan interrupted his Payton
tribute to show off the watch on his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Rolex. A $30,000 time piece. The gift Payton presented
McMillan last season in honor of his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this. It's love there,'' McMillan said, genuinely
delighted Monday night at New Jersey when Payton passed him to move
atop the Sonics' assists list. Payton enters the Sonics' game
Wednesday night against Golden State having become the team's
career leader in a fourth statistical category.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Payton also will enter KeyArena with a torch handed
down by an icon.
</P>
<P>
   As far as McMillan is concerned, Payton's time has truly come.
</P>
<P>
   The all-star point guard is finally in his proper place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being the leader that I always hoped to try and mold him
(into). Finally, he's become that guy,'' McMillan said. ``For once,
numbers don't mean anything to him. The only numbers that mean
anything to him is wins or losses. He's always been a guy who
pretty much kept up with his statistics. But now he's being the
leader that he needs to become for this team to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof of McMillan's testimony is how Payton handled grabbing the
assists record.
</P>
<P>
   Payton actually did not know he had achieved the mark at the
time. It wasn't until after the game against the Nets that Payton
was told about the achievement and congratulated.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing McMillan's compliments was high praise to Payton.
</P>
<P>
   They are only four years apart. Payton, 31, always has described
a brotherly relationship with his former teammate. But McMillan,
35, watches Payton with a look in his eyes normally reserved for
proud fathers.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan was already wearing Seattle green when the Sonics
drafted Payton to succeed him in 1990. As the oft-told story goes,
McMillan took a volatile Payton under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   Now McMillan sees a mature Payton _ a point guard for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Payton is on top of his game, averaging 21.9 points, 10 assists
and 7.1 rebounds in the flow of the team's schemes. He still is
wiry and strong. His defense is hard-nosed. And his mouth still
runs in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand his ways and how competitive he is,'' McMillan
said. ``I've seen him grow throughout his career, and so far this
is his best year. Anytime someone needs to speak, he's speaking
up.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan concedes that one reason Payton no longer suppresses
his leadership skills is because the old regime is gone. McMillan,
Detlef Schrempf, Sam Perkins and Hersey Hawkins were veteran Sonics
players who also accepted responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the fact that I was part of that group,'' McMillan
said, ``I was a guy who was leading him. ... (But Gary's) happy
with the guys we signed this year. He feels these are the guys he
can lead.''
</P>
<P>
   It gives McMillan a warm feeling. He can afford to follow the
inscription, ``Take it easy,'' that Payton put on the bottom of
McMillan's watch.

SOUTHLAND TRAFFIC WORST IN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- GRIDLOCK-STUDY -LADN  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Steve Carney and Harrison Sheppard 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a finding that won't surprise angry commuters stuck on the
101 Freeway, Los Angeles ranked first in the nation for traffic
congestion for the 16th year in a row, according to a study
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And with six million more people expected to move to the region
by 2020, transportation experts said the Southland likely will
retain its inglorious heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very large population, a very wide area, and because of
that there are just very few ways to get from one side to the
other. Except for cars,'' said David Schrank, co-author of the
study from the Texas Transportation Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing to realize is there's no one
or two silver bullets,'' said Dan Beal, transportation policy
manager for the Automobile Club of Southern California. ``What we
have is a need to apply a lot of different solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The gridlock study, compiled annually by the Texas
Transportation Institute, ranked 68 of the nation's largest urban
areas, and listed L.A. at the top of all congestion categories.
</P>
<P>
   A rush-hour trip in Los Angeles takes 51 percent longer than a
drive during off-peak times, according to the study. That's up from
31 percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, Texas, the study found that motorists lose about
three hours a year to congestion. A Los Angeles driver can rack
that up in one trip, if caught in a nasty SigAlert. By comparison,
over the course of a year the average L.A. driver spends about 82
hours caught in traffic, topping second-place Washington D.C. at 76
hours.
</P>
<P>
   And that gridlock costs L.A. drivers about $1,370 per year in
wasted fuel and travel time, according to the study's 1997 figures,
the most recent available.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation experts say the answers to gridlock can be found
in five main areas:
</P>
<P>
   Add freeway lanes or build new freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the number of vehicles on the road by persuading people to
carpool, ride buses or trains, bicycle, walk or work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Convince people to avoid driving at peak times by adding freeway
tolls that rise during rush hour, or having employers shift work
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Increase road efficiency by improving ramp metering,
synchronizing traffic signals on surface streets and quickly
clearing the freeways of disabled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Manage population growth to slow the number of new vehicles on
the roads and build communities so people don't need to drive as
far to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the problem is sprawl, and that is something Southern
California has to come to grips with,'' said Gloria Ohland,
spokeswoman for the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a
nonprofit coalition of 200 groups that reviews transportation
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to create more compact, mixed-use communities,'' she
said, ``so you don't have to go very far to get groceries, to go to
the dry cleaners, to take your kid to soccer practice.''
</P>
<P>
   She said cities such as Burbank, Santa Monica, West Hollywood
and Glendale, to a certain extent, all offer such lifestyles. In
traditional suburban communities like Northridge or Santa Clarita,
``you really need to get into the car to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it is too late to regulate growth in Los Angeles. A
key is to provide attractive alternatives for motorists, such as
trains, car pools or Smart Shuttle vans, which are dispatched on
demand like airport shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said it will be hard to get drivers out of their cars,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't going to change their lifestyles,'' said Mark
Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Association
of Governments. ``How can we create systems that give the same
service as your automobile?''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said the answer is not to
add freeways.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be any more freeways. We're looking at
maximizing our existing system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans is adding 300 miles of new high-occupancy vehicle lanes
to every freeway countywide, except the Pasadena Freeway and those
that lead into downtown, Tiritilli said.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend HOV lanes are wasted space.
</P>
<P>
   The Reason Public Policy Institute, a Los Angeles-based
nonprofit foundation, advocates turning some HOV lanes into
quasi-toll lanes, so solo drivers could pay to join car poolers.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to begin a rapid
bus system next year. It would run on surface streets and allow
buses to turn traffic lights green as they approach, said MTA
regional planning director Brad McAllester.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA is testing the project with three lines, including one
along Ventura Boulevard from Warner Center to Universal City that
will start running in June.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the rapid bus system would expand, removing the
equivalent of nine freeway lanes full of rush hour traffic,
McAllester said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Green, director of the environmental program at Reason,
said policy makers and motorists alike will not easily embrace big
solutions such as freeway double-decking or massive transit
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem will undoubtedly eventually solve itself,'' Green
said, adding that people tend to limit their commutes to an average
of 20 minutes. ``They do what's necessary to try to maintain that.
They will find other jobs, or live other places or work at home.'' &QL;

 SERVICES OPERATE ATMs THAT DISPENSE MORE THAN CASH  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MARK DAVIS
</P>
<P>
   Knight-Ridder Newspapers KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Americans, believe
it or not, are behind the curve when it comes to using automated
teller machines. The Poles, Hungarians and Czechs are way ahead of
us, thanks to a Leawood, Kan., company.
</P>
<P>
   Euronet Services Inc., at 4601 College Blvd., operates a network
of nearly 1,800 ATMs across Europe at which former communist bloc
shoppers can conduct a flurry of business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the machines dispense cash like their counterparts in
the United States. But they also flash advertisements to users and
spit out coupons. Users in Poland also can pay their utility bills
at the ATMs. Users in Poland and Hungary can buy vouchers for
mobile phone minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll start to see the same things here,'' said
Michael Brown, chief executive officer and chairman of Euronet. ``
It just hasn't started here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such services might make their debut in America through 334 Dash
network ATMs that Euronet's software operates in Dillard's stores,
including those in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably going to see all of that in Dillard's stores
in the future,'' said David Helm, assistant treasurer of the Little
Rock, Ark.-based department store chain.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements probably will be the first feature to show up on
the Dillard's ATMs, the last of which went in this month. Helm said
a cosmetics company's ad might flash on the machine's small screen
during the 30 or 45 seconds it takes to process a cash transaction
or account balance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, Euronet's software can select an ad geared to
the person standing at the machine. The cosmetics ad might pop up
if the card activating the machine belongs to a woman; a menswear
ad might pop up if it's a man's card.
</P>
<P>
   Helm said Dillard's decided to put ATMs in all its stores
because customers are using checks less often and debit cards more
often. A debit card looks like a credit card but automatically
deducts the purchase price from the user's bank account, rather
than bill the customer later.
</P>
<P>
   Helm said having an ATM in the store also allowed shoppers,
especially this holiday season, to double-check their balances and
avoid an embarrassment at the register.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the department store will look into the other
features Euronet can provide through ATMs, Helm said. That's why
Dillard's went to Euronet to operate the machines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to be way ahead of everyone with ATMs and how
they're proceeding,'' Helm said.
</P>
<P>
   Euronet got that experience in Europe, principally in former
communist bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Henry, chief operating officer at Euronet, spent five
years scouting locations and setting up the network, starting in
Hungary and expanding outward. Consumers in these recently opened
economies were good candidates to use the added features of the
machines because they had been in such a primitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   No one had checking accounts before the Soviet bloc fell apart.
Consumers simply lined up with wads of cash to pay their utilities
in person. Post offices allowed consumers to pay the bills in one
place, but it was still a cash-only deal.
</P>
<P>
   Each Euronet ATM is hooked up to let consumers pay utilities
electronically. It's also quicker than getting in five separate
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in these former Soviet-dominated economies also don't
have established credit histories to get mobile telephone service,
Brown said. Consumer credit, like checking accounts, simply didn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, individuals who want mobile phone service buy vouchers
worth so many minutes of use. Brown said the vouchers were
something like calling cards, but involve accessing a code to fill
your phone with usable minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Euronet ATMs sell these vouchers. The ATM offers an advantage in
that the machines operate 24 hours a day. Brown said retail stores
that sell the vouchers were open only a few hours on weekends and
far fewer hours during the week than U.S. retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Although Euronet's machines regularly pay off consumers,
investors haven't fared so well. Euronet sold stock publicly in
March 1997. Its initial public offering came out at 131/2, and
shares traded as high as 161/4 that first day.
</P>
<P>
   This week, shares are bumping around 3 and briefly fell below 2
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Building the network in Europe has been expensive, and machines
generally don't reach average transaction volumes for three to 12
months, the company's reports said. Brown said that machines in
Poland had taken even longer to gain volume but that monthly
transaction totals had doubled this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 8 percent of the (Polish) population has a card, which I
love, (because) we're already hitting break-even,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the firm's entire ATM network was likely to be
operating at a profit by year-end. But that's on an operating
basis, before the firm covers its interest expenses, taxes,
depreciation and amortization costs.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has reeled in its capital expenditures to get there,
partly by selling its ATMs in Croatia to a bank, though it
continues to operate the network.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Gyulafia, the firm's director of marketing
communications, said the firm could expand into other areas, such
as helping banks in Europe set up credit card operations.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he saw Euronet's ATMs getting into the e-commerce
field even more, offering, for example, concert tickets,
particularly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got connections to people's money,'' he said.

NETZERO SWAPS STOCK FOR VIDEO AD CARRIER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Z. Cohen 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE -- Internet service provider NetZero began
spending the spoils of its initial public offering Tuesday by
buying AimTV, a carrier of video advertising on the Web, for $25.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for NetZero to give AimTV shareholders 1 million
shares of NetZero stock for the company. The deal is expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero went public Sept. 24, issuing 10 million shares and
raising $160 million through the stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   Now, NetZero users will have no choice but to watch video
commercials as well as still banners on their screen in exchange
for the free Internet access the company offers.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero Chief Executive Mark Goldston said the addition of AimTV
gives NetZero another outlet for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, AimTV's product will be integrated into the NetZero
browser in the form of a service called GroundZero. When users log
on, they will view television-quality advertising while their modem
is dialing and connecting, Goldston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time it is our intention to try and integrate the AimTV
technology so that during part of your log-on we'll show you
regular banner advertising, and part will be television-quality
commercials,'' Goldston said.
</P>
<P>
   The product AimTV has developed employs a thin file to transmit
the video to targeted users identified by the profile information
they give the company as part of the registration process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not streaming video, and it's something that can work
on narrow-band access (such as a telephone connection),'' Goldston
said.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst began coverage of NetZero on Tuesday with a hold
rating, saying the company looks strong, but the business model is
unproven. ING Barings analyst Youssef Squali initiated the coverage
of the company along with several other Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldston said his company has not yet been able to go after
advertisers, but he believes the service will be well-received.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero's stock ended trading Tuesday 75 cents higher, at $25.25
per share. &QL;

RENOVATED APARTMENT COMPLEX OFFERS SAFE PLACE TO LIVE, LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>

   By SHANI A. BROWN Knight Ridder Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Residents of Olive Park Village now have a
safe place to live and interact with one another, thanks to a $3.2
million partnership between a bank and a local nonprofit community
development group.
</P>
<P>
   The complex also includes the ``Make a Difference Center,''
which opened Monday. The project is the result of a partnership
between Bank of America Community Development Corp. and Old
Northeast Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Housing Development Commission also provided $1.4
million in rehabilitation loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am speechless about what has happened here'' said Mary
Therese Carroll, chairman of the Old Northeast board. ``It really
has become a wonderful place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Make a Difference Center at Ninth and Olive streets consists
of a computer lab connected to the Internet, a library and a
tutorial area. It will provide activities at no charge for children
and adults who live in the complex. Children also can frolic on the
playground outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America CDC and Old Northeast worked together to buy and
renovate the 137-unit complex about a year ago, said William
Nelson, president of Bank of America Kansas City Region.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the apartments have been renovated.
Completion of the others is scheduled by the end of December. The
property is mixed-income housing, with 52 of the units available
for rent subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The Make a Difference Center is the first to open in the
Midwest, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center will provide residents, especially school-age
children, with a safe, community-based place to play and learn,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The center's program was created by Bank of America to provide
services to residents of multifamily rental properties developed by
the Bank of America CDC. A total of 25 centers are planned across
the nation.
</P>

   In only 11 months, Olive Park Village was transformed into a
community where people feel safe, said Paul Livingston, senior vice
president of Yarco Cos., which renovated the complex and will
manage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the better developments in this area,''
Livingston said. ``And the center is probably the most premium
community center in this area because of all the services it
offers.''

<P>
   Though the books and computers have not yet arrived, 13-year-old
Ryan Johnson was excited to use the center Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to eat, take a nap and do my homework after school,''
Ryan said. ``Now I can come here and use the computers. I will
probably come everyday. I guess I will have to cut out my nap
time.''

OPPOSITION HEATS UP AS SPRINT, MCIWORLDCOM FILE MERGER
APPLICATION

<P>
   Knight-Ridder Newspapers KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As Sprint Corp. and
MCI WorldCom Inc. file their formal merger application today with
the Federal Communications Commission, the voices of opposition to
the marriage are gathering strength.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and regulators already are blustering about ``the
dangers of market concentration'' and ``taking a hard look at this
deal,'' though Congress has little direct power to block a huge
telecommunications merger, and regulators have never done so.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, frustrated by the parade of megamergers and
seeming inaction in Washington, are back at the ramparts, howling
about hidden increases in consumer long-distance prices and a
telecommunications system set up to serve Wall Street and corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet corporate America sees little in the deal for itself, save
one less rival to compete for its business.
</P>
<P>
   And competitors, predictably, think the deal would stifle
competition and should face onerous conditions if allowed at all.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers' zeal doesn't surprise officials at Sprint and MCI
WorldCom, who will be trying to rush their deal past roadblocks as
quickly as possible while making as few concessions as possible to
appease various opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they hope to complete the deal by
mid-2000, an optimistic schedule given the two-year regulatory slog
that past telecom mergers have been subjected to.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a merger of this size, it's understandable that a variety
of interests would express concern,'' said Peter Lucht, a spokesman
for MCI WorldCom. ``But we're confident that we're going to be able
to show that this merger is pro-consumer and in the public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Benjamin Wolff, a partner with the law firm of
Davis, Tremain and Wright who specializes in antitrust issues,
``That's going to be a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   ``On its face, this appears to be something that decreases
competition. They're going to make the pitch that everything's in
flux in the industry, but regulators aren't in the business of
predicting future trends. Under the law, they have to make the
determination under today's competitive landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost certain that if regulators allow the deal, they will
force the combined company to divest Sprint or MCI WorldCom's
Internet backbone, the large national and global networks that
carry Internet traffic between smaller networks and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   When WorldCom bought MCI Communications in 1998, regulators
forced MCI to sell its Internet backbone. With that precedent and
their urgency to get the deal done, it's unlikely that MCI WorldCom
and Sprint would waste time arguing against such a divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   The open questions are whether the companies' combined share of
the long-distance market will be cause for strong concern, and
what, if anything, regulators will do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Together, MCI WorldCom, Sprint and AT&AMP;T control 80 percent of
the long-distance market, easily enough concentration to raise
antitrust concerns at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department has already asked MCI WorldCom and Sprint for
additional information after their initial merger filing in
October. The request is not out of the ordinary, but it indicates
that the department intends to examine the merger in detail, rather
than approve it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies declined to comment on the process at Justice,
which is not public.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC review, however, is a public process. And the companies'
filings today will provide the best view of their strategy with
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The betrothed are likely to offer a two-pronged rationale for
their union.
</P>
<P>
   First, they will argue that long-distance is already a commodity
business, with more than 600 providers overall. Moreover, they will
argue that a growing number of smaller carriers now have their own
fiber networks and can compete directly against the big three, even
for the sophisticated voice and data services that corporations
use.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, regulators are likely to permit at least one of the
regional Bell operating companies _ Bell Atlantic or Southwestern
Bell _ to begin offering long-distance service to its customers,
adding competitive vigor to the residential market, where the Bells
are expected to be most active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you put aside the notion that the market is evolving
and the Bell companies will be entering, we still maintain that
this merger would not harm competition in the long-distance market
because that market is so robustly competitive already,'' Lucht
said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the companies will argue that long-distance as we know
it is disappearing and will soon be replaced by all-distance
pricing as consumers buy flat-rate bundles of local, long-distance,
wireless and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce
committees, company officials have tried to portray the new
WorldCom as the best hope for a strong alternative to the
``mega-Bells,'' with their stranglehold over local telephone
markets, and the ``emerging AT&AMP;T cable monopoly,'' which that
company has assembled by buying national cable providers during the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a merger of monopoly providers,'' said John
Sidgmore, vice chairman of MCI WorldCom. ``This merger is being
done so we can become large enough to compete with the monopoly
powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups say that rationale is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, they'll face real competition in the future, but
they don't have it now,'' said James Love, director of the Consumer
Project on Technology. ``The current (long-distance) market share
of the Baby Bells is zippo, and they're the best hope against that
awesome competitive threat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should people trade in real competition today for a theory
about how there might be competition down the road? This is about
as plain and straight an example of a harmful merger that consumers
can imagine. It should be stopped. That's why we have antitrust
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Business users also take issue with almost every point the
companies offer. They say the vast bulk of long-distance carriers
are niche players, and the market is already an oligopoly, with
most carriers taking their pricing cues from the big three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the arguments that this is going to be good for
competition, and I think they're fairly specious,'' said Bruce
Thatcher of TelCon Associates, a Kansas City company that audits
telephone bills for companies and helps them negotiate contracts
with carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to get lower-priced service because of this. I
have not talked to a single telecom user who thinks this is a good
deal for them, and I've heard a lot of people cast doom and
gloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that trepidation, Thatcher said, is due to direct
experience with customer service problems after WorldCom's purchase
of MCI. Just as they surmount some of those problems, the combined
MCI WorldCom and Sprint will try to meld two vastly different
cultures and have a multiyear repetition of those issues, Thatcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporations also tend to divide their businesses among the
top two or three carriers. The disappearance of one of those
players will mean higher rates and less innovation in services,
businesses say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has been quite innovative in introducing new pricing
plans,'' said Ruth Michalecki, director of telecommunications and
information services at the University of Nebraska and chairman of
the International Communications Association, which represents
business users.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, she said, ``I don't think that consumers or
big users will have the opportunity to negotiate rates.''
</P>
<P>
   They also discount the notion that emerging carriers such as
Qwest Communications and Level 3 Communications can offer real
competition to AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the big three have the networks that can serve anybody,
anything, anywhere,'' Michalecki said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jeff Hafer, manager of telecommunications for GPU Energy in
Redding, Pa.: ``Not many Fortune 500 or Fortune 1000 companies take
the third-tier carriers seriously. Telecommunications is mission
critical. We're not willing to risk it to save a few dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the sole voices of support for the merger so far _
besides Wall Street _ comes from Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a
member of two key Senate committees, Judiciary and Commerce, that
will examine the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint happens to be the second-largest contributor to
Ashcroft's 2000 re-election campaign, having donated $22,000 by the
end of June, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate Judiciary Committee held its hearings to
discuss the merger, Ashcroft announced that he had met with MCI
WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers and was ``strongly inclined
to support the proposed merger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the most important question raised by the merger is
its impact now and in the future on Missouri and on Kansas City,''
Ashcroft said. ``In his discussion with me, Mr. Ebbers made it
clear that MCI WorldCom expects to deliver a substantial number of
new jobs to Kansas City over the next few years.''

1969: HUSKIES YEAR OF TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Should first-year coach Rick Neuheisel ever feel the
pressures of the great University of Washington football monolith
gnawing at him, it would serve him well to consider the plight of
the 1969 Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Worlds collided, and everything was knocked off center.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, a ridiculous schedule was met with an
undesirable offense, exposing a glaring lack of talent for the
Huskies. As loss after loss piled up, a rigid coach clashed with
mildly rebellious players, leading to suspensions, protests,
boycotts, even death threats. Toss in a shredded ankle for the
team's All-America running back candidate, and one of the most
turbulent seasons of college football for Seattle emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Capping it off was the most miserable Apple Cup matchup on
record: 0-9 Washington hosting 1-8 Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those times were tough,'' said Lee Brock, a Huskies defensive
tackle and co-captain in '69. ``Everybody was getting killed back
then, Vietnam, Martin Luther King Jr., Bobby Kennedy. I don't think
a whole lot of people were focused on football, at least not like
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of blame and mistrust, a lot of
finger-pointing. People didn't like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   STARS
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Alex, Ralph Bayard, Harvey Blanks and Lamar Mills were the
objects of much hate and vile bile. Their names and mugshots would
be plastered across the front pages of Seattle's newspapers. They
were the Four Hoarse Men of Washington _ they spoke out and paid
dearly for it.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1969, these players were banished from the UW
program by longtime coach Jim Owens. Their crime? Failure to give
``100 percent commitment'' to Owens during hastily called
one-on-one meetings with the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that was asked of me was, `Can you give loyalty
to me as an individual?' '' Bayard recalls. ``My response was that
`I was taught that that was something you have to earn and I've
seen some things I don't necessarily agree with.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fallout was certain after a 22-7 loss at Oregon, dropping
Washington to 0-6 for the first time in school history. Coaches
were looking to give players a jolt. Fullback Landy Harrell was
singled out, ordered to run stadium steps for fumbling twice
against the Ducks. Other players had coughed up the ball in that
game. Only Harrell, who was black, was punished.
</P>
<P>
   Players practiced and Harrell ran. Players went to dinner and
realized Harrell was not among them. He was still running steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and changed (clothes) and, very honestly, we never
saw Landy again,'' Alex said of Harell, who would transfer to
Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's African American players, 13 strong among a squad
of 80, were so disturbed by the obvious sacrifice of Harrell that
they met privately and asked through an assistant coach to see
Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of racism claims from the year before, Owens faced his
entire team the next day. He asked that anyone not committed to the
program stay in the locker room. Everyone stood up and went to
practice. Not satisfied, Owens demanded to meet with each player
out on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two long lines, like going into a movie,'' said
Brock, who is black. ``Everybody in line was asked if they were
loyal to the program. I said, `How could I not be, I'm captain of
this (bleep-bleep) team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mills, ``In those days, the coach was everything and the
athletes just blindly followed him. I thought that was stupid. I
said what I felt. I wasn't going to lie. Some of those guys lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens' demeanor never changed during the inquisition. But it was
clear four answers didn't sit right with him.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions were relayed to reporters that afternoon. Bayard
heard about it from another student while walking across the
skybridge that connects the upper campus to Hec Edmundson Pavilion;
the others were in a car, headed for upper campus, listening to KJR
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come to get an education and play football,'' the
normally soft-spoken Bayard said. ``The last thing on my mind was
to get involved in anything controversial. We were all stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayard was a starting split end from San Francisco. Mills was a
reserve running back from Los Angeles. Alex was a defensive back
from Seattle, sidelined after suffering a concussion against
Michigan in the second game. Blanks was a breakaway runner from
Chicago, out since spring ball with a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Their ouster stirred an already volatile atmosphere in town. If
debate over the Vietnam War, race relations and drug use weren't
enough, the normally stable yet now-divided UW football program had
everyone in a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, it seemed as if the 1969 Huskies had a death
wish hanging over them. They opened against Michigan State,
Michigan and Ohio State _ respectively the nation's sixth-ranked
team in preseason, the eventual Rose Bowl entry and the nation's
No. 1 club in the first polls. Washington was outscored 113-32 by
this trio.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies also tried to use the run-oriented wishbone offense,
not a fan or player favorite. It was a disaster. Washington didn't
score more than 14 points until the Apple Cup.
</P>
<P>
   All of it became secondary once the suspensions were meted out.
The next day, 200 protesters, black and white, blocked the path of
the Huskies charter bus bound for the airport, demanding that no
African American players accompany the team to UCLA. None did. In
Los Angeles, Owens suffered his worst defeat as UW coach at that
time, 57-14 to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings were held. Lawyers were hired. UW faculty members
considered their own protest. The Huskies' lone African American
assistant coach, Carver Gayton, quit. Fights between black and
white students broke out during the next two games in Husky
Stadium. Owens' oldest daughter, Kathy, was stopped in her car by
four men, two black and two white, and had her hair pulled and was
slapped in the face. Owens' removal was demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended players were not immune from community backlash,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents got threatening phone calls that said, `Your son
will be killed if he steps back on the field,' '' Alex recalled.
``I got a postcard in the athletic department from a guy who said
he had a high-powered rifle and if I stepped back into Husky
Stadium he would blow my head off. I'm trying to remember how he
signed it; maybe `a loyal Husky fan'?''
</P>
<P>
   A racist label was stuck on Owens, amid claims he either stacked
players at positions by race or didn't let blacks hold leadership
roles.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued that Owens, a former University of Oklahoma
All-American end, simply was too unbending to deal with the new
breed of athlete, that his militaristic coaching style, which had
been responsible for Rose Bowl victories in 1960 and '61 and for
returning UW football to prominence, had become outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any evidence of (racism) with me,'' Brock
said. ``But being originally from Oklahoma myself, Owens was the
way Okies are. They never had been exposed to black people like us.
He'd never seen a Harvey Blanks who was from Chicago and would step
into your face and say what he liked. I'm certain there were some
insensitivities on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gary Gayton, brother of Carver Gayton and an attorney who
represented some of the suspended players, ``I think Jim sincerely
thought he was doing the right thing, but times were changing. The
only thing I said is, `You're recruiting these kids from the ghetto
and you can't treat them the same as the others, like kids out of
Puyallup.' That was hard for Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently about this tumultuous time, Owens spoke softly
and in measured tones. It was clear that he still believed what he
did with those players 30 years ago was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would hurt anyone to be misunderstood and not be able to
convey what we were trying to do to all the athletes on that
club,'' said Owens, now retired and living in Bigfork, Mont. ``Some
seemed to agree, some didn't. We were constantly trying to meet
somewhere in the middle and have some kind of accord, which we did
after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Compromise was reached before the Apple Cup. UW president
Charles Odegaard got involved and promised that football discipline
would be overhauled. There would be no more loyalty oaths at
practice. Any punishment would be subject to upper-campus review.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four suspended players were reinstated. Blanks was
not.
</P>
<P>
   According to teammates, the often-animated running back wouldn't
give in on someone else's terms. Instead, he made matters worse.
Blanks allegedly swore at Owens and challenged him to fight in
front of the team, committing insubordination that wouldn't be
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted Owens to apologize publicly to him and the coach
wasn't going to do it,'' said Mark Hannah, a defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Others blamed Blanks' debilitating pain for getting in the way
of common sense. He had been a pro prospect, an honors candidate, a
showcase player. When his ankle snapped under the weight of a hard
tackle during spring ball, dreams were shattered as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he could have been as good anybody who ran the ball
out there, including Napoleon Kaufman,'' Brock said. ``The injury
was so devastating to Harvey it destroyed his soul. I'm sure that
was part of Harvey's frustration _ that he wouldn't ever be the
same again.''
</P>
<P>
   STARS
</P>
<P>
   In the '69 Apple Cup, the Huskies beat Washington State, 30-21,
with Bayard catching touchdown passes covering 62 and 11 yards.
Demonstrating how bad these teams were, they combined for just one
victory before their fearsome meeting _ the Cougars earning a 19-18
decision in their season opener over an Illinois team that would
finish 0-10. At no other time in the past 50 years have the state's
Pac-10 rivals combined for fewer than five victories entering a
season-ending game.
</P>
<P>
   As the Huskies and Cougars prepare for their 37th Apple Cup and
91st meeting overall on Saturday, Bayard ironically is right in the
middle of it. For the past seven years, he has served as the UW's
senior associate director for compliance. If there were suspensions
today similar to his, he might have a hand in the decision-making
process.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there was opposition to Bayard's hiring among UW
alumni who still hadn't forgiven him for speaking up. He got the
job anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bayard has no regrets over what happened in 1969. If anything,
his actions helped integrate the football team and athletic
department to more acceptable levels, as well as humanize
coach-player relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being honest up front is going to get you in trouble, but I'll
stick with being honest and straightforward,'' Bayard said. ``If I
had to do it all over again. I'd do it the same way. Right is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayard and the three other players remain close today. Alex is a
Seattle minister and director of the Matt Talbott Center for the
Homeless. Mills is a Seattle attorney and deputy director of the
Northwest Defenders Association and is married to a judge. Blanks
played briefly in the now-defunct World Football League for a
Chicago team coached by Steve Spurrier, then turned to acting and
directing. He has appeared in movies, TV and most notably
Shakespearean theater, and bounces between Los Angeles and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one who is down on the streets, where folks
probably thought all of us would end up,'' Alex said jokingly. ``We
were painted as being ungrateful and evil. We were the blight on
the purple fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Owens, ``I'm tickled to death all of the fellows are doing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayard was the only one who played again for Owens, enjoying the
Huskies resurgence brought on the very next season by the Sonny
Sixkiller era. Years later, Alex sat and chatted easily with Owens
as they rode a bus to a UW Alumni-Varsity football game in the
Kingdome. Alex said he prayed for Owens when he heard he had
undergone surgery for a brain aneurysm in recent years. Word has it
that even Blanks and Owens eventually shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is tough and it's expensive,'' Alex said. ``If the
price wasn't exacted, I would hate to see where the program would
be today. It cost us something. We all know we'll never be in the
Husky Hall of Fame.''

KC LEADERS WANT TO IMPOSE IMPACT FEE ON DEVELOPERS TO HELP PAY FOR
NEW ROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE RICE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MIKE RICE Knight Ridder Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City leaders want to impose an impact
fee on Northland developers to help pay for new roads in the city's
fastest-growing sector.
</P>
<P>
   The fee, a popular funding mechanism in the West and in Florida,
would be levied on all new development to help pay for the capital
improvements needed to serve that development. The fee would vary
according to how much traffic a development generated.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council is expected to vote on the proposal shortly
after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents believe the fee could generate about $4 million
annually toward needed road construction and upgrades, estimated to
cost as much as $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Kansas City's growth is occurring north of the Missouri
River, but the road system is regarded by many to be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The city has tried to address those road needs with sales tax
money and tax increment financing projects, but city leaders
believe developers need to pay more of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, developers with frontage on arterial streets must
construct the portion of the roadway adjacent to their project.
This policy has led some developers, who do not want to pay for
those costs, to leave their frontage undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also has created a patchwork of improved and
unimproved street segments.
</P>
<P>
   Developers have attended meetings on the proposal, which has
been in the discussion stage since spring. The fee, they said, is
too high and could be cost-prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   But they are working with the city at modifying the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The fee would be based on the amount of peak-hour traffic that a
new development generated. Using a formula established by the
Institute of Traffic Engineers, the highest rates would be imposed
on banks with drive-through facilities, video-rental stores,
convenience stores that sell gasoline and fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The rates for residential, office and industrial developments
would be less.
</P>
<P>
   The full fee would not be assessed until four years after the
fee's adoption. It would be assessed at 50 percent of the
designated amount the first year, 62.5 percent the second year, 75
percent the third year and 87.5 percent the fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   Developers would qualify for credits if they paid for or built
any arterial streets in the city 10 years before the fee's
adoption. And any developer would receive a refund if the city did
not spend the fee after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities in the metropolitan area have a development fee
in place. Overland Park, Kan., for instance, levies a
14.5-cent-per-square-foot excise tax _ about $6,300 an acre _ to
pay for thoroughfares whenever land is platted.
</P>
<P>
   Impact fees have been popular in suburban areas in states like
California, Florida and Arizona, where growth has been rapid and
taxpayer resistance to paying for infrastructure is common, said
James Duncan, an Austin, Texas-based consultant who is assisting
Kansas City on drawing up its fee proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what some might think, Duncan said, impact fees
stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one likes to shell out money,'' Duncan said, but he noted
that growth is not free. ``Cities have to pay for it somehow. The
federal and state grants that used to pay for these kinds of things
are not out there anymore. When Uncle Sam stops spoon-feeding you,
you have to stand on your own two feet.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A detailed analysis of the voice and data recorders
aboard EgyptAir Flight 990 indicates that a crew member, possibly a
relief pilot, seized the controls of the passenger jet and forced
the plane into a steep dive toward the Atlantic Ocean, government
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the new information, investigators also theorize that
the veteran captain of the Boeing 767, Ahmed al-Habashi, who had
briefly left the cockpit and returned, struggled in vain to regain
control of the aircraft after the other pilot calmly uttered an
Arabic expression about putting his trust in God, switched off the
autopilot and pitched the Boeing 767 into the high-speed plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the relief pilot at the center of the inquiry
was Gamil al-Batouti, a 59-year-old veteran EgyptAir employee and
former Air Force aviator. Batouti was not assigned to fly the plane
at the time of the crash, but the officials said they believe he is
the man in the co-pilot's seat whose remark about God can be heard
seconds before the plane began its fatal descent.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled co-pilot was aboard the flight, but was apparently
not in the cockpit at time of the crash and his whereabouts on the
plane were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir representatives familiar with the voice of the
airline's crews listened to the cockpit voice recorder and
identified the voice of Batouti, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials cautioned that they had no other verification
of Batouti's voice and, that there were four pilots aboard the
plane who could have flown it. The officials also warned that
further analysis of the information might lead them to different
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing likelihood that the relief pilot, or another
EgyptAir crew member, deliberately brought down the aircraft led
the authorities Tuesday to prepare to transfer the inquiry to the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Transportation Safety Board, which has had
authority over the inquiry, decided Tuesday to keep its
jurisdiction, in response to Egyptian complaints that the American
authorities were moving too quickly to blame a crew member for the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   As federal authorities reconstructed the final horrifying
seconds of the flight, air safety and law enforcement officials
provided a clearer account of what might have happened on the Oct.
31 flight, which seemed routine as the big jet left Kennedy
International Airport bound for Cairo and reached its 33,000-foot
cruising altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just after 1:49 a.m., something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual events began seconds after the pilot, Habashi,
briefly left the cockpit, the officials said. The departure was
inferred by authorities from the sound of the cockpit door opening
and closing. They believe that Habashi left Batouti alone in the
cockpit because they have picked up no other voices.
</P>
<P>
   When he was alone, the other pilot repeated quietly and calmly,
``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At about this time someone shut off the autopilot. The officials
said that the voice recorder's cockpit microphones picked up
Habashi saying in Arabic, ``What's going on?'' or ``Let's fix
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later the plane began its steep descent, from 33,000
feet to less than 17,000 feet. It is unclear at exactly what point
in the flight that the two men spoke, but the flight data recorder
showed that eight seconds after the autopilot was disconnected, the
plane began its plunge toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   During the dive, the two parts of the tail that control whether
the plane dives or climbs moved in an unusual fashion. Although in
normal flight operations the two parts move in tandem,
investigators said they were initially baffled by the movement of
the left and right parts of the tail in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The officials now hypothesize that one pilot may have been
desperately trying to pull out of the dive while the other pilot
was forcing the plane's controls down. There is no indication that
the two men in the cockpit engaged in a physical struggle with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Near the bottom of the dive, someone turned the engine control
levers to the cutoff position _ a possible but not definitive clue
that a struggle for control of the plane ended when one man shut
down the engines.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the plane regained altitude, climbing several
thousand feet until it stalled, reaching a speed too slow to remain
airborne. The aircraft apparently broke and fell into the Atlantic,
killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, t was unclear whether investigators had gleaned most of
what they expected to extract from the voice and data recorders.
They initially said there was nothing on the tape to indicate a
criminal act. But in more thorough analyses and evaluations by
Arabic speakers, their conclusions have changed significantly. And
some officials cautioned that further analysis might lead them to
still different theories about the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation safety officials said that with many questions
unanswered, recovery operations will continue at the site of the
crash, 60 miles south of Nantucket, as American and Egyptian
investigators compile highly detailed biographical accounts of the
EgyptAir crew members, all of whom had recently undergone routine
medical and psychological evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The American theories about the crash led to protests from
Egyptian officials who complained bitterly about the plan to turn
the investigation over to the FBI, the officials said. The
discussions became a matter of serious diplomatic concern with the
Egyptian ambassador, Nabil Fahmy, meeting Tuesday with
Undersecretary Thomas Pickering at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the Egyptians had asserted that the
American authorities might have misread the evidence and too
quickly dismissed the possibility that the plane crashed as a
result of a mechanical failure or some other problem.
</P>
<P>
   The expression apparently uttered by the relief pilot was,
``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' which is a common phrase that can mean, ``I
put my faith in God,'' or, ``I entrust myself to God.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, the phrase is used often, especially at the
start of a journey or a task. It can be used by someone about to
begin something as simple as cooking a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said that the phrase had no known
connection to any political or terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the Egyptian scenario, the co-pilot's comment could have been
a worried response to some as-yet-undetermined mechanical breakdown
that a few seconds later caused him to disengage the autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians said that the pilot's urgent words to his
co-pilot, ``What's going on?'' could have referred to his concern
over that undetermined problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman of the safety board, James Hall, said Tuesday
evening that ``we have so far found no sign of a mechanical or
weather-related event that could have caused this accident'' in the
otherwise routine flight.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hall Tuesday stopped short of turning the case
over to the FBI
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that in the next few days, Egyptian investigators and
senior EgyptAir representatives familiar with the Arabic used in
the cockpit would evaluate the tape from the voice recorder. Other
administration officials emphasized that they did not view the
Egyptian concerns as an effort to slow the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that in crashes involving American crews, safety board
experts often cannot agree about what the pilots were saying. ``It
is made slightly more difficult in this situation because the
expressions and conversations are in Arabic,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the inquiry into the crash would continue and that
the authorities would soon bring a large vessel to the scene that
could continue the search, even in rough winter weather, for human
remains and wreckage of the plane. Aviation experts said that no
matter who was in charge, the authorities must still recover more
sections of the aircraft from the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that retrieval of the cockpit area would be a
priority. In some previous crashes, information stored in on-board
computer chips yielded valuable data about the condition of the
aircraft in the seconds before the impact. Unlike older planes,
most cockpit instruments in the 767 are displayed on video screens,
which preserve no information after a crash.

KANSAS CITY LEADERS WANT TO IMPOSE IMPACT FEE ON NORTHLAND
DEVELOPERS TO PAY FOR ROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE RICE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MIKE RICE Knight Ridder Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City leaders want to impose an impact
fee on Northland developers to help pay for new roads in the city's
fastest-growing sector.
</P>
<P>
   The fee, a popular funding mechanism in the West and in Florida,
would be levied on all new development to help pay for the capital
improvements needed to serve that development. The fee would vary
according to how much traffic a development generated.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council is expected to vote on the proposal shortly
after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents believe the fee could generate about $4 million
annually toward needed road construction and upgrades, estimated to
cost as much as $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Kansas City's growth is occurring north of the Missouri
River, but the road system is regarded by many to be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The city has tried to address those road needs with sales tax
money and tax increment financing projects, but city leaders
believe developers need to pay more of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, developers with frontage on arterial streets must
construct the portion of the roadway adjacent to their project.
This policy has led some developers, who do not want to pay for
those costs, to leave their frontage undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also has created a patchwork of improved and
unimproved street segments.
</P>
<P>
   Developers have attended meetings on the proposal, which has
been in the discussion stage since spring. The fee, they said, is
too high and could be cost-prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   But they are working with the city at modifying the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The fee would be based on the amount of peak-hour traffic that a
new development generated. Using a formula established by the
Institute of Traffic Engineers, the highest rates would be imposed
on banks with drive-through facilities, video-rental stores,
convenience stores that sell gasoline and fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The rates for residential, office and industrial developments
would be less.
</P>
<P>
   The full fee would not be assessed until four years after the
fee's adoption. It would be assessed at 50 percent of the
designated amount the first year, 62.5 percent the second year, 75
percent the third year and 87.5 percent the fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   Developers would qualify for credits if they paid for or built
any arterial streets in the city 10 years before the fee's
adoption. And any developer would receive a refund if the city did
not spend the fee after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities in the metropolitan area have a development fee
in place. Overland Park, Kan., for instance, levies a
14.5-cent-per-square-foot excise tax _ about $6,300 an acre _ to
pay for thoroughfares whenever land is platted.
</P>
<P>
   Impact fees have been popular in suburban areas in states like
California, Florida and Arizona, where growth has been rapid and
taxpayer resistance to paying for infrastructure is common, said
James Duncan, an Austin, Texas-based consultant who is assisting
Kansas City on drawing up its fee proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what some might think, Duncan said, impact fees
stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one likes to shell out money,'' Duncan said, but he noted
that growth is not free. ``Cities have to pay for it somehow. The
federal and state grants that used to pay for these kinds of things
are not out there anymore. When Uncle Sam stops spoon-feeding you,
you have to stand on your own two feet.''

VALLEY TRAFFIC HEADING NOWHERE, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   City dwellers across the United States are increasingly stuck in
traffic, and it's costing them hundreds of dollars in extra travel
time and fuel, a study released Tuesday says.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Phoenix, land of the car and home of the perpetual
freeway-construction project, is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to increased time spent going nowhere, the
Valley of the Sun rates better than most, finishing 53rd out of 68
urban areas studied by the Texas Transportation Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Over a 15-year period, the time lost to road congestion in metro
Phoenix jumped 133 percent, the institute found in its annual
mobility report. That's a big increase, but a far cry from the
1,000 percent increase in Indianapolis or the 633 percent jump in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The report's release sparked a flurry of dueling news releases
by groups interested either in promoting or discouraging road
building.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Policy Project, which argues that the
nation can't build its way out of congestion, analyzed the
institute's figures and concluded that urban sprawl is what's
locking motorists in traffic. Sprawl makes people drive more, so a
nearly 1 million gain in population over the past 15 years actually
feels like 1.9 million new drivers, travelwise.
</P>
<P>
   The American Road &AMP; Transportation Builders Association had a
different spin on the study: Lack of road building is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyist group said that although the number of vehicle
miles traveled has increased 130 percent in 30 years, and
population and vehicle registrations have jumped by double digits,
new highway capacity has inched up only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in between _ and behind the steering wheel _ are Valley
motorists such as Eliot Suied and Dave Matthews. Their views show
how traffic woes can be relative.
</P>
<P>
   To Suied, a three-year transplant from Orange County, Calif.,
who has plied the roads of Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; and
Miami, ``traffic'' and ``congestion'' hardly belong in the same
sentence in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no comparison,'' Suied said. ``It's like
saying, `That third-grader hit me real hard,' vs. `Mike Tyson
smacked me in the mouth.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Matthews, who daily commutes 50 miles from Ahwatukee to
Central Avenue and Camelback Road and back, calls rush-hour traffic
``abysmal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the problem: too many cars for not enough road,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A while back, Matthews said, he would have prescribed more roads
as the solution. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic engineers say we open lane after lane and they
fill up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report added more gasoline to the fire raging over how
to reduce congestion. Researchers at the Texas Transportation
Institute say the road builders and the pro-transit crowd are both
right _ and both wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There is no single answer, study authors David Schrank and Tim
Lomax said. Rather, American cities need to build more roads,
encourage carpooling and boost transit.
</P>
<P>
   If road building alone were the answer, the cities they studied
would need to add 37 more lanes of roads and freeways just to keep
up with one year of higher traffic demand, the study's authors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If carpooling were the only answer, the average city would
have to increase its annual number of carpool trips by at least
100,000 every year,'' they stated.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas study indicated that the average Phoenix driver in
1997 lost 35 hours a year stuck in traffic. That works out to about
45 minutes a workday.
</P>
<P>
   And traffic delays cost them $580 each in 1997, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers landed Phoenix in the middle of the pack. At the
top of the heap, the typical Los Angeles driver spent 82 hours
sitting in traffic in 1997, at a cost of $1,370 in wasted fuel and
extra travel time. &QL;

DISNEY, WARNER EYE STORE CLOSURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK -- The Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. have started
moving toward cutting back their once-booming retail store
operations for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by both Burbank-based chains, which sell a wide
variety of character-based clothing, toys and collectibles, come
amid a rapidly changing retail environment driven by pursuit of hot
new trends and fads. Most of the stores occupy space in
high-traffic malls with above-average lease rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy money has been made for Disney and Warner, but now
you've got to work for it,'' said Frederick Marx, retail consultant
with Marx Layne Management in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ``Now it's
time for a reality check. At some point, a concept gets mature and
can become a classic but it's tough to stay that way because we're
talking about a very fickle audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner had already pulled the plug on further expansion of its
180 stores earlier this year after it opened a new store in a
Tampa, Fla., suburb. The studio's parent, Time Warner Inc.,
disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week
that it was considering closing some of the 140 U.S. locations and
may take a charge against earnings as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The filing also said Time Warner was considering decreasing the
size of some of the Studio Store locations and reiterated earlier
statements that it was placing increased emphasis on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney, it plans to close a store at the Lenox Shopping
Center in Atlanta in mid-January in the first instance of the
entertainment giant shuttering an existing Disney Store.
Spokeswoman Sondra Haley said Tuesday that Disney had decided to
let the store's lease expire rather than renewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits at Disney's consumer products division fell 38
percent to $102 million in fiscal 1999, pulled down partly by
lagging performance at the stores. Disney officials disclosed two
months ago that underperforming stores could be closed and that the
chain would be working on a prototype of a new design.
</P>
<P>
   At an analysts' meeting earlier this month, executives said they
would ease up on opening new locations and boost efforts to make
Disney goods appealing to older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will definitely slow the expansion rate on new stores and
focus on existing locations,'' Haley said. ``But we don't have
plans to close a certain number.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley said the chain, which opened its first store in Glendale
in 1987 and now has 738 locations, is facing lease expirations on a
significant number of locations but is currently considering not
renewing on only one store. ``This is kind of a natural process as
we hit lease expirations to re-evaluate our long-term positions,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Retail strategist Michael Crosson said the strategy used by
Disney and Warner _ blanketing the country with stores at major
malls _ had worked effectively for most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had tremendous sales out of the stores, which had a
tremendous influence on all their licensed properties,'' said
Crosson, chief executive officer of Michigan-based JGA. ``Consumer
awareness hit an all-time high a few years ago but peaked. There's
now a lot more competition from sports teams, restaurants and logo
products from places like Old Navy, Gap, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said the proliferation of entertainment-oriented
retail has diluted the ``specialness'' of the products they sell.
Crosson said Disney and Warner, which opened its first store in
1991 at the Beverly Center in West Hollywood, are most likely to be
focusing on adding the ``experience'' element to the retail sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a trend to reassess strategy, such as
should you have experience-based neighbors and whether you should
focus on flagship stores in major metropolitan areas instead of
having them in every shopping center,'' he added. &QL;

SOUTHLAND TRAFFIC WORST IN NATION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES --In a finding that won't surprise angry commuters
stuck on the 101 Freeway, Los Angeles ranked first in the nation
for traffic congestion for the 16th year in a row, according to a
study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And with six million more people expected to move to the region
by 2020, transportation experts said the Southland likely will
retain its inglorious heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very large population, a very wide area, and because of
that there are just very few ways to get from one side to the
other. Except for cars,'' said David Schrank, co-author of the
study from the Texas Transportation Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing to realize is there's no one
or two silver bullets,'' said Dan Beal, transportation policy
manager for the Automobile Club of Southern California. ``What we
have is a need to apply a lot of different solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The gridlock study, compiled annually by the Texas
Transportation Institute, ranked 68 of the nation's largest urban
areas, and listed L.A. at the top of all congestion categories.
</P>
<P>
   A rush-hour trip in Los Angeles takes 51 percent longer than a
drive during off-peak times, according to the study. That's up from
31 percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, Texas, the study found that motorists lose about
three hours a year to congestion. A Los Angeles driver can rack
that up in one trip, if caught in a nasty SigAlert. By comparison,
over the course of a year the average L.A. driver spends about 82
hours caught in traffic, topping second-place Washington D.C. at 76
hours.
</P>
<P>
   And that gridlock costs L.A. drivers about $1,370 per year in
wasted fuel and travel time, according to the study's 1997 figures,
the most recent available.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation experts say the answers to gridlock can be found
in five main areas:
</P>
<P>
   Add freeway lanes or build new freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the number of vehicles on the road by persuading people to
carpool, ride buses or trains, bicycle, walk or work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Convince people to avoid driving at peak times by adding freeway
tolls that rise during rush hour, or having employers shift work
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Increase road efficiency by improving ramp metering,
synchronizing traffic signals on surface streets and quickly
clearing the freeways of disabled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Manage population growth to slow the number of new vehicles on
the roads and build communities so people don't need to drive as
far to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the problem is sprawl, and that is something Southern
California has to come to grips with,'' said Gloria Ohland,
spokeswoman for the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a
nonprofit coalition of 200 groups that reviews transportation
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to create more compact, mixed-use communities,'' she
said, ``so you don't have to go very far to get groceries, to go to
the dry cleaners, to take your kid to soccer practice.''
</P>
<P>
   She said cities such as Burbank, Santa Monica, West Hollywood
and Glendale, to a certain extent, all offer such lifestyles. In
traditional suburban communities like Northridge or Santa Clarita,
``you really need to get into the car to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it is too late to regulate growth in Los Angeles. A
key is to provide attractive alternatives for motorists, such as
trains, car pools or Smart Shuttle vans, which are dispatched on
demand like airport shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said it will be hard to get drivers out of their cars,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't going to change their lifestyles,'' said Mark
Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Association
of Governments. ``How can we create systems that give the same
service as your automobile?''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said the answer is not to
add freeways.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be any more freeways. We're looking at
maximizing our existing system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans is adding 300 miles of new high-occupancy vehicle lanes
to every freeway countywide, except the Pasadena Freeway and those
that lead into downtown, Tiritilli said.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend HOV lanes are wasted space.
</P>
<P>
   The Reason Public Policy Institute, a Los Angeles-based
nonprofit foundation, advocates turning some HOV lanes into
quasi-toll lanes, so solo drivers could pay to join car poolers.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to begin a rapid
bus system next year. It would run on surface streets and allow
buses to turn traffic lights green as they approach, said MTA
regional planning director Brad McAllester.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA is testing the project with three lines, including one
along Ventura Boulevard from Warner Center to Universal City that
will start running in June.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the rapid bus system would expand, removing the
equivalent of nine freeway lanes full of rush hour traffic,
McAllester said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Green, director of the environmental program at Reason,
said policy makers and motorists alike will not easily embrace big
solutions such as freeway double-decking or massive transit
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem will undoubtedly eventually solve itself,'' Green
said, adding that people tend to limit their commutes to an average
of 20 minutes. ``They do what's necessary to try to maintain that.
They will find other jobs, or live other places or work at home.''

DISNEY, WARNER SCALE BACK RETAIL OUTLETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dave McNary 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK _ The Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. have started
moving toward cutting back their once-booming retail store
operations for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by both Burbank-based chains, which sell a wide
variety of character-based clothing, toys and collectibles, come
amid a rapidly changing retail environment driven by pursuit of hot
new trends and fads. Most of the stores occupy space in
high-traffic malls with above-average lease rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy money has been made for Disney and Warner, but now
you've got to work for it,'' said Frederick Marx, retail consultant
with Marx Layne Management in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ``Now it's
time for a reality check. At some point, a concept gets mature and
can become a classic but it's tough to stay that way because we're
talking about a very fickle audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner had already pulled the plug on further expansion of its
180 stores earlier this year after it opened a new store in a
Tampa, Fla., suburb. The studio's parent, Time Warner Inc.,
disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week
that it was considering closing some of the 140 U.S. locations and
may take a charge against earnings as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The filing also said Time Warner was considering decreasing the
size of some of the Studio Store locations and reiterated earlier
statements that it was placing increased emphasis on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney, it plans to close a store at the Lenox Shopping
Center in Atlanta in mid-January in the first instance of the
entertainment giant shuttering an existing Disney Store.
Spokeswoman Sondra Haley said Tuesday that Disney had decided to
let the store's lease expire rather than renewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits at Disney's consumer products division fell 38
percent to $102 million in fiscal 1999, pulled down partly by
lagging performance at the stores. Disney officials disclosed two
months ago that underperforming stores could be closed and that the
chain would be working on a prototype of a new design.
</P>
<P>
   At an analysts' meeting earlier this month, executives said they
would ease up on opening new locations and boost efforts to make
Disney goods appealing to older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will definitely slow the expansion rate on new stores and
focus on existing locations,'' Haley said. ``But we don't have
plans to close a certain number.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley said the chain, which opened its first store in Glendale
in 1987 and now has 738 locations, is facing lease expirations on a
significant number of locations but is currently considering not
renewing on only one store. ``This is kind of a natural process as
we hit lease expirations to re-evaluate our long-term positions,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Retail strategist Michael Crosson said the strategy used by
Disney and Warner _ blanketing the country with stores at major
malls _ had worked effectively for most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had tremendous sales out of the stores, which had a
tremendous influence on all their licensed properties,'' said
Crosson, chief executive officer of Michigan-based JGA. ``Consumer
awareness hit an all-time high a few years ago but peaked. There's
now a lot more competition from sports teams, restaurants and logo
products from places like Old Navy, Gap, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said the proliferation of entertainment-oriented
retail has diluted the ``specialness'' of the products they sell.
Crosson said Disney and Warner, which opened its first store in
1991 at the Beverly Center in West Hollywood, are most likely to be
focusing on adding the ``experience'' element to the retail sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a trend to reassess strategy, such as
should you have experience-based neighbors and whether you should
focus on flagship stores in major metropolitan areas instead of
having them in every shopping center,'' he added.

KINGS HOLD ON TO BEAT BLACKHAWKS

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andy Murray's mom called the other day and told
him just how good a job he was doing with the Los Angeles Kings.
Murray, the quintessential downplayer of great coaching jobs, shot
back with a quick retort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom said, `Maybe you'll be Coach of the Year,''' Murray
said. ``I told her I just want to be coach for !ital!for!off! a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Murray's mom had a premonition. It's early, as Murray
reminds anyone who will listen, but in his first year with the
Kings, he's doing something no one thought possible: He's winning.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Jamie Storr's 36 saves, the Kings won their third
straight, holding on to beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-2 in front of
12,980 Tuesday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   A win over the hapless Blackhawks isn't much to celebrate, but
it does show something. Past Kings teams lost to these teams.
Though this wasn't pretty, the Kings did win and are again atop the
NHL with the most points. Los Angeles, Detroit, Ottawa and Toronto
had 26 points entering the night, but only the Kings played, and
they have 28.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite looking at a 12-4-4 mark, which includes the
8-1-2 record in their last 11 games, Murray remains the worrywart
who fears the loss that can come at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to lose, every game,'' Murray said. ``We have to
win these games. I don't know what the attitude was last year. All
I know is the players, to this point of the season, have
acknowledged how important each game is on each night.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the third-period collapse against Phoenix nearly a
month ago, when everyone bemoaned it being the same old club, the
Kings have been the suprise of the league. It's also that game the
Kings remember and which drives them on nights in which they play
teams like the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   With a rematch with Phoenix up next and a season low in
attendance, the Kings jumped on Chicago early and didn't let up.
They took control with a pair of goals 38 seconds apart in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went ahead 1-0 when Vladimir Tsyplakov chipped the
rebound of Rob Blake's shot from the point past Chicago goalie
Steve Passmore at the 7:05 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles added to its lead on a pretty pass from Glen Murray
to Brian Smolinski. Murray had the puck along the left wing boards
and flipped to Smolinksi, who tipped it past Passmore for a 2-0
Kings lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings increased their lead to 3-0 midway through the second
period on Donald Audette's eighth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kings goalie Jamie Storr shut down the Blackhawks
offense until the 10:36 mark of the third period. Storr, looking
for the Kings' first shutout since opening night, stopped the first
27 shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   However, that ended when Eric Daze corralled a loose puck at the
top of the crease, and despite partially fanning on the shot,
managed to squeak the puck through Storr's pads to pull Chicago to
within 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks made it 3-2 when Tony Amonte scored on the power
play with 58.8 seconds left. Amonte took a pass from Michael
Nylander at the left side of the net and banked in a shot off
Storr's back. It made the Blackhawks 1 for 8 on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Kings are 3-0-1 since first-stringer Stephane Fiset
was injured before the Edmonton game last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goaltending has been a strong point for our team all year,''
Murray said. ``It doesn't matter who's in there.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ The surprise was that when Steve Francis grabbed Dirk
Nowitzki and threw him to the floor, he hit it. It was the only
significant shot the Rockets connected on all night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis earned a quick ejection and apparently took the Rockets'
defense and shooting touch with him. If the 0-5 start to the season
was frustrating, this might have been worse. At least then, the
Rockets were close.
</P>
<P>
   They fell to 2-7 by getting routed 114-95 by the Dallas
Mavericks on Tuesday night at Reunion Arena. And the Rockets could
be without Francis when they face the high-speed Sacramento Kings
on Thursday, still seeking their first win at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Francis would not comment on the incident, which occurred with
2:57 left in the second quarter. Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said he would leave it up to the league but added that nothing
Francis did should merit a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Official Don Vaden, however, indicated he saw a punch thrown,
which would bring an automatic suspension. Mavs officials said that
after reviewing tape, officials e-mailed a description of a punch
to Rod Thorn, NBA senior vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contact was unnecessary and excessive, which constitutes
the flagrant two,'' Vaden said. ``That first contact (when Francis
hammered Nowitzki on the arm on a breakaway) was unnecessary, and
the second one (tossing Nowitzki to the floor) was excessive. The
punch had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said: ``I expect to have him, definitely. There was
no behavior that warrants a suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Rockets lost Francis for the remainder of
Tuesday's game, they were already in trouble, unable to slow the
Mavericks' break or to make the sort of shots they would like to
find every night.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a team that had beaten only the Magic and Warriors
(twice), the Rockets collected worsts like an 11-year-old hoarding
Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   Against a Mavericks team that has been the fourth-worst in the
NBA in field-goal defense, the Rockets made just 34 of 92 shots (37
percent), their worst shooting night of the season. They matched
that with their worst free-throw shooting night, making just 22 of
35 free throws (62.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   And they allowed more fast-break points than in any game this
season (37).
</P>
<P>
   ``You give up 37 points on fast breaks and can't make layups and
wide-open shots and free throws, that's what you get,'' Tomjanovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Rockets got the sort of shots they wanted,
Tomjanovich said: ``Layups. We were right on top of the basket. And
free throws. They must charge for them here in Dallas. We didn't
take advantage of the free ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley made just one of seven shots and was held to
seven points. After making his first five shots, Hakeem Olajuwon
made just one of his next five and had 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Drew, who played the rest of the night after Francis'
ejection, made just five of 18 shots to lead the team with 15
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just shot the ball horribly,'' Drew said. ``They all felt
good. They just didn't go in. I've never gotten better looks than
that. So many jumpers, pull-ups, things I normally make. Everything
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets' offense might not have been their greatest
problem. The Mavs beat them down the court from the outset. Michael
Finley and Cedric Ceballos repeatedly set up with good position in
transition.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Mavericks did not beat the Rockets on the break,
Robert Pack darted around screens to get in the lane or burn the
Rockets' rotations with passes.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had 28 points on 12-of-17 shooting to go with season
highs for rebounds (13) and assists (seven). Ceballos had 19 off
the bench. Pack had 10 of the Mavericks' season-best 29 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing playground ball,'' Barkley said. ``They
didn't want us to set up in the half-court set. They were just
getting it and running it down our throats. They were playing like
they were playing in a rec league. They were just running and
gunning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to win for them that often. It worked against
us. But it worked better because Steve was out of the game. As well
as they played, they were only up six or seven points late in the
third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Rockets began to fall apart in the third quarter,
almost duplicating the fourth-quarter collapse of the night before.
Trailing 64-58, the Rockets missed consecutive free throws, as they
had Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They then began clanging outside shots, as they had Monday. Drew
missed consecutive wide-open 3s. Barkley missed a jumper. Walt
Williams missed a layup.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Rockets moved on to turnovers, losing the ball
on three consecutive trips down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs' Sean Rooks had a three-point play and Finley hit a
jumper to push the lead to 69-58. By the end of the quarter, the
Mavericks led by 13, had outscored the Rockets 34-2 on fast breaks
and were getting inside with ease. And all this was before the
nightly fourth-quarter offensive meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   That came quickly and predictably. The Rockets made just one of
their first nine shots and had two turnovers to begin the quarter.
By the time Barkley and Olajuwon got up to return to the game, the
Rockets were down by 20.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Thomas Hamilton drove for a lefthanded layup and the
first Rockets basket of the quarter, the Mavericks had pushed their
lead to 26 and Olajuwon and Barkley were back on the bench resting
for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And if Tomjanovich had not quite seen it all in nine games, he
knew he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of things already in this short season. It's
enough already,'' he said with a chuckle. ``That's not the laugh of
something funny. That's a guy ready to be fitted for a
straitjacket.''

DODGERS COULD SEND VALDES TO BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers already pulled off the blockbuster
trade of the offseason, sending disgruntled outfielder Raul Mondesi
to Toronto for Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   They have now laid the groundwork for another high-profile deal
involving right-hander Ismael Valdes. Sources said the Dodgers and
Boston Red Sox are working on a deal to send Valdes to Boston for
pitcher Jin Ho Cho and infield prospect Adam Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Valdes' immense potential, the new Dodgers regime
believes the past rap on the 26-year-old. Valdes went 9-14 with a
3.98 ERA, but was criticized harshly by pitching coach Claude
Osteen for not being tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what a lot of teams are doing is just getting into
position for the winter meetings,'' said Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone, who won't talk about specific trades. ``I don't think
you'll see much until then.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the St. Louis Cardinals and Colorado Rockies pulled
off a seven-player deal that included two of the pitchers the
Dodgers eyed from the Cardinals, a deal that would include Dodgers
second baseman Eric Young is still possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals and Dodgers talked about either Manny Aybar or
Jose Jimenez in a deal for Young, but both were sent to Colorado as
part of a seven-player trade Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said the Dodgers also would trade Young for one-time
Philadelphia closer Ricky Bottalico. He would fill one of the
Dodgers' top needs, a power pitcher in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had shown interest in making a multi-player trade
with the Dodgers that would also include Valdes, but after trading
for Pat Hentgen and now Darryl Kile, the Cardinals no longer are
actively pursuing starters, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers can move Young and Valdes, both considered
offseason priorities, they would cut nearly $11 million of payroll
for next season. Young is set to make $4.5 million in each of the
next two years, and Valdes is eligible for arbitration and likely
to make approximately $6 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It would drop the Dodgers' payroll to near the mid-$80 million
range.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it leaves them in an awkward situation if they lose third
baseman Adrian Beltre, whose agent, Scott Boras, petitioned the
commissioner's office to have Beltre declared a free agent. Boras
said the Dodgers signed Beltre when he was 15, a breach of Major
League Baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   If Beltre is given free-agent status, it could leave a gaping
hole the Dodgers may be unable to fill. The commissioner's office
could also keep the Dodgers from negotiating with Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you there's 50 ballplayers in the major leagues that
have signed illegally,'' Lasorda said during a news conference
honoring one of his former players, New York Mets manager Bobby
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was done illegally, they gave the birth certificate to
us, which simply means that they knew that he wasn't the right
age,'' Lasorda said. ``Why should he be able to go out into the
world and make millions of dollars?''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing they may lose Beltre, the Dodgers have turned to free
agent and former Dodger Todd Zeile. Sources said Zeile's agent,
Seth Levinson, spoke with Malone and Dodgers chairman and CEO Bob
Daly numerous times Tuesday. But time and money is working against
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can't afford to pay a huge contract, but Zeile is in
the market for one. The Van Nuys native and Thousand Oaks resident
is 34, and this could be his last big payday. After driving in more
than 90 runs in each of the past four seasons, and coming off a
year in which he hit .293 with 25 homers and 95 RBI for the Texas
Rangers and was paid $3.2 million, sources said it's unlikely he'll
sign for anything less $5 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   The same sources say Zeile is close to re-signing with the
Rangers, which could happen as early as today. It is believed to be
at least a three-year deal with an option for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: While most of the elite organizations eye Japanese closer
Kazuhiro Sasaki, the Dodgers can do nothing but scout him. As a
penalty for illegally signing two Cuban players, the Dodgers can't
sign a foreign player until January. But Sasaki may wait until the
New Year to sign.... With Dodger Stadium undergoing extensive
renovations, the club will soon announce its annual winter workouts
will be held at USC.

USC GIVES TOLEDO MORE AMMUNITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's rivalry week, and right on schedule, the war
of words has begun.
</P>
<P>
   USC free safety David Gibson, when asked about UCLA's eight-game
winning streak in the crosstown series, provided Bruins coach Bob
Toledo with one of his favorite pastimes: collecting bulletin board
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate seeing Bob Toledo on the sideline with his arms
raised in the air,'' Gibson said. ``When I see UCLA, there's a
silent, cocky demeanor. I don't think they've had much class about
the streak. I have a strong dislike for UCLA. The
self-righteousness on that sideline gets to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can live with myself if I can't say I beat
UCLA, and it's a ninth loss in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also some disagreement between Toledo and USC coach
Paul Hackett regarding which team had more pressure on it going
into Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot more pressure on them than us. They have
got to stop the streak. We've had the streak,'' Toledo said. ``I
think there's so much pressure to `Stop the streak, Stop the
streak.' We'll just go out, have fun and try to keep the streak
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett seemed taken aback by the comments when informed of them
during Tuesday's press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? He doesn't mind being 4-7? That's a bunch of B.S.,''
Hackett said. ``I wonder if you polled the seniors if they felt the
same way. USC-UCLA is always pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to be the team that kept the streak going? Do you
want to be the team that couldn't keep streak going? Maybe there is
a little more pressure on the team that has to break the streak.
This is big. We've been waiting for this for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Hackett added to his feelings on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob says it's all on us, great. This is not about Bob Toledo,
it's about USC and the senior class. We've been talking about it
for a year. It's a huge deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson on fans: Gibson also had some terse comments for USC's
fans, stating that the Trojans would be better than 4-6 this season
if there were larger crowds at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   USC's largest crowd this season has been 57,494, with a low of
43,795.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee this team would play better if we'd gotten
more support,'' Gibson said. ``It brings energy to have that
support. They're front-runners. When we're doing well, they'll be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows the importance of this Saturday's game with the
above-mentioned fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating UCLA, as far as the alumni's standpoint would make
everything all right,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dumb question: Hackett should be applauded for keeping a
straight face when a reporter asked him if injured quarterback
Carson Palmer would redshirt this season. Or if he would play
against Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had already been declared out for the season Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Football alumni banquet: The Trojan Football Alumni Club is
holding its 44th annual pre-UCLA fall banquet Thursday at the Grace
Simon Lodge in Elysian Park. Festivities begin at 6 p.m. and all
former football players are invited. Information: (310) 831-1255.
</P>
<P>
   Grain out: Offensive guard Jason Grain, who is recovering from
knee surgery, will not be available. Wide receiver R. Jay Soward
and tight end Antoine Harris, who have strained hamstrings, are
expected to play.

A FINN FINALLY SLIPS INTO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly five months after signing with the Kings,
Finnish defenseman Jere Karalahti arrived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is when the 24-year-old will join the Kings.
Karalahti says he'd like to during the three-game homestand that
ends Saturday. Kings coach Andy Murray says there is no timetable.
General manager Dave Taylor said Karalahti will be with the Kings
beginning Thursday, but when he debuts is up to Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti plans to be on the ice with the Kings for the first
time during Thursday's morning skate. Whether he plays that night
against Phoenix is another issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to me,'' Karalahti said. ``If I play at my level and
play like I can play, I have a good chance to make the team. I'm
ready to play. It's a different hockey game here, but I don't think
it's going to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever may be the case, the answer will begin to work itself
out today when Karalahti plays for the Kings' International League
affiliate in Long Beach. Murray and Taylor are expected to be in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for a player to get into the lineup,'' Murray said.
``He's a great European player. We have to see how he plays here.
It all depends on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti, a 6-foot-2, 210-pounder, spent parts of the last
seven seasons with IFK Helsinki of the Finnish Elite League. He
said he's in fine shape after playing this past weekend, though
fatigued after a 20-hour journey to the States.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, however, brought an end to a frustrating battle of red
tape. A few years ago, he was arrested for possession of drugs and
admitted to using. It made it difficult for him to obtain a work
visa, which he recently secured.
</P>
<P>
   But breaking into the Kings' lineup, considering how well
they've played, could be tough. Murray doesn't like to shake things
up, but when Karalahti plays, he's expected to add a physical
presence to the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a pretty good all-around game,'' Taylor said. ``He's
good on the power play, has a big shot. He's best described as
steady. He has a little bit of a physical edge, plays with a bit of
a bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, Robitaille not close: Not that it matters as much since
Jamie Storr is playing so well, but goalie Stephane Fiset (right
hand contusion) may not be ready to return to the Kings until they
play in Colorado next Tuesday, if then.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Fiset was ``at least a week away, maybe longer,''
which could keep him out of the next four games. The Kings play
Colorado and Dallas on back-to-back nights before returning home to
play San Jose on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, injured left winger Luc Robitaille (fractured left
foot) could still be three weeks away from returning despite being
off crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be the full six weeks,'' Murray said. ``I know
Luc was optimistic about it, but he's still three weeks away.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's injury was detected Nov. 6, the same day it was
discovered center Jozef Stumpel (hernia) would miss two to three
months. Stumpel is slated to begin working out later this week, but
his return date remains the same.

WOMAN ON MIDTOWN STREET IS HIT BY MAN WITH A BRICK
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout; adds byline)  
(sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 27-year-old woman returning from an office errand
was smashed in the head with a brick and left critically injured on
a bustling midtown sidewalk on Tuesday afternoon by a man who then
ran off, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Nicole Barrett of Queens, underwent two brain
surgeries at Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday night and was
expected to survive, one of her neurosurgeons said. A CAT scan of
Ms. Barrett's brain ``looked pretty good,'' said the surgeon, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they had no suspects in the attack, an
apparently random act that took place in front of a street full of
horrified witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, a temporary worker on the last day of a job
assignment at Taylor Gray employment agency on East 42nd Street,
was walking at the corner of East 42nd and Madison Avenue about
3:10 p.m. when a man in his 40s walked up behind her, a law
enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word, the man brought a large gray paving stone down
on the back of her head, then ran north up Madison Avenue as Ms.
Barrett slumped to the ground unconscious, witnesses told the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was black, about 5 feet 4 inches tall, with a white
beard and close-cropped hair, wearing a dark jacket and blue jeans,
turned west on 43rd Street and disappeared into the crowd,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, a native of Athens, Texas, a town of about 15,000
an hour's drive southeast of Dallas, moved to New York City a year
and a half ago, a law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor of her parents in Athens said that they planned to
catch a 6 a.m. flight from Dallas on Wednesday morning to be with
their daughter. The neighbor, Joyce Barrett, who is not related to
Nicole's family, said that Nicole's mother, Sharon, was concerned
but hopeful. ``She was upset, but she was pretty calm,'' Joyce
Barrett said. ``She's kind of nervous and wringing her hands. I'm
surprised she's even functioning at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack against Nicole Barrett was a reminder of just how
senselessly violent life in New York City can still be despite a
decrease in crime in recent years. It brought to mind other attacks
in public places like the death earlier this year of Kendra
Webdale, who was standing on a subway platform when a mentally ill
man pushed her in front of a train.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rhyme or reason to this,'' said a man who described
himself as Ms. Barrett's boyfriend, but would not identify himself.
He and several friends visited her at the hospital for several
hours on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear last night if anyone on the street had tried to
stop Ms. Barrett's attacker. A man working in a newsstand a few
feet away said he heard a commotion and ambulances but did not
leave his perch to see what was the matter. ``We don't look out
from here,'' said the man, who would not give his name. ``The
moment we look out, people start taking things. Our business is in
here. Not out there.''

HERMOSILLO HAS DECISIONS TO MAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Carlos Hermosillo has been all smiles this
week. He's shaking hands, posing for pictures and is usually the
last to leave training.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's savoring every minute before Sunday's Major League
Soccer championship match against D.C. United in Foxboro, Mass.,
because he's ready to leave the Los Angeles Galaxy and finish his
career in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo is only 34 goals shy of becoming Mexico's scoring
champion and, at age 35, playing in two leagues could hurt his
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are various aspects going into my decision,'' Hermosillo
said. ``My train of thought is that I'll never stop wanting to play
here. But obviously, I have to make a decision with my goals in
Mexico and breaking the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now is not the time to talk about it. We're trying to win
a championship. After the game, I'll start thinking about my
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be another factor to explain Hermosillo's relaxed
demeanor. He is peaking. After going through a period in which he
scored just two goals in 10 games, Hermosillo scored three in the
Western Conference finals against Dallas to become the Galaxy's
playoff scoring leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``His confidence is certainly back because he's getting goals,''
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. ``The thing he's really done so
superbly over the last few games is just his work rate. That's
where the goals are coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also helped us defend and, as a result of that, he puts
our team in a better position when we're regaining the ball, which
is going to make it easier for him to score goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also been invaluable because of his big-game experience.
He's been in these kind of battles and championship games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo admitted that his confidence was rattled heading into
the playoffs. But now, that problem has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lost confidence in myself and the league, being the top
goal scorer in Mexico but having trouble here,'' Hermosillo said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Hermosillo is respected much like Michael Jordan or
John Elway were here. But in MLS, he had been in a rut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only human,'' Hermosillo said. ``It's nice to have that
human contact, to have someone saying you're doing a great job
again. It has helped my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the game has been Hermosillo's biggest adjustment.
In Mexico, he's a post-up target, where the team focuses on getting
him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   With the Galaxy, he's just another piece on the front-line with
speedsters Cobi Jones and Clint Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasized trying to get him the ball around the 18
(yard-line), but it wasn't like we set up practices specifically
for that,'' Schmid said. ``The service guys have been finding him,
but they're finding him because he's been far more active lately.
His activity level has helped more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dallas series, Hermosillo was working both sides of the
field, hurrying to get in scoring positions. Two of his goals were
opportunistic; he was in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All great strikers in the world go through ebbs and flows like
that, and it can be frustrating,'' Schmid said. ``If strikers don't
get goals, everybody looks at them very critically. And when they
get goals, they're playing with a lot of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big mind game that they have to figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo has done that. Now, he just has to figure out whether
to return to the Galaxy next season.

KINGS HOLD OFF BLACKHAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is not how the Los Angeles Kings built the
best record in hockey, not why first-year coach Andy Murray is the
early front-runner for coach of the year.
 &UR;  &LR; This is not what will draw fans, intoxicated by glitz and
underappreciative of blue-collar effort, to games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did everything possible to lose. They sat on an early
lead, were nearly defenseless as Chicago fired 23 shots at goalie
Jamie Storr in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they did the unexpected, at least for the Kings teams past.
They held on for a 3-2 win in front of a season-low 12,980 fans
Tuesday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Kings' 10th straight win against the Blackhawks dating
back to February 1997, but joy wasn't the prevailing mood
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chicago) lost a game they deserved to win,'' said Kings coach
Andy Murray, who's team was outshot 38-21. ``We weren't working, we
didn't get to loose pucks. We were skating stiff. We're not a team
that can survive if we don't have effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this isn't how the Kings have played during an
11-game streak in which they've lost just once and tied two games.
But this clearly isn't the same `ol Kings organization that usually
loses these games in dreadful fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these are the new Kings. Complaining about their effort,
admitting they were outplayed. Talking about a win, mainly because
Storr was brilliant, particularly in the third period. He finished
with 36 saves, 21 of which came in the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them every chance to win,'' Kings center Bryan
Smolinski said. ``They came hard. They were working hard because we
weren't working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings survived because Storr, now 3-0-1 since the injury to
Stephane Fiset, wouldn't cave when the rest of the Kings were
sliding backward. They had a 3-0 lead midway through the second
period, but had trouble sustaining offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks broke the shutout bid when Eric Daze flicked a
rebound through Storr's legs with 9:24 to play. They put a big
scare into the Kings when Tony Amonte scored with 58.8 seconds left
to make it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't feel like (you're under attack),'' Storr said of the
third period. ``That's what happens when a team is down. They're
going to battle and knock you back on your heels.''
</P>
<P>
   But Storr, for the umpteenth time, bailed out the Kings with a
pad save off Amonte with eight seconds left to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put yourself behind the eight-ball, it's a long way
to come back,'' Blackhawks coach Lorne Molleken said. ``They're a
good team and they work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Kings thought they deserved a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went ahead 1-0 when Vladimir Tsyplakov chipped the
rebound of Rob Blake's shot from the point past Chicago goalie
Steve Passmore at the 7:05 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles made it 2-0 when Smolinski redirected Glen Murray's
pass from the left wing boards past Passmore, and went up 3-0
midway through the second period on Donald Audette's eighth goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was also hard to tell that, at least statistically, the Kings
are the NHL's best team. They lead the league with 28 points, and
after 20 games are 12-4-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tear my team apart,'' Murray said. ``We had a
weak game. This hockey club has battled to get where we are over
this twenty-game segment. We are deserving of our position right
now in the standings.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Kings say, not deserving of a one-goal win against
the Blackhawks.

 NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The stuff people have in their basements ...
</P>
<P>
   Some folks have electric trains. Joseph Omran has the city's
first cable car operation in his basement, or at least the ghost of
the cable cars.
</P>
<P>
   Omran owns Le Beau Market at Clay and Leavenworth, atop Nob
Hill. The store's basement, or a corner of it, was the powerhouse
for Andrew Hallidie's first cable car line, the Clay Street Hill
Railroad. It opened for business Sept. 1, 1873, and ran for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   Omran shows me the cavern-like powerhouse with the original
brick vaulted ceiling, iron pillars and glass skylights and
windows. This is where the big steel wheels cranked the fabled
cables that pulled Mr. Hallidie's crazy little cars up Nob Hill
from Kearny Street, changing forever the character of the city and
jump-starting Tony Bennett's singing career.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't the Beatles get started here?
</P>
<P>
   GRAYBAR HOTEL: In the basement of the Ramada Plaza Hotel, on
Market Street just across from Civic Center Plaza, a hotel
executive wraps his arms around a brace of lockers in the employee
locker room, pulls them away from the wall and exposes a locked
door, unopened in years. Behind it is a slice of San Francisco's
past.
</P>
<P>
   It's the city jail from the earthquake days. The '06 Quake
disabled City Hall, so the government was sort of homeless until
1911, when the owners of the Whitcomb Hotel (now the Ramada), then
under construction, offered use of the building as a temp City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   What is now the Ramada's lost-and-found locker was the vault
housing San Francisco's treasury. Much of the Whitcomb's basement
became the city jail for five years. Two dark, windowless (duh,
it's the basement) cells remain, the chrome bars still shiny in the
beam of a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   No glamour slammer for S.F. in those days. And I hear the room
service sucked.
</P>
<P>
   I DON'T KNOW what's in the basement of Tommy's Joynt, Van Ness
at Geary, but I suspect that's where they keep the herd of buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Joynt was born in '47 and is still the only place in town
that serves buffalo stew and buffalo chili. And I mean from the
buffalo, not from Buffalo, as in Buffalo wings. Tommy's buffalo
don't fly or cluck.
</P>
<P>
   The place has atmosphere. Objects dangling from the ceiling
include a pi &LR; n &LR; ata and a hockey stick from the Denver Invaders,
'63-64. I'm not sure if that was a hockey team or a convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best deal in town,'' enthuses Mr. Eat, my erstwhile
pseudo-foodie and fine-dining dilettante, ``is this frosty 12-ounce
mug of beer and giant double-yolk hard-boiled egg for $2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wipe the foam off your nose, Eat,'' I reply.
</P>
<P>
   THE OLD JOINTS, if not the old Joynt, are fading fast.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not a personal medical complaint. New Joe's, on Geary
just a meatball's throw from Union Square, shut down recently.
</P>
<P>
   Same old story: Skyrocketing rent. I hear Joe's was paying
$22,000 and was facing a very stiff hike. So it took one.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful ethnic hand-gestures were exchanged, and a bit of the
old city went bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   A NEAR-DEATH dining experience: Trihack, the bon vivant cabbie,
alerts me that Harry Denton's restaurant hangs by a thread. Not
long ago at Harry's, on Steuart in the newly hip Embarcadero 'hood,
you needed a shoehorn and crowbar to get through the groovy people
in the jazz bar to a table for a superb meal.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harry's is open for continental breakfast only, and I'm not
sure which continent. A week from now, who knows, you'll walk past
and the place will be a hip little Starbucks/ Rite Aid/BofA.
</P>
<P>
   YOU WANT good news? Okay, after vandals did a major graffiti job
on the monument to the WWII cruiser San Francisco, the Land's End
park maintenance crew worked like dogs and cleaned up the mess in
about one day.
</P>
<P>
   If the paint-wielding cretins are ever caught, give 'em spray
cans and a wall and have them write 100 times the names of the 100
sailors and Marines who died on that ship 59 years ago off
Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF old ships with bad luck:
</P>
<P>
   In 1857, the Central America picked up a big load of
Forty-Niner-mined gold in Panama, headed for New York and ran into
a hurricane. The ship went down with 425 passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   The sunken treasure was salvaged 10 years ago, and now about 400
pounds of bars, dust and coins from the cache will be auctioned,
after being displayed today through Friday at Union Bank of Calif.
on California St.
</P>
<P>
   I'd get into the bidding, but I've got plenty of those coins,
collected over the years from hotel pillows.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S THE DEAL, wonders Jeff Gillenkirk, with the ad in this
paper's ``Death Notices'' section, for ``Bay Area resales _ Plots,
crypts''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like the housing crisis is spreading,'' Gillenkirk says.

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE'S WIFE COMES CLEAN 
 &HT;     BY CARLA MARINUCCI
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ When the moment came at San Francisco's
Leadership High School, Cindy McCain, wife of Republican
presidential hopeful John McCain, didn't flinch.
<P>
   ``Should marijuana be legal?'' asked sophomore Sam Heller, 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view marijuana as highly addictive,'' answered McCain. ``I
have very negative, very strong feelings about this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Heller persisted, McCain turned to him. ``Honey, I've been
there,'' she said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   For the 45-year-old McCain, the mother of four, her husband's
ascension to the status of serious contender in the 2000
presidential race has meant coming to terms and going public with
her own private troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, she became addicted to prescription drugs
following back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in recovery,'' she told the classroom, as students
listened in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part for me was admitting, eight years ago, when I
had a problem,'' she said in an interview later. ``I was adept at
hiding what I was doing. ... It was very hard facing my husband. I
didn't want to let him down. I felt that I failed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain, who has been described as shy, more comfortable at
home and a ``reluctant campaigner,'' projected more of her
husband's polished, go-get-'em style in her visit to San Francisco
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She has watched her husband, an Arizona senator, go from a mere
asterisk to become the Republican challenger to watch. He is now
dead even in the polls with Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New
Hampshire, the state with the first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to predict we'll pass him (in the New Hampshire
polls) next week,'' she told a crowd of 70 enthusiastic McCain
supporters during a luncheon Tuesday at the Bank of America
building. ``There is a difference in experience.''
</P>
<P>
   At Leadership High School, San Francisco's only public charter
high school, the former special education teacher plunged into
classrooms, asking questions and giving students an honest
assessment of campaign life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start to run for the presidency, there's no manual,''
she told them. ``Being part of the solution is exciting. But it has
its down days ... days when I'd rather pull the covers over my head
and say, `I don't want to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   When she didn't know an answer to their queries, she picked up
her cell phone to get them _ from the candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know if you favor the death penalty for youth
offenders,'' she asked the senator, reached in his hotel room on a
break. (Answer: He favors the death penalty, and letting states
determine how to carry it out.)
</P>
<P>
   And later, she talked frankly of the effects of the national
spotlight on her children and her husband, who has been accused of
having a volcanic temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen the temper. I've never witnessed these
explosions ... and I've been married to him 20 years. So I find
this kind of humorous, in a way,'' she said. ``He's a passionate
man, there's no doubt about it. ... He wants people to understand
where he's coming from. ... I do think it's a bad rap.''
</P>
<P>
   She's pleased her husband's book, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' has
been on best-seller lists for nine weeks, but she said some parts _
like the chapter in which McCain recalls his passion for an exotic
dancer known as the Flame of Florida _ aren't especially suitable
for her kids. She only let them listen to the abridged version, on
tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't need to hear all of it,'' she said, laughing.
``There wasn't anything in the book I didn't know. But it is funny
to read it in print.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a very public campaign, Cindy McCain still holds some
things close to the vest.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't volunteer that she recently returned from Europe on a
medical mission _ personally escorting a blind 19-year-old
Ukrainian girl named Marina to Phoenix so she could undergo an
operation to give her sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that drives me, that means a lot to me,'' she
said, when questioned about the work. ``I'd like to continue to do
these things. ... As first lady, I'd hope that I could.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest trip was one of dozens of similar missions she's
undertaken in the past 15 years as part of her work heading her
Helmsley Family Foundation. She's flown overseas to assist a
Croatian solder who took shrapnel in his face, a Vietnamese baby
with a cleft palate and a young boy with a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable saying we could help them and not go
get them. Most of them have never been out of their villages, and
I'm a mother,'' she said. ``I feel more comfortable making sure
they're comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   As first lady, she said, she would also promote adoption. The
McCains adopted an infant from Bangladesh with a cleft palate;
their daughter, Bridget, is now 8.
</P>
<P>
   And she now gets a lot of mail from people who want her to
continue to talk about drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an adventure that she says is both exhilarating and
incredibly tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's always difficult for me,'' she said, in an interview
with The Chronicle. ``And if the moment comes when I don't find it
difficult to talk about what happens _ then I've got another
problem,'' she said. ``The daily discussion is good, because that
keeps me in recovery. It keeps me focused. Because for anybody in
recovery, addiction is a fine line.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, this was good,'' she said of the race. ``Now I
have the opportunity to help others ... and what else could you ask
for?''  &LR;

 THE PUSH OF TECHNOLOGY, THE PULL OF SONGWRITING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (In fourth from last graf, corrects date of Beck CD ``Odelay'' to (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the slapback echo that enhanced Elvis Presley's first
records in Memphis, to the computerized sounds that regularly spice
today's hip-hop CDs, this century has seen a roller-coaster ride of
music mixed with technology. Some might also call it a love-hate
affair, as artists and consumers have been drawn to technology,
then repelled by it, then drawn back _ back and forth, like a
yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   The songwriter is still the primary shaper of music _ from
Jimmie Rodgers and Robert Johnson to Muddy Waters and John Lennon,
from Joni Mitchell to Alanis Morissette, from James Brown to Puff
Daddy, from Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen, from Johnny Rotten to
Kurt Cobain _ but the ways musicians can present their songs on
stage and in the studio have changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidity of technological advances has made careers in the
blink of an eye, and destroyed them just as quickly, once the
technology has become obsolete. Remember Human League, the avatars
of synth-pop in the early '80s? Remember quadrophonic sound?
Remember those disco productions? Two-track recordings? Talk boxes?
All those have gone the way of the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   The new buzz words are loops, autotuners, Pro Tools, and ISDN
lines, which bounce off satellites and allow Barbra Streisand, for
instance, to sit at her Malibu beach home and listen to mixes of
her album beamed to her from a New York studio. And in real time,
no less.
</P>
<P>
   To use or not to use _ that's the question artists have faced in
dealing with technology since the dawn of the rock era in the '50s,
back when Les Paul refined the electric guitar and invented
overdubbing and tape echo.
</P>
<P>
   Some have gone overboard with special effects _ think back to
the first $1 million studio album, Fleetwood Mac's bloated ``Tusk''
in 1979 _ while others have gone the minimalist route, such as
Boston's Godsmack, which made its self-titled, near-double-platinum
CD for just $5,000 last year. The century has shown that there's no
one route to success _ which is what is so fascinating and so
dangerously addictive about the pop business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are records that someone made in a basement that sound
great, and some made for a million dollars that sound terrible,''
says Mike Denneen, owner of Q Division studio in Boston and
producer of records for Aimee Mann, Letters to Cleo, Guster, and
Gigolo Aunts, among others.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to say that artists are always able to choose
their methods of recording, but that isn't true in this century and
not likely to be true in the next, either. The likes of Springsteen
and Michael Jackson can do what they want, based on prior success,
but many new acts have been stuck with producers chosen by their
record labels. The result can be gimmicky studio sounds layered
into their records whether the acts want them or not. Thus, we've
had a century of bands often apologizing for their records, saying
instead, ``Come see us live. That's where you'll see the real us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not always true, either, of course. The proliferation of
backing tapes _ kicked into high gear by Madonna and Janet Jackson
_ has made some concerts a disquieting study in artifice. That's
hardly what the founding fathers of rock _ Presley, Jerry Lee
Lewis, Little Richard, Big Joe Turner, Johnny Cash, and Roy Orbison
_ had in mind. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wonderful accidents &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But technology has also prompted some wonderful accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology gets developed to serve music, but people will find
uses and ways for it that are different from how it was
conceived,'' says Bob Weir, the longtime Grateful Dead
singer/guitarist. ``Look at guys like Muddy Waters in the late '40s
and '50s who took their amps and cranked them all the way up. You'd
think you would get a distorted sound, but he and some of his
Chicago friends got a great sound that became the future of the
blues, then of rock.'' (As Waters sang, ``The blues had a baby and
they called it rock 'n' roll.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Grateful Dead are a marvelous example of a band that often
took a minimalist approach in the studio _ recording some albums
that explored sparse folk and country-blues _ but a maximalist
approach on stage. They pioneered large, stadium-ready sound
systems; in their later years, they were among the first to of
high-tech miniature monitors that fit inside the ears of musicians
to help them hear each other better, replacing the outmoded monitor
speakers that once cluttered the stage floor.
</P>
<P>
   As for performance quality, the century's advances can be summed
up by contrasting the Beatles' show at Shea Stadium in 1966, which
few fans heard because of the inferiority of the speaker system, to
later stadium shows by Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, and U2,
which required up to 15 trucks of equipment. The last Rolling
Stones tour featured the best, most equalized sound ever heard in a
stadium setting.
</P>
<P>
   Again, some acts have gone overboard with concert presentation.
But then, fans have come to expect that from pop stars ever since,
in the wake of Woodstock '69, the music became big business. The
'80s saw Michael Jackson using $500,000 robotic spiders on stage
during the ``Victory'' tour that followed his 40-million-selling
``Thriller'' album. The Stones used cherry pickers and metal
bridges. Pink Floyd erected a towering video screen and oversized
mirror ball rising from the middle of the crowd. And U2's last tour
featured a large LED (light-emitting diode) screen and a space
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Rock as fantasy and apocalypse _ it's all been done, as stage
shows have evolved from the barroom roots of the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Today's fin de siecle concerts also feature wireless
microphones, headset mikes (pioneered by Peter Gabriel and used
extensively by Garth Brooks), hydraulically lifted stage props,
computerized Vari-lites, and ceiling harnesses that hoist teen
idols like 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys high above the
audience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Music as spectacle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The public has become so accustomed to music as spectacle and
special effect that even many of today's club acts have to bring
along separate sound and lighting engineers. It's costly, but
necessary, to hold the attention of a generation that can quote
chapter and verse from the satirical rock film ``This Is Spinal
Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lion's share of advances have been in the studio.
Presley and other Memphis titans recorded in mono at Sam Phillips's
Sun Studio in the mid-'50s. Then came the three-track studio
consoles used when producer Phil Spector forged his ``wall of
sound'' pop records. And then came the adrenaline rush of the
Beatles (and producer George Martin), who went from four-track
recording on the breakthrough ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band'' (1967) to the first eight-track album, ``Abbey Road''
(1969).
</P>
<P>
   Technology then became a runaway express. The '70s saw the
influx of 16-track recordings, popularized by Steely Dan, then
24-track in the late '70s. There were even a few 40-track consoles.
These, according to Carl Beatty, who teaches recording engineering
at Berklee College of Music, were used by Leon Russell (who would
ask a backup singer to layer 30 tracks of vocals behind his own)
and the British art-pop group, 10cc, whose 1975 hit, ``I'm Not in
Love,'' was similarly layered. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Music's mood swings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But pop music, being the cyclical beast that it is, swung back
to a minimal use of technology espoused by the punk bands of the
late '70s, such as the Sex Pistols and the Ramones. They didn't
even like guitar solos, labeling them too indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s saw a return to lush productions, along with the
synth-pop era (whose demise was forecast by Keith Richards in 1983
when he said, ``All those new effects you could get two or three
years ago _ everybody has heard them now''). A new backlash led to
a surge of stripped-down acoustic records, such as Springsteen's
``Nebraska'' and Tracy Chapman's self-titled debut, whose songs had
been developed when she was a Tufts University student singing in
the streets of Harvard Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a cycle of audiences wanting performers to be
larger than life and different from them, to be glamorous like
Mariah Carey,'' says producer Denneen. ``And then a cycle of
audiences saying, `No, we want performers to be just like us,
because anybody can be in a band.' You see that cycle repeated
constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came digital sound _ leading up to the 48-track digital
recordings that are popular today _ with its own inevitable
counter-reaction in the grunge era of the early '90s. That was
spearheaded by Kurt Cobain's Nirvana and other Seattle groups such
as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. They restored the
primacy of the electric guitar, along with lyrics that came from
the street and from the heart, not from some pompous songwriting
hack.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of hip-hop was also sparked by technology. Sampling
devices enabled rappers to set up computerized beats and edit
sampled sounds plucked from soul pioneers from James Brown to
George Clinton's P-Funk. Pop fusionist Beck made this approach
palatable to rock audiences in his landmark ``Odelay'' CD in 1996.
It was a sonic collage of surprises, such as applying hip-hop beats
to a country melody.
</P>
<P>
   As the new millennium approaches, there's now a device called
the autotuner, which corrects the pitch of a singer, both in the
studio and in concert. It was used by Cher on her recent album,
which shouldn't surprise anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The brightest hope for the next millennium is the way that costs
have decreased in recording studios, enabling young bands to make
records that sound just as good as those made by superstars. A
company called Tascam will soon market a digital, 24-track
hard-disc recorder for just $4,000, which could render high-priced
studios obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the cost structure changing the industry, because it's
getting so unbelievably cheap,'' says Berklee engineer Beatty.
``It's a fertile period. Things are happening so fast.''

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHBRIDGE, Mass. _ One day two years ago, James Knott was in
his office talking on the telephone when he noticed something
unusual happening in the lobby of Riverdale Mills, his wire-mesh
manufacturing plant here.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked out, Knott saw nearly two dozen people, including
several men wearing dark jackets with bold ``US AGENT'' lettering
on their backs. Over the next seven hours, the agents, armed with
9mm semiautomatic pistols, seized boxes of documents from file
cabinets and desks.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Knott was incredulous as he watched the scene
unfold. In 1979, he'd bought this forgotten mill on the Blackstone
River, 13 miles southeast of Worcester, pumped his own money into
it, and over the next 20 years turned the granite and red-brick
complex into the town's largest employer. The plastic-coated wire
mesh that Knott invented is used to make lobster traps all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched the agents question his employees, Knott wondered
what he could have done to invite a raid of his company. Nearly a
year later, on Aug. 12, 1998, he had his answer. Knott was indicted
on two counts of violating the Clean Water Act for allegedly
pumping highly acidic water into the town sewerage system.
</P>
<P>
   In separate press releases, US Attorney Donald K. Stern and the
Boston office of the Environmental Protection Agency condemned
Knott, warning that a conviction could result in up to six years in
prison and a $1.5 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Knott fought back and has turned the tables on his accusers.
The charges against him were later dropped, and today it is the
federal government that sits in court as a defendant, forced to
explain its pursuit of Knott, and allegations that some agents
manufactured and withheld evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Knott case shines a light on the relatively unknown work of
200 EPA criminal agents who pursue polluters nationwide. The group
has been responsible for some high-profile prosecutions, and the
work of several agents has been praised both in New England and
nationally. But there are also accusations that some agents have
bullied targets of their investigations, padding enforcement
statistics on the backs of small business owners accused of minor
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting the environment is obviously one of the most
important jobs our government can do,'' said Judson Starr, a
Washington lawyer who defends companies accused of environmental
crimes and once served as chief environmental prosecutor in the
Justice Department. ``But for some, extremism is no vice in
protecting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive tone
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The brochure touting the criminal investigation division of the
EPA features three photographs of agents holding semiautomatic
handguns in the firing position. To those critical of the division,
the brochure sets the tone for a level of enforcement that is
disproportionate to the crimes alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental crimes are different: They almost never involve
defendants with histories of violence or prior criminal activity.
The polluters are frequently corporations and search warrants are
sometimes executed in company offices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the EPA often sends in large numbers of armed agents to
serve the warrants. ``It's ridiculous,'' said one EPA agent, who
asked not to be identified. ``Everyone stands around and talks
about why so many of us are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA criminal unit is reviewing its search warrant
procedures, having established an advisory group earlier this year
to make recommendations. The agency withheld records relating to
the work of the advisory group when the Globe requested them under
the Freedom of Information Act. The EPA said producing the records
``could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Knott complained that his employees were repeatedly videotaped
and photographed during the execution of the search warrant. One
agent, according to court papers, allegedly told an employee,
``Answer my questions or you will be obstructing justice. If you
refuse to answer, you will be taken to court and you will have to
pay your own legal fees.''
</P>
<P>
   The files of the EPA criminal investigation unit also contain
complaints of inappropriate behavior, according to records the
agency did release under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lowrance, the EPA's deputy administrator for enforcement,
said it is not unusual for those targeted by investigators to
complain they were mistreated or that agents acted inappropriately.
``I have been involved in the investigation of some of those
allegations and the vast majority have proven absolutely false,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Pineville, La., last year complained that EPA
agents were threatening employees of the city sewer department with
indictments and jail time. ``They are asking our employees who they
are voting for in the mayor's election and using a strong-arm
approach that if they `come clean' they will not be prosecuted,''
Mayor Fred Baden said.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Maurice Hinchey, a New York Democrat, said he
was disappointed with both the level of competence and
professionalism of EPA criminal agents when he turned to the agency

hazardous-waste dumping was fouling the ground water. The EPA, he

   ``It was the carelessness, the unprofessionalism, the lack of
attention to detail, lack of communication. The way they carried

uniformity in approaches. . .adhering to a high level of
professional standards. This is important police work.''

   Knott has never been bashful about taking on the government. For
many years he had questioned the regulators who showed up at his
mill, and disputed government interpretations of various laws. In
1993, he was cited for failing to get a town permit for a private
well at the plant, and in 1995 for failing to properly mark and
cover barrels of waste oil. But Knott also insists he is both
serious and sensitive to environmental concerns at his plant.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, he points to an award his company received in
September from Governor Paul Cellucci for outstanding achievement
in reducing the use of toxins. The state lauded Riverdale Mills for
inventing and designing a system to eliminate solvents in the
manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA became interested in Knott two years ago, when it said
it received an anonymous tip from a mill employee that the plant
wastewater treatment system was inoperable and the facility was
sending acidic water into the town sewerage system _ a violation of
the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   When agents searched the mill, they said they found that
wastewater was being diverted past the plant's treatment system and
that key parts of the system had been dismantled. Knott denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors tested the wastewater at the mill in October 1997 and
again in November of that year. They focused their efforts on what
they called ``Manhole 1,'' which was located on the street just
outside the plant. They did additional testing at ``Manhole 2,''
which was 303 feet away. Both manholes are located on property
owned by Knott. The second manhole is located next to where the
wastewater from Riverdale Mills enters the town sewerage system.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA, dozens of tests at Manhole 1 revealed
highly acidic wastewater that violated clean-water standards. But
the investigators performed only a handful of tests at Manhole 2.
</P>
<P>
   As Knott and his attorney analyzed the EPA's test data, they
were troubled by the way investigators recorded the only result at
the second manhole that violated the law. The number ``7'' looked
as if it had been changed to ``4.'' The change was significant
because a 7 indicated a pH range within legal limits (PH measures
the acid level of water). A reading below 5 indicates the water is
too acidic and could threaten plants and fish. So a reading of 4
was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Knott hired a former FBI handwriting expert. As EPA
agents watched, David P. Grimes examined the original test results.
He said his examination of the documents ``revealed alterations,
overwriting of numerals and letters, and strikeovers without proper
initials for correction.'' He noted ``a numeral having a formation
similar to the sevens in the notes was changed to a numeral four.''

<P>
   Two weeks later, US District Court Judge Nathaniel Gorton threw
out the test results without ruling on the allegation the results
were changed. Gorton said the EPA took samples on the Riverdale
Mills property without informing Knott, even after agreeing to do
the work in the company of a mill employee.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case largely hinged on those two days of pH
testing in 1997. The judge's ruling eliminated one day of testing
as evidence, weakening the case.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 23, the government withdrew its case against
Knott before trial. Knott's attorney, Warren Miller of Boston,
received a fax saying: ``The United States submits that it has
determined, in preparing for trial, that the evidence to support
the counts of the indictment is insufficient to sustain the
government's burden of proof.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dismissal did not end the Knott case. On June 3, 1999,
Assistant US Attorney Jeanne M. Kempthorne, now chief of the
corruption unit, sent a letter to Judge Gorton revealing that
crucial information was withheld from the affidavit supporting a
second search warrant at the mill in July 1998. EPA agent Stephen
Creavin, she wrote, ``omitted certain facts'' from his affidavit.
What Creavin failed to disclose was information that Knott says
exonerates him. The affidavit did not include test results from
November 1997 showing that wastewater at the second manhole _ the
one closest to where the mill wastewater entered the town system _
met all standards.
</P>
<P>
   Knott said the indictment against him has not only damaged his
reputation, but threatened his business. A BankBoston loan officer
threatened to cancel a $2 million loan agreement because of concern
about the potential $1.5 million fine, said Knott. He said he has
spent $225,000 on legal fees and expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Knott filed a Hyde Amendment complaint, which allows
the subject of a criminal case to collect attorney's fees and other
expenses if the government action is ``vexatious, frivolous, and in
bad faith.'' The case is pending. Knott has also filed a separate
claim for $2.51 million in damages under the Federal Tort Claims
Act, alleging Creavin withheld evidence and falsely accused him of
fouling local waters.
</P>
<P>
   In his complaint, Knott alleges that there was never any
credible evidence to support the charges against him. An
engineering professor he hired from Worcester Polytechnic
Institute, James O'Shaughnessey, re-created the plant conditions on
the days the EPA agents tested. Even assuming the plant's internal
treatment system wasn't working, the tests performed by the
professor indicate that the lowest possible pH level of the
wastewater produced at the plant was 6.5, still within legal
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``How, then, could the EPA agents have recorded pH of less than
5.0 at manhole No. 1?,'' Knott's complaint against the government
states. ``Only by the use of inaccurate equipment, incompetent
testing, or deliberate falsification.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it dismissed the case against Knott, the EPA and US
attorney's office in Boston insist Knott did violate the Clean
Water Act. ``James Knott disconnected a pretreatment system,'' said
Sam Silverman, an enforcement lawyer with the Boston EPA.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing last month in response to Knott's complaint against
the government, David M. Uhlman, the assistant chief of the
Environmental Crimes Section at the Department of Justice in
Washington, wrote ``there was at the time of the indictment and
there remains today a substantial basis for the government's
contention that (Knott) committed the crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the government has denied that any of its agents
acted inappropriately or falsified documents in the case against
Knott. The decision to dismiss the case was simply a matter of
prosecutorial discretion, the government said, and not the result
of ``malicious or wanton'' conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Knott, however, suspects the case against him was a bit of
bureaucratic payback. As the government provided Knott with files
related to the case during the discovery process, his lawyer came
across a copy of a letter written by Knott to state environmental
officials in 1990. There was no explanation for why the letter,
which involved a dispute over permitting for electric generators,
was in the files of the EPA investigators.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of Knott's letter is a handwritten message from an
unidentified environmental official asking a colleague, ``Do we
just drop this?'' Just below that note, the official makes another
comment, one that Knott believes may explain why his case was so
vigorously pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind making his life miserable for awhile,'' the
official wrote.

   Inside the EPA, some criminal staff members wonder how the Knott
case ever became a criminal matter in the first place. Both
locally, and in Washington, some EPA officials say there is debate
about the selection of cases, and assertions that some smaller
criminal cases would have been better handled as civil complaints.
</P>
<P>
   There are other small business owners like Knott asking how
their cases became criminal matters. Several EPA agents pointed to
examples of prosecuting ``minnows'' while ignoring the ``whales.''
</P>
<P>
   One such case is that of Dino Cervantes, a New Mexico farmer who
pleaded guilty to fouling local waters with runoff from water used
to wash his plants. Cervantes was indicted even though he paid to
have the runoff hauled to a safe location after he was notified
that tests showed a problem. ``It was a PR stunt,'' says Cervantes.
``Now they can tell Congress, `Hey, look at what we are doing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Clinch of Longview, Wash., had charges dropped against him
in May after a jury refused to convict him of charges he illegally
removed asbestos. Clinch was repairing six carports at a building
complex he owns when he said he unknowingly removed sprayed-on
asbestos. After learning it was asbestos, Clinch said he paid an
expert to haul it away. The EPA, however, considered it a criminal
offense and Clinch was indicted last December, a year and a half
after the asbestos was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Gary H. Baise, a Washington lawyer who served as chief of staff
to the first administrator of the EPA in 1970, said Knott and
defendants in the other cases have legitimate complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases. . .are ones that would appear to be normal civil
cases, traffic tickets,'' he said. ``These cases seem to be going
criminal. They have to make the numbers and make themselves
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lowrance, the EPA's deputy administrator for enforcement,
said the agency is blind to the size of a company, considering only
what a person or corporation is accused of doing. ``We target
criminal misconduct,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the significant impact of a criminal charge, the
EPA's criminal investigation division has guidelines to evaluate
the relative severity of violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is universal consensus that less flagrant violations
with lesser environmental consequences should be addressed through
administrative or civil monetary penalties and remedial orders,
while the most serious environmental violations ought to be
investigated criminally,'' according to the guidelines. ``The
challenge in practice is to correctly distinguish the latter cases
from the former.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Knott, whatever wastewater flows out of his plant
ends up at the Town of Northbridge sewerage treatment plant about
two miles away. The sewage is treated and sent into the Blackstone
River. The town's plant superintendent, James Madigan, said he
regularly monitors the pH level of the discharge he sends into the
river. The pH level has always been within acceptable limits, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the effect on the environment if Knott was violating
the law as charged, Madigan said there was none.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the concerns investigators had,'' Madigan said
in a recent interview. ``With flow time, (the Riverdale Mills
wastewater) would be so diluted you wouldn't even notice it here.
It would have no impact at all on us. I definitely told the
investigators. That is one of the questions they asked me. They
were concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he testified before the grand jury that
investigated Riverdale Mills, Madigan said no. ``I was supposed to
testify before the grand jury, but they called me and canceled,''
Madigan said. ``They said it wasn't necessary.''

 MADAPDAP, Philippines: ... the United States.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is growing resentment in the Philippines over the base
contamination, and the country's Department of Foreign Affairs says
the base cleanup dispute ``continues to affect'' relations between
the countries. In September, the Philippine House of
Representatives passed a resolution calling on the United States to
clean up the sites.
</P>
<P>
   But a cleanup would be expensive. The General Accounting Office,
in a 1992 report, quoted military officers as saying the cost of
cleaning up both Philippine bases would approach ``Superfund
proportions'' _ a reference to the program for cleaning up the most
contaminated sites in the United States. American engineers
estimate the cost at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is not providing any money to clean up the bases,
however. The United States has also resisted calls to provide
technical assistance and more detailed military environmental
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The US embassy in Manila said in a statement that the ``American
military forces practiced good environmental stewardship during
their stay in the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   But that assertion is contradicted by the government's own
records, interviews with former military officers, Philippine base
workers, and even the US military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been in and out of there many years, particularly
during Vietnam, I know we were really (environmentally) abusive,''
said retired Navy Rear Admiral Eugene J. Carroll, now an official
with the nonprofit Center for Defense Information in Washington, a
group that has been critical of military spending. ``We clearly
left behind a toxic brew.''
</P>
<P>
   Vest, who oversees environmental issues at foreign bases for the
Pentagon, said there is no question the former US bases in the
Philippines were contaminated by American forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do recall years ago having been at Clark and physically
seeing contamination,'' he said. ``There is contamination at those
locations that was indeed caused by the military.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations ignored
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's environmental officers at Subic Bay tried to remedy
the hazards created by operations at the massive base. They knew
pumping millions of gallons of untreated sewage into Subic Bay each
day was a threat to public health.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed building a sewage treatment plant at a cost of
$12.7 million. To correct other deficiencies, they recommended the
construction of hazardous-material storage buildings, improvements
to leaky fuel storage tanks, and other environmental projects
totaling more than $2 million. But none of the recommendations were
followed.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to spending money on environmental projects at its
bases in 140 countries around the world, the Pentagon has been
stingy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dedicated budget for environmental cleanups
overseas, as there is for domestic bases. Many environmental
decisions are made by base commanders, who are often placed in the
position of deciding whether to cut funds for training and
logistics, which could prove hazardous to their soldiers, or
rejecting requests for environmental improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their policy overseas is to do nothing,'' said Polly Parks, a
Washington activist who works with countries concerned about base
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to spend $165 million on overseas
environmental projects this year. Ninety percent will be spent on
environmental compliance and maintenance, with the balance used to
clean up contaminated soil or water. Domestically, the military
spends $1.72 billion a year to clean up contaminated sites.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, commanders at foreign bases are
often faced with vague and conflicting directives on environmental
issues. US bases overseas are required to comply with the
environmental quality standards of the host country, and to adhere
to additional requirements or guidance provided in treaties. The
Department of Defense also requires overseas bases to ``conform to
the extent practicable'' to the more detailed standards followed at
bases in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Vest said each foreign commander has to create an
environmental document that ensures the base complies with local
law, any treatment requirements, and DOD standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy and standards are clear,'' he said. ``You do not
contaminate ground water or soil with current operations. And if
there is a spill, you clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   However, US personnel overseas sometimes do not know what is
required. A 1991 audit by the General Accounting Office found most
environmental officials at overseas bases did not have even a basic
knowledge of local regulations.
</P>
<P>
   A report in September by the Department of Defense Inspector
General concluded that at American bases in Germany, ``the training
of environmental personnel on the applicability of the German law
and the increased potential for German enforcement action was
insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns over secrecy, environmental inspectors in
many countries are not granted access to US bases, leaving it up to
the military to police itself. In its report, the GAO prevented
foreign countries from learning of hazards on their land by
deleting ``references to specific organizations that generate
hazardous waste, names of installations and countries where they
are located, and all photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   In countries like the Philippines, weak environmental
regulations are usually accompanied by impotent enforcement.
Furthermore, American regulatory agencies, such as the
Environmental Protection Agency, have no authority to police the
overseas activities of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is lacking is laws,'' for overseas environmental
compliance, said William Gallagher, who studied US operations in
Germany for the Defense Department Inspector General's office.
``You do things as the result of agreements, but there are no
hard-and-fast requirements for what you do overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also no accurate gauge of the extent of overseas
contamination. The military does not routinely conduct
environmental studies to identify contaminated areas, as it does
domestically. And unlike at home, there is little or no pressure
overseas from environmental groups to press the military to
identify and clean up hazardous sites.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hazards that are known are causing concern among some
government officials and activists.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report discovered contaminated ground or water at five
of the seven overseas bases it inspected. ``We identified
conditions at the. . .bases we visited that, had they occurred at
bases in the United States, would have been violations of US
environmental regulations,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A second report by the GAO, in 1992, said the environmental
damage at the Philippine bases was ``significant'' and ``would not
be in compliance with US environmental standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, a US commonwealth, the local attorney general
alleged this summer that the Navy was violating clean water, clean
air, and hazardous-waste laws in its operations at the Vieques
base. The Navy has admitted to mistakenly firing rounds tipped with
depleted uranium at Vieques, and using napalm in 1993. A
preliminary health study found the physical and mental health of
the residents near the base was significantly worse that that of
other Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, sewage from two bases flows untreated into local
rivers, a practice that would be illegal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that situation disgusting,'' said a high-ranking US
military official, who
</P>
<P>
   has pushed for tougher environmental standards overseas, and
asked not to be identified.

   The Spanish were the first to look at the lush, tropical
mountains that rise to form a protective ring around Subic Bay and
see the deep-water port for both its natural beauty and strategic
importance. In 1908, the United States established a naval base at
Subic that would become a key staging area for wars fought in Korea
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Navy jets and ships passed through Subic Bay.
Repairing and maintaining the equipment resulted in thousands of
tons of hazardous waste. Right up until the Navy left the facility
in 1992, the adjacent bay provided an easy and convenient dumping
area for heavy metals, fuel, chemical ammunition waste, and raw
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Roquito Dioso, a Filipino who worked at Subic, said there were
two rules of thumb for the hazardous waste produced at the Naval
Magazine, where bombs and ammunition were stored and destroyed.
Both violated local and US regulations.
</P>
<P>
   If the amount of toxic waste was less than a full barrel, the
waste was dumped into a local stream, he said. If there was enough
waste to fill several barrels, it was trucked to a local landfill
and dumped, Dioso said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Defense Department struggles to keep up with billions of
dollars of cleanup work at military bases across the country,
another problem is looming that could end up being more expensive
than the combined cost of every environmental cleanup program the
government has under way.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50 million acres of land in the United States have
been used as bombing and target ranges by the military. Cleaning up
just five percent of the land would cost $15 billion, according to
the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potentially massive liability, the Defense
Department has moved slowly on the issue. In an audit this year,
the General Services Administration cited the failure to account
for training-range and weapons-system cleanups as a serious
deficiency. It said the undisclosed liability was ``likely to be an
additional tens of billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the military is spending $51 million a year to clean
up training ranges. The total Pentagon environmental budget is $3.5
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Several internal Environmental Protection Agency documents warn
of the huge cost of cleaning the ranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summary, as measured by acres, and probably as measured by
number of sites, ranges and buried munitions represent the largest
cleanup program in the US,'' wrote Ken Shuster, the EPA's expert on
military range waste.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and military have been haggling for five years over a
``range rule'' that would govern the cleanup of training ranges.
Gary Vest, the principal assistant deputy underecretary of defense
for environmental security, said he expected the plan to be
finalized by next summer. Vest added that the cost of the work will
be ``pretty substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   In an April letter, Timothy Fields Jr., an EPA assistant
administrator, urged the military's top environmental official,
Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Sherri W. Goodman, to move faster
on creating a cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last several years, EPA has become increasingly
concerned with the (unexploded bombs) and hazardous chemical
contamination situations at military ranges nationwide,'' wrote
Fields. ``For many reasons, it appears that closed, transferred,
and transferring military ranges are not being adequately addressed
in a manner consistent with accepted environmental or explosive
safety standards and practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the EPA said it found evidence that the National
Guard training range at the Massachusetts Military Reservation on
Cape Cod was significantly contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum byproducts from missiles and heavy metals contained in
bombs and bullets threaten soil and ground water at many ranges.
There is also the danger posed by unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   Some ranges were used as burial sites for hazardous waste and
excess munitions. In addition, the military still burns munitions
waste and excess fuel in open pits across the country. The practice
is allowed because the facilities were exempted when laws were
passed in the 1980s governing the disposal of hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   Fields, in a second internal document, listed other examples of
problems at ranges, including:
</P>
<P>
   --The military failing to clean up property contaminated with
unexploded ordnance before transferring it to private parties or
other government agencies. At the Tobyhanna Army Depot in
Pennsylvania, a 20,000-acre area used as a range is now a state
park. The park was closed in 1997 when 53 unexploded 37mm shells
were found.
</P>
<P>
   --Poor regulatory oversight of unexploded ordnance removal. A
scrap-yard worker in California was killed in 1997 when he cut into
an antitank shell he thought was inactive. The piece was one of 55
explosive shells mistakenly shipped to the scrapyard by workers at
the Army's Fort Irwin.

BARGAIN LAND PURCHASE PROVES COSTLY

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the federal government offered to sell 78 acres of land to
the rural community of Marion, Ohio, in the late 1950s, everyone
agreed the dollar-an-acre asking price was a bargain. The city used
the land to build a sprawling school complex that was the envy of
neighboring communities, and in 1963, the first graduates marched
out of the new River Valley High School.
</P>
<P>
   But today, there are fewer positive feelings in town about the
school. Many of the River Valley graduates are sick with leukemia
and other cancers. Several have died.
</P>
<P>
   After health officials began investigating the cancer cases two
years ago, the residents of Marion learned for the first time that
they unknowingly built their school on top of a former US Army
dumpsite filled with toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of communities across the country had done the same
thing as Marion, buying land on the cheap from the military in the
decades following World War II. It is only in the past few years,
however, that many new owners of the surplus military property have
realized what is buried on their land.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio officials have determined that at least 11 other schools
were built on military sites and that four of the sites need to be
cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there are more than 500 sites formerly used by
the military which are now private property. And, as in Ohio,
officials here are finding problems. Several hundred of the
Massachusetts sites need some sort of environmental action, ranging
from simple evaluations to costly removal projects, but a lack of
federal funding results in only a few a year being cleaned up, said
Anne Malewicz, the federal facilities section chief for the state
Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, funding for the US Army Corps of
Engineers to identify and remove hazardous waste from former
military sites in Massachusetts has been cut from $10 million a
year to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funding problem is narrowing the priority list at a time
when we are looking at problems out there and thinking the list
should be expanded,'' said Mark Begley, the director of the
Division of Response and Remediation for the state Bureau of Waste
Site Cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Begley said sites that need to be cleaned up in Massachusetts
are contaminated with asbestos, PCBs, lead paint, leaking oil
tanks, old bombs, and chemical solvents.
</P>
<P>
   Two sites in the state that need action, but are not receiving
any, are located in the South Shore town of Hingham.
</P>
<P>
   At Wompatuck State Park, officials suspect a former military
burn pit may be contaminated with heavy metals and unexploded
ordnance. Grass has not grown on the site for 40 years. In the
Beals Cove area, remnants of bombs have been spotted on an
embankment and high concentrations of lead and copper have been
found in a nearby public recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 9,000 sites _ called Formerly Used Defense
Sites, or FUDS, by the military _ across the country that were sold
off after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are places where people are already living, working,
playing, and going to school,'' said Lenny Siegal, director of the
Center for Public Environmental Oversight, an advocacy group.
``They were transferred before people knew what hazards existed
there. It's not just the military's fault. No one paid much
attention to these kinds of problems in the '60s and '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers has declared many of these sites to
be in need of no further cleanup action. But state environmental
officials have begun their own checks of the properties. Last year,
six states said they found contamination at half of the sites that
the Corps said needed no more action.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Corps clarified the no-further-action
classification, telling states that if they find problems on these
sites, it will consider doing cleanup work.
</P>

<P>
   In Ohio, the number of leukemia cases among River Valley
graduates is five times higher than what would be expected,
according to state and federal health officials. The finding
prompted an investigation of the school property, located on the
edge of town in an area rich with cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   A review of town records and old aerial photographs revealed
that the school complex was built on a former Army vehicle depot
and dumping area, and a camp for prisoners during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the soil and water, investigators found byproducts from the
dumping. Arsenic, used to delouse prisoners, was found in the soil
at a level 23 times what is typically found elsewhere in Ohio.
Metals were found in the water at unhealthy levels. And the school
and a neighboring property were contaminated with
trichloroethylene, a chemical suspected of causing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Huge fences were quickly erected around 10 acres of playing
fields and 1,350 tons of soil was trucked away. Today, the testing
continues and scientists and public health officials are trying to
confirm the cause of the leukemia cases.
</P>
<P>
   There is both resentment and anger in Marion over the discovery
at River Valley. ``The government sold us a bill of goods,'' said
Don Millard, the owner of a local appliance store and the father of
a River Valley graduate with cancer. ``We have a deed saying this
land was unused, and now we find out it was a chemical dump.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Tolnar, who graduated from River Valley in 1982, has no
doubt her leukemia was caused by the chemicals now being discovered
on the school grounds. Tolnar underwent a grueling bone marrow
transplant and massive amounts of chemotherapy in 1993, just six
months after she was married. The process saved her life, but left
her physically beaten and unable to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never run again. I don't have a good knee or ankle. I
will never know what my child looks like,'' she said. ``All of
those things were taken away from me because I went to a school
that had chemicals in its land.''

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Boston office of the Environmental Protection
Administration told the officers of Cape Cod Hospital in April 1996
that it was starting an enforcement action against the facility,
the hospital turned to the state's congressional delegation for
help.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA had accused the Hyannis hospital of illegally converting
wetlands it owned into cranberry bogs, thereby violating federal
laws. The potential penalty was stiff _ a six-figure fine, plus
costly restoration of the wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   But with help from local congressmen, the hospital was able to
make its case to John DeVillars, the EPA's regional administrator.
DeVillars drove to the hospital to personally inspect the property
and kept close tabs on the case, EPA records indicate. In the end,
the hospital did not have to pay a fine, despite firm and repeated
assertions by the EPA enforcement staff that a cash penalty was
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has strong policies to prevent the appearance of
favoritism in enforcement cases, but in the Cape Cod Hospital
matter, at least two of those rules appear to have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Some enforcement staffers complain that DeVillars has
compromised the agency by intervening in cases of interest to
congressmen and questioning the actions of staff after a political
inquiry. They said those actions undermine the agency's credibility
and create the perception that complaining to DeVillars can
influence enforcement outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars acknowledged examining cases of interest to
politicians, saying if any member of Congress calls, ``I take a
personal interest.'' But he strongly denied showing favoritism
toward any party in an enforcement case, or violating EPA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of cases where congressmen have called me where
they had clear concerns about what the agency does and where we
have stuck to our guns or took stronger stands is a very long
list,'' he said. ``So the fact a congressmen calls does not by
definition mean the outcome of the case will change and at no time
has a call resulted in any lessening of the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars said he has bucked political pressure in several
high-profile cases, most notably at the Massachusetts Military
Reservation on upper Cape Cod, where he has won praise from
residents and environmentalists for pushing the Pentagon to clean
up the site.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a survey of New England EPA enforcement personnel
last year done by Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility, a Washington group representing federal
environmental employees, more than half of the 40 respondents said
violators received preferential treatment after contacting
DeVillars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was most disconcerting was that the business
community perceives it as well,'' said Jeffrey Ruch, the PEER
executive director. ``They know they can go to the local regional
administrator or a congressman and get a better deal cut.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars angrily denounces the criticism by PEER as uninformed
and unfair, and several local environmental groups have come to his
defense, praising his enforcement record. EPA chief Carol Browner
has also backed DeVillars.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital matter is one example of how a political
contact to DeVillars changed the complexion of a case.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of congressional aides on behalf of the hospital
played an important role in internal discussions about the case,
according to EPA records, including some the agency has refused to
release. Congressional aides also were invited to EPA offices in
Boston to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of publicly released records related to the case were
deleted by EPA lawyers, who said the law allowed documents related
to decision-making and attorney-client communication to be removed.
Some of the passages contain critical remarks of DeVillars and his
actions in the case and make reference to congressional
interference, according to original copies of the records.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Cape Cod Hospital, the facility enlisted the help
of Mark Forest, an aide to US Representative William Delahunt, a
Quincy Democrat, and prior to that, US Representative Gerry Studds,
who left Congress in 1996. US Senator John F. Kerry also sent a
letter to DeVillars, asking that the action be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   In memos to DeVillars, EPA enforcement lawyers and wetlands
experts working on the case charged that the hospital's contractor
had illegally filled 20 acres of wetlands without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mark Stein, the lead attorney for the EPA, wrote the
hospital, saying a settlement of the case would be considered with
a significant monetary penalty and restoration of the wetlands.
Later that month, the enforcement staff wrote a memo saying the
fine should be $94,768.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars, meanwhile, made handwritten requests for updates in
the margins of memos discussing the political interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   What the congressional aides made clear was that a fine was
unacceptable. In another deleted passage, the EPA's congressional
liaison sent a message to the enforcement staff saying Forest
considered the penalty issue ``paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   For several months, the enforcement staff attempted to negotiate
a settlement with the hospital. In February 1997, the staff
recommended issuing an order to the hospital to pay a fine and
restore the wetlands. It was signed by then-enforcement chief
Harley Laing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DeVillars told the staff to continue negotiating and on
April 1, 1997, the hospital signed an agreement that did not
include a fine but did require it to restore the damaged wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   As the case was being negotiated, the EPA kept congressional
aide Forest updated, communication which appears to violate agency
policies prohibiting staff from ``sharing information about
enforcement investigations, negotiations, litigation, or settlement
strategy or tactics with members (of Congress), their staff, or
other outside parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to Laing two weeks before the case was settled, EPA
congressional liaison Al Frezza wrote: ``I contacted Mark Forest of
Delahunt's staff and told him the EPA was hopeful the CCH case
would be resolved by the end of the month. . .and that there would
be no penalty. I offered to provide him with more specific
details.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars and his staff said the information provided to Forest
does not violate agency policy, saying they would have provided the
same information to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Forest said he contacted DeVillars because the hospital believed
it was convicted without a hearing. When asked if DeVillars
influenced the decision not to issue a penalty, Forest said, ``I
would like to think the hospital made (its) case.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final move, which also appears to violate EPA policy,
records indicate the Boston office brokered the contents of a press
release with the hospital. The EPA prohibits negotiation of any
terms of enforcement press releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression that any release, if one did occur,
would be innocuous to the hospital,'' the hospital's lawyer wrote
after reviewing the EPA's proposed press release. Records indicate
several changes were made to the release, including the addition of
comments praising the hospital, after the lawyer complained and
sent back proposed revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Lubber, the assistant EPA regional administrator, said
that in rare instances the agency shares press releases with the
subjects of enforcement action before they are released. She
denied, however, that the contents were negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars and Laing insisted that congressional interest had no
bearing on the decision not to issue a fine, saying the decision
was ultimately made by the case team.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview recently why no fine was issued, Stein
said: ``It was a very close call, but the call got made.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyla Bennett, who was coordinator of wetlands enforcement at the
time, said she agreed to drop a fine from the setttlement after
superiors said they would not support one. ``We agreed like the
people on the Titanic agreed the boat was going down,'' she said.
``I felt I had no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Cape Cod Hospital is not the only one where members
of Congress intervened. More recently, US Representative Joseph
Moakley, a Democrat from South Boston who is credited with helping
DeVillars win his appointment as regional EPA administrator,
contacted DeVillars on behalf of campaign supporters accused of
filling wetlands to build a parking lot at the North Stoughton
Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars took an immediate and active role in the case,
according to agency records, overruling his enforcement team's
recommendation, which included ordering the property owner to rip
up a parking lot and restore the destroyed wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The building owners, the consultant to the building owner, and
several Reebok executives _ whose corporate headquarters are on the
site _ were campaign contributors of Moakley's. The congressman and
DeVillars discussed the case on at least three occasions. In
addition, Moakley aide Joseph Moynihan was in frequent contact with
the EPA on the case.
</P>
<P>
   At several points, according to enforcement staff, it appeared
Moakley's office was provided confidential information, in
violation of EPA policy. A case lawyer noted in the file that she
was told by the EPA's congressional liaison that Moynihan indicated
things were ``going in the right direction'' regarding the case,
even though the EPA had yet to formally tell the property owner
what it proposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars pushed his top enforcement officials to change their
recommendation on the case and develop a plan to create new
wetlands and leave the parking lot untouched. Even though this
proposal ran contrary to EPA policy for wetlands cases, DeVillars
said he thought his approach would result in a better environmental
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the building owner determined it would be cheaper to
agree to what the case team originally wanted _ rip up the parking
lot and restore the wetlands _ than the DeVillars proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A Moakley spokeswoman, Karin Walser, said Moakley simply asked
DeVillars to take a look at the case. ``Joe Moakley's feeling is a
lot of times when we call it doesn't change the outcome, but
hastens it a little bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars, who announced last week he would soon leave the EPA
for the private sector, conceded it is unlikely he would have
become involved in the Stoughton case if not for Moakley's
interest. But he rejected any suggestion he did Moakley's bidding
in the matter. He said his only motivation was to ensure the best
possible environmental outcome. He cited the property owner's
decision to agree to the original proposal because it was cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is it is such a humdinger of a proposal they
chose not to accept it,'' DeVillars said. ``I don't see what the
big deal is.''

US PRESENCE ON FOREIGN SOIL TAINTED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   With a US military presence in more than 140 countries, the
question of how Washington should deal with complaints of overseas
environmental contamination is emerging as a prickly financial and
diplomatic issue.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Department of Defense inspector general warned that
contamination of foreign soil by the military is an issue that will
have to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``DOD presence in other countries has resulted in environmental
damage that will require eventual cleanup and disposal, and the
cleanup costs will be substantial,'' the report cautioned.
``Potentially significant liabilities may exist in Japan, South
Korea, the Philippines, Turkey, Great Britain, Spain, Canada, and
other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, representatives from a dozen countries met in
Washington to discuss base cleanups and lobbied members of Congress
to help remove hazardous waste from overseas facilities. ``It is an
important moral issue and public health issue and environmental
issue,'' said John Lindsay-Poland, an American activist who has
studied base contamination in Panama and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a look at some of the countries allegedly
contaminated by the United States:
</P>
<P>
   --The DOD inspector general this year said cleanup costs are
expected to total at least $1 billion. Germany is among the
countries with the most rigorous environmental laws and toughest
enforcement standards. It is also host to one of the largest
contingents of American forces overseas, with 69,663 active duty
personnel stationed there. Not surprisingly, Germany also receives
the bulk of the $165 million a year the Pentagon spends on overseas
environmental compliance and cleanup. Last year, the military
reported projects to clean up landfills, remove PCBs, repair sewage
treatment plants, and remediate contaminated soil.
</P>
<P>
   --A Japanese environmental group _ NEPA Coalition of Japan _ has
documented severe environmental contamination at the Yokosuka US
Naval base.The group says a September 1998 report found soil
contaminated with lead at 150 times the Japanese standard; arsenic
at 10 times the limit; and mercury at a level 440 times greater
than Japanese standards. Ground water was also tainted by poisons,
including lead at 520 times the national standard.The group also
said it has documented pollution at several other bases, including
the dumping of PCBs into a pond and the systematic dumping of
oil-contaminated water into public sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
   --The US military is currently cleaning up thousands of acres of
jungle firing ranges and testing sites used by soldiers throughout
this century. The work is being done in anticipation of the
transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama next year. The cleanup,
however, has been controversial, with Panamanian government
officials complaining about the thoroughness of the work and a lack
of information provided by the Pentagon. Earlier this year, 25
members of Congress wrote to Defense Secretary William Cohen urging
him to release more records, saying they feared ``the US government
is preparing to walk away from its responsibility to adequately
clean up US military bases and firing ranges in Panama that were
used to test conventional and chemical weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   --When Canadian officials turned to the United States several
years ago for help in cleaning up environmental contamination at
former US military facilities in their country, the Pentagon said
it had ``no legal obligation'' to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike what has happened in many other countries, the
Pentagon later reversed itself and agreed to pay $100 million to
clean up the former US sites in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress last year, Deputy Secretary of Defense
John J. Hamre, said the payments were ``a special case not
duplicated anywhere else in the world,'' and one unlikely to be
repeated because ``there is no other country with the same
combination of geography, historical relationship, and vital
significance to US national security.''

<P>
   MADAPDAP, Philippines _ The midday sun is beating down on
Nerissa Sagum-Agustin as she pauses on a dirt road in this
distressed resettlement area to look at her list of the sick.
</P>
<P>
   She points to the first name, five-year-old Abraham Taruc, and
quickly finds his home, having been there many times to deliver
medicine and accompany the family to the local hospital. The
two-room cinder-block structure is cool and dark. Abraham's mother,
Elvira, sits on the floor, the boy stretched across her lap, his
head cradled in her arm. He stares at the ceiling with his mouth
open, oblivious to the visitors who just entered.
</P>
<P>
   There are many children like Abraham on the list carried by
Sagum-Agustin, a nurse and community activist. They are unable to
walk or talk. Their growth is stunted and their muscles refuse to
coordinate. They suffer from spasms and seizures. Most are unable
to eat solid food.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham and hundreds of other children were born or raised at
nearby Clark Air Base, which was abandoned by the US Air Force in
1991. After the Americans left, the former barracks became homes
for families like Abraham's. They planted corn and rice in the
fields that flow next to the long runways once used by American
fighter jets, and tapped wells on the base for water.
</P>
<P>
   What the families didn't know was that the land was contaminated
with the residue of chemicals, insecticides, and hazardous waste
generated by the Air Force, according to US government records and
a study by an American engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   Unknowing mothers mixed their baby formula with water tainted by
mercury, gasoline, and bacteria. For years, the residents of the
former air base drank the water, used it to bathe their children,
and water their crops, never suspecting it may be the reason why
people were getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   As countries like the Philippines begin to come of age
environmentally, they are awakening to a toxic disaster at former
and current US bases. Virtually no part of the world is untouched
by environmental hazards generated by the US military. A recent
Pentagon report cited environmental problems at bases in Greenland,
Spain, Japan, Panama, Italy, Iceland, and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a (US) military base in the world that doesn't
have some soil or ground water contamination. That is just a
given,'' said Gary Vest, the principal assistant deputy
undersecretary of defense for environmental security. ``I will
stipulate there is contamination everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental contamination is not just the result of
historical neglect. It continues today in places like South Korea,
where raw sewage flows untreated from US bases into local waters.
</P>
<P>
   The military has polluted in ways that would be illegal and
subject to criminal prosecution in the United States, according to
records obtained by The Boston Globe. Several countries, ranging
from key allies like Germany to the small island nation of Bermuda,
are now demanding that the United States help pay for the
environmental damage done by American forces.
</P>
<P>
   US base commanders are required to adhere to the environmental
standards of the host country, but in many cases there are no
standards. And even in countries with strict environmental
regulations, the United States has often ignored, or knowingly
violated, the host country laws.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences for polluting overseas have been few. At home,
Congress has shown little interest in paying for the cleanups. The
Clinton administration, which has prided itself on taking a hard
line against polluters in America, has dismissed the complaints of
countries like the Philippines out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it wanted to pay for major cleanups overseas, the
Pentagon has little discretion to do so unless given permission by
Congress _ something that has happened only once in recent years.
This year, the United States plans to spend only $17 million on
cleanups at foreign bases, or .1 percent of what it spends on base
cleanups domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone discussing this could build a pretty good case
for a moral obligation'' said Vest. ``If you accept that, you still
have to contend with what you are allowed to do by the law. That is
the overarching, fundamental question.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All's not well at bases
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the impoverished Philippines, once a vital Asian foothold for
the US Air Force and Navy, the legacy of American military
operations is detailed in the list of contaminants found in the
wells tapped by the residents who moved into the former command
center area at Clark. The list includes:
</P>
<P>
   --Mercury, which can impair child development and is linked to
nervous system disorders and kidney and liver disease, found at
twice the accepted Philippine health level;
</P>
<P>
   --Double the acceptable Philippine standard for nitrate, which
is linked at elevated levels to ``blue baby syndrome,'' a
potentially fatal condition that results from restricted oxygen in
the blood;
</P>
<P>
   --Propylbenzene, a fuel byproduct, which is not allowed in the
water supply at any level;
</P>
<P>
   --The insecticide dieldrin, a product now banned in the United
States, at amounts above Philippine health limits;
</P>
<P>
   --Unsafe amounts of lead, and coliform bacteria, which indicates
the presence of bacteria and other hazardous organisms.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is spreading, with the contaminated ground water
flowing away from the former base and toward overcrowded and
destitute towns clustered around the sprawling facility, according
to the Philippine government agency developing the base.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated water at the Clark command center is just one
trouble spot. Military records highlight scores of toxic threats at
Clark _ once the largest Air Force base outside the United States _
as well as at the former Navy base at Subic Bay, 65 miles to the
west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a US environmental firm, Pennsylvania-based Weston
International, found soil throughout Clark contaminated with jet
fuel, benzene, pesticides, oil, and PCBs. In several cases, the
study, commissioned by the Philippines, warned that the hazardous
waste could migrate into the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Families who lived on or near the base suffer from a
disproportionately high rate of many kinds of illnesses, according
to a 1998 study by the Toronto-based International Institute of
Concern for Public Health, which has been critical of military
environmental practices. The study found that current and former
residents of the command center area at Clark reported a high
percentage of illnesses associated with the mouth, nose, throat,
skin, and immune and nervous systems, as well as high levels of
kidney disease and reproductive disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for an immediate cleanup of the base, saying
the combination of exposure to toxic materials and poor living
conditions was creating health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this reason, improvement, remediation, and cleanup efforts
should be addressed to these areas first,'' the study concluded.
``If this is not possible, then evacuation. . . should be
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   The true scope of the contamination at Clark and Subic, and the
potential impact on nearby residents, may not be known for years.
Many of the toxins left behind become more hazardous the longer
people are exposed to them. And because much of the hazardous waste
was buried in landfills or dumped into waterways, there is a danger
of the toxins flowing unseen into unspoiled areas.
</P>
<P>
   As countries begin to assess the environmental damage at current
and former bases, the problem of overseas pollution threatens to
become a major financial and diplomatic liability for the United
States.

   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ In an opening that would be the
envy of a New York gallery, Mexico's ruling party held a glittery
art exhibit on the eve of its first-ever primary to select the
party's presidential nominee. ``The Art of Doing Politics'' raised
money to finance the Institutional Revolutionary Party as it heads
to the presidential election in 2000. The message was: Here is the
new PRI, the democratic PRI, the transparent PRI that is openly
raising money for what promises to be a tight, closely watched
presidential race. By SUSANA HAYWARD.

 MADAPDAP, PHilipines: ... Dioso said.

<P>
   Only a quarter of the 5 million gallons of sewage pumped by the
Navy into the bay every day was treated. An internal 1992 report
found that contaminated wastewater generated by the sandblasting of
ships was discarded in the bay. ``To a certain degree, the area
became saturated with waste,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination was not limited to the bay. Of the area around
the base foundry shop, the Navy report noted, ``Aside from the high
possibility of PCB ground contamination, it is quite probable that
the area is also contaminated with heavy metals, particularly lead,
copper, cadmium, silver, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The US turned over 1,000 pages of environmental documents to the
Philippine government. Those documents, according to experts, are
likely only a fraction of the total that exist.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Coles, an engineer with Kleinfelder Inc., a US firm
that works on domestic base cleanups, told a Philippine Senate
committee in September that the documents generated by a facility
like Subic should fill a medium-sized warehouse. And the documents
would only tell part of the story, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stationed at Subic for five years,'' said Coles. ``To my
knowledge, things occur that are not necessarily documented. . . .
You will find things you don't expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Base workers have described many improper practices not detailed
in Navy records released to the Philippines. In one incident, a
base worker said he and others were ordered to pour cyanide out of
drums directly into a landfill. The same landfill, which contained
other hazards dumped by the Navy, was frequented by local
scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States left both Subic and Clark, there have
been few environmental or health studies.
</P>
<P>
   A study of Subic, which the Philippine government is developing
as an international business and tourism zone, found only isolated
contamination. The study has been criticized by US scientists and
engineers as substandard. The environmental official for the Subic
Bay Metropolitan Authority, the government agency developing the
area, acknowledged the shortcomings of the 1997 government-funded
study, saying it was intended more as a development tool than an
environmental review. The official, Michael Musngi, said a more
recent study by a Japanese company found a high concentration of
heavy metals in sediment samples taken from Subic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 study did identify 10 contaminated areas and suggested
further studies on 13 other sites. Asked if those areas are being
studied, Musngi said, ``Unfortunately, no. Subic Bay is in dire
need of funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government is ill-equipped to study the bases.
Officials collected water samples at Clark in used Coke bottles. A
group of US scientists donated a device to test water, but it has
not been used because the Philippine scientists don't know how to
assemble or operate the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is exactly the problem,'' said Saul Bloom, a San
Francisco-based environmental activist who has studied
contamination at the bases. ``How do you walk away from a country
that does not have the capacity to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials at Clark and Subic complained about a lack
of cooperation from the US military, saying they have not been
provided documents needed to identify toxic hotspots.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the records may no longer exist. The Navy report said
``several environmental files were reported missing'' and others
were shredded. At a Subic facility where excess and unusable
munitions were incinerated, there are no records of how the Navy
disposed of toxic residue from the burning of ammunition. ``It is
likely that the area is contaminated with lead, lithium, and other
heavy metals,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The US government maintains it bears no responsibility to clean
up the contamination in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written to the Philippine Senate this summer, Sherri
Goodman, the deputy undersecretary of defense, said the 1947 treaty
governing the bases does not require the United States to pay for
any cleanup. In addition, she said, a 1988 amendment to the treaty
waived the Philippines' right to demand cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Defense and State departments refused to
comment officially on the Philippine bases. Privately, some said
there is general indifference to overseas pollution, and in the
case of the Philippines, lingering resentment from a 1992
Philippine Senate vote to end the US lease at Subic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some Philippine government officials are also uninterested in
pushing the United States to clean up the bases. The Philippines
still counts Washington as an important military ally, and some
officials here worry the relationship would be damaged by a more
aggressive push to clean up the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting for a cleanup, however, say every day of delay
results in more exposure to toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like a beggar,'' said Philippine Senator
Loren Legarda-Leviste. ``We are asking for justice. This was a
lopsided agreement that does not protect the environment. Who could
think of environmental protection in the 1940s?''
</P>

Poisonous well `closed'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children priming the Champion Pitcher well at the former
Clark Air Base are smiling. Drawing water from the well is fun and
they have no idea that they are pumping poisons from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of families, many refugees who lost their homes during
the eruption of nearby Mount Pinatubo, moved here after the United
States left the facility in 1991. From the shells of barrack
buildings, some of this country's poorest residents built new homes
from the foundations, patching together cardboard cigarette boxes,
stray two-by-fours and scrap metal to make walls and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   As the children play at the well, Epifania de Leon carries her
eight-year-old daughter, Michelle, clutching the child close to her
chest and taking care to avoid the crumbled concrete blocks around
her.
</P>
<P>
   The de Leons moved away from Clark last year, but still come
back to visit friends. The children playing in the contaminated
water are a harsh reminder of why they left.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after arriving at Clark, and drinking the water,
Michelle experienced severe diarrhea. Within a few months, the
once-active three-year-old stopped talking and walking.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle today looks like a child half her age. She is unable to
eat solid food and her legs are gaunt and malformed. Her eyes and
mouth widen, and her fists clench as she repeatedly fends off
spasms. She spends her days lying on a floor or cradled in her
mother's arms, unable to communicate the most basic of needs. When
asked what made her daughter sick, de Leon is quick to nod toward
the nearby well.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than two years since the Weston International
study determined that the water coming from the wells at the Clark
Air Base command center was contaminated. At a Philippine Senate
hearing in September, the chief environmental officer for Clark
Development Corporation, the government agency that now operates
the air base, said the wells were ordered closed as soon as the
results were known.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the hearing, however, a Globe reporter found the
children pumping water from a well reported closed. Residents of
the center said the wells continue to be used for drinking water.
The wells were shut down, but only for a day, when a Philippine
senator came to visit the site, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Those pushing for a cleanup of the bases are growing frustrated.
They have talked of filing a lawsuit against the United States _ a
difficult effort that could take many years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Myrla Baldonado, who started the People's Task Force for Bases
Cleanup, said Filipinos are beginning to realize the danger of
toxic waste. As they learn more, people in the country are
beginning to demand more, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What they can't understand, she said, is the indifference of the
American government. ``It's enraging,'' Baldonado said. ``The US is
a very callous government. People remember how Americans treated
Filipinos when they were here. This is just a continuation.''

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enforcement of the nation's environmental laws is
often haphazard and lax, creating a system where major polluters
can operate with little fear of being caught or punished, according
to court and enforcement records.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration has promoted the notion of an
environment-friendly presidency, and federal agencies have
trumpeted record-breaking fines against polluters, some enforcement
officials on the front line say they are losing the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton people have gutted environmental enforcement,''
said Gregory Sasse, a federal prosecutor in Cleveland with 13 years
of experience pursuing polluters. ``It is not a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Larger companies, particularly those with political muscle, are
often treated differently than smaller businesses that lack legal
resources and clout, according to some prosecutors and
environmental watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental enforcement in the United States is so uneven that
whether or not a company or individual is prosecuted by the federal
government for polluting is largely a factor of where it does
business, according to an analysis of seven years of records for
every federal court district in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern North Carolina, for instance, the US attorney did not
prosecute a single company or person for an environmental offense
from 1992 through 1998, the last year for which records are
available. Federal prosecutors in Maryland, by comparison,
prosecuted 42 environmental cases in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has among the most anemic enforcement records in
the country, according to federal criminal prosecution data and
internal records of the Environmental Protection Agency. In
addition, records indicate that John DeVillars, the EPA
administrator for New England, has become personally involved in
cases where members of Congress or their staff have lobbied the
agency to soften enforcement action against corporate polluters.
</P>
<P>
   In at least two cases, the New England EPA appears to have
violated agency rules designed to prevent the appearance of
favoritism in enforcement cases. The regional agency has also
embraced a national movement to combine enforcement with
``compliance assistance,'' a program whereby it tells companies
what they should be doing and allows them to voluntarily fix
pollution problems to avoid penalties.
</P>
<P>
   It is a controversial approach that critics say coddles
polluters and sends a message that enforcing environmental laws is
not a priority. In addition, businesses can reap the economic
benefits of polluting for many years, and not have to pay a price
for breaking the law in the past.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars and top officials in the Clinton administration,
however, say the new approach results in more businesses improving
their environmental performance. In addition, they say compliance
assistance is not replacing traditional enforcement, but is being
offered in concert with tough sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard criticism from those who believe compliance
assistance is tantamount to not enforcing. I think that is a false
criticism,'' said Sylvia Lowrance, the EPA's deputy assistant
administrator for enforcement. ``Our view is a strong enforcement
base is absolutely essential. What incentive is there if you don't
have the deterrent backup of a strong enforcement program?''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America, however, appears unconvinced that the
government is taking a tough line on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's largest environmental consulting companies,
the International Technology Corporation of Pennsylvania, said
government enforcement of environmental laws is so lax that the
firm's business is being hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand for the company's services is heavily influenced by the
level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations,''
according to the company's 1997 annual report. ``During the 1990s,
spending by commercial clients has slowed primarily due to reduced
implementation and enforcement activities by governmental
regulatory authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 1998 annual report, the company again cited weakening
enforcement by federal, state, and local regulators. Environmental
decisions by private industry in the United States, the company
said, are now driven by economic concerns and not regulatory or
legal ones.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to policing the country's polluters, the
environmental cop is not walking the beat, said Michael Casey of
the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization in
Washington that studies environmental enforcement data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson here is if you are a big, politically-connected
polluter, you can endanger public safety and health with
impunity,'' he said. ``Environmental crime pays.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EPA disregards key law
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When discussing its environmental record, the White House points
to a three-page-long list of accomplishments _ from a $1.5 billion
plan to restore the Florida Everglades to the approval of tougher
clean-air standards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when highlighting its achievements in a White House
paper called ``Protecting our Environment and Public Health,'' the
Clinton administration strikes a cautionary note:
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of us still breathe unhealthy air, and 40 percent of
our waterways are still too polluted for fishing and swimming.
Development threatens open space and environmentally sensitive
lands, and global warming threatens the stability of the earth's
climate.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's own report of enforcement efforts last year highlights
the continuing disregard of several key environmental laws. The
agency reported that:
</P>
<P>
   --Approximately 20 percent of the nation's incinerators and
landfills are in significant noncompliance with hazardous waste
laws.
</P>
<P>
   --One in four drinking water systems in the nation is in
violation of public health standards.
</P>
<P>
   --Half of the country's wastewater treatment facilities failed
to comply with clean-water laws during at least one-quarter of
fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of a battery of environmental laws in the past 30
years was supposed to solve many of those problems. However, many
of the laws are not being aggressively enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Water Act was a seminal ecological event when it was
passed by Congress in 1972. Yet today, according to environmental
groups and internal EPA records, the enforcement of the law is so
weak that many serious and chronic polluters operate with virtual
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   One indicator of the sorry state of the country's water supply
is the explosive growth of the bottled-water industry. Bottled
water sales in the United States rose 9.5 percent last year from
the previous year, according to the Beverage Marketing Corp. The
industry cites the fear of contaminants in water supplies as a
driving force in growing sales.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's Inspector General last year found that enforcement
staff in Alaska and Idaho failed to take any action against 75
percent of the companies that were in significant noncompliance
with the Clean Water Act. The polluters ranged from the US Army to
a major seafood processor. The pollutants included excess amounts
of nitrogen, ammonia, oil, grease, and chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, many serious and chronic violators are escaping
enforcement, and even those who are punished often receive only a
slap on the wrist, according to the Public Interest Research Group,
an environmental activist organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 study of water enforcement, PIRG concluded that one of
every five major wastewater discharges violated the Clean Water Act
during a 15-month period. The group is updating its study, and a
preliminary analysis has indicated little change.
</P>
<P>
   Those who pollute the air also benefit from lax enforcement of
the Clean Air Act, which was created in 1962 and toughened in 1990,
according to both the EPA's Inspector General and analysis of EPA
enforcement records.
</P>
<P>
   As it does with many enforcement programs, the EPA often pays
states to enforce the Clean Air Act. But both the agency and the
states have failed to do the job effectively, the EPA Inspector
General concluded last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found inconsistent implementation of agency directives, and
in other cases the states or EPA regions disregarded the agency's
requirements,'' the report stated. ``As a result, the effectiveness
of air-enforcement programs suffered. Numerous significant air
pollution violators went undetected and many of those identified
were not reported to EPA. Moreover, these violators were not made
known to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inspector General reviewed enforcement actions in six
states, including Massachusetts, and found widespread failure to
detect major air polluters.
</P>
<P>
   A study this year by the Environmental Working Group made
similar conclusions: ``Without question, the Clean Air Act is not
being effectively enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   The group analyzed the EPA's enforcement record and found that
one of every three major facilities in auto assembly, iron and
steel, petroleum refining, pulp manufacturing, and metal smetling
violated the Clean Air Act in 1997 or 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only a third of those violating the law were fined and the
fines that were levied were too small to have any effect, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a strong threat of enforcement, people will
break the law,'' said John Coequyt, who oversaw the study.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and Justice Department said action it took against 24
electric utility companies earlier this month is proof the Clinton
administration is serious about cracking down on air polluters.
</P>
<P>
   The government filed seven lawsuits in the south and midwest,
accusing the companies of illegally releasing massive amounts of
air pollutants and contributing to one of the most severe
environmental problems facing the country. The lawsuits seek fines
against the companies and action to force them to spend money on
new pollution-control devices. The companies have denied any
wrongdoing.

 WASHINGTON: ... any wrongdoing.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are few federal prosecutors in the country with as much
experience pursuing polluters as Gregory Sasse.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the EPA awarded Sasse a silver medal for superior
service for his work on a task force that secured the first
criminal indictment of a company violating the law designed to
prevent the release of chemicals hazardous to the ozone. That was
one of dozens of environmental cases the northern Ohio prosecutor
has investigated in 13 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Sasse, is that his boss and others in the
Justice Department don't want him doing his job so well. They may
talk of getting tough with polluters, but the reality is much
different, he said in an interview with the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Clinton administration took office, environmental
crimes were immediately dropped as a top priority,'' he said.
``They were consigned to the slagheap of priorities past, like
gambling and auto theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasse, according to a whistleblower complaint he filed in 1996,
said his superiors punished him for going after polluters,
downgrading performance evaluations and ordering him to abandon
promising cases. He said the retaliation started during the Bush
administration, but began anew with increased intensity during the
Clinton years. The same supervisors were responsible for all of the
alleged reprisals and remain in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Sasse said he was briefing his supervisor on
allegations that a steel company was illegally releasing toxins
into the air and sickening nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor responded by saying, ``If they don't like it, why
don't they just move,'' according to Sasse. When Sasse said the
plant's illegal polluting could be making people sick, the superior
was not sympathetic. ``People get sick all the time,'' Sasse said
his superior replied. ``I was sick last month and nobody opened a
criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasse's lawsuit is pending. He is not the only federal
environmental enforcement official making such a claim. In Texas,
prosecutor Ruth Ann Weidel filed a similar complaint in 1997. Her
lawsuit is also pending.
</P>
<P>
   Weidel, who has since left the US attorney's office, was a
veteran prosecutor and the former vice chair of the American Bar
Association's Environmental Crimes Committee. She prosecuted the
first criminal environmental cases in Arizona and the Los
Angeles-area district.
</P>
<P>
   While working in the southern Texas district, Weidel said she
experienced open hostility among superiors due to her work pursuing
environmental violators, according to the complaint she filed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she said her superiors failed to investigate political
interference in a case involving a major Clean Air Act violation by
a Texas corporation. She said state regulators and the EPA cut back
their involvement in the case because of political pressure
``exerted at the very highest levels of Texas state government.''
</P>
<P>
   Weidel said her role in environmental cases was diminished, in
part, because defense attorneys for polluters complained she was
too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   One result, she said, was the assignment of inexperienced
lawyers to important cases, including one that resulted in a major
decision against the Department of Justice that narrowed the
definition of a polluter. The case attracted national attention,
and according to Weidel's complaint, prompted a top Justice
Department official to loudly complain of ``the ineptitude and
incompetency'' of the Texas office.
</P>
<P>
   Weidel declined an interview request. The Justice Department has
denied her charges and Sasse's.
</P>
<P>
   Sasse is a reluctant critic of federal environmental
enforcement. He has never spoken publicly before about his
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, enforcement of environmental crimes protects the
integrity of the whole regulatory scheme,'' he said. ``The cold
economic reality is (that) noncompliance saves money and even if
you are caught, the civil fines are virtually never greater than
what it would have cost to comply. Without criminal prosecutions,
the system doesn't work. Not only is there a powerful incentive to
pollute, but complying is economic suicide. A lack of integrity in
the system breeds a lack of integrity in the private sector.''

<P>
   In 1990, Congress approved funding for 200 criminal agents to
work for the EPA chasing down polluters. It took seven years to
hire and train all of the new agents, who were expected to add
credibility to the ultimate threat against any polluter: the
possibility of a criminal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   While the agents have generated a modest increase in recommended
charges, there has been no noticeable rise in prosecutions. Justice
Department records indicate the number of criminal cases filed last
year is virtually the same filed during the last year of the Bush
administration, which was perceived as hostile to environmental
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there is a wide disparity in the number of polluters
charged with a crime. In some regions, there is virtually no
criminal environmental enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts ranks near the bottom of the 90 federal districts
in both the number of environmental cases referred for prosecution
and the number of cases prosecuted, according to an analysis of
case activity for every US attorney's office in the country. The
Globe obtained the case data from Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, a research group that studies
Justice Department enforcement records.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 through 1998, Massachusetts prosecuted environmental
crimes at a rate one-fourth the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 criminal agents assigned to the New England office of the
EPA ranked last in the country for the average number of cases
initiated last year _ an average of 2.9 cases per agent as compared
to 4.4 nationally and as high as 6.3 in the San Francisco region.
The average number of criminal referrals developed by the office
was also well below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some regions of the country, there is no dedicated
environmental crimes unit at the US attorney's office in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald Stern said the statistics don't give his
office credit for several major civil environmental cases it is
handling, as well as other cases that were environmental in nature
but classified as something else because the charges also involved
fraud. ``I place a high priority on environmental prosecutions,
both criminally and civilally,'' he said. ``Although we don't have
a separate unit, we have not failed to prosecute cases because of a
lack of resources or interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Attorney General Janet Reno sets priorities for the
nation's prosecutors, whether or not environmental crimes are
pursued is very often a local decision.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Florida, for instance, an environmental unit of six
lawyers generates cases and prosecutions at more than three times
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watts-FitzGerald, the chief of the unit, said the decision
to dedicate the six lawyers to environmental enforcement is largely
the decision of the local US attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has a national unit, based in Washington,
pursuing environmental crimes. That unit, however, has been under
attack from Congress. The unit's budget today is $7 million less
than it was in 1992 when adjusted for inflation. The practical
effect has been fewer people to handle cases. The impact shows on
the number of environmental prosecutions conducted, with
enforcement levels failing to increase from the Bush years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Congress this year slashed the EPA's enforcement
budget by $10.6 million, forcing the agency to cut such programs as
the Northeast Environmental Enforcement Project, which provided
legal and technical assistance to Massachusetts oficials
investigating environmental crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Justice Department defended the Clinton record
on environmental enforcement as impressive. The agency said it is
doing more complicated cases with greater environmental impact,
something which is not accurately accounted for in case statistics.
It points to a multistate action to clean up the Mississippi River
and criminal action against a major cruise line operator as
examples of its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental enforcement is a very high priority for me, for
Attorney General (Janet) Reno and this administration,'' said Lois
Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment and natural
resources. ``We have now as strong and effective an environmental
enforcement program as you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing criminal sanctions against polluters is only part of
the enforcement picture. Most cases are handled by issuing fines,
administrative orders, or warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, Massachusetts again falls short, producing fewer
enforcement actions per capita than the rest of the country,
according to EPA statistics. The New England area has 7 percent of
the country's enforcement personnel, but accounts for only 3
percent of the civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Local EPA officials say the statistics are misleading because
they don't measure the quality of cases or their outcomes, such as
the benefit to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go out and nickel and dime people all day long and pump
our numbers up,'' said DeVillars, who last week announced he would
soon leave his post as regional administrator for the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The New England region, however, is a battleground over a new
approach to environmental enforcement, one that is gaining currency
nationally. The chief component of the strategy is ``compliance
assistance,'' or working cooperatively with business and industry
to improve environmental performance.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner introduced the phrase in 1993
and reorganized the agency's enforcement program under the newly
named Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance. Promoting a
more cooperative approach toward business found support in
Congress, where Republicans have complained of overzealous and
unfair enforcement by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Few regions of the country have adopted compliance assistance
with the enthusiasm of the New England EPA district.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars said he is a ``firm believer in a collaborative
approach'' and a ``force for education and empowerment.'' But he
rejected the notion that his office has softened its level of
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   He said enforcement is vigorous in this region and is used in
combination with compliance assistance. In addition, he said his
office is targeting industries with the most serious pollution
problems, at the expense of improving the region's enforcement
numbers by pursuing smaller cases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics of this strategy say it allows businesses to get
away with crimes. Internally, the DeVillars approach has stirred
controversy. Several enforcement officials say the agency has
become subservient to business, sending a dangerous message to
polluters that penalties can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental problems today are less visible, but still
quite important,'' said one member of the regional legal team, who
like others asked not to be identified because they fear job
reprisals. ``Things will not change until the bottom line is
impacted.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars attributes much of the dissatisfaction with his
approach to a shakeup of the bureaucracy at the agency. He added,
however, that it is difficult to know if his tack is having a
greater effect than traditional enforcement. ``We are trying to
come up with measurements of success.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he has established a goal of making the Charles
River safe for swimming and fishing by Earth Day 2005. He said
traditional enforcement programs would never identify such a goal,
focusing instead on the number of enforcement actions and fines.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the same nationally. After detailing its
compliance assistance efforts, the EPA this year said, ``At the
present time, EPA has only limited data on the effects of
compliance assistance activities on environmental results.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Ruch, the executive director of Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility, a group representing many federal
enforcement personnel, said there is no evidence the less
confrontational, more educational approach toward industry is
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with this kind of thing all over the place,'' Ruch
said. ``The agency says compliance is up or the environment is
better off. The problem there is they never identify how the
environment is benefiting in a way that can be verified. All that
is being offered is unsupported rhetoric.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States government, which acts as steward and
protector of the nation's environment, is itself the worst polluter
in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have contaminated more than 60,000 sites across
the country and the cost of cleaning up the mess is officially
expected to approach $300 billion, nearly five times the price of
environmental destruction caused by private companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the real cost is likely tens of billions of dollars more,
according to government audits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every military base and nuclear arms facility in the
country is contaminated. The pollution extends from the US Mint,
which releases hazardous chemicals into the air when producing
commemorative coins, to the national parks, where leaky oil tanks
and raw sewage are polluting pristine rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Environmental Protection Agency, charged with enforcing
the country's environmental laws, has been fined for violating
toxic waste laws at its laboratories. At the EPA's lab in
Lexington, Mass., for example, mercury was discovered leaching into
the ground water three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of government pollution has been severe and
widespread. Some of the most contaminated spots on earth are the
property of the United States. The toxic waste has been linked to
increased cases of cancer and other illnesses for those living near
such sites.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pollution is historical residue that can be blamed
on some of the century's defining events: America's quest to put a
man on the moon to winning the Cold War against the former Soviet
Union. But the polluting by federal agencies is perpetuated by a
system in which there are often two sets of rules: one for the
government and another for private companies. There is also growing
concern among environmentalists and some enforcement officials that
instead of getting tougher with government polluters, Congress and
federal regulators are creating new loopholes and further relaxing
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sites have been cleaned up, but the government remains
the nation's premiere environmental felon,'' said Jonathan Turley,
a lawyer who directs George Washington University's Environmental
Crimes Project.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legacy of pollution, federal agencies remain exempt
from some environmental laws. Only last month, in a move that
surprised regulators, Congress added language to a budget bill that
would make it virtually impossible for the EPA to fine the military
for environmental violations.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also caught in a classic conflict of interest:
It is both the criminal and the cop.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, federal regulators have been accused of ignoring
evidence of environmental recklessness by their official brethren.
But even when doing their job, the regulators are handicapped. The
government can sue private companies to force them to clean up
contaminated sites and if warranted, take criminal action against
the firms and their employees. Yet those tools are off-limits to
officials when the polluter is the government itself.
</P>
<P>
   The result, critics say, is a system where the deck is stacked
in favor of the federal agency that violates the environment. ``The
government,'' said Virginia attorney Harry Kelso, a former federal
environmental crimes prosecutor, ``has a license to pollute.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's sewage problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every summer tourists migrate to Yellowstone National Park to
admire the ancient canyons, the magic of ``Old Faithful,'' and the
dark blue lakes and rivers that make up the 3,400-square-mile
historic site.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors from across the world admire the natural wonders,
the antiquated sewage system at the park struggles behind the
scenes to process the waste generated at park lodges and public
toilets. It often fails.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, tens of thousands of gallons of raw
sewage have flowed untreated into the lakes and streams of
Yellowstone National Park, in clear violation of the federal Clean
Water Act. Park officials have been embarrassed by the
contamination, but complain that for years their pleas to Congress
to upgrade the system have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   If the park were the property of a private company _ and not the
federal government _ the state of Wyoming or the EPA could punish
the polluter with fines and lawsuits. When the violator is the
National Park Service, however, there is little regulators can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many examples of the federal government failing to live
up to its own rules,'' said Gary Beach, the administrator of the
water quality division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be spending my time on the private sector,'' he said.
``I shouldn't have to be spending my time getting the federal
government to comply with their laws. I think it is embarrassing
when the Park Service, which is supposed to be a defender of the
environment, is polluting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like every other federal agency, the Park Service is exempt from
enforcement under the Clean Water Act, the historic measure
approved 30 years ago to protect the country's rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to penalize federal agencies that pollute
waterways is costly to the environment. Federal facilities are more
likely to violate water standards than private companies, EPA
records show. In addition, according to a report issued earlier
this year by the EPA Inspector General, federal agencies are
increasingly violating the law, with 27 percent of all government
facilities out of compliance in 1996, the latest year figures were
available, compared to 10 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, federal agencies have sent raw sewage flowing into
rivers and improperly disposed of waste from laboratories,
hospitals, and military installations, according to Mary Sweeney,
an assistant state attorney general who prosecutes environmental
violators. ``There is simply no reason for federal facilities to
continue to be held to a lower standard than private industry,''
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Congress has waived the government's
immunity from punishment under several environmental laws,
including hazardous waste disposal requirements and the release of
toxins into the air. The threat of fines in those areas, regulators
say, has prompted the government to pollute less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the military has been credited with improving its
daily environmental compliance in the past decade and becoming more
responsive to community concerns about contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been spending a hell of a lot of money for quite a while
now,'' said Gary Vest, the principal assistant deputy
undersecretary of defense for environmental security. ``It's almost
at 30 years now of having a formal environmental program at DOD. We
spent $5 billion a couple of years ago. When you spend so much
money on clean air and clean water, you would hope that you are
getting somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Exemptions and loopholes remain, however.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies are still exempt from many state environmental
laws, which in some cases are more stringent than federal
requirements. The US Navy, for example, is immune from state laws
and Coast Guard regulations governing oil spills. In Washington,
state regulators have repeatedly complained of Navy spills spoiling
Puget Sound. Last year, 6,000 gallons of jet fuel from the aircraft
carrier USS Kitty Hawk fouled the sound, one of three Navy spills
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials said the spills were the result of
negligence and would have resulted in fines of $90,000 if the Navy
were a private company. Instead, the Navy policed its own cleanup,
paid no fines, and even prevented state environmental experts from
boarding ships.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar in California, where the Navy is the
largest spiller of oil, according to state officials. In San Diego,
environmental activists say information has been withheld on some
incidents, including a 6,000-gallon oil spill at a Navy pier last
year and the 1996 release of mercury into the bay from a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had to play by the same rules everyone has to, it
would be a better situation,'' said Laura Hunter, the director of
the Clean Bay Campaign, an advocacy group that monitors US Navy
pollution. ``We get less protection than guaranteed by law because
of the presence of the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, in a statement, acknowledged that it is granted
``flexibility'' by Congress because of its ``unique mission,'' but
said it does not misuse that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy recognizes that with this flexibility comes
responsbility,'' the statement said. ``As a good steward of the
environment, (the) Navy has implemented its own spill contingency
planning, spill response, and spill reporting. It reports every
single spill.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of toughening standards for federal agencies,
enforcement officials are worried pollution standards are being
softened. ``Things are getting worse,'' said Vicki Peters, an
environmental prosecutor with the Colorado attorney general's
office. ``I am seeing backpedaling. . . . Anyone living around a
federal facility is not getting the same amount of protection as
someone living around a private site.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent reorganization of the Department of Energy, prompted
by concerns of security breaches at top-secret weapons plants, also
has had the effect of placing those plants outside the grasp of
environmental regulators.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton approved the new arrangement last month, but
said he had reservations about a number of the provisions,
including the section exempting the country's nuclear weapons
complex from environmental regulation. The new arrangement so
worried state environmental prosecutors that 43 of the 50 state
attorneys general in the country signed a letter warning Congress
of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over four decades, DOE and its predecessors operated with
no external oversight of (the) environment,'' they wrote. ``Over
the past 12 years or so, the disastrous consequences of this
self-regulation have become plain. DOE now oversees the largest
environmental cleanup program in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month, in a decision that several federal regulators
termed outrageous, Congress approved a defense spending plan that
would ``prohibit the payment of environmental fines or penalties
unless authorized by law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, when approving the spending plan, said he was troubled
by the fine provision. Environmental regulators said the measure
effectively takes away the ability to penalize the Department of
Defense when it pollutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breathtaking attack on federal enforcement,'' US
Representative William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote in
a letter to colleagues last month. ``At stake is the capacity of
the EPA and Justice Department to enforce pollution standards with
the tools essential to back up their sanctions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was a routine stop at the office ATM, and
suddenly I felt as if I had been transported to Las Vegas or an I
Love Lucy episode.
</P>
<P>
   I asked for $120, but the machine started spitting money at me:
$480, all counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the machine still raining money?'' asked the guy behind me,
grinning wickedly, as if to say, ``If only it were Friday, life
would be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   I could just picture Ricky saying, ``You've got some 'splaining
to do'' as I clutched my fistful of bills and hopped into the car
of a friend waiting to pick me up for lunch. ``Do you have a cell
phone?'' I demanded. ``I need to call security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to call them this minute?'' my friend laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sure,'' I said. ``I don't want them to think I ran off
with the cash.'' And I don't want to get too comfortable with that
money padding my wallet, I thought to myself.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question of not returning the money, of course. Yet
the thick wad of bills weighed on me with the full force of
conscience, and of possibility. How far could you trust yourself?
How much money would it take to tempt an honest person?
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you had no fear of security cameras or bank records. If
there were absolutely no chance of getting caught, could you be
sure you would do the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those instances when life imitates your
book-of-the-moment _ in my case, Anne Tyler's 1998 best-seller, ``A
Patchwork Planet.'' At the heart of the novel is the issue of
trust, and of doing the right thing when no one is looking.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old protagonist, Barnaby Gaitlin, lost everyone's
trust as a teen-ager, when he committed a series of break-ins. His
buddies nabbed the cash, while he became the notorious ``Paul Pry''
thief, poring over love letters and photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   As an adolescent, he is saved from jail by his parents'
considerable wealth and clout. As an adult, he refuses to work for
the Gaitlin Foundation, the family trust, choosing instead to do
manual labor for Rent-A-Back, where he does heavy lifting for
elderly clients.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby moves through life aimless, immature. Until he falls in
love with Sophia, a kind, responsible woman and incorrigible cooker
of Crockpot dinners. Her goodness, he hopes, will rub off on him.
</P>
<P>
   When Sophia's aunt, one of Barnaby's clients, accuses him of
stealing $2,600 she hid in her flour bin, Sophia stands by Barnaby
_ in all the wrong ways. Believing her lover to be guilty, she
replaces the money in the flour bin.
</P>
<P>
   When the real money turns up in the pocket of her aunt's
bathrobe, Sophia fesses up to her suspicions. Her actions prove her
love, she explained to Barnaby, because she loved him no matter
what. Barnaby can't articulate, even to himself, the source of his
dismay: He wants to be loved for the man he has become, a man who
can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   I had become attached to Sophia, and I wanted to yell at her,
``Cut it out! That's no way to run a relationship! Why, I trust my
husband more than I trust myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophia's act of loyalty was in another way an act of disloyalty,
her vote of confidence a vote of no-confidence. It is his
customers, ironically, who believe in Barnaby's innocence, swamping
him with orders.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's nice to be trusted. What's your hurry, my friend said,
about calling security? ``There's no way anyone would believe you
took that money. You wouldn't be capable of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what any of us is capable of, given the wrong
circumstances? But suddenly I understood how Barnaby felt.
</P>
<P>
   You count on the people in your life to trust you more than you
trust yourself.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The environmental contamination by the US government is so
severe and widespread that every region of the country is affected
in some way.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of cleaning up all of the privately-owned Superfund
sites in the United States _ properties operated by chemical and
oil companies, rubber manufacturers, huge industrial concerns, and
others _ is estimated by the EPA to cost $57 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up Superfund properties polluted by the federal
government, according to the EPA, could cost as much as $280
billion _ nearly five times the amount of private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Superfund list accounts for only a fraction of the
sites polluted by the federal government. In 1996, a panel of
government officials identified 61,155 sites across the country
contaminated by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense alone generates 750,000 tons of
hazardous waste each year, more than the combined production of the
country's five largest chemical companies, according to a study by
a task force of governors and attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of cleaning up sites not on the Superfund list is
expected to add billions more in costs. Though by most estimates
the cleanup of the government sites will take many more decades,
not enough money is being allocated to keep pace with established
timetables.
</P>
<P>
   DOE's budget for environmental cleanup has repeatedly been cut
during this decade. The Federation of American Scientists, a
Washington arms-control group, projects a shortfall of $4.4 billion
in the agency's cleanup budget through fiscal 2006.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress drastically slashed the budget for cleaning
up military bases scheduled for closure, likely delaying cleanups
at those sites. And within the Department of Defense, the amount
needed to restore contaminated sites is being underreported,
according to several audits. In 1998, the Pentagon estimated it
will cost $34.2 billion to clean up environmental hazards at bases
across the country. But that figure is inaccurate and the true cost
is much higher, according to a report issued in July by the
Pentagon's Inspector General.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the Navy failed to account for the cost of
disposing of nuclear reactors and nuclear waste, an amount that
could be as much as $13.2 billion. And the Army did not include
estimates for the cleanup of unexploded bombs, which could also
cost billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the most expensive cleanup will occur at weapons
plants operated by the Department of Energy, where a half century
of nuclear missile and bomb production has contaminated 475 billion
gallons of ground water.
</P>
<P>
   DOE this year told Congress it will spend at least $147 billion
to cleanup 113 sites across the country _ and that the work will
take another 75 years to complete. Former workers at nuclear
weapons plants across the country are charging in lawsuits that
they were sickened and colleagues died from years of exposure to
radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   New England is home to hundreds of locations polluted by the
federal government, including a dozen Superfund sites.
</P>
<P>
   The soil at the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station, which
local officials want to convert into a massive mall, is
contaminated with volatile organic compounds and heavy metals,
according to the EPA. Ground water near former landfills, dumps,
and training areas on the site is also contaminated with heavy
metals.
</P>
<P>
   At the US Army's Natick Laboratory, contamination threatens the
drinking water supply for nearby residents and Lake Cochituate,
where the town has posted a warning about eating fish caught there
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The government Superfund sites stretch across New England, from
the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine to the New London
Submarine Base in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But government pollution extends beyond the country's military
and nuclear weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has identified 913 potentially contaminated sites at 22
facilities in 10 states. The agency has estimated cleanup costs at
$1.5 billion. As of 1997, only 3 percent of the sites had been, or
were being, cleaned up. The agency was slow to identify polluted
areas, taking five years just to survey its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the magnitude of the problems at
federally-contaminated sites, the issue suffers from political
indifference, said Kelso, the former environmental prosecutor who
has forced the government to clean up some polluted sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure this country has been leveled with,'' he said.
``I'm not even sure that Congress has been leveled with, or the
president.''
</P>
<P>

Regulator wears two hats
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, a US Navy jet left Andrews Air Force Base en route
to a rendezvous with an aircraft carrier off the Florida coast. On
board were members of the Navy general counsel's office and other
military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Also along for the ride was Lois Schiffer, the top environmental
official for the Department of Justice, and another high-ranking
Justice lawyer. The group spent a night aboard the nuclear-powered
USS John C. Stennis.
</P>
<P>
   For Navy officials, the trip to Florida was a chance to build
good will with Schiffer. To others it highlighted an inherent
conflict of interest at the Justice Department. Schiffer wears two
hats: She is at once the highest-ranking environmental prosecutor
in the country and the chief defender for federal agencies accused
of violating environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have cases for the Navy, sometimes as a polluter in
cases related to aircraft carriers,'' she said of the trip. ``It is
a lot easier to figure out your position on a case if you see
one.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers working for Schiffer has charged that the
Justice Department's environmental and natural resources division
actually works to protect government agencies engaged in
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is a systemic one, caused by the existence of a
Division culture that places a premium on the protection of the
government bureaucracy instead of an attorney's duties to the
public interest, the truth, and the court,'' wrote attorney Daniel
Jacobs in a letter this year to Attorney General Janet Reno, a copy
of which was provided to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs told Reno he has evidence of a US government agency that
he did not name routinely destroying records.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that when he reported the alleged government
wrongdoing, Schiffer allegedly retaliated against him, and later
warned him that releasing documents relating to the case was
illegal. Jacobs is now involved in an extraordinary legal battle
with his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs's performance rating was downgraded and he was
transferred to another job. Jacobs recently won a court case
allowing him to show his attorney the same records he provided
Schiffer. The attorney can now advise Jacobs of his legal options.
Schiffer declined comment on Jacobs's case.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there is little the Justice Department can do to
penalize federal agencies that pollute. The Justice Department is
prohibited from filing lawsuits or issuing fines against other
federal agencies. Both of these tools are frequently employed by
the department when pursuing private polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal agencies are required by a 1992 law to comply
with all environmental statutes, there are few consequences if they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   The small EPA office charged with keeping federal polluters in
line is often overmatched politically. Several EPA officials said
privately they want to take more action against federal agencies
that pollute, but are hamstrung by special exemptions and political
considerations, such as congressmen worried about the impact of
environmental enforcement on hometown bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, on environmental compliance, the EPA is like a
David with a bunch of Goliaths, especially when it comes to the
military,'' said Cathy Lemar, director of the Military Toxics
Project, a nonprofit group that monitors base cleanups across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has also stumbled internally, unable to complete even
basic mandates requiring the agency to monitor the compliance of
federal facilities with environmental laws, and track their
spending on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many frustrated regulators, particularly at the EPA, said little
will change until Congress and the president toughen laws and
federal agencies fear the consequences of polluting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what folks have been willing to pay for,''
said one EPA official, who agreed to an interview only if he was
not named. ``This is (what) I would call less than a band-aid
applied against a compound fracture of the nation's skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the federal government is getting away with murder
and the EPA is not legally or politically powerful enough to turn
the tide.''

   &UR; The US government is among the world's worst polluters. Federal
agencies have contaminated more than 60,000 sites across the
country. The cost of cleaning up the worst sites is officially
expected to approach $300 billion. And wherever US bases have been
located around the world, similar problems have occurred. In a
four-part series, the Globe explores the dilemma.

 &HT;    Whatever happened to candles, hats and Pin the Tail on the
Donkey?
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Commandment No. 1 from the Children's
Birthday Party Bible: Always RSVP.
</P>
<P>
   That's repondez s'il vous plait. Meaning, let the host know in
advance whether you'll be . . .
</P>
<P>
   Oh, nevermind.
</P>
<P>
   No one RSVPs anymore. Might as well doodle on the invitation for
all the good writing ``RSVP'' does.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe it, but many people do not know what RSVP
means,'' etiquette author Dana May Casperson says. ``No one ever
taught them. Or else they just don't bother anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's just a handful of confetti these days compared to
other egregious breaches in polite behavior at children's parties.
</P>
<P>
   Like the mom who brings little Johnny to the party . . . along
with five of his hungry, thirsty, noisy _ and uninvited _ siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Or the dad who drops off little Susie an hour late . . . and
picks her up an hour after everyone else has gone home.
</P>
<P>
   Or the parents who ``dump and run,'' leaving the party host to
manage their inquisitive toddler while they get hours of kid-free
shopping done at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just the guests. The hosts _ out to impress their
children and every other parent in the neighborhood _ often go so
overboard with Broadway-sized birthday productions that they forget
basic points of politeness.
</P>
<P>
   Like greeting guests as they arrive, or seeing them to the door
as they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Or sending ``thank you'' cards after the soiree.
</P>
<P>
   Or teaching little Susie not to yell ``I ALREADY HAVE ONE OF
THESE!!!'' when opening her presents. Heck, some parents just
collect gifts like a door charge and have the kids open them later.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say birthday parties are a great chance for parents to
teach kids social skills they can use the rest of their lives. Like
being a gracious host who thinks of guests first. Or being a
gracious guest who remembers the party is for honoring the birthday
boy or girl, not snatching all the party favors their little hands
can hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children have to be reminded over and over to develop those
skills so it becomes second nature,'' Casperson said. ``It's not
just for one party. It carries over into bigger events when they
get older, like weddings and housewarmings.''
</P>
<P>
   For hosts, it's important to teach children that while the
soiree is for them, they have to be considerate of others'
feelings. That means including all the children in whatever
activities are planned and making sure everyone is served. Equally
apportioned goodie bags also go a long way. ``Bag envy,'' as those
in the birthday biz call it, has led to more than a few fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Giving older children a choice in their parties can teach them
how much work goes into the planning and preparation. Let them fill
party favor bags, help make the cake or prepare invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Altman says her son James' best birthday party was the one
he never had. Altman is editor of Parenting Plus , a magazine that
publishes in the Palm Beaches and Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   During vacation this year, Altman took her 6-year-old trout
fishing, something he'd always wanted to try. Sure, it was at a
trout farm, but he didn't know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   After he caught the trout, the farm operators told them he could
have the fish mounted as a trophy _ for a steep fee.
</P>
<P>
   Altman offered him a choice: a birthday party when they got back
home or the mounted trout. The trout won.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're terrible for that,'' she said. ``But we had
a little cake in our cabin for him and he's going to get a fish on
his wall, something he actually wanted. And we got to avoid the
circus of having a birthday party.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach parent Beth Cole says she has tried to follow a
common-sense approach with her parties for daughter Laura, 6, and
Peyton Jr. (PJ) , who is 4.
</P>
<P>
   The past two years, she's opted to have PJ's party at school.
Along with having cake and party favors for his classmates, she's
hired wildlife handlers to bring kid-friendly birds, lizards,
skunks, snakes and porcupines to his pre-school so that all the
kids can participate. That way, PJ gets to be with his friends, no
one gets excluded, and Cole's carpet and furnishings stay free of
juice and ice cream stains.
</P>
<P>
   For her daughter, she usually lets her invite three or four
girlfriends somewhere away from home, such as a water park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal with the parties is to never have a large group of
children in my house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The closest she's come is having a handful of her daughter's
friends sleep over after the party. Even that simple plan became a
fiasco when two girls had a fight and one decided she wanted Cole
to call home so her mother could come get her.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's pet peeves: Parents who invite too many kids or who host
parties that are inappropriate for the age. ``You do not take a
group of kids to a PG-13 movie when they're 6 or 7.'' And lunchtime
parties that don't serve food until 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the parents who use parties as weekend day-care.
</P>
<P>
   After one party, Cole found herself baby-sitting a 4-year-old an
hour after everyone else went home. Cole said that when the boy's
mom finally got there, ``She said, 'Oh, hi. I'm here.' She didn't
even thank me for watching her kid for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   For today's parents, birthdays are especially tough because
parties are a much bigger deal now than a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were young, it was a cake, Pin the Tail on the Donkey
and we were done,'' said Ann Hallock, editor of Family Fun
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine recently offered a series of birthday tips. Among
them: Start small, especially for kids ages 3 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to be hiring a trapeze artist,'' Hallock said.
``For kids that age, balloons and cake are pretty exciting. And if
you start off with it being unbelievable and you have to take a
week off work to plan it, you're only creating a problem for next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Good advice, but South Floridians may not be listening. In
January 1995, Bill and Robin Lanting hosted the greatest show on
earth for their son Parker's 3rd birthday: elephants, llamas,
clowns, trapeze artists and a 70-foot-long, big-top tent.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, for son Chase's 6th birthday party, they
arranged for three Humvees full of Army regulars and reservists
from the West Palm Beach garrison to arrive with camouflaged faces
and toy guns and invade the house.
</P>
<P>
   The Lantings rented bumper boats for the backyard swimming pool
and dumped in dry ice to give the pool a foggy effect. Uniformed
U.S. Naval Sea Cadets supervised the kiddie naval battles.
</P>
<P>
   The children dined on military-styled grub: chipped beef, mashed
potatoes and peas. The parents got catered seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my mission in life,'' Robin Lanting said at the time.
``I'm a mother who likes throwing parties for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Such excess almost always leads to trouble, etiquette maven
Casperson said. Parents wind up spending more time planning and
carrying off the party than they do spending time with their
children or teaching them how to behave in a social situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, the kids wind up expecting each year that their birthday
party will be the most wonderful thing in the world,'' she said.
``That's out of proportion to reality, of course. These lavish
affairs are nothing more than a showing of financial success most
times. And they're not fair to the children because it causes
overstimulation and wears them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tips for a successful birthday party
</P>
<P>
   Have you really thought of everything? Local party experts and
several birthday-tested parents offer these tips for planning a
successful birthday party:
</P>
<P>
   _ Include your child. Let children help plan the party,
including choosing a theme, decorating invitations and picking out
party favors. Surprises are fun, but kids like to get involved in
planning, and this is a time when they're motivated to be
especially helpful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start early. Check out your options, get the best price,
create a fallback plan if necessary. Start two to three months in
advance if you're going to involve your children. If you choose a
theme, carry it through from beginning to end, including
invitations, crafts, games, cake and party favors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the party manageable. It's tempting to invite the whole
second-grade class for the afternoon, but you'll likely regret it.
Follow the old rule of inviting the same number of guests as your
child's age.
</P>
<P>
   _ Experiment. Think creatively and put away that rectangle cake
pan. Or better yet, opt for decorated cupcakes instead.
</P>
<P>
   _ Party time. If you're planning a Saturday afternoon party at a
popular attraction, be prepared for a mob. If you can swing a
weekday party, you'll get a calmer atmosphere and maybe a better
price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of sleep-overs. For kids under 10, it's often
impossible to get past midnight without at least one ``I want to go
home'' problem. For pre-teens, sleepovers seem to have become the
party of choice, but be specific about when kids are expected to go
to sleep, or they won't.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a list of party necessities. If you're holding a party
away from home, remember to bring camera, film, refreshments,
matches, knife, bag for taking gifts home, notepad for keeping
track of who gave what, wet wipes for getting kids clean enough to
sit in your car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be afraid to ask for help. Recruit helpers for big
parties. Unless you're sure you'll have help from parents, hire
baby-sitters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget thank-you notes. No matter the age of your child,
it's proper etiquette to send written thank-you notes. A parent can
write the note if the child is under age 5 or hasn't learned to
print.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be prepared. Parents think nothing these days of bringing
along a couple extra siblings. Plan for unexpected guests. It's
normal to have extras show up at parties, so have extra food and
favors ready.
</P>

 &HT;    High Court holy war
 &HT;    By RowlanD Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Get ready, America. The Supreme Court is juggling
a Hail Mary pass lobbed from Texas that will influence the national
school prayer struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where football is religion and religion is a contact
sport, a church-and-state controversy that erupted at a public high
school football game will be decided by the republic's nine highest
constitutional refs.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision will be final.
</P>
<P>
   Let's roll the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Several families asked officials with the Santa Fe Independent
School District, located in the flat land south of Houston, to stop
having students lead the audience in prayer before the Indians took
the field against visiting high school teams.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe school officials denied the request.
</P>
<P>
   Two families, one Mormon and one Roman Catholic, went to court
claiming that the practice, which was under control of government
employees in the public school district, violated the U.S.
Constitution's First Amendment that says, ``Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the
families. Santa Fe's officials appealed the ruling and have
continued student-led prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the man who would be president, signed a
brief urging the Supreme Court to hear the case. Eight other states
did likewise.
</P>
<P>
   They asked for it. Now they've got it. The case now is in the
hands of the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe school officials also asked the Supreme Court to review
a federal appeals court decision that ruled students could offer
prayers at graduation ceremonies as long the prayers did not
proselytize and were nonsectarian.
</P>
<P>
   School officials claimed this ruling forced officials to
officially discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has never taken up the question of student-led
prayers at graduation ceremonies, although it did rule in 1992 that
public schools could not invite members of the clergy to lead
graduation prayers.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the families said Santa Fe officials were
deliberately circumventing the court's 1992 decision by having
student surrogates lead a captive audience in government-controlled
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices took the football-prayer appeal, but not the
graduation-prayer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The court may now hear arguments over the difference between a
government-controlled prayer at a graduation ceremony and a
government-controlled prayer at a football game.
</P>
<P>
   If the argument is put forward that graduation ceremonies are
more solemn and important and therefore more likely to demand
involuntary attendance than football games, then the justices, none
of whom are from Texas, need to understand that this thinking is
reversed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, attendance at high school graduation ceremonies is
more likely to be voluntary while attendance at high school
football games is more likely to be involuntary.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea is that the government can approve religious
observances regardless of the feelings of the audience only when
the ceremonies are solemn and serious, then the justices need to
understand that football is worshipped in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting hairs between student-led prayers at two Texas rituals
replaces the wall between church and state a with transparent veil.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a crushing setback to Thomas Jefferson, who wrote
the following to the Danbury Baptist Association on Jan. 1, 1802:
</P>
<P>
   ``I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole
American people which declared that their legislature should `make
no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between
church and state.''

 &HT;    Powerful (gasp!) new star in the firma-mint
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For all the mints crowding store shelves
these days, you'd think Americans had the collective breath of
German shepherds.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any breath mints, but ``power'' mints. That's the
name the industry gives to the kind of confection that makes your
throat feel like you've inhaled a bucket of dry ice. Heck, there's
even an aptly named line of Powerful Mints, part of the $302
million breath freshener market.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Altoids, the ``curiously strong'' mint, that has long
blown away the competition in its whoosh of peppermint scent. Now a
third flavor has joined the small but powerful Altoids line-up.
Imagine opening your mouth to a 40-below wind-chill and sprinkling
in a little cinnamon, and you have the flavor experience. (Altoids
is even releasing a promotional film to introduce consumers to a
Sindy, the female embodiment of the new cinnamon mint.)
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon is the third flavor for Altoids, which first appeared
in England about the time the colonies were rebelling against King
George III. (The others: original peppermint and the newer
wintergreen, which debuted this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the competition, Altoids has a curiously strong fan base.
The mints even found their way into government documents, thanks to
Monica Lewinsky, who exchanged e-mails with President Clinton about
the alleged effects of including Altoids in certain intimate acts.
That correspondence became part of the Starr Report.
</P>
<P>
   Since demand for power mints began increasing about a year ago,
Starbucks has rolled out After Coffee Mints and Neiman Marcus
introduced a characteristically understated (but hardly
under-flavored) ``the mint.'' Certs amped up their offerings with
Powerful Mints. Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip Dilbert,
has even given his approval to a new line of Perfor-mints, which
are shaped like the strip's characters.
</P>
<P>
   The next target: women. The folks who make Altoids, Callard &AMP;
Bowser, just unveiled a less-potent, female-targeted hard candy
under a different name, La Vie de la Vosgienne. (Slogan: ``Say La
Vie.'') The candies come in tin containers which, the ads brag,
give other sweets ``a packaging complex.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, flavor is not enough. Part of Altoids' appeal has
long been those metal containers, used since the 1920s. So popular
are the tin boxes that the company trumpets their versatility in
ads: ``The distinctive tins have hundreds of household uses, such
as holding nails, fishing tackle, coins, pins, paper clips. One
wilderness group even uses them as emergency stoves.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the tin drum is Penguin, a mint that's now the rage in
Silicon Valley among computer chipheads mostly because of their
caffeinated peppermints. (Why not just call them Amphetimints?)
Their frozen-tongue-in-cheek warning: ``For use while driving or
operating heavy machinery.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the ``cold'' front this winter: Mentos Cool Chews,
billed as the ``first chewy strong mint.'' Their makers are
spending millions in marketing aimed at MTV-aged viewers, including
Mentos-sponsored rock concerts, a mail-in offer for a free
Freshmaker Tour CD, and a contest offering the chance to sit
onstage at a concert in a La-Z-Boy recliner that will later be
shipped to the winner's home.
</P>
<P>
   Why this sudden American yen for powerful tastes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have an openness toward food now,'' says Susan Smith
of the National Confectioners Association. ``They like ethnic food,
spicy food and lots of high flavors. And it's not just adults who
like them. My 11-year-old son, who sometimes even forgets to brush
his teeth, is crazy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I equate it to salsa outselling ketchup,'' says Pamela Byrne
of Warner-Lambert Co., manufacturer of Certs. ``America wants
robust flavors.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: The U.S. Supreme Court is considering the issue of
grandparents' visitation rights. Can you list the names of the
justices, and their address, so we can write to express our opinion
and tell our stories?
</P>
<P>
   A: The nine justices: William Rehnquist (chief justice); Stephen
Breyer; Ruth Bader Ginsburg; Anthony Kennedy; Sandra Day O'Connor;
Antonin Scalia; David Souter; John Paul Stevens; Clarence Thomas.
The mailing address: Supreme Court of the United States, 1 First
St. NE, Washington, DC 20543.
</P>
<P>
   But you need to know that letters from the public will not have
any effect on the Supreme Court's decision-making process, on this
or any other issue under consideration. As a representative said,
it's not a court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the Newbery Medals? Who gives them out, and when did
they start?
</P>
<P>
   A: The medals are awards given every year by the American
Library Association to the author of the book considered the most
distinguished contribution to American literature for children.
</P>
<P>
   The medals originated in 1921 when a bookseller named Frederic
Melcher decided that authors would write better books for young
readers if there were an award for high-quality childrens'
literature. At the time, most books published for youngeters in the
United States were formula fiction, such as those featuring Hardy
Boys, Nancy Drew and the Bobbsey Twins.
</P>
<P>
   So Melcher created the Newbery Medal _ named after John Newbery,
an English publisher and bookseller in the mid 1700s _ and asked
childrens' librarians who were members of the American Library
Association to decide which book was the most distinguished of the
year. A committee of 15 such librarians who are members of the
ALA's Association of Library Services to Children meets each year
to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did ``Indian summer'' get its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, let's explain what Indian summer is. It's a short
period of especially fair weather and mild days usually coming in
late October and early November, when the leaves are turning and
falling, following the autumn's first cold spell.
</P>
<P>
   World Book Encyclopedia explains that the origin of the term is
uncertain, but speculates that the American settlers named the
period after the American Indians, who told the settlers in advance
that this period would come. And every year it did, right on cue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picturesque Expressions: A Thematic Dictionary'' says the
American Indians, who always took advantage of the unseasonably
warm weather to make their final preparations for winter, called
the period the special gift of a favorite god, Cautantowwit, the
god of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We were talking about baseball the other day, and the name of
Josh Gibson came up. Someone said he hit more than 900 home runs in
his career. Do you have any information about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Specific statistics are in question because, as the book ``A
Who's Who of Sports Champions'' states, the Negro Leagues didn't
keep documentable records. But there's no disputing that Gibson was
a great hitter. Satchel Paige went so far as to call him ``the
greatest hitter who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was born on Dec. 21, 1911, in Buena Vista, Ga. His family
moved to Pittsburgh in 1924, where he started playing semipro
baseball. He began playing in the Negro Leagues in 1930. A catcher,
he played mostly for teams in and around Pittsburgh, including the
Homestead Grays and the Pittsburgh Crawfords. He also played winter
baseball in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Gibson is believed to have hit about 800 home
runs, including one measuring an astounding 575 feet. He was
credited with as many as 84 home runs in a season, which may have
included as many as 200 games.
</P>
<P>
   He died suddenly of a brain tumor on Jan. 20, 1947, the year
Jackie Robinson became the first black player in the Major Leagues.
In recognition of his accomplishments, Gibson was inducted into the
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The History Channel recently featured John DeLorean and his
gull-wing sports car from the early 1980s. It mentioned that he's
planning a new lightweight car made of plastic. Do you know
anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Still the visionary engineer obsessed with aerodynamics,
lightweight materials and speed _ think of the sleek time-travel
car of the ``Back to the Future'' movies _ John Z. DeLorean does
indeed have on the drawing board a new sports car. According to
him, it would rocket from zero to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds, and would
cost less than $20,000. Like the earlier DeLorean, and the
Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe before that, it would have flip-up
gull-wing doors.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, DeLorean declined to provide any
specifics about his partners or source of financing. But he said he
was sure he would build the car, perhaps in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   His initial sports car, made in Northern Ireland, was an
attention-getter for its styling and performance, but failed in the
marketplace after DeLorean was tried on charges of cocaine
trafficking and fraud. His accusers said he was trying to raise
money by illegal means to save the troubled DeLorean Motor Car Co.
He was acquitted in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the flight recorder in airplanes called a black box,
when it's actually orange?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aviation veterans say the black boxes were never black. They
were tan, yellow or _ the standard today _ orange. That's to make
them easier to find. In military aviation, the term referred to any
compact experimental or secret high-technology electronics
equipment, especially radar. The phrase has stuck to this day, now
used mainly to describe a flight recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former Sen. Bob Dole is heading a campaign to raise $100
million in private donations for the planned World War II Memorial.
Where can we send contributions?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've printed the information before, but it's well worth
repeating. If you want to send a check, make it out to World War II
Memorial and mail to: World War II Memorial, P.O. Box 96766,
Washington, DC 20090-6766. Credit card donations also can be made
online _ www.wwiimemorial.com/donorprograms/donation.cfm _ or you
can call 1-800-639-4992 to make a credit card donation or to get
information. The estimated cost to design, construct and maintain
the memorial is $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the memorial is scheduled for Veterans Day
2000. It's expected to be a reality three years after that. As of
June, about $60 million has been received from individuals,
corporations, veterans' groups and other donors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was astronaut John Casper's background, and what is he
doing now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Casper is a veteran of four spaceflights. He was the pilot
for a scientific mission by space shuttle Atlantis 1990 and was
commander for three other shuttle scientific flights in 1993, 1994
and 1996. He logged more than 825 hours in space.
</P>
<P>
   A retired Air Force colonel, Casper was born in Greenville,
S.C., in 1943. He lived in the Atlanta suburbs of Doraville and
Chamblee as a child. He attended Georgia Tech for a year, then
entered the Air Force Academy, where he received a B.S. degree in
engineering science in 1996. He earned a master of science degree
in astronautics the following year from Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lives in Houston, Casper still considers
Gainesville, Ga., to be his hometown. He is director of safety,
reliability and quality assurance for the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Norman Rockwell has been in the news recently because of an
exhibition of his works opening in Atlanta. In all the coverage
about his life and career, I haven't seen any mention of the cause
of his death. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: In announcing his death on Nov. 8, 1978, at his home in
Stockbridge, Mass., his wife, Molly, said simply: ``He didn't die
of anything except being 84 years old.'' Rockwell had been in
failing health for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand the Titanic was trying to win the Blue Riband
for speed when it went down. What was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Blue Riband was (and still is) a British title that has
commemorated record-breaking trans-Atlantic passages for more than
160 years. It's verbal only, meaning there's no actual trophy or
ribbon. While some believe that it should be preserved for liners
of old, or at least kept for ocean-going successors worthy of the
mystique, others disagree and claim it for more modern vessels,
such as sailboats and water-jet propelled craft.
</P>
<P>
   The first Blue Riband was conferred on the paddlewheel steamer
Great Western in 1838. The title simply related to the fastest
Atlantic crossing, east or west, in a day when merchant vessels
were the only links between the continents. The terminal points
varied for many years until they were set as Ambrose Light off New
York and Bishops Rock Light off England's Scilly Isles.
</P>
<P>
   Other vessels capturing the Blue Riband have included the City
of Brussels, which took it for Belgium in 1869; the Teutonic, for
Germany, in 1891; the Lusitania and the Mauretania, for England, in
1909; the Rex, for Italy, in 1933; the Normandie, for France, in
1935; the Queen Mary, for England, in 1938; and the United States,
for the United States, in 1952.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If it's your first Thanksgiving in Texas, get
with the program. The state tree is the pecan, so it's no surprise
that this tasty nut shows up on the holiday table in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular is that ultra-rich pecan pie, a quick
mix-and-pour-in-a-pastry-shell dessert. Whether you use two eggs or
three, dark corn syrup or light, white sugar or brown is all a
matter of preference or family tradition. Here are a trio of
recipes to tempt you. Clip and save. The pecan crop is good this
year.

 &HT;    You make the call on sweet potato casseroles
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are almost as many versions of this casserole in Texas as
there are Cowboy fans. Here are two that see plenty of action on
the Thanksgiving table.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Potato Casserole
</P>
<P>
   3 cups cooked sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup melted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons melted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped nuts
</P>
<P>
   Mix all ingredients, except topping, together and place in dish.
</P>
<P>
   Combine topping ingredients and sprinkle on sweet potatoes. Or
combine brown sugar, flour and nuts and sprinkle on sweet potatoes;
then drizzle with melted butter. (Can be refrigerated at this point
and baked the next day.) Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith's Sweet Potato Casserole
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 large sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 stick butter or margarine, melted
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon allspice
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   1 stick butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups pecan pieces
</P>
<P>
   In large pot, boil the potatoes with skins on until they are
soft. Let the potatoes cool. Remove the skins and place the
potatoes in a large mixing bowl. Whip the potatoes with electric
mixer until smooth. Add the egg, sugar, butter, flour and
evaporated milk. Mix well to blend. Add the spices and vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Make topping by melting the butter in a medium saucepan over low
heat. Then add the brown sugar and pecans and stir until the
mixture is smooth and easy to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon the potatoes into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish. Spread
the topping evenly over the potatoes. Bake for 40 minutes in an
oven heated to 350 degrees. Serve while you cheer for the Cowboys.

 &HT;    There's something about Brussels sprouts
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be honest. Did anyone ever look at the Thanksgiving table and
say, ``Oh, goody! Brussels sprouts!''
</P>
<P>
   But as sure as turkey is the main course, it's guaranteed that
November food magazines will have pictures of the bird surrounded
by little green Brussels sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's to add eye appeal for the camera, a bit of color, a
different shape. Maybe it's because of the season. Thanksgiving may
be a celebration of the harvest, but by the end of November the
produce harvest is mostly past. The green beans probably come from
California or south of the border, and often look it. Broccoli is
the green vegetable we'll be stuck with for months to come _ hardly
a reason for celebration. Snow peas and sugar snaps are too new to
the American culinary scene to be grounded in tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Brussels sprouts, however, like any good member of the cabbage
family, seem suited to the season.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with the phenomenon, food writers take steps to add to the
appeal of these miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   One technique that shows up sometimes is to separate the sprouts
into individual leaves before they're cooked. I did that once, and
it is not something you want to do on a busy day.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be busy this year, for there will be 20 at our
Thanksgiving table. Given the division of labor, it falls to me to
make the stuffing, the mashed potatoes, the pumpkin pie and the
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   The immemorable vegetable. But there must be one on the
sideboard, even if it is a token. So this year I took the challenge
and started early, testing various recipes, looking for a
preparation that would earn a nod of approval if not enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   I found one. It may not invite seconds, not in competition with
the garlic roasted mashed potatoes and the biscuit and cornbread
stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe next year someone will say, ``Oh, goody! Ann's
Brussels sprouts!''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to double the recipe, use two large skillets.
</P>
<P>
   PAN-BROWNED BRUSSELS SPROUTS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Brussels sprouts, of even size
</P>
<P>
   4 large cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted
</P>
<P>
   Rinse sprouts in cold water. Trim the bottom stem and remove
loose outer layers. Cut sprouts in half lengthwise. Cut garlic into
very thin slices.
</P>
<P>
   In a large, heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter with the
oil over moderate heat, then cook garlic, stirring, until pale
golden. Transfer garlic with a slotted spoon to a small dish lined
with a paper towel. Reduce heat to low and arrange sprouts in the
skillet, cut sides down, in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt to
taste. Cook sprouts, without turning, until tender and undersides
are golden brown (about 15 minutes). Resist the temptation to turn
up the heat to speed the process. Check doneness with the tip of a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   With tongs, transfer sprouts to a serving plate, browned sides
up. Add the golden garlic, pine nuts and remaining butter to the
skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, for about 1 minute.
Spoon over the sprouts and sprinkle with freshly ground black
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Toast the pine nuts in a 350-degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes,
until golden.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This makes 4 moderate servings, about all anyone will
spoon up unless they are ardent fans of Brussels sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 245 calories, 21 g
fat, 25 mg cholesterol, 31 mg sodium, plus salt to taste.

 &HT;    The birth of road food
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We drove our new cars across America, and plugged in to the
electricity that wired the country. Speedy transportation and
instant power would dramatically alter the way Americans cooked and
ate in the second quarter of the century.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy that would soon fail tragically, the dark days
of the Great Depression and the beginning of World World II also
colored our culinary landscape. Home cooks were without kitchen
help when the Depression hit, and many took to the job with relish,
learning about the regional foods they sampled while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Travel they did: Americans moved about in mass numbers for the
promise of better jobs, or just to see the country. Road food was
born, and more than ever, restaurants became social as well as food
venues.
</P>
<P>
   In metropolitan areas, moving pictures captured the essence of
Hollywood glamour and elegance. Cocktails before dinner and lavish,
sophisticated parties inspired a new approach to entertaining _
with alcohol as a main beverage.
</P>
<P>
   On the farms, radio made homey recipe chats popular. Cooks
across the nation were hearing about the same foods and recipes and
were introduced to new technologies at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens were modernized _ toast popped up from toasters and
didn't need to be watched. Refrigerators were larger, and included
freezing compartments, just right for Clarence Birdseye's
newfangled idea: ``frosted foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Health issues continued to grow, and food additives were
scrutinized carefully by the FDA. Vitamins and minerals necessary
for healthy bodies were identified and added to foods to prevent
many common diseases. The seven food groups were outlined as the
nutrition standard for Americans. We become vitamin-crazed _ only
laxatives outsold vitamins in pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the 1930s brought World War II rationing, and
economical recipes used during the Depression remained on the
table. Cooks became creative with fewer meats and more starches _
rice salads and macaroni and cheese came of age.
</P>
<P>
   Women were in factories, not in the kitchen, as the war
progressed. Dozens of gadgets made the cook's job easier and
faster. The pressure cooker, invented for the military, was sold to
wartime cooks, who put it to work canning vegetables from their
victory gardens.
</P>
<P>
   This was the decade of instant foods: instant coffee, boxed cake
mixes, Nestle's Quik chocolate mix, instant mashed potatoes and
frozen orange juice concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation flew into the '50s, the men came home from the war
and women returned to their homes _ but not to their aprons. They
were primed to get out of the kitchen and into the workforce. Home
dining declined, and restaurant meals grew in a trend that
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   Our soldiers brought food ideas from the countries where they
had served. Chefs would soon pick up on Italian pastas, Hawaiian
tropical fruits and French wines. The coming decade would bring
even more ethnic changes to menus, supermarket shelves and tables
across America.

 &HT;    Popular recipes from the second quarter of the 20th century
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Credited to an insurance salesman and
hobby cook in California, the chiffon cake was described as a
``high-rising new cake that melts in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   General Mills bought the recipe in 1947 and printed it in a
leaflet.
</P>
<P>
   CHIFFON CAKE
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4cups sifted cake flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   3teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   5egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   3/4cups cold water
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1cup egg whites (7 or 8 egg whites)
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder,
and salt into large mixing bowl. Make a well in center, and add
oil, egg yolks, water, vanilla and lemon zest. Beat until smooth
with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Whip egg whites with cream of tartar until they hold a stiff
peak. Pour yolk mixture gradually over beaten whites, gently
folding in with a rubber spatula just until blended.
</P>
<P>
   Pour batter into ungreased 10-inch tube pan, and bake 55
minutes. Raise the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake 10 to
15 minutes longer or until surface springs back when lightly
touched.
</P>
<P>
   Invert pan immediately on top of a funnel to cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Turn pan right-side up and rap sharply on counter to loosen
cake. Turn cake out and frost or glaze as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: For orange chiffon, omit vanilla and lemon zest, and
add 3 tablespoons grated orange zest. Substitute orange juice for
the water.
</P>
<P>
   For chocolate chip chiffon, increase sugar to 1 3/4 cups, and
omit lemon zest. Just before pouring batter into pan, fold in 3
ounces semi-sweet chocolate, grated.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes make 1 10-inch tube pan cake.
</P>
<P>
   During their 1927 honeymoon in Rome, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary
Pickford dined on this fettucine dish at Alfredo's restaurant. It
came to be known as Fettucine Alfredo. The recipe from Alfredo's is
simple _ no cream, no mushrooms, nothing fancy. Just pure
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   FETTUCCINE ALFREDO _ THE ORIGINAL
</P>
<P>
   1pound fresh fettuccine noodles
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup unsalted butter at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (use Parmigiano-Reggiano
for authentic results)
</P>
<P>
   black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Cook fettuccine noodles until al dente _ just tender, but with
chewiness. Fresh noodles take only about 2 minutes. Dried noodles,
inferior, need more time.
</P>
<P>
   Dice butter into heated large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly drain pasta, turn into the bowl with butter, and add
Parmesan, tossing well. Add several twists of the peppermill; serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings.

 &HT;    Pie tips in a nutshell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is an electric mixer required to make a pecan pie?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, in fact, it's better not to use one. Overbeating the eggs
results in a foamy filling. During baking, the foam will rise to
the
</P>
<P>
   top, coating the nuts with an atypical sugary crust.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does light or dark corn syrup make a better pecan pie?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't matter. The syrups can be used interchangeably. If
you prefer a light-colored pie, use light corn syrup and granulated
</P>
<P>
   sugar. Brown sugar can be used in pumpkin pies but may cause
slight weeping. Pecan pies made with dark brown sugar and dark corn
syrup will be dark-colored, have a molasses flavor, a slightly
curdled look and some weeping.
</P>
<P>
   But they taste great.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many pecans should you use in a pecan pie?
</P>
<P>
   A: For a 9-inch pie, any amount from one to two cups can be used
without altering the other ingredients. And it doesn't matter if
</P>
<P>
   the pecans are chopped or halved.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many eggs are needed for a pecan pie?
</P>
<P>
   A: The basic formula is three eggs for a 9-inch pie. Four eggs
will produce a slightly firmer pie. Five eggs is too many; the
filling
</P>
<P>
   tends to curdle.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can you tell when pecan pie is done?
</P>
<P>
   A: Insert a knife halfway between the center and the edge of the
pie. The blade should be clean when removed. If there is cloudy
filling on the knife, bake longer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you keep pie crust from getting soggy?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are baking your pie in a metal or foil pie pan, place
the pie on a preheated heavy-duty cookie sheet for the entire
baking time. This procedure is not necessary with glass pie dishes,
which conduct heat evenly.

 &HT;    Alternatives for holiday meal: A tale of two turkeys
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Two of the most popular ways to cook a
Thanksgiving turkey are brining _ which produces a super-moist bird
_ and deep-frying, which gives diners a chance at a crispy skin.
</P>
<P>
   Both methods are unusual and require special equipment and
storage space. We have tried both methods, and they are successful
if you follow the directions.
</P>
<P>
   Brining may be easier for most cooks, though finding a fresh,
not frozen, turkey may be difficult. Order now from butchers to
ensure a fresh bird. Plan for refrigerator space or a deep cooler
that will hold the trash can and the bird. It must be kept cool.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-frying requires outdoor space and a propane cooking setup,
and should be done carefully.
</P>
<P>
   But for alternatives to the roasted bird, these turkeys are the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   BRINED TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe for the brine can be increased as needed to
cover the turkey. To figure how much brine is needed, place turkey
in container to be used (a new trash can works well) and measure
how much water you will need to cover turkey completely. You must
have a lot of space in your refrigerator, because the turkey needs
to soak there overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Total time required: Overnight for brining; plus normal roasting
time
</P>
<P>
   Equipment:
</P>
<P>
   6-gallon stockpot or new, clean plastic wastebasket to hold
15-20 pound bird
</P>
<P>
   Large liquid measurer (clean milk jug is good)
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerator shelf to hold stockpot and turkey
</P>
<P>
   For turkey and brine:
</P>
<P>
   115- to 20-pound fresh turkey
</P>
<P>
   2cups kosher salt or 1 cup plain (noniodized) table salt
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons dried sage
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon dried marjoram
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon celery seeds
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   Seasoning vegetables for stuffing:
</P>
<P>
   1medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1medium carrot, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1medium celery rib, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons ( 3/4 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   About 1 1/2 quarts homemade turkey stock (made with giblets from
turkey) or canned chicken stock, plus more as needed for gravy as
desired
</P>
<P>
   The night before roasting, rinse turkey inside and out with cold
water. Remove neck and giblets from cavity and use for turkey
stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a very large stockpot, mix 2 gallons cold water with salt,
rosemary, thyme, sage, marjoram, celery seeds and peppercorns,
stirring until salt dissolves. Note: Brine mixture can be increased
proportionately as needed to cover the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Place cleaned turkey in pot. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to
325(degrees).
</P>
<P>
   In small bowl, mix onion, carrot and celery.
</P>
<P>
   Remove turkey from brine and rinse well, inside and out, under
cold running water. Pat skin and cavity dry with paper towels. Turn
turkey on its breast. Loosely fill neck cavity with onion mixture.
Using a thin wooden or metal skewer, pin neck skin to the back.
Fold the turkey's wings akimbo behind the back or tie to the body
with twine. Loosely fill the large body cavity with the remaining
onion mixture. Place the drumsticks in the wire lock or tie
together with kitchen string.
</P>
<P>
   Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack in roasting pan. Rub
well with butter. Tightly cover breast area with foil. Pour 2 cups
of turkey stock into bottom of pan. Throughout cooking, add stock
as needed as it evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Roast turkey, basting all over every 30 minutes with juices from
pan bottom (lift foil to baste breast area). Cook until a meat
thermometer put in meaty part of the thigh (do not touch a bone
with it) reaches 180 _ about 4 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Remove foil during last hour to allow breast to brown;
re-cover with foil if skin becomes too brown.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer turkey to serving platter and let stand for at least 20
minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Use reserved drippings for gravy. Note: Do not add extra salt to
gravy before tasting, as the turkey juices will be salty.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 15 to 20 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Do not stuff this turkey with traditional stuffing; the
extra salt in turkey's juices would ruin the stuffing. Instead,
loosely fill cavities with seasoning vegetables and bake stuffing
in separate pan.
</P>

   The recipe for deep-fried turkey became popular with fans of
Paul Prudhomme, who says it originated in Louisiana's Cajun region.
The seasonings used here are Cajun seasonings; you can vary them to
suit your tastes, however.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is a somewhat dangerous cooking method, a few notes
on safety: Set the pot and burner on a level, firm surface, such as
a patio or walkway with spacious clearance. Children and pets
should be kept well away from the cooking area at all times. Have a
safe place set aside to cool the pot of oil after cooking. Remember
to turn the gas off at the tank after closing off the burner.
</P>
<P>
   DEEP-FRIED TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   Time: Overnight to season; about 2 hours preparation and cooking
</P>
<P>
   Equipment:
</P>
<P>
   Heavy bottomed stockpot (8 gallon)
</P>
<P>
   Propane burner
</P>
<P>
   Deep-fry thermometer, attached to wire so it can be in oil at
all times
</P>
<P>
   Meat injection needle or basting tube with needle attachment
</P>
<P>
   Two thick wire coat hangers or professional meat hook for
lifting turkey in and out of hot oil
</P>
<P>
   Oven mitt
</P>
<P>
   Paper-lined platter for draining turkey
</P>
<P>
   FOR TURKEY:
</P>
<P>
   5gallons peanut or vegetable oil, or enough to cover bird in pot
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons ground red pepper (cayenne is best), optional
</P>
<P>
   12- to 15-pound turkey, cleaned and legs tied
</P>
<P>
   For injection puree:
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup finely chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup finely chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons ground peppers that have been packed in vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon ground cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup turkey or chicken stock, made with giblets
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Mix 2 teaspoons salt and 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper in small
bowl; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Clean turkey, removing the giblets and neck packed in the
cavities. Rinse and pat dry. If the turkey has a ``pop-up''
doneness indicator, remove and discard it.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet over high heat, melt butter until half
melted. Add onions; saute about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add celery, garlic, ground hot peppers, 1 tablespoon plus 1
teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon red pepper and black pepper. Cook until
mixture is a rich golden brown, about 3 minutes, stirring and
scraping pan bottom frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Add stock and Worcestershire; bring to a boil, stirring
constantly. Remove from heat; immediately transfer to a blender.
Blend on highest speed until mixture is very smooth _ it must go
through tip of basting needle.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse and drain turkey well. While puree is still hot, pour it
into the meat injector or basting tube, and inject the puree into
turkey, making holes about 2 inches apart. (Note: Take care not to
pierce through meat to turkey cavity.) To fill the hole formed by
injector needle, as you draw needle out, continue injecting puree.
</P>
<P>
   Pour any remaining puree into cavity of turkey and rub over
inner surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle reserved salt-cayenne mix evenly over bird and inside
the cavity, rubbing in by hand and using all. Close legs and tail
together with metal prong (or fold legs back into skin flaps or tie
legs with kitchen twine). Cover. Refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   To fry turkey: Heat oil in large pot over burner to 400 degrees.
Attach thermometer to edge of pot; it must touch oil at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Remove turkey from refrigerator one hour before frying. Let it
sit on several layers of paper towels to collect any juices. The
bird should be very dry when placed in oil to prevent spattering.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare harness for turkey. Thread a metal hanger through turkey
and twist its ends together securely. Thread second hanger through
loop made by first. Secure ends well. Form a loop on end of second
hanger for handle. Make sure all wire ends bend inward so as not to
snag on pot's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Practice lifting turkey up and down over pan to adjust your
grip. Slowly and carefully lift turkey into oil to prevent
splashing.
</P>
<P>
   (Wear heavy apron, long sleeves and boots in case oil
splatters.)
</P>
<P>
   Turkey should be completely submerged. Check thermometer: It
should be at 350 degrees and remain so during cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   Cook 35-45 minutes at a steady 350 degrees (roughly 3 minutes
per pound). If turkey bobs, and does not remain submerged, use
long-handled grill fork to push turkey down or turn slightly so all
of turkey is cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Remove turkey by carefully lifting out of pot. Have pan lined
with paper ready on sturdy table nearby. Place turkey _ breast side
down _ on pan and allow to sit for 20 minutes to drain before
removing leg holdings and carving.
</P>
<P>
   Cool oil in safe place away from foot traffic, children and
pets.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This turkey is best when still warm.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 main dish servings.
</P>
<P>
   (Recipe adapted from ``The Prudhomme Family Cookbook'' by the
Paul Prudhomme family, Morrow, 1987.)
</P>
<P>
   To vary the flavor of the smoking, use herb bunches (rosemary,
thyme) placed directly over the chips, and use an aromatic liquid
such as apple cider or bourbon, to soak chips. Note: This can be
done in an outdoor smoker; use the recipe book that came with it
for instructions on using your smoker.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKED TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   Time required: One hour preparation; about 2 1/2 hours cooking
time
</P>
<P>
   Equipment:
</P>
<P>
   2 large disposable foil turkey-roasting pans
</P>
<P>
   1 cake or cookie rack or any rack that fits inside roasting pan
</P>
<P>
   3 to 5 pounds wood chips for smoking (apple chips recommended )
</P>
<P>
   Liquid for soaking chips
</P>
<P>
   For the turkey:
</P>
<P>
   112- to 18-pound turkey, cleaned
</P>
<P>
   2onions, peeled, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2oranges, peel on, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2apples, peel on, quartered
</P>
<P>
   For rub:
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons crushed thyme
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons crushed sage
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Mix rub ingredients; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse and clean turkey, removing giblets for gravy. (Note: pan
drippings from smoked turkey are too bitter to use in gravy, so
plan to have extra stock on hand.) Stuff cavity with quartered
onions, oranges and apples.
</P>
<P>
   Rub turkey with seasonings; put leftover rub inside cavity and
rub cavity well. Let turkey sit with rub for about hour on rack
before smoking. Meanwhile, soak chips in desired liquid 30 minutes
before using.
</P>
<P>
   Place one turkey roasting pan over two burners. Put soaked chips
in bottom of pan. Cover with second roasting pan, and turn burner
to medium high until chips begin to smoke. (Make sure stove
ventilation fan is on.)
</P>
<P>
   Once chips are smoking, place turkey on rack, over chips. Cover
with second pan and turn heat to medium low. Check every 20 minutes
to see if chips need to be replaced; add more as needed to keep
smoke steady.
</P>
<P>
   Cook under cover 1 1/2 hours, over medium-low heat. Remove
turkey from smoker and place into pan that was used as cover.
</P>
<P>
   Finish roasting in the oven at 350 degrees. until done,
approximately 1 hour for a 12-pound bird; longer for a bigger bird.
Rely on a meat thermometer placed in meatiest part of thigh reading
175. (Note: A pop-up doneness indicator will work for this turkey.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove; allow turkey to stand on platter for 20 minutes before
carving. A pink tinge may be present; this is from the smoke and
does not indicate raw meat.
</P>
<P>

Village of Golf.)

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ GIVERNY, France _ I came to see Claude

<P>
   When buying Brussels sprouts, remember that freshest is best.
They shouldn't be stored more than two or three days. And smaller
Brussels sprouts are milder in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid sprouts misted by one of those supermarket produce jets.
The sprouts need to be dry before being stored in the refrigerator.

 &HT;    Bid adieu to '99; bonjour to nouveau vintage reds
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all this millennium hoopla, you'd think some savvy wine
marketer would have come up with a way to slap ``Vintage 2000'' on
the label of their new bottling.
</P>
<P>
   Without a time machine, though, that's not quite feasible. Even
with today's technology, it still takes time to pick the grapes,
crush 'em, ferment the juice and bottle it.
</P>
<P>
   Not much time, mind you. That's why you'll have no problem
saying goodbye to 1999 with a glass of 1999 vintage wine in your
hand _ if you're so inclined. And if you want to get a head start,
stop by your local wine shop Thursday and check out the
viticultural equivalent of the new-model-year automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   It's that time again, to stain our teeth with the ruby-purple
juice we call Beaujolais Nouveau and with their lip-smackin'
cousins from other wine regions.
</P>
<P>
   Beaujolais Nouveau began as a phenomenon in the bars and bistros
of Beaujolais and Lyons in France. Every year, shortly after
harvest, eager locals would line up in cafes to fill their empty
pitchers from the winemakers' barrels, and a good time was had by
all. Presumably.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Paris got into the act, and the French government stepped
in to decree that Nouveau Day would occur each year on the third
Thursday of November. Wherever the Nouveau Beaujolais went,
importers had to agree not to sell the fermented grape juice before
that date (though nouveau wines from other regions faced no such
restriction).
</P>
<P>
   Georges Duboeuf, the Beaujolais region's top producer, has
proclaimed this year's nouveau celebrations ``the perfect way to
kick off millennium-end merriment.'' Duboeuf says exceptional
weather has produced an excellent vintage of nouveau, and while
it's hard to remember when wine producers called a press conference
to announce a lousy vintage, the descriptions of this year's wine
does tantalize.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Duboeuf's take on his '99: ``Beautiful deep crimson
tinged with purple. Held to the nose, it exhales scents of kirsch
amidst a red-fruit bouquet blending ripe strawberries, morello
cherries and blackcurrant with accents of cocoa, blueberry, rose
and violet. This wine offers more to savor than in previous years
and is harmonious, pleasing and captivating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. That's a mouthful of wine for $9.69 a bottle. The
millennium awaits.
</P>

 &HT;    For Use Sat., Nov. 20 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KASHGAR, China _ This exotic Silk Road city doesn't look, smell
or sound like China.
</P>
<P>
   Mosques jut elegant minarets above the low skyline, calling
faithful to prayer in a Turkic-based tongue. Succulent,
cumin-scented lamb chunks broil on sidewalk grills. And wall clocks
in restaurants and shops brazenly herald the hour _ two hours off
official time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's best efforts to tame this wild western region
of the world's last communist empire, resentment still simmers
against Chinese rule here. At times, it heats into explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang ranks with Tibet and Taiwan as China's most worrisome
political flashpoints. Today, Beijing suffers even greater angst
after watching ethnic rebellions spread elsewhere in the world _
Chechnya, East Timor and most of all Kosovo, where NATO intervened
on behalf of ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility is most widely and quietly marked here on the clocks
and watches of ethnic Uighurs (pronounced ``WEE-gurs''), the
Muslim, Turkic-speaking descendants of the Huns. They live two
hours behind Beijing time, following the rhythm of the sun instead
of the central government's mandate that all China observe the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the only safe protest allowed in this region 1,800
miles west of Beijing that has convulsed periodically in riots,
bombings and killings staged by Uighur activists. They are fighting
for independence and full religious freedom in this land of
mountains and desert that comprises one-sixth of all China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had the struggle against separatist activity
throughout our history. It has never ceased,'' acknowledged Ablait
Abdureschit, governor of the Xinjiang (pronounced ``SHIN-jyan'')
Uighur Autonomous Region, and himself a Uighur who is loyal to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never allow splittists to separate Xinjiang from our
motherland,'' Abdureschit said in a recent interview in the modern
regional capital Urumqi, echoing the determined declarations of
officials from the bottom of the bureaucracy to the top guns in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's two-pronged approach to subduing Xinjiang focuses on
economic development, which is aimed at eliminating dissatisfaction
with Chinese rule, and on strong-arm security aimed at eliminating
those who express discontent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Shi Shaolin, a Han Chinese and deputy commissioner of Kashgar
prefect, is proud of the changes Chinese have brought to this city
of 350,000 and to the still backward countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``After liberation the central government invested lots of money
in this district,'' he said, referring to the 1949 founding of
China's communist regime. ``We paved roads connecting every
township and brought electricity into every town.''
</P>
<P>
   New China also brought millions of Chinese, who both helped
develop the region and diluted the ethnic mix. In 1949, the
non-Chinese population was 93 percent, mostly Uighur, and Chinese
were about 7 percent. By 1997, the more than 17 million population
was 47 percent Uighurs, 42 percent ethnic Chinese, and 11 percent
Kazak and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Chinese got the best jobs in government and industry,
and now with their experience elsewhere are making inroads in
commerce, or so the Uighurs complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Uighur people have little chance to learn new things,
like computers. Uighurs just work in trade. Or they are farmers,''
said one Uigher who did not want his name published for fear of
arrest. He said computers are limited to high government offices,
which rarely are staffed by Uighurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change very slowly here for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively high-paying oil industry is one example. The
major oil fields of China National Oil Company employ some 4,000
people, but only about 300 of them are Uighurs, according to vice
president Jia Chengzao.
</P>
<P>
   Irritation is palpable among Uighurs who refuse to go into
Chinese restaurants or snigger in Uighur about Chinese officials
who don't understand the language.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders proclaim they respect the local culture
and traditions, they sometimes show little understanding of either.
</P>
<P>
   Two female government officials, both Han Chinese who grew up in
Xinjiang, laughed at a foreign female guest who hurried to buy a
scarf at the bazaar before walking into a mosque. The Chinese went
bareheaded into the cavernous prayer room to meet with the chief
imam.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries they would not be permitted to enter a mosque
bareheaded, but here no one objected. One Uighur Muslim quietly
thanked the foreign visitor for respecting Islam by wearing a
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs know that protesting can cost them dearly. Simply
speaking to a foreign visitor without authorization has sent some
Uighurs to jail.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the second tactic of Beijing's strategy here.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said
it documented 190 executions in Xinjiang from January 1997, through
last March, or an average of one execution every 4.3 days.
Thousands more have been detained, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The last large-scale protests erupted in 1997, resulting in mass
arrests and as many as 100 deaths. But security forces have kept
occupied with smaller agitations, such as the six Uighur gunrunners
executed in mid-September, and with preventing big ones.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, Xinjiang's public security defused an
anti-government ``political rebellion'' planned to coincide with
China's Oct. 1 national day in Khotan, a center of unrest in south
Xinjiang, according to Abdul Aziza, director of Kashgar's
administration of religion and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year before Oct. 1 we have a meeting to keep alert for
this kind of riot,'' said Aziza, blaming the separatist activities
on an ``East Turkistan group'' related to an ``Islamic party'' that
he said has branches in every county.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   East Turkistan is the name around which independence-minded
Uighurs rally. Two short-lived Republics of East Turkistan were
proclaimed to exist here in Kashgar in 1933 and in Ili in the north
in 1944, but both fell quickly to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   While the practice of Islam is permitted, it is strictly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence is obvious in the working mosques dotting the
countryside, and the mostly older women who cover their heads and
sometimes faces with brown, burlap-like cloths.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of religious suppression during China's Cultural
Revolution the central government in 1977 started rebuilding
destroyed mosques and allowed Islam to re-emerge. But freedoms were
constricted again in the late 1980s, by Chinese leaders apparently
fearing unmanageable growth and radical influences from neighboring
Islamic countries of Central
</P>
<P>
   Asia that split off from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic imams, or leaders, deemed insufficiently patriotic were
purged, mosque construction halted and schools teaching the Koran,
the Muslim bible, were either outlawed or tightly monitored. At
Kashgar's central Id Kah Mosque, for example, a line of rooms once
used to give Koranic instruction now sit dark and empty.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, China looks solidly in control here.
</P>
<P>
   The Uighurs are not so lucky as the Tibetans, who have their
Dalai Lama to center their cause and celebrities like actor Richard
Gere to publicize it in the West. Exiled Uighur activists have 50
Internet Web sites, but the Uighurs are neither united under a
single leader nor do they enjoy the support of any famous Western
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Uighurs have made their peace with China, gladly accepting
the railroads and water systems and any new jobs offered.
</P>
<P>
   However, should China suffer the same kind of economic downturn
that led to the Soviet collapse, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think China is in danger of falling apart. So in that
sense China has over-reacted (to the separatists),'' said Dru
Gladney, a China-watcher at Honolulu's Asia-Pacific center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if China should run into (economic) trouble,'' he said,
``there would be these ethnic fault lines.''

   KASHGAR, China _ This exotic Silk Road city doesn't look, smell
or sound like China.
</P>
<P>
   Mosques jut elegant minarets above the low skyline, calling
faithful to prayer in a Turkic-based tongue. Succulent,
cumin-scented lamb chunks broil on sidewalk grills. And wall clocks
in restaurants and shops brazenly herald the hour _ two hours off
official time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's best efforts to tame this wild western region
of the world's last communist empire, resentment still simmers
against Chinese rule here. At times, it heats into explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang ranks with Tibet and Taiwan as China's most worrisome
political flashpoints. Today, Beijing suffers even greater angst
after watching ethnic rebellions spread elsewhere in the world _
Chechnya, East Timor and most of all Kosovo, where NATO intervened
on behalf of ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility is most widely and quietly marked here on the clocks
and watches of ethnic Uighurs (pronounced ``WEE-gurs''), the
Muslim, Turkic-speaking descendants of the Huns. They live two
hours behind Beijing time, following the rhythm of the sun instead
of the central government's mandate that all China observe the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the only safe protest allowed in this region 1,800
miles west of Beijing that has convulsed periodically in riots,
bombings and killings staged by Uighur activists. They are fighting
for independence and full religious freedom in this land of
mountains and desert that comprises one-sixth of all China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had the struggle against separatist activity
throughout our history. It has never ceased,'' acknowledged Ablait
Abdureschit, governor of the Xinjiang (pronounced ``SHIN-jyan'')
Uighur Autonomous Region, and himself a Uighur who is loyal to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never allow splittists to separate Xinjiang from our
motherland,'' Abdureschit said in a recent interview in the modern
regional capital Urumqi, echoing the determined declarations of
officials from the bottom of the bureaucracy to the top guns in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's two-pronged approach to subduing Xinjiang focuses on
economic development, which is aimed at eliminating dissatisfaction
with Chinese rule, and on strong-arm security aimed at eliminating
those who express discontent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Shi Shaolin, a Han Chinese and deputy commissioner of Kashgar
prefect, is proud of the changes Chinese have brought to this city
of 350,000 and to the still backward countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``After liberation the central government invested lots of money
in this district,'' he said, referring to the 1949 founding of
China's communist regime. ``We paved roads connecting every
township and brought electricity into every town.''
</P>
<P>
   New China also brought millions of Chinese, who both helped
develop the region and diluted the ethnic mix. In 1949, the
non-Chinese population was 93 percent, mostly Uighur, and Chinese
were about 7 percent. By 1997, the more than 17 million population

 &HT;    CHINA'S GREAT TAKLIMAKAN DESERT RESISTS WORLD OIL HUNTERS
 &HT;    With Photos.

<P>
   LUNNAN OIL BASE, China _ The fearsome Taklimakan Desert, one of
the earth's last great natural barriers to human penetration, is
grudgingly yielding up some of its liquid treasure.
</P>
<P>
   But not without a desperate fight.
</P>
<P>
   With its dreaded sandstorms called ``black hurricanes'' and its
almost indecipherable underground rock formations, the mighty
Taklimakan has managed to frustrate some of the world's smartest,
most tenacious oil hunters for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Known to centuries of camel travelers as ``the sea of death,''
the Taklimakan looks like a set for ``Lawrence of Arabia'' with its
endless undulating dunes of golden powder-fine sand.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that China, the world's most overcrowded
country, could include an egg-shaped ``empty quarter'' 600 miles
wide that is reminiscent of the most desolate deserts of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan ranks as the most inaccessible part of the world,
lying further from the sea than any other point on the globe. It is
protected on three sides by walls of mountains leading to Siberia,
Afghanistan and Tibet, and on the fourth side by China's Gobi
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago China's national oil company hit a gusher smack
in the middle of the Taklimakan. An international rush for oil was
on, centered in the desert a few hundred miles north of the ancient
Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   That first discovery shaft sunk by China National Petroleum
Company tapped into a world-class oil deposit said to be 70 miles
long. Within months Western oil companies plunged in to lease
quadrants of the desert fringes put up for wildcatting by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinese and Western drillers were gambling that this
austerely beautiful terrain would yield a string of super-giant oil
fields and turn China's western frontier into another Caspian Sea
bonanza. But it hasn't happened, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of bidding British Petroleum (now BP/Amoco),
Exxon and Agip paid the Chinese a total of $500 million in 1993 for
the right to explore and share in any commercial-sized oil finds.
The deal was that the Western companies would pay for the
exploration and keep a 49-percent share of profits if oil was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Chinese geologists told the World Petroleum
Congress that the Taklimakan and the surrounding wasteland of the
so-called Tarim Basin had potential reserves of 88 million barrels.
Thus, this nearly uninhabited desert about half the size of Texas
was said to be perched on top of four times the proven oil reserves
of the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before a spread in the National Geographic
magazine told of ``an enormous underground pool of oil'' beneath
the Taklimakan. Western companies bought up more drilling blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some geologists still think there could be numerous super-giant
``elephant'' oil fields lurking somewhere beneath these shifting
sands. But so far they've only found a few baby elephants, not
nearly enough to justify the ambitious Chinese oil estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Through enormous expense and almost inhuman endurance by 4,000
Chinese oil workers, China's national oil company is managing to
squeeze 75,000 barrels a day of oil from the desert and its
northern fringe.
</P>
<P>
   From March to June of each year, wind currents slash down from
Siberia and collide with northbound airflows from the Tibetan
plateau. The result is killer sandstorms in which the sky blackens
and the air fills with sand and gravel that hits like bird-shot.
That's why Taklimakan in local dialect means ``go in and don't come
back out.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer isn't much more pleasant. The sun bakes the desert
floor until the temperature reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In the
winter, the wind blows and the desert chills to 20 degrees below
zero.
</P>
<P>
   One of every four barrels produced in the Tarim Basin comes out
of the ground here at the Lunnan Oil Base, a cluster of buildings
and oil processing apparatus huddled on hardscrabble wasteland 70
miles north of Taklimakan's first ridge of flowing sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the difficulties of working in the Tarim Basin, the
Chinese are finding increasing volumes of brackish water flowing up
the well casing along with the oil in Lunnan. And even though
Lunnan's 67 wells have been producing for only a decade or less,
the Chinese are being forced to install some big mechanical
rocker-arm pumps to bring up crude that used to flow up freely
under natural pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarim Basin now ranks as China's seventh-largest oil field,
far less than its original promise.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the oil, Chinese drillers have found impressive
supplies of natural gas, which may be piped to eastern China and
help replace dirty coal as the main heating source in Shanghai and
other heavily polluted cities. Tarim's proven natural gas reserves
are estimated at 200 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning we hoped we could discover a huge oil reserve
here,'' acknowledged Jia Chengzao, deputy chief of China's Tarim
oil and gas prospecting zone. ``But from our experience, we have
found more gas than oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese have had some successes on their own
exploration blocks, nothing the Western drillers have tried here
has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the suspected oil layers lie up to 20,000 feet below the
dunes, drillers are forced to use new and expensive wildcatting
tricks, including three-dimensional seismic modeling, digital
simulation and high-pressure jetting for super-deep drilling. And
the high-tech hasn't been working.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, which has been hunting for oil in the Taklimakan since
1993, is the only Western company still drilling. Unless Exxon's
fortunes get better, it may pull out before long.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon spokesman in Dallas said the oil company was not
currently drilling in the Tarim Basin, but Jia confirmed that Exxon
is now drilling a wildcat well on one of its New Jersey-sized
lease-holdings on the northwestern edge of the desert and should
learn within two months if it is a winner. Jia said Exxon already
abandoned another similar-sized block after another wildcat well
found no commercial-sized oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon spokesman did not return follow-up phone calls from
Cox Newspapers inquiring about the exploratory well of which Jia
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum, which won one of the first lease blocks in
1993, has already dropped out after finding nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Agip, which hold the rights to explore a territory
bigger than Wisconsin, have drilled two dry holes and have told the
Chinese they have no plans for further exploration, according to
Jia. The Agip-Texaco leases are due to expire at the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan hasn't been tamed so far. Maybe it never will be.

</P>
<P>
   Some geologists still think there could be numerous super-giant
``elephant'' oil fields lurking somewhere beneath these shifting
sands. But so far they've only found a few baby elephants, not
nearly enough to justify the ambitious Chinese oil estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Through enormous expense and almost inhuman endurance by 4,000
Chinese oil workers, China's national oil company is managing to
squeeze 75,000 barrels a day of oil from the desert and its
northern fringe.
</P>
<P>
   From March to June of each year, wind currents slash down from
Siberia and collide with northbound airflows from the Tibetan
plateau. The result is killer sandstorms in which the sky blackens
and the air fills with sand and gravel that hits like bird-shot.
That's why Taklimakan in local dialect means ``go in and don't come
back out.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer isn't much more pleasant. The sun bakes the desert
floor until the temperature reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In the
winter, the wind blows and the desert chills to 20 degrees below
zero.
</P>
<P>
   One of every four barrels produced in the Tarim Basin comes out
of the ground here at the Lunnan Oil Base, a cluster of buildings
and oil processing apparatus huddled on hardscrabble wasteland 70
miles north of Taklimakan's first ridge of flowing sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the difficulties of working in the Tarim Basin, the
Chinese are finding increasing volumes of brackish water flowing up
the well casing along with the oil in Lunnan. And even though
Lunnan's 67 wells have been producing for only a decade or less,
the Chinese are being forced to install some big mechanical
rocker-arm pumps to bring up crude that used to flow up freely
under natural pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarim Basin now ranks as China's seventh-largest oil field,
far less than its original promise.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the oil, Chinese drillers have found impressive
supplies of natural gas, which may be piped to eastern China and
help replace dirty coal as the main heating source in Shanghai and
other heavily polluted cities. Tarim's proven natural gas reserves
are estimated at 200 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning we hoped we could discover a huge oil reserve
here,'' acknowledged Jia Chengzao, deputy chief of China's Tarim
oil and gas prospecting zone. ``But from our experience, we have
found more gas than oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese have had some successes on their own
exploration blocks, nothing the Western drillers have tried here
has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the suspected oil layers lie up to 20,000 feet below the
dunes, drillers are forced to use new and expensive wildcatting
tricks, including three-dimensional seismic modeling, digital
simulation and high-pressure jetting for super-deep drilling. And
the high-tech hasn't been working.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, which has been hunting for oil in the Taklimakan since
1993, is the only Western company still drilling. Unless Exxon's
fortunes get better, it may pull out before long.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon spokesman in Dallas said the oil company was not
currently drilling in the Tarim Basin, but Jia confirmed that Exxon
is now drilling a wildcat well on one of its New Jersey-sized
lease-holdings on the northwestern edge of the desert and should
learn within two months if it is a winner. Jia said Exxon already
abandoned another similar-sized block after another wildcat well
found no commercial-sized oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon spokesman did not return follow-up phone calls from
Cox Newspapers inquiring about the exploratory well of which Jia
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum, which won one of the first lease blocks in
1993, has already dropped out after finding nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Agip, which hold the rights to explore a territory
bigger than Wisconsin, have drilled two dry holes and have told the
Chinese they have no plans for further exploration, according to
Jia. The Agip-Texaco leases are due to expire at the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan hasn't been tamed so far. Maybe it never will be.
</P>

IF YOU DON'T GET CASH, YOU WON'T PAY FEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's shocking news: A federal judge in California predicted
the other day that those new laws prohibiting banks from charging
fees for using their ATMs will turn out to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Who woulda guessed?
</P>
<P>
   You know the deal. Voters in San Francisco and the City Council
in Santa Monica recently approved bans on the surcharges that most
banks levy on ATM withdrawals when the person taking the cash
doesn't have an account at the bank that provides the machine. The
judge made his prediction at a hearing in which he granted a
preliminary injunction that allows banks to continue charging ATM
fees while they challenge the new laws in court.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press report on the hearing said that the judge
ordered the banks to put the fees in escrow _ in case the laws hold
up and the money has to be returned to ATM users.
</P>
<P>
   A word to the wise: The ATM users might not want to hold their
breath.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a judge, a lawyer or a constitutional
scholar to see that municipal government shouldn't be butting into
private enterprise just because some consumers are feeling put
upon. Banks have a right to charge fees for the services they
provide; consumers have a right to avoid the fees by declining to
use the services.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that simple, as Ross Perot likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. I get annoyed when I'm trying to score some
cash out of an ATM and the dreaded message appears on the screen:
``So-and-So Bank charges a fee of $1.25 (or $1.50 or $2 or $2.50)
for the use of this machine.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't end there, sad to say. Not only do you have to
pay the bank that's churning out the money _ your own bank slaps
you with an additional fee as a penalty for using the other bank's
machine.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? Right after the ATM tells you how much it will
cost you to make a withdrawal, it sends you another message _ the
escape clause. You can push a button, get your ATM card back and
presto _ you're fee-free.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't get the money you wanted. But that's a
choice that is imposed on us each and every day in our free
enterprise system: Are we willing to pay the going rate for a
product or service, or would we prefer to do without?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, folks, but I can't jump aboard the indignation bandwagon
on this issue. It would be one thing if the fees were imposed
without giving the customer the option of terminating the
transaction _ although you'd have to figure that any customer with
half a brain would catch on after getting hit with a fee once or
twice.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, there's no deception of any kind. The banks
couldn't be any more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it: When it comes to economic injustice, these
ATM fees are about as penny ante as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the wailing and gnashing?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as we approach a new millennium, we just like to hear
ourselves wail and gnash. Maybe we feel so powerless in this age of
high-tech wonderment that we simply can't resist the urge to rise
up in protest over the slightest affront.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem in this case, as there is in so many
situations where consumers stage a revolt against some minor
inequity. In the end, they'll be worse off than they were before
the revolt.
</P>
<P>
   When San Francisco and Santa Monica decided to ban the ATM fees,
Wells Fargo and Bank of America decided to reprogram their machines
to reject cards other than their own. The message was clear: If you
don't want to pay for the convenience, then the convenience won't
be available.
</P>
<P>
   If the anti-fee movement should hold up in court and become a
nationwide phenomenon, rest assured that the banks will retaliate.
If we set out to punish the banks, we shouldn't be surprised if the
banks set out to punish us.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll suddenly be paying a fee to use our own bank's ATM.
Maybe those ubiquitous cash machines that we've become so dependent
upon will suddenly be harder to find than a parking space downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll end up wishing that we had shut up and paid the
fees.
</P>

   &UR; The US government is among the world's worst polluters. Federal

country. The cost of cleaning up the worst sites is officially
expected to approach $300 billion. And wherever US bases have been
located around the world, similar problems have occurred. In a

CELTICS TO FACE REVVED-UP CAVALIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They still are not packing them in at Gund Arena. Blame
it on Fratello Hangover. The Cleveland Cavaliers are nothing like
their namesakes from the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   These guys run. They pass. They score. They're worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   They've averaged nearly 106 points a game over the last four
games. Oh yes, they're also 4-2. They can score inside and out and
they still defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're quick in transition and they hold opponents to 41
percent shooting,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said Tuesday. ``They
are like Miami in that they have changed their style.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right. They don't plod. They don't squeeze the innards
out of the 24-second clock. New coach Randy Wittman not only has
his team playing at a much faster clip, he's also apparently
resuscitated Bobby Sura and Brevin Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve NBA teams are averaging 100 points a game or more. The
Cavs are one of them, even after scoring a Fratelloish 84 in a
season-opening loss to the Knicks. (They avenged that four days
later in Cleveland.) Only five teams are holding opponents under 42
percent shooting. The Cavs, despite the absence of big center
Zydrunas Ilgauskas, are one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've adjusted to the (new) rules,'' Pitino said. ``They
have three guards who can push it. They have a lot of weapons and
are very difficult to guard. They have great shooters who can hurt
you and they're getting a lot of easy baskets in transition.''
</P>
<P>
   When hoop historians start chronicling the Pitino Years in
Boston, they'll notice an early, heavy Cleveland effect. One of the
Ricktator's first free agent signings was ex-Cav Chris Mills, who
lasted less than a 24-second violation in Boston. There also was
the Boston meltdown in Gund Arena last year (113-86), which
prompted Pitino to say that he'd change his lineup (he didn't) and
that the Globetrotters played better defense (they did).
</P>
<P>
   Then there was last year's trade that sent backup center Andrew
DeClercq &UR;  &LR; to the Cavs for backup center Vitaly Potapenko and
Boston's first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino still likes the trade because he feels Potapenko is an
upgrade at the position. Entering Wednesday's game, both lads are
starting, DeClercq because of the foot injury to Ilgauskas,
Potapenko by default. DeClercq is averaging 11.2 points, 7
rebounds, and 1.17 blocks in 27.5 minutes. Potapenko is averaging
7.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 0.86 blocks in 26.9 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs selected heady Utah point guard Andre Miller with
Boston's pick, which turned out to be eighth overall. Miller is
averaging 8.8 points and 5 assists in only 19.2 minutes. He came in
for Knight against the Bucks last Saturday and had 13 points, 5
rebounds, 4 assists, and a steal in 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's premature (or post-mature?) to say what the Celtics would
have done with the pick. They didn't interview anyone or bring in
anyone for a workout, but Miller is a possibility. So is Shawn
Marion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs look at the Potapenko-DeClercq deal and see that they
swapped backup centers, got out of having to re-sign Potapenko
while having DeClercq locked in for three years at reasonable
numbers, and got a No. 1 pick on top of it all. The Celtics look at
the deal and see an improvement in the position and a rookie named
Adrian Griffin who's cheaper, and, for now, better than a lot of
players taken in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a trade that helped both teams. The Cavs are
happy. The Celtics are happy. Potapenko says playing against the
Cavs is ``no big deal'' because it happened twice after the trade
and he's used to his new digs. The game starts a rough stretch for
the Celtics. They host the Nets Friday, then have four
back-breakers with Miami (away) and the Pacers, Spurs, and Bucks
all at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce has made a dramatic recovery from what was termed a
strep throat Monday. ``It was a little sore throat,'' Pierce said
Tuesday after going through practice without incident. ``I really
felt bad but I got a lot of rest and I'm feeling much better. I got
through practice fine and didn't feel any weakness. I'll be ready
to go.'' That, of course, was just what Pitino wanted to hear.
``The wonders of penicillin,'' the coach said. ``It makes me feel
very good. I was beginning to feel very bad.'' . . . The Cavs could
have Lamond Murray on hand Wednesday. He has been out all season
with a sprained knee ligament . . . Calbert Cheaney (ankle) will
miss his fourth straight game with a sprained right ankle, but
Pitino is hoping Cheaney can play Friday against the Nets . . .
Pervis Ellison, meanwhile, is getting in better shape and,
according to Pitino, could start seeing some action. Ellison has
not played in the last three games . . . Pitino said he may use
Dana Barros and Doug Overton together in certain situations. One of
those would be Wednesday night, where Barros could defend the
smaller Knight and Overton, while still playing the point, could
defend the taller shooting guard . . . Pitino keeps preaching pass
before shoot, but after one drill Tuesday of many, many passes and
no shots, he said, ``That's great if you have a 45-second clock.''

US PRESENCE ON FOREIGN SOIL TAINTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a US military presence in more than 140 countries, the
question of how Washington should deal with complaints of overseas
environmental contamination is emerging as a prickly financial and
diplomatic issue.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Department of Defense inspector general warned that
contamination of foreign soil by the military is an issue that will
have to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``DOD presence in other countries has resulted in environmental
damage that will require eventual cleanup and disposal, and the
cleanup costs will be substantial,'' the report cautioned.
``Potentially significant liabilities may exist in Japan, South
Korea, the Philippines, Turkey, Great Britain, Spain, Canada, and
other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, representatives from a dozen countries met in
Washington to discuss base cleanups and lobbied members of Congress
to help remove hazardous waste from overseas facilities. ``It is an
important moral issue and public health issue and environmental
issue,'' said John Lindsay-Poland, an American activist who has
studied base contamination in Panama and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a look at some of the countries allegedly
contaminated by the United States:
</P>
<P>
   --The DOD inspector general this year said cleanup costs are
expected to total at least $1 billion. Germany is among the
countries with the most rigorous environmental laws and toughest
enforcement standards. It is also host to one of the largest
contingents of American forces overseas, with 69,663 active duty
personnel stationed there. Not surprisingly, Germany also receives
the bulk of the $165 million a year the Pentagon spends on overseas
environmental compliance and cleanup. Last year, the military
reported projects to clean up landfills, remove PCBs, repair sewage
treatment plants, and remediate contaminated soil.
</P>
<P>
   --A Japanese environmental group _ NEPA Coalition of Japan _ has
documented severe environmental contamination at the Yokosuka US
Naval base.The group says a September 1998 report found soil
contaminated with lead at 150 times the Japanese standard; arsenic
at 10 times the limit; and mercury at a level 440 times greater
than Japanese standards. Ground water was also tainted by poisons,
including lead at 520 times the national standard.The group also
said it has documented pollution at several other bases, including
the dumping of PCBs into a pond and the systematic dumping of
oil-contaminated water into public sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
   --The US military is currently cleaning up thousands of acres of
jungle firing ranges and testing sites used by soldiers throughout
this century. The work is being done in anticipation of the
transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama next year. The cleanup,
however, has been controversial, with Panamanian government
officials complaining about the thoroughness of the work and a lack
of information provided by the Pentagon. Earlier this year, 25
members of Congress wrote to Defense Secretary William Cohen urging
him to release more records, saying they feared ``the US government
is preparing to walk away from its responsibility to adequately
clean up US military bases and firing ranges in Panama that were
used to test conventional and chemical weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   --When Canadian officials turned to the United States several
years ago for help in cleaning up environmental contamination at
former US military facilities in their country, the Pentagon said
it had ``no legal obligation'' to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike what has happened in many other countries, the
Pentagon later reversed itself and agreed to pay $100 million to
clean up the former US sites in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress last year, Deputy Secretary of Defense
John J. Hamre, said the payments were ``a special case not
duplicated anywhere else in the world,'' and one unlikely to be
repeated because ``there is no other country with the same
combination of geography, historical relationship, and vital
significance to US national security.''

ROOKIE KEVIN FAULK WAS THE LONE PATRIOTS STANDOUT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Having just turned their prime-time network
showcase into ``Monday Night Foolball,'' the Patriots were
receiving their reward as they headed to the locker room: a cold
shower of abuse on a numbing November overnight. And this was from
their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing their local heroes with the personal touch, the
vitriolic gantlet above the runway from the north end zone to home
headquarters at Foxboro Stadium offered a special imprecation for
each participant in the 24-17 loss to the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe (15 for 36, 170 yards, 2 touchdowns, 3
interceptions, 3 sacks) was saluted for his abysmal passing in
bedeviling winds. Terry Allen (14 carries, 36 yards) was hailed as
the fulcrum of a running game that existed only in theory. Coach
Pete Carroll was exalted for going for a touchdown instead of a
sure field goal on fourth and goal from the 1 in the second
quarter, a play on which Allen got jammed back to the 2. The
members of the defense were acknowledged for getting shredded by
Jets quarterback Ray Lucas (18 for 31, 153 yards, 2 TDs, 2
interceptions, 0 sacks), a Patriot practice squad reject; running
back Curtis Martin (31 carries, 149 yards, 36-yard TD), a Patriot
refugee; and coach Bill Parcells, a Patriot until he could duck out
of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Only running back Kevin Faulk was spared.
</P>
<P>
   As Faulk proceeded among the last stragglers, the fans
disengaged their hands from making obscene gestures long enough to
give Faulk a brief burst of applause. He acknowledged it by holding
two fingers monentarily aloft _ a peace offering, obviously, for it
couldn't have been a ``V'' for victory. Then he politely walked
past the outstretched hands _ minus weapons _ extended from above.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the crowd was taking pity on an innocent rookie;
it was, rather, that they appreciated Faulk for providing two of
the too-few highlights on their night out: a 95-yard bolt with a
kickoff return in the second quarter and a nimble 13-yard touchdown
reception in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the locker room, Faulk refused to accept any consolation
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team loses, there's nothing positive that comes out
of it,'' he said. ``No matter what I did on special teams or
whatever, there's nothing positive that comes out of a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but at least the second-round draft pick from LSU
displayed a couple of glimpses of potential.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the Jets taken a 7-0 lead with 8:47 left in the
first half than Faulk fielded a John Hall kickoff 3 yards deep in
his end zone. He raced up the middle through an opening, bounced
off a tackle, and angled to his right in a footrace that he
eventually lost to Jets cornerback Marcus Coleman, who caught him
at the 8-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he'd gotten into the end zone,'' said Carroll, who was
in no mood for kudos in the wake of the debacle, ``because we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this was the infamous series on which the Patriots
bypassed the field goal as three runs by Allen and a Bledsoe pass
to him produced nothing but frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it had been a singular effort by Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their kickoff team is one of the tops in the NFL,'' he said.
``I read the coverage and found a seam.''
</P>
<P>
   With 10:07 left in the game and the Patriots down, 24-3, Faulk
provided their first sign of a pulse when he took a screen pass to
the right by Bledsoe and threaded into the end zone, dragging
linebacker Roman Phifer the last few yards, to make it 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great call by Drew,'' said Faulk, ``and I got some
good blocking in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice was a barely audible monotone, his eyes focused on the
floor in front of his locker, as he reluctantly described his
exploits. Faulk, who is basically serving an apprenticeship behind
Allen this year and carried only twice for 7 yards Monday, could
see no short-term benefits from his performance. In the long run,
he briefly conceded, it could yield dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me more confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he immediately returned his focus to the grim overall
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still an awful lot we've got to work on,'' he said,
repeating his mantra: ``There's nothing positive that came out of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the trick is for Faulk and his teammates to consign Monday's
futility to history and focus on Sunday's visit to Miami in a game
that looms as an AFC East survival test for both the fourth-place
Patriots (6-3) and the first-place Dolphins (7-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a day to get over it, then we come back to work,''
he said. ``We've got to put it behind us. We got hurt bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Faulk, the pain might have been worse.

ON THE WEB, WRITERS WRITE THEIR OWN TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the journalistic equivalent of the naked bootleg, the
football play in which the quarterback deserts his blockers and
runs alone against the opposing team. In this example, a seasoned
journalist abandons the comforting context (and the paycheck) of a
newspaper or magazine, and hangs out a shingle, saying to readers,
in effect: Forget the others! Read only me!
</P>
<P>
   Now rolling out on the naked bootleg is policy scribe Mickey
Kaus, formerly of the New Republic, Newsweek, and the online
magazine Slate. Sometime last spring, Kaus decided he had had
enough working for other people. Now he is the owner-occupier of
one of the more interesting single family dwellings on the Web:
kausfiles.com.
</P>
<P>
   This has been done before. Eight years ago, the popular Dallas
sports columnist Skip Bayless went solo with a fax-based
subscription service. He lasted four years, but the going was
tough. ``I thought people all across Dallas would subscribe to my
sports column just the way they subscribed to the newspaper,'' he
recalls. But instead they took his faxed columns to the copying
machine, effectively picking his pocket. Bayless is now a lead
columnist with the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The Web changes the terms of trade, as Matt Drudge and Harry
Knowles, the engaging omphalos of the movie site
aint-it-cool-news.com, have shown. Kaus pays $30 a month to a
company that runs his page off a computer in Reno, and he devotes
several hours a week to formatting his columns. Otherwise, he's
free and clear to succeed or fail on his own.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes kausfiles from the other stand-alone
journalism sites is that it's good. I enjoy Drudge and salute his
services to the nation, but, like Knowles, Drudge is a
hunter-gatherer, not a writer or reporter. Al Gore's former
roommate Bob Somerby runs a site called The Daily Howler
(dailyhowler.com), which, his education at the World's Greatest
University notwithstanding, is exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Kaus is churning out Pretty Serious Journalism. The author of a
well-reviewed book on welfare, he writes punchy and informative
copy on a subject that puts normal people to sleep. He can be very
funny, and he's good in attack mode, especially when tilting
against the mediacracy. He administered a memorable mugging of the
New York Times's sloppy obituary of Judith Campbell Exner that led
to a backtracking ``Editor's Note'' in the newspaper of record two
days later.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, he caught the esteemed Naomi Wolf pushing
the line that George W. Bush's campaign advisers are racist, a
piece of demagogy that might have been taken more seriously if
someone else had said it. I think the New Yorker's Joe Klein has
become more critical of Bill Bradley since kausfiles accused him of
``falling in love again,'' but Kaus isn't taking credit for that.
</P>
<P>
   What do journalists want? They want to maximize each of three
axes: money, freedom, and fame. So where does Kaus stand? For a
mainstream reporter, his freedom coefficient is close to 100, the
best possible score. For money, he gets a score of 50, which is
better than the zero he was earning for the first several months of
kausfiles' existence. Just last month, Slate editor Michael Kinsley
offered Kaus half a salary to give Slate readers a 24-hour jump on
Kaus's columns before he posts them on kausfiles. Kaus lives alone
in Manhattan, and Kinsley's mite ``pays the rent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What about audience, or fame? His ``unique browser hits'' per
week seem to increasing from the 5,000 level to the 8,000 level,
Kaus says tentatively. By comparison, Slate claims 1.4 million such
hits every week. It would be nice to attract advertisers, ``but I'm
not worrying about that this month,'' Kaus says. ``That's one of
the virtues of having no business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience will increase. But fame, well, fame always proves
elusive. Just after he launched the site, Kaus attended his 30th
reunion at Beverly Hills High School. ``Many of my classmates had
become California's leading doctors and lawyers, and inevitably,
one of them asked me what I do for a living,'' Kaus recalls. ``I
said, `I have a Web site.' And this guy paused for a moment, and
replied, `My daughter does, too.' ''

NICKS IN THE CHAINSAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a time, Albert J. Dunlap, former chief executive and
president of Sunbeam Corp., was the darling of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap's slash-and-burn approach to restructuring and layoffs
led to the nickname ``Chainsaw Al,'' a fitting moniker for a man
who, it turns out, was neither a compassionate employer nor an
astute businessman. But in a world where mere mention of a
restructuring or a downsizing could trigger higher stock prices,
shareholders adored Chainsaw Al. And so did many in the media.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Byrne, a senior writer at Business Week, was among a
handful of journalists and analysts who saw through the facade.
Byrne's new unauthorized biography, ``Chainsaw: The Notorious
Career of Al Dunlap in the Era of Profit-at-Any-Price''
(HarperCollins Publishing Inc., 1999), paints a troubling portrait
of how big egos and greed can destroy a company and the people it
employs.
</P>
<P>
   As I delved into the book, I found myself struggling to make
sense of Dunlap's popularity and the cadre of supporters who jumped
at his every command _ even when a command made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   One example: The 1997 shutdown of a 59,000-square-foot plant in
Bay Springs, Miss. Factory workers at the site produced the highly
efficient positive temperature coefficient (PFC) wires embedded in
Sunbeam's electric blankets, one of a handful of products that were
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Shutdown of the building, which Sunbeam occupied for free, would
save the company less than $200,000 in transportation costs. But
the transfer of equipment to a plant some 40 miles away would
result in as much as $10 million in relocation costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Byrne, aides tried to convince Dunlap that the move
was foolhardy, but the Sunbeam chief wouldn't listen. When the
mayor launched a campaign to keep the plant open and accused Dunlap
of treating workers like ``depreciating pieces of equipment,''
Dunlap declared war.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 125 workers, or about 5 percent of Bay Springs' entire
population, lost their jobs as a result. Sunbeam offered them jobs
in Hattiesburg, but it was too far from the workers' homes and the
pay was too low. ``They couldn't drive 200 miles a day for $6 or $8
an hour, and he knew it,'' Mayor Jerry Evon Smith told Byrne.
Dunlap ``was offering them jobs so he wouldn't have to pay them
unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as workers in Bay Springs were trying to make sense of
the job cut and were worrying about their future, Dunlap's chainsaw
tactics were fast becoming role models for managers.
</P>
<P>
   The now 61-year-old ex-paratrooper was ousted by the Sunbeam
board in 1998 for not meeting earnings projections. But his legacy
lives on. One reason, the book suggests, is the pressure
institutional shareholders began placing on corporate managements
in the early 1990s, a shift that led to a significant change in the
way public corporations are governed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a public company's goal was to manage a firm for
employees and customers as well as for shareholders, suppliers,
community residents, and the firm's own financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, such companies had shifted their focus, making the
creation of shareholder value their primary goal. By appeasing
shareholders' yen for profits through downsizing, some US firms not
only realized short-term gains but were able to make a balance
sheet look a lot healthier than it was.
</P>
<P>
   Apply that formula to today's go-go economy, and it is easy to
see why thousands of workers are still losing jobs. When Chicago
outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas looked at layoffs in
1999, it found that more than 575,000 jobs have been cut thus far,
11 percent higher than in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the best way to improve and grow a company is to
increase staff and assets, develop products, or venture into viable
new markets. Unfortunately, Dunlap chose the slash-and-burn route,
cutting 12,000 jobs at Sunbeam. And his impact on the company
didn't end there. ``In one year,'' says Byrne, ``Sunbeam's losses
totaled $898 million, a sum that wiped out all the net income the
company had made under'' both of its previous chief executives
``for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The book not only recounts Dunlap's business decisions, it
examines the man behind the title, including the elderly parents
Dunlap abandoned, the son he ignored, the ex-wife he abused, and
the dogs he adored.
</P>
<P>
   We learn, for example, that Dunlap's first wife, Gwyn, returned
to her family with her toddler son because of abusive treatment.
The daughter of a plumber, she wanted to make a better life for
herself and saw Dunlap as a man who would probably succeed at
fulfilling his own lofty dreams. The couple married in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   By 1963, Gwyn Dunlap had had enough. Barred from using the
family car and fearful of her husband's temper, she packed her bags
a year later and left with her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Christmas holidays of 1963, while at her parents'
home in New Jersey, Dunlap shoved his wife so hard that she fell
over a coffee table and onto the living room floor,'' Byrne writes.
``I will kill you, and step all over you and take that baby,''
Dunlap is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The need to overpower was also present in the executive suite.
In fact, working with Al Dunlap was a lot like going to war, the
author says. ``The pressure was brutal, the hours exhausting, and
the casualties high. . . At Sunbeam, Dunlap created a culture of
misery, an environment of moral ambiguity, indifferent to
everything except the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would throw papers or furniture, bang his hands on his
desk, knock glasses of water off a table, and shout so ferociously
that a manager's hair could lift from his head by the stream of air
that rushed from Dunlap's screaming mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne's book is packed with behind-the-scenes information, much
of it from people who were right there in Dunlap's orbit. Still,
the end of the book was something of a letdown for me, not because
Byrne failed in telling the tale, but because I wanted Dunlap to
get his.
</P>
<P>
   Chainsaw Al received his pink slip over the telephone. Maybe
Sunbeam's board was so afraid of the chief executive's roar, it
cowered at the thought of delivering the news in person. What a
pity.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left the company, Dunlap was earning $26.9
million a year, which included $13.7 million to reimburse his
income tax bill for his company stock and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Where is he now? When he's not on the golf course or collecting
big fees on the lecture circuit, Chainsaw Al is relaxing in his
multimillion-dollar home in a gated community in Boca Raton, Fla.

   MADAPDAP, Philippines _ The midday sun is beating down on
Nerissa Sagum-Agustin as she pauses on a dirt road in this
distressed resettlement area to look at her list of the sick.
</P>
<P>
   She points to the first name, five-year-old Abraham Taruc, and
quickly finds his home, having been there many times to deliver
medicine and accompany the family to the local hospital. The
two-room cinder-block structure is cool and dark. Abraham's mother,
Elvira, sits on the floor, the boy stretched across her lap, his
head cradled in her arm. He stares at the ceiling with his mouth
open, oblivious to the visitors who just entered.
</P>
<P>
   There are many children like Abraham on the list carried by
Sagum-Agustin, a nurse and community activist. They are unable to
walk or talk. Their growth is stunted and their muscles refuse to
coordinate. They suffer from spasms and seizures. Most are unable
to eat solid food.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham and hundreds of other children were born or raised at
nearby Clark Air Base, which was abandoned by the US Air Force in
1991. After the Americans left, the former barracks became homes
for families like Abraham's. They planted corn and rice in the
fields that flow next to the long runways once used by American
fighter jets, and tapped wells on the base for water.
</P>
<P>
   What the families didn't know was that the land was contaminated
with the residue of chemicals, insecticides, and hazardous waste
generated by the Air Force, according to US government records and
a study by an American engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   Unknowing mothers mixed their baby formula with water tainted by
mercury, gasoline, and bacteria. For years, the residents of the
former air base drank the water, used it to bathe their children,
and water their crops, never suspecting it may be the reason why
people were getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   As countries like the Philippines begin to come of age
environmentally, they are awakening to a toxic disaster at former
and current US bases. Virtually no part of the world is untouched
by environmental hazards generated by the US military. A recent
Pentagon report cited environmental problems at bases in Greenland,
Spain, Japan, Panama, Italy, Iceland, and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a (US) military base in the world that doesn't
have some soil or ground water contamination. That is just a
given,'' said Gary Vest, the principal assistant deputy
undersecretary of defense for environmental security. ``I will
stipulate there is contamination everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental contamination is not just the result of
historical neglect. It continues today in places like South Korea,
where raw sewage flows untreated from US bases into local waters.
</P>
<P>
   The military has polluted in ways that would be illegal and
subject to criminal prosecution in the United States, according to
records obtained by The Boston Globe. Several countries, ranging
from key allies like Germany to the small island nation of Bermuda,
are now demanding that the United States help pay for the
environmental damage done by American forces.
</P>
<P>
   US base commanders are required to adhere to the environmental
standards of the host country, but in many cases there are no
standards. And even in countries with strict environmental
regulations, the United States has often ignored, or knowingly
violated, the host country laws.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences for polluting overseas have been few. At home,
Congress has shown little interest in paying for the cleanups. The
Clinton administration, which has prided itself on taking a hard
line against polluters in America, has dismissed the complaints of
countries like the Philippines out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it wanted to pay for major cleanups overseas, the
Pentagon has little discretion to do so unless given permission by
Congress _ something that has happened only once in recent years.
This year, the United States plans to spend only $17 million on
cleanups at foreign bases, or .1 percent of what it spends on base
cleanups domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone discussing this could build a pretty good case
for a moral obligation'' said Vest. ``If you accept that, you still
have to contend with what you are allowed to do by the law. That is
the overarching, fundamental question.''
</P>
<P>

   All's not well at bases
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the impoverished Philippines, once a vital Asian foothold for
the US Air Force and Navy, the legacy of American military
operations is detailed in the list of contaminants found in the
wells tapped by the residents who moved into the former command
center area at Clark. The list includes:
</P>
<P>
   --Mercury, which can impair child development and is linked to
nervous system disorders and kidney and liver disease, found at
twice the accepted Philippine health level;
</P>
<P>
   --Double the acceptable Philippine standard for nitrate, which
is linked at elevated levels to ``blue baby syndrome,'' a
potentially fatal condition that results from restricted oxygen in
the blood;
</P>
<P>
   --Propylbenzene, a fuel byproduct, which is not allowed in the
water supply at any level;
</P>
<P>
   --The insecticide dieldrin, a product now banned in the United
States, at amounts above Philippine health limits;
</P>
<P>
   --Unsafe amounts of lead, and coliform bacteria, which indicates
the presence of bacteria and other hazardous organisms.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is spreading, with the contaminated ground water
flowing away from the former base and toward overcrowded and
destitute towns clustered around the sprawling facility, according
to the Philippine government agency developing the base.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated water at the Clark command center is just one
trouble spot. Military records highlight scores of toxic threats at
Clark _ once the largest Air Force base outside the United States _
as well as at the former Navy base at Subic Bay, 65 miles to the
west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a US environmental firm, Pennsylvania-based Weston
International, found soil throughout Clark contaminated with jet
fuel, benzene, pesticides, oil, and PCBs. In several cases, the
study, commissioned by the Philippines, warned that the hazardous
waste could migrate into the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Families who lived on or near the base suffer from a
disproportionately high rate of many kinds of illnesses, according
to a 1998 study by the Toronto-based International Institute of
Concern for Public Health, which has been critical of military
environmental practices. The study found that current and former
residents of the command center area at Clark reported a high
percentage of illnesses associated with the mouth, nose, throat,
skin, and immune and nervous systems, as well as high levels of
kidney disease and reproductive disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for an immediate cleanup of the base, saying
the combination of exposure to toxic materials and poor living
conditions was creating health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this reason, improvement, remediation, and cleanup efforts
should be addressed to these areas first,'' the study concluded.
``If this is not possible, then evacuation. . . should be
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   The true scope of the contamination at Clark and Subic, and the
potential impact on nearby residents, may not be known for years.
Many of the toxins left behind become more hazardous the longer
people are exposed to them. And because much of the hazardous waste
was buried in landfills or dumped into waterways, there is a danger
of the toxins flowing unseen into unspoiled areas.
</P>
<P>
   As countries begin to assess the environmental damage at current
and former bases, the problem of overseas pollution threatens to
become a major financial and diplomatic liability for the United
States.

 MADAPDAP, Philippines: ... the United States.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is growing resentment in the Philippines over the base
contamination, and the country's Department of Foreign Affairs says
the base cleanup dispute ``continues to affect'' relations between
the countries. In September, the Philippine House of
Representatives passed a resolution calling on the United States to
clean up the sites.
</P>
<P>
   But a cleanup would be expensive. The General Accounting Office,
in a 1992 report, quoted military officers as saying the cost of
cleaning up both Philippine bases would approach ``Superfund
proportions'' _ a reference to the program for cleaning up the most
contaminated sites in the United States. American engineers
estimate the cost at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is not providing any money to clean up the bases,
however. The United States has also resisted calls to provide
technical assistance and more detailed military environmental
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The US embassy in Manila said in a statement that the ``American
military forces practiced good environmental stewardship during
their stay in the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   But that assertion is contradicted by the government's own
records, interviews with former military officers, Philippine base
workers, and even the US military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been in and out of there many years, particularly
during Vietnam, I know we were really (environmentally) abusive,''
said retired Navy Rear Admiral Eugene J. Carroll, now an official
with the nonprofit Center for Defense Information in Washington, a
group that has been critical of military spending. ``We clearly
left behind a toxic brew.''
</P>
<P>
   Vest, who oversees environmental issues at foreign bases for the
Pentagon, said there is no question the former US bases in the
Philippines were contaminated by American forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do recall years ago having been at Clark and physically
seeing contamination,'' he said. ``There is contamination at those
locations that was indeed caused by the military.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations ignored
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's environmental officers at Subic Bay tried to remedy
the hazards created by operations at the massive base. They knew
pumping millions of gallons of untreated sewage into Subic Bay each
day was a threat to public health.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed building a sewage treatment plant at a cost of
$12.7 million. To correct other deficiencies, they recommended the
construction of hazardous-material storage buildings, improvements
to leaky fuel storage tanks, and other environmental projects
totaling more than $2 million. But none of the recommendations were
followed.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to spending money on environmental projects at its
bases in 140 countries around the world, the Pentagon has been
stingy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dedicated budget for environmental cleanups
overseas, as there is for domestic bases. Many environmental
decisions are made by base commanders, who are often placed in the
position of deciding whether to cut funds for training and
logistics, which could prove hazardous to their soldiers, or
rejecting requests for environmental improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their policy overseas is to do nothing,'' said Polly Parks, a
Washington activist who works with countries concerned about base
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to spend $165 million on overseas
environmental projects this year. Ninety percent will be spent on
environmental compliance and maintenance, with the balance used to
clean up contaminated soil or water. Domestically, the military
spends $1.72 billion a year to clean up contaminated sites.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, commanders at foreign bases are
often faced with vague and conflicting directives on environmental
issues. US bases overseas are required to comply with the
environmental quality standards of the host country, and to adhere
to additional requirements or guidance provided in treaties. The
Department of Defense also requires overseas bases to ``conform to
the extent practicable'' to the more detailed standards followed at
bases in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Vest said each foreign commander has to create an
environmental document that ensures the base complies with local
law, any treatment requirements, and DOD standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy and standards are clear,'' he said. ``You do not
contaminate ground water or soil with current operations. And if
there is a spill, you clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   However, US personnel overseas sometimes do not know what is
required. A 1991 audit by the General Accounting Office found most
environmental officials at overseas bases did not have even a basic
knowledge of local regulations.
</P>
<P>
   A report in September by the Department of Defense Inspector
General concluded that at American bases in Germany, ``the training
of environmental personnel on the applicability of the German law
and the increased potential for German enforcement action was
insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns over secrecy, environmental inspectors in
many countries are not granted access to US bases, leaving it up to
the military to police itself. In its report, the GAO prevented
foreign countries from learning of hazards on their land by
deleting ``references to specific organizations that generate
hazardous waste, names of installations and countries where they
are located, and all photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   In countries like the Philippines, weak environmental
regulations are usually accompanied by impotent enforcement.
Furthermore, American regulatory agencies, such as the
Environmental Protection Agency, have no authority to police the
overseas activities of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is lacking is laws,'' for overseas environmental
compliance, said William Gallagher, who studied US operations in
Germany for the Defense Department Inspector General's office.
``You do things as the result of agreements, but there are no
hard-and-fast requirements for what you do overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also no accurate gauge of the extent of overseas
contamination. The military does not routinely conduct
environmental studies to identify contaminated areas, as it does
domestically. And unlike at home, there is little or no pressure
overseas from environmental groups to press the military to
identify and clean up hazardous sites.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hazards that are known are causing concern among some
government officials and activists.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report discovered contaminated ground or water at five
of the seven overseas bases it inspected. ``We identified
conditions at the. . .bases we visited that, had they occurred at
bases in the United States, would have been violations of US
environmental regulations,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A second report by the GAO, in 1992, said the environmental
damage at the Philippine bases was ``significant'' and ``would not
be in compliance with US environmental standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, a US commonwealth, the local attorney general
alleged this summer that the Navy was violating clean water, clean
air, and hazardous-waste laws in its operations at the Vieques
base. The Navy has admitted to mistakenly firing rounds tipped with
depleted uranium at Vieques, and using napalm in 1993. A
preliminary health study found the physical and mental health of
the residents near the base was significantly worse that that of
other Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, sewage from two bases flows untreated into local
rivers, a practice that would be illegal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that situation disgusting,'' said a high-ranking US
military official, who
</P>
<P>
   has pushed for tougher environmental standards overseas, and
asked not to be identified.

</P>
<P>
   The Spanish were the first to look at the lush, tropical
mountains that rise to form a protective ring around Subic Bay and
see the deep-water port for both its natural beauty and strategic
importance. In 1908, the United States established a naval base at
Subic that would become a key staging area for wars fought in Korea
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Navy jets and ships passed through Subic Bay.
Repairing and maintaining the equipment resulted in thousands of
tons of hazardous waste. Right up until the Navy left the facility
in 1992, the adjacent bay provided an easy and convenient dumping
area for heavy metals, fuel, chemical ammunition waste, and raw
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Roquito Dioso, a Filipino who worked at Subic, said there were
two rules of thumb for the hazardous waste produced at the Naval
Magazine, where bombs and ammunition were stored and destroyed.
Both violated local and US regulations.
</P>
<P>
   If the amount of toxic waste was less than a full barrel, the
waste was dumped into a local stream, he said. If there was enough
waste to fill several barrels, it was trucked to a local landfill
and dumped, Dioso said.

<P>
   Only a quarter of the 5 million gallons of sewage pumped by the
Navy into the bay every day was treated. An internal 1992 report
found that contaminated wastewater generated by the sandblasting of
ships was discarded in the bay. ``To a certain degree, the area
became saturated with waste,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination was not limited to the bay. Of the area around
the base foundry shop, the Navy report noted, ``Aside from the high
possibility of PCB ground contamination, it is quite probable that
the area is also contaminated with heavy metals, particularly lead,
copper, cadmium, silver, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The US turned over 1,000 pages of environmental documents to the
Philippine government. Those documents, according to experts, are
likely only a fraction of the total that exist.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Coles, an engineer with Kleinfelder Inc., a US firm
that works on domestic base cleanups, told a Philippine Senate
committee in September that the documents generated by a facility
like Subic should fill a medium-sized warehouse. And the documents
would only tell part of the story, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stationed at Subic for five years,'' said Coles. ``To my
knowledge, things occur that are not necessarily documented. . . .
You will find things you don't expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Base workers have described many improper practices not detailed
in Navy records released to the Philippines. In one incident, a
base worker said he and others were ordered to pour cyanide out of
drums directly into a landfill. The same landfill, which contained
other hazards dumped by the Navy, was frequented by local
scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States left both Subic and Clark, there have
been few environmental or health studies.
</P>
<P>
   A study of Subic, which the Philippine government is developing
as an international business and tourism zone, found only isolated
contamination. The study has been criticized by US scientists and
engineers as substandard. The environmental official for the Subic
Bay Metropolitan Authority, the government agency developing the
area, acknowledged the shortcomings of the 1997 government-funded
study, saying it was intended more as a development tool than an
environmental review. The official, Michael Musngi, said a more
recent study by a Japanese company found a high concentration of
heavy metals in sediment samples taken from Subic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 study did identify 10 contaminated areas and suggested
further studies on 13 other sites. Asked if those areas are being
studied, Musngi said, ``Unfortunately, no. Subic Bay is in dire
need of funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government is ill-equipped to study the bases.
Officials collected water samples at Clark in used Coke bottles. A
group of US scientists donated a device to test water, but it has
not been used because the Philippine scientists don't know how to
assemble or operate the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is exactly the problem,'' said Saul Bloom, a San
Francisco-based environmental activist who has studied
contamination at the bases. ``How do you walk away from a country
that does not have the capacity to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials at Clark and Subic complained about a lack
of cooperation from the US military, saying they have not been
provided documents needed to identify toxic hotspots.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the records may no longer exist. The Navy report said
``several environmental files were reported missing'' and others
were shredded. At a Subic facility where excess and unusable
munitions were incinerated, there are no records of how the Navy
disposed of toxic residue from the burning of ammunition. ``It is
likely that the area is contaminated with lead, lithium, and other
heavy metals,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The US government maintains it bears no responsibility to clean
up the contamination in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written to the Philippine Senate this summer, Sherri
Goodman, the deputy undersecretary of defense, said the 1947 treaty
governing the bases does not require the United States to pay for
any cleanup. In addition, she said, a 1988 amendment to the treaty
waived the Philippines' right to demand cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Defense and State departments refused to
comment officially on the Philippine bases. Privately, some said
there is general indifference to overseas pollution, and in the
case of the Philippines, lingering resentment from a 1992
Philippine Senate vote to end the US lease at Subic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some Philippine government officials are also uninterested in
pushing the United States to clean up the bases. The Philippines
still counts Washington as an important military ally, and some
officials here worry the relationship would be damaged by a more
aggressive push to clean up the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting for a cleanup, however, say every day of delay
results in more exposure to toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like a beggar,'' said Philippine Senator
Loren Legarda-Leviste. ``We are asking for justice. This was a
lopsided agreement that does not protect the environment. Who could
think of environmental protection in the 1940s?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Poisonous well `closed'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children priming the Champion Pitcher well at the former
Clark Air Base are smiling. Drawing water from the well is fun and
they have no idea that they are pumping poisons from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of families, many refugees who lost their homes during
the eruption of nearby Mount Pinatubo, moved here after the United
States left the facility in 1991. From the shells of barrack
buildings, some of this country's poorest residents built new homes
from the foundations, patching together cardboard cigarette boxes,
stray two-by-fours and scrap metal to make walls and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   As the children play at the well, Epifania de Leon carries her
eight-year-old daughter, Michelle, clutching the child close to her
chest and taking care to avoid the crumbled concrete blocks around
her.
</P>
<P>
   The de Leons moved away from Clark last year, but still come
back to visit friends. The children playing in the contaminated
water are a harsh reminder of why they left.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after arriving at Clark, and drinking the water,
Michelle experienced severe diarrhea. Within a few months, the
once-active three-year-old stopped talking and walking.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle today looks like a child half her age. She is unable to
eat solid food and her legs are gaunt and malformed. Her eyes and
mouth widen, and her fists clench as she repeatedly fends off
spasms. She spends her days lying on a floor or cradled in her
mother's arms, unable to communicate the most basic of needs. When
asked what made her daughter sick, de Leon is quick to nod toward
the nearby well.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than two years since the Weston International
study determined that the water coming from the wells at the Clark
Air Base command center was contaminated. At a Philippine Senate
hearing in September, the chief environmental officer for Clark
Development Corporation, the government agency that now operates
the air base, said the wells were ordered closed as soon as the
results were known.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the hearing, however, a Globe reporter found the
children pumping water from a well reported closed. Residents of
the center said the wells continue to be used for drinking water.
The wells were shut down, but only for a day, when a Philippine
senator came to visit the site, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Those pushing for a cleanup of the bases are growing frustrated.
They have talked of filing a lawsuit against the United States _ a
difficult effort that could take many years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Myrla Baldonado, who started the People's Task Force for Bases
Cleanup, said Filipinos are beginning to realize the danger of
toxic waste. As they learn more, people in the country are
beginning to demand more, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What they can't understand, she said, is the indifference of the
American government. ``It's enraging,'' Baldonado said. ``The US is
a very callous government. People remember how Americans treated
Filipinos when they were here. This is just a continuation.''

   Chastain, dumped from the squad before the last Cup, boots home
the winning goal against the Chinese, rips off her jersey, and
instantly becomes rich and famous. Smith's headstrong Broncos are
21-0, have been ranked No. 1 since Day 1 and are favored to win
their first national title.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the next time husband and wife see each other, at
the Final Four in San Jose three weekends from now. ``I haven't
spent a full day with Brandi since before the World Cup began in
June,'' says Smith, whose team hosts plays to UCLA in a third-round
tournament match Saturday. ``We both have crazy schedules. Thank
God for cell phones. I don't think we'd ever talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   They knew the summer (for her) and fall (for him) would be
insane, but Smith and Chastain figured there'd at least be a few
weeks after the World Cup and before the college season when they
could be housemates again. ``Brandi was thinking about coming home
and hanging out and doing laundry,'' Smith says, ``but she was just
catapulted into the stratosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain found herself on the cover of Time, Newsweek, and
Sports Illustrated all in the same week. Whenever she answered the
phone, somebody like Nike or Volvo or Power Bar was offering to
sign her to a deal _ the endorsement tally is $2 million and
counting. ``I don't know half the things she's involved in,'' says
Smith. ``Brandi's schedule is so crazy I don't think I could keep
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been out flat himself ever since August as his Broncos
have run off to their best season ever. Santa Clara plays in the
West Coast Conference, which means twice-a-week treks from Malibu
to Spokane, plus a cross-country jaunt to face perennial champs
North Carolina (i.e. Mia U.). ``We certainly didn't dodge
anybody,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Since Smith, whose teams have made 11 straight NCAA tournaments
and six Final Fours, is something of a campus icon, he's in demand
as a speaker at university events. This week, he'll be addressing
the Oakland alumni chapter. And since he's head regional coach for
the Olympic development program, Smith has to pencil another two
dozen events a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday, we played Brigham Young in a tournament game,''
he says. ``At 4:40, I was on a flight to Bozeman, Montana, then on
to Laramie, Wyoming, for site visits for summer camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain knows the routine well. She was Smith's full-time
assistant until her pre-Cup camp and travel obligations with the US
team convinced them that she had to scale back to volunteer status.
``The coach of the women's soccer team is a very demanding guy,''
Smith says. ``I wanted someone to be here so I wouldn't be buried
24/7.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had his thing, Chastain had her thing and that was
understood even before they married a year before the 1996
Olympics. ``Brandi and I have always been our own people,'' he
says. ``We're very respectful of each of us having our own dreams
and aspirations. I love what I'm doing; she loves what she's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were engaged in 1995, Chastain wasn't even in the
national team's player pool. She was dropped from the roster after
winning a gold medal in the inaugural Cup in 1991 and didn't get
back on until a players' strike a year before the 1996 Olympics
created an opening. ``I know what it was like for her not to be
involved all those years,'' says Smith. ``How crushing, how
devastating it was for her.''
</P>
<P>
   After Chastain won a gold medal in Atlanta and was invited to
train with the squad for this year's Cup, both she and Smith
decided that she should ride the wave as long as she could. That
meant residency camps, trips to Australia, Brazil, China, Portugal,
and Japan while Smith stayed home coaching in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   They still hadn't even had their honeymoon. They finally found
time during the summer of 1998. ``We spent it at the (men's) World
Cup in Paris,'' Smith says. ``Not a bad place for a honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chastain played in this summer's Cup opener before a full
house at the Meadowlands, Smith and his 11-year-old son from a
previous marriage took the red-eye from LA to watch. When Chastain
slammed home The Kick in the Rose Bowl, Smith was in the stands. He
watched his wife rip off her shirt in front of the world _ and
didn't find it odd.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch soccer every day, like Brandi and I do on TV,
it's hard not to see someone take off his shirt after scoring a
goal,'' Smith says. ``Taking off your shirt in soccer is like an
NBA guy slam-dunking and staring at his defender. People thought it
was Nike's idea. No. It was just the moment and the passion and
Brandi's wanting to do what her heroes had done.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chastain or Smith was prepared for immediate fame and
fortune that followed. ``We were naive about what it all meant,''
he says. While Smith has been coaching his Broncos, his wife has
been frequent-flying all over the United States making appearances,
doing commercials, shooting a movie, playing on an indoor tour with
her teammates, hobnobbing with celebs.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday afternoon, Chastain phoned him. ``I've got something
you're going to want to do,'' she told her husband. ``Tiger has
asked me if I want to play nine holes with him. Want to join us?''
``Love to,'' Smith sighed. ``But I've got to scout these games.''
</P>
<P>
   His volunteer assistant understands. The season takes priority.
When she returned home from the Cup for ``Brandi Chastain Day,''
Smith was out of town recruiting. He has been at the job for 13
years, taking Santa Clara from nowhere to national prominence
almost instantly. ``For the first three years, I was making $3,200
a season,'' remembers Smith, whose record is 221-50-14, fifth on
the all-time US list. ``Now, that's not even a month's salary.''
</P>
<P>
   His varsity has been ranked No. 1 once before, when Chastain was
a senior in 1990, but this year has been magical. The Broncos have
outscored opponents, 98-9, and allowed just one conference goal.
They dominated the WCC all-star list with six first-teamers and
three second-teamers, and have three All-Americas in forwards Mandy
Clemens and Jacqui Little and defender Nikki Serlenga.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, who wrote a big check from her post-Cup windfall to
the university's athletic booster fund (``Wow, you must be making
some money,'' her husband told her) has stayed true to her school
obsessively by cellular. ``My phone will ring minutes after a game
and it'll be Brandi saying, `Who played well?'', Smith says. ``We
were having a meeting once and (midfielder) Aly Wagner's phone
starts ringing. It's Brandi, wanting to know how practice went.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain did make it back last month for the Notre Dame game,
where she was being honored. ``Our first goal came on a penalty
kick and our whole team took off their shirts and waved them
around,'' Smith says. ``How appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain also returned for the final week of the regular season,
which was the longest time she and Smith had been together in more
than five months. ``That meant a lot to our players,'' he says,
``because they know that when Brandi's with us, she's turned
something down to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos make it to December, Chastain will be there on
the sideline. Then she and Smith will go off to the Caribbean and,
finally, exhale. ``We still haven't sat down and talked about it,''
he says. ``We haven't had a chance to catch our breath and say,
wow, take a look at all this stuff.''

THORNTON A BETTER FIT FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's funny how no one seems to talk much about Joe
Thornton these days. In his first season, 1997, after he was the
first overall choice in the NHL draft, many wondered about
Thornton, who didn't get a lot of ice time with Boston and wound up
with three goals and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Then last season, Thornton had a sterling campaign, racking up
41 points, 16 via goals. And he was the Bruins' No. 3 scorer in the
playoffs with 9 points (three goals) in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Now we seem to take him for granted, it seems. He's more mature,
and at 6 feet 4 inches, 220 pounds, he's 15 pounds bigger than he
was as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   In 18 games this year, Thornton has three goals and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have been putting the puck in the net,'' said
Thornton, 20. ``I've been hitting the guys with some good passes.
As far as the goals, I'm not concerned. I'll keep on playing strong
and as long as I get a lot of chances, I'll help the team that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton skates on a line with Sergei Samsonov, who has 11
points, including five goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well together,'' Thornton said. ``He definitely
knows how to put the puck in the net. All I have to do is get him
the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever kidded Thornton about being the league's top
draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard about being the first player taken overall,
or this or that,'' he said. ``Everybody just goes out and plays
their game. Once you get on the ice, everybody's just occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a couple of years in the league, they kind of forget
who's the first or second pick and stuff like that. You just go out
and play your best. They forget where you were drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   There were mild chuckles about how slowly Pat Burns brought
Thornton along that first season, but Thornton understood: He was
just a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been sent back to juniors that year, I'm not sure how
last year and this season would have gone for me,'' he said.
``Every year I just want to get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things picked up the second half of last season and in the
playoffs; that's when I picked up the pace. And if I feel I'm
getting better each and every day, I think I'll get more points
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs last season were particularly exciting for
Thornton. He loved being on the ice in the important moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bunch of opportunities to play a lot last season in
the playoffs,'' he said. ``I had a good share of ice time in the
playoffs and it was really exciting to have that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton is better able to handle himself in tough situations
now, too. He doesn't back away from a fight. The weight he put on
while working out with fitness boss Mike Boyle in the summer of
1998 certainly gave him a boost, and Thornton kept his weight up
last summer while working with his personal trainer at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body just naturally found its weight,'' he said. ``I'm a
big guy and I just naturally filled out. Plus, I watch what I eat.
I only eat good food.''

<P>
   It requires major chutzpah to make a movie about the making of
what is arguably the greatest film of all time; the very real
danger is that the filmmakers will spend the entire running time of
their effort inadvertently underscoring just how brilliant the
original truly was. So give points for hubris to the team behind
``RKO 281,'' an HBO docudrama about the obstacle-laden road that
led to ``Citizen Kane,'' Orson Welles' enduring masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Liev Schreiber stars as Welles, who was a mere 24 when he
co-wrote, directed and starred in ``Kane,'' but as the film opens,
he's already considered a has-been. His successes in radio and
theater landed him a sweetheart Hollywood deal, but he's suffering
from a vague paralysis _ months upon months have passed and all he
has to show his studio, RKO, is a string of projects that died in
development. All he knows for sure is that he absolutely does not
want to make the film version of his radio smash, ``The War of the
Worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kane'' was a thinly veiled retelling of the life of publishing
overlord William Randolph Hearst (James Cromwell), who spent his
inheritance buying a chain of newspapers and lately had befriended
such dubious leaders as Mussolini. ``RKO 281'' fictitiously has
Welles meeting and quickly offending Hearst at one of the latter's
famous dinner parties at San Simeon, which in turn inspires him to
take Hearst on cinematically. In fact, Welles never visited San
Simeon _ his first wife had married the nephew of Hearst's
mistress, Marian Davies (played here by Melanie Griffith), so if
any such invitation had been considered it was no doubt quickly
squelched to prevent an awkward scene. But Herman Mankiewicz (John
Malkovich), who wrote the first draft of ``Kane,'' had been to San
Simeon, and had _ thanks to his battle with the bottle _
subsequently been scratched off the invite list, which created a
pool of bitterness that he no doubt poured enthusiastically into
his writing.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-time filmmaker, Welles is prone to goofs _ he trashes
a camera and digs up the floor of a soundstage to get a shot he
wants _ but he's also, in one bold stroke, redefining cinema. And
he manages to shoot ``Kane'' in utter secrecy _ when Hearst finally
finds out what the film is about, he hears not from his gossip
columnist, Louella Parsons (Brenda Blethyn), but from her
competitor, Hedda Hopper (Fiona Shaw).
</P>
<P>
   Once Hearst gets the message, though, Hollywood is under siege.
Hearst threatens to expose the seamier side of Hollywood's moguls
and stars; at one point, the other studios offer to buy ``Kane''
from RKO, just to destroy it and mollify Hearst. Welles is
particularly miffed by the on-again, off-again support he gets from
RKO studio chief George Schaefer (Roy Scheider), who's never sure
if his tyro auteur is more passionate about his film and the First
Amendment or just indulging in some hard-core self-aggrandizement.
</P>
<P>
   Performances are largely terrific, and certainly, an impressive
cast has been assembled. Schreiber invests considerable thought
into Welles' blustery moments, and Cromwell works hard to find the
human touches in the monstrous Hearst. Director Benjamin Ross
(``The Young Poisoner's Handbook'') opted to shoot the film in
London, with splendid results _ the locations found to stand in for
San Simeon are lavish, and in general the film has a bit of a
fairy-tale look to it. There are a few clever visual homages to
``Kane'' thrown in at odd angles in this film.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film clocks in at well under 90 minutes, and feels a
bit thin for all its swagger. There's much backstage drama it
misses _ for example, Welles loved Charles Foster Kane while
Mankiewicz hated him, which had to have led to some interesting
dynamics in the making of the movie. And for all its acclaim,
``Kane'' was fairly snubbed at the Oscar ceremony, which must have
been both humbling and irritating to Welles.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, the film doesn't quite nail the connection
between ``Kane'' and Welles himself _ in a way, Kane came to
resemble Welles more than Hearst, something that Hearst himself
obliquely observes to his nemesis in a nice moment late in the
movie. To have created such a work at the age of 24 must have been
overwhelming, even to Welles. But to have largely been punished for
it provoked a chagrin and distrust that affected the rest of his
career, which though long and celebrated, was never able to fulfill
that early promise.

   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ The Miami quarterback controversay that
really wasn't all that controversial turned more frothy here Sunday
when Damon Huard _ Dan Marino's, you know, controversial backup _
was sacked, smashed, and otherwise trash-compacted at Ralph Wilson
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Huard's line in a humiliating 23-3 loss to the powerful Buffalo
Bills: 9 for 25, 65 yards, no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Huard's line after the loss: ``To me, the whole quarterback
controversy is absurd. My job right now is to back up Dan Marino.
If he's ready, he's the man.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has been the incontrovertible, and not the
least bit controversial, truth in Miami for 16-plus seasons and
60,000-plus yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Dophins and Patriots meet Sunday at Pro Player Stadium in
what became an even more critical matchup for the New Englanders
after their 24-17 loss to the Jets (no strangers to QB
controversies themselves). Who will steer the Miami offense against
New England? If the nagging nerve in Marino's neck stops pinging,
then it undoubtedly will be the 38-year-old legend's game to lead.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not Marino, then the 26-year-old Huard, who went
undrafted in '96 after smashing all the passing records at the
University of Washington, will make his fifth straight start since
moving in as Marino's emergency replacement against the Patriots
Oct. 17. Prior to being shredded Sunday like a small order of
Buffalo wings (mild, very mild, with lots and lots of celery),
Huard had directed four consecutive wins _ including the 31-30
triumph over the Patriots _ connecting on 70 of 120 passes for 813
yards and 4 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   In the predictable, all-variables-covered world of the NFL,
Huard quickly had gone a long way in establishing himself not just
as Marino's stand-in, but also as the somewhat-surprising heir
apparent to the Marino monarchy. The Dolphins weren't exactly
crushing people with a Huard-led offense that had totaled 49 points
in 12 quarters, but the defense had limited the likes of
Philadelphia, Oakland, and Tennessee to only 22 points. Run-and-gun
wasn't getting 'em there, but the Dolphins were winning, and that
was enough to keep head coach Jimmy Johnson's hair straight (never
a doubt) and his eye fixed on Huard as his offensive maestro.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Sunday's setback, when the Dolphins were cruising along
at an impressive 7-1, Johnson pointed to two factors in Huard's
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, going to Europe and getting the experience, I think,
was really a big key for him,'' said Johnson. ``When he came back
from Europe a year ago, before last season, I said, `Man, this guy
is not the same guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 is the Dan Thing, Huard's attempt to craft himself into a
Marino clone, even in the way, some suggest, he walks and talks.
Nearly a dozen years Marino's junior, the 6-foot-3-inch, 215-pound
Huard has spent two-plus years practicing, working out, even
golfing (they played Ireland courses together last spring) like the
famed 6-4, 228-pound Marino. Some of his teammates refer to him
affectionately as ``Baby Dan.'' Up until the banging around he and
his teammates took against the Bills, it was working pretty well
for the one-time pride of the Frankfurt (Germany) Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan has been great,'' said Huard, who could be seen at the
sidelines in Foxborough last month, absorbing every word the
injured Marino hollered through his helmet during the
come-from-behind triumph. ``He tells me just to hang in there and
that the games will come down to the fourth quarter. He goes over
the pictures and the defenses. Everything that you can imagine that
somebody would do to help a guy, he's done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing Marino could do for Huard when faced with
the Bills. He was sacked three times and forced constantly to
release failed passes, a collection of underthrows and overthrows
that, in part, led Miami to only 101 yards of net offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to focus,'' said Huard, dismissing the fact that the
day's elements _ Buffalo's powerful defense and the wintry Western
New York wind _ were daunting. ``I obviously didn't focus enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that controversy that won't go away, Huard only wishes he
could have shrugged off Bruce Smith as easily as he dismisses the
notion that he's truly in a me-or-Marino mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't annoy me,'' he said. ``That's life, I guess.
There's always controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   That Huard is even in the mix is a surprise. As promising as he
was at Washington, there was still that incredible slight of having
gone unpicked in the '96 draft. In fact, the pros were so
unimpressed by his college numbers (5,692 yards, 34 touchdown
passes), he wasn't even invited to the NFL combine.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Miami Herald story, an NFL general manager revealed
that it was a former Seattle Seahawks personnel director who
ultimately denied Huard the opportunity to attend. The league's two
scouting services were split on Huard, according to the GM, and in
such cases it is the local NFL club that determines whether a
college player from its area gets invited.
</P>
<P>
   According to the GM, the Seahawks executive out-and-out
``trashed'' Huard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like it was personal or something,'' said the GM.
``Normally, you just say yea or nea, and go on. But it was more
than that. It was kind of strange.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three years later, his career resurrected, Huard
passed off the remarks as ``the highs and lows of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit one of those lows in the summer of '96 when he was
invited as a free agent to the Cincinnati Bengals camp. He threw
well, appeared in one exhibition game, even tossed a TD pass on his
first drive, but ultimately fell victim to the depth chart. No job.
No prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati would go into a constant case of QB shuffle over the
next three years, and a disappointed Huard went off on a job
search.
</P>
<P>
   A business major at Washington, he won a position with Football
Northwest, a Paul Allen company formed for the purpose of steering
through the proposal to build Allen's Seahawks a new stadium. Only
months after a Seahawks boss kept him from the combine, there was
Huard, thumping the tub for a billionaire in need of a tax break.
Seattle execs now credit Huard's lobbying, in part, for gaining
public approval to build the $300 million stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Huard signed as a free agent with the
Dolphins and impressed everyone enough with his arm and his
scrambling to stay all year, if only on the sidelines. Itching to
get in some action, he spent the spring of '98 in Germany,
directing the Galaxy to a 7-3 record and a spot in the World Bowl
before wrenching a knee. He hit on nearly 55 percent of his 290
passes and piled up nearly 2,000 passing yards and 12 touchdowns.
Most of all, the experience got his game charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how much I enjoyed playing the game,'' he recently
told the Florida Sun-Sentinel. ``Really, over there, it's not very
sophisticated. We didn't practice all day and watch film all night.
You just went over and played the game. Our offense was as simple
as simple can get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back,'' said Johnson, ``and had a flair for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   What Huard can do that Marino can't _ or hasn't had to _ is run
when necessary. No one ever has gotten rid of the ball faster than
Marino. Anyone else has to make up for a less-than-lightning
release, and Huard has done that with his legs. He'll routinely run
out of the pocket and search for options downfield. He'll take the
sack if necessary; the Patriots piled him under nine times and
knocked him down a dozen more.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as Sunday was, Johnson didn't once look over his shoulder
and summon ex-New Englander Scott Zolak into the action. Huard went
down throwing, his final toss to Tony Martin overthrown while _
what else? _ under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' said Huard, looking ahead to Sunday,
a game he might or might not play, depending how this week's
controversy plays out. ``I'm sure it will be a hard-fought game,
just as it was a few weeks ago. That's the way our conference is
going to be, a rat race.''

EMBOLDENED JETS REACTED TO OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Steve Sidwell couldn't have emphasized the
importance of preventing ``the big play'' more than he did in the
15 days between games.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots defensive coordinator looked at the first eight
games and found 10 running plays of 15 or more yards and 18 pass
plays of 15 or more yards. He called this situation ``lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a situation the Patriots corrected in Monday night's
24-17 loss to the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just aren't tackling well,'' said defensive tackle Chad
Eaton. ``Sid always tells us we're a good defense but we're poor
tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very basic. For our defense to work, we have to tackle.
It's that simple. There were a few times when we had Curtis
(Martin) stopped but he got past us. That's what I'm talking about.
We've got to make the plays when we have a chance to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, they couldn't prevent a Ray Lucas scramble
for 17 yards that may have given the young quarterback confidence
that he could at least run if everything else failed. That drive
ended in Lucas throwing an interception, which is what the Patriots
thought there'd be more of.
</P>
<P>
   But that interception didn't rankle Lucas. He got bolder.
Knowing that Martin was having success running the ball opened up
the passing game for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had stopped Curtis, it would have meant everything for
us,'' said Eaton. ``Ray was throwing those dinky passes and he was
completing them because we bit on the play fakes because they were
running the ball so well.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that one big play snowballed into another.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-yard pass to Wayne Chrebet early in the second quarter got
the ball to the Patriots' 18, and Lucas soon took the Jets in for
their first score.
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots answered with a field goal, Lucas wasn't shy
about going to the air on the first play. He got another gain of
greater than 15 yards in the form of a diving 17-yard grab by
Keyshawn Johnson on the left sideline.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the defense to get stung by the run.
Three plays later, Martin took a straight handoff, quickly kicked
it out to the right, and was gone for a 36-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The right side of the Jets' line tied up the left side of the
Patriots' line. Linebacker Chris Slade missed Martin after a few
yards and that sprung him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make adjustments on the field, and at that point
the crowd noise was so high I'm not sure everyone heard the call,''
said Eaton. ``We might have had some guys playing one defense and
the other side playing another. It was miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are quick to blame the coaching, but it's not
them. We have to make those adjustments on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   With 48 seconds remaining in the half, the Patriots fell asleep
on defense. They allowed a 15-yard pass on first down again, Lucas
to Chrebet, following a Marcus Coleman interception. That put the
Jets in business at the Patriots' 21. With New England thinking
pass, the Jets ran, with Ray Anderson scampering 10 yards. Three
plays later, a very confident Lucas fired an 11-yard touchdown pass
to wide-open tight end Fred Baxter to make it a 21-3 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made adjustments in the second half, holding the
Jets to 3 points. The longest pass play was 14 yards, from Lucas to
Johnson, but it was during a 19-play drive that ate up 11:23,
including the final 8:52 of the third quarter. That led to the
field goal, which made it a 24-3 game.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots were better at preventing the big play, they
were terrible on third down. During the drive, Martin ran for 3 on
third and 1, Lucas passed to Johnson for 14 on third and 12, Lucas
passed to Johnson for 8 yards on third and 7, and Anderson run up
the middle for 4 yards on third and 2. The only time the defense
held was on third and goal at the 8.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ran roughshod for 149 yards on 31 carries, a 4.8-yard
average. Stopping him was priority No. 1 heading into the game, and
if that priority had been met, the Patriots would have taken their
chances with Lucas.

NET-BASED LIAISONS IMPROVE ENERGY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How simple it used to be to buy electricity. Your local utility
ran a power plant, maybe bought some power from Canada on summer
afternoons, and every month sent you a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a growing number of states, deregulation and technology
have turned the electric business into a boggling picture of
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Power plants now compete with each other for business. So-called
aggregators representing groups of customers bicker with brokers
and traders to get the best deal. And an hour-by-hour spot market
sets the ultimate price for power.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it has made huge inroads into other types of
business-to-business commerce, the Internet is playing a large and
rapidly growing role in the electricity market. On-line electric
sales will exceed $1 billion this year, and could reach $100
billion within five years, according to Forrester Research of
Cambridge, Mass. US consumers buy about $215 billion worth of
electricity annually, some of it sold under contracts that change
hands several times, pumping up the on-line sales figure.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly household names yet, two companies are playing what
many observers call starring roles in the new world of
Internet-based electric marketing: privately held Enermetrix.com of
Maynard, Mass. and Houston Street Exchange of Portsmouth, N.H., a
unit of BayCorp Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   While aimed at slightly different parts of the market between
power plant and plug, Houstonstreet.com and Enermetrix.com are
offering dramatically more efficient systems for buying and selling
electricity _ and ultimately many other types of energy _ than are
the old-line world dominated by brokers trading phone calls and
faxes all day long.
</P>
<P>
   (Essential.com of Burlington, Mass., meanwhile, is trying to
become a one-stop shopping center for not just electricity but home
heating fuel, telephone, and Internet access, although currently it
acts as a sales agent for only one electric company, New England
Electric System's AllEnergy unit, and only in limited parts of
Massachusetts.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is having an explosive impact on this industry,
and we haven't really seen all the ways that the Internet is going
to act on this industry,'' said Ethan Cohen, an energy consultant
with The Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely estimated that last year $70 billion worth of
electricity was traded, double the amount a year earlier and
probably eight times the 1997 level. (A large fraction of that sum
represents contracts to sell power that changed hands several times
before the producer delivered it.)
</P>
<P>
   About 100 companies have licenses from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to trade electricity in the United States,
and about half of them are active in Northeastern markets.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason these companies even exist is that in
Massachusetts and a growing number of other states, utilities have
been forced out of the power generation business to promote
stronger competition and lower prices for producing electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Edison of today, for example, operates as a regulated
monopoly carrying power from producer to buyer, although virtually
all of the residential power it supplies is through a ``standard
offer'' deal of 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour because little
competition has developed for home customers.
</P>
<P>
   The kinds of deals being made, a growing number through the Net,
can range from a hastily negotiated contract to provide power to
replace a plant that suddenly goes down, to a 12-month pact to
supply a group of municipal governments with their power, to a
purely speculative resale of a pending contract in response to
market-moving weather forecasts or changes in the price of natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Enermetrix, based in the former Digital Equipment complex in
downtown Maynard, likes to compare itself to Sabre, the American
Airlines-owned ticket reservation system that allows travel agents
to compare various flights and fares on different routes.
</P>
<P>
   Through Enermetrix, buyers representing hundreds of companies
can shop around for gas and electric contracts from about 50
suppliers and brokers, then close the deal on line.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Street, in contrast, acts as a ``platform'' for more
than 80 electric suppliers and brokers to make deals among
themselves. Typically it carriers 10 to 15 bids each morning for
different amounts of power at different places for different time
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in the Northeast in early July, Houston Street quickly
expanded by mid-September to cover all 12 major power grids in the
continental United States. It hopes to go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites allow buyers and sellers to negotiate anonymously up
to the point where they strike a deal, at which point they are
responsible for settling accounts and paying a fee to Enermetrix or
Houston Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing like crazy,'' said Enermetrix chief executive
John Gaus, who predicts his company will double its current
40-person employment roster within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company has received $6 million in venture capital financing
and is halfway toward amassing a third round of $20 million in
venture investment, Gaus said. Customers buying electricity through
Enermetrix-arranged deals include the Pittsburgh airport, Benjamin
Moore Paints, and about 11,000 Connecticut businesses that have
formed a buying group. Enermetrix said customers typically save 19
percent on their power bills.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other dot-coms that launch a concept and then try to
find customers, Enermetrix was founded in 1995 as North American
Power, brokering deals by fax and phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We developed the business first and then found a great tool to
do our business through the Internet'' starting in January 1998,
said company president Jeff DeWeese, a former Boston Edison
engineer who cofounded the company with Gaus. ``It's like comparing
e-mail to the Post Office, the efficiencies are so dramatic,''
DeWeese said.
</P>
<P>
   Within several months, Gaus said, Enermetrix will add coal, fuel
oil, gasoline, and other energy products to its market. It also has
plans to expand to Europe, Japan, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Houston Street chief Frank W. Getman Jr. said, ``We've
basically created a great plaform for trading whatever the hell you
want to trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Enermetrix currently views itself as having no direct
competition, to some extent by design. ``They've been kind of a
sleeper so far in terms of marketing,'' said The Yankee Group's
Cohen, particularly in contrast to Houston Street, which made a big
splash at a recent energy industry convention with a sweepstakes
giving away a Cobra sportscar.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Street, based in offices near the Pease International
Jetport, is battling for business with so-called proprietary
systems offered by Altra Energy, Bloomberg, and Enron. Their
systems generally require people to buy software or special trading
devices before they can start doing deals. Houston Street, in
contrast, merely requires a customer to open an account and have a
computer that can get on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   However, Getman said, ``Our real competition is the phones,
trying to break the inertia and get people off the phones and onto
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Street takes a sliding-scale fee of 1 to 2 cents per
megawatt-hour traded, reduced as the volume traded increases. While
it sounds paltry, given that some 3 billion megawatt-hours were
traded in 1998, had Houston Street been able to handle every one of
those traded, it could have grossed over $30 million. And trading
volume is projected to explode.
</P>
<P>
   In its first four weeks, Houston Street said it handled 270,000
megawatt-hours of deals (worth about $2,500 in commissions), but
since then it has declined to publicize trading figures.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies face a Catch-22, in that more companies will not
sign up to participate until more companies have signed up and
participate. Gaus said his sense is that ``Houston Street gets a
lot of traffic from people looking at prices, but they don't get a
lot of people doing deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob LaRochelle, a Virginia-based energy trader who works for
Central Vermont Public Service, said of Houston Street, ``It's a
pretty slick site,'' but said he probably does barely 10 percent of
his deals through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically there just needs to be more people being active on
it,'' LaRochelle said. ``Like anything, it takes time for people to
get comfortable with it.'' LaRochelle still makes heavy use of a
``squawk box'' on his desk where traders call out offers during the
day, and is leery of posting bids on too many computer systems in
case he suddenly needs to yank them back because electric prices
have soared or plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, The Yankee Group's Cohen said Enermetrix is like a
Sabre airline reservation system that only has three or four
airlines. Enermetrix now counts 50 so-called sell-side members _
suppliers of electric and natural gas _ and seven buyers who
collectively represent thousands of businesses. Buyers include AEP,
Control Solutions, Scana, Unitil, and the 11,000-member Connecticut
Business Industrial Association.
</P>
<P>
   Unitil, the Hampton, N.H., parent of Fitchburg Gas &AMP; Electric
and two small southern New Hampshire utilities, is both a heavy
user and a financial backer of the site.
</P>
<P>
   While most New England utilities have been swept up in a
frenzied drive to merge, Unitil chief executive Robert G.
Schoenberger said he is far more interested in exploiting the
capacities of Enermetrix to get new customers than in merging with
a bigger utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a real role for a company to help
customers negotiate their way through this maze of services and
offers,'' Schoenberger said. ``What customers are telling us is,
`We don't care if you own the pipes and wires _ we want the
service.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be on the side of the industry where the most
innovation is going to come from, and I don't think it's the
hard-assets side,'' Schoenberger said. ``We want to own the
customer relationship.''

NET-RELATED IPOS LEAD IN THE QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten companies New England launched their intial public offerings
between July and September, but investors were seriously enamored
with just three of them, sending their stock prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   And what does the trio have in common? The Internet and the
World Wide Web, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Engage Technologies Inc. of Andover, Mass. has seen its shares
more than triple to 47 7/8, after raising $82.4 million at $15 a
share on July 20. The company, which provides Internet marketing
services, has seen its market valuation soar to more than $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Engage went public, ART Technology Group of
Cambridge, Mass., which provides a suite of Internet customer
relationship management and e-commerce software, raised $54.8
million in its IPO. Not only has its stock price soared from its
$12 offering to close at 67 3/16 Friday, but five days ago the
nine-year-old company successfully launched a second public
offering, selling 4.5 million shares, raising $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   SilverStream Software Inc., may be considered the most
successful of the trio, based on the rise of its stock. In its
mid-August IPO, it sold three million shares at $16 each and
watched its price nearly double in the first day of trading. Since,
it hit a high of 94 last Wednesday, and closed at 80 on Friday. The
three-year-old, Burlington, Mass. company develops Internet
software that helps firms create their own e-commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the other seven companies have also seen their stock
prices rise since their IPOs. The largest offering by far was
Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. of South Portland,
Maine, which was spun out as a separate company from National
Semiconductor Corp. in a management-led buyout in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In early August Fairchild, one of Maine's largest corporations
with 8,000 employees, sold 20 million shares at $18.50 each,
netting $345 million after underwriter fees. Shares closed Friday
at 26, giving Fairchild a $2.3 billion market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   The only two IPO companies whose shares have declined are both
nontechnology firms. Cambridge-based Biopure Corp. raised nearly
$38 million at $12 a share, but has since seen its stock fall,
closing Friday at 10 5/8. The biopharmaceutical firm has developed
an emergency blood substitute for dogs and is developing another
blood product for people.
</P>
<P>
   The second, Yankee Candle Co., is a 30-year-old business that
raised $97.5 million. Despite reaching profitability this year, its
stock has seen a modest decline from its IPO price of 18, closing
Friday at 15 7/8. Based in Whately, Mass., the company has 85
stores in 26 states, including its South Deerfield, Mass. emporium
that attracts 2.5 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overall climate clearly shows that IPOs are back in
fashion. In last year's third quarter, only six firms went public.

NET START-UPS DRAW LOTS OF VENTURE CAPITAL IN 3D QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet start-ups and high-speed communications firms accounted
for more than two-thirds of the $926.7 million venture capitalists
poured into New England companies over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   That hefty third-quarter investment total was below the record
$1.07 billion set in the second quarter. Still, it was almost 70
percent higher than the $550.8 million invested in the year-ago
quarter, according to the Boston Globe/PricewaterhouseCoopers Money
Tree survey.
</P>
<P>
   Between July and September, 113 New England companies, most of
them in Massachusetts, received venture funding, with the region
accounting for 10 percent of nationwide investments. High-speed
communications and software and information services _ the latter
dominated by business-to-business Internet companies rather than
those aimed at consumers _ accounted for more than half of those
113 deals, and for nearly 71 percent of the $926.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers made New England second to Silicon Valley in
funding, which reported $3.324 billion in 298 companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the East Coast as a whole is catching up. The New York
metropolitan area ($688.5 million in 68 deals) and the
Washington/Baltimore metropolitan area ($638.1 million in 61 deals)
both made significant gains, mostly from one or two large deals.
The increased funding in those regions was predominantly due to
business-to-business Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, venture capital investment in the third quarter rose
to a record $9.04 billion, far exceeding the previous record of
$7.64 billion in the second quarter and 138 percent higher than the
$3.79 billion recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, in the first nine months of 1999 venture capital
investments nationally amounted to more than $21 billion, compared
to about $14 billion for all of 1998, noted Patrick M. Gray, a
partner in the PricewaterhouseCoopers Global Technology Industry
group.
</P>
<P>
   The summer period is usually when venture capital funding slows
down. But this year the pace remained hot, as 993 companies
nationwide received funding, compared to 707 a year ago. At the
same time, average funding per company increased 70 percent to $9.1
million, compared with $5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further evidence that technology is driving the US
economy: technology companies added to the Dow Jones industrials,
the Nasdaq breaking 3000, a selective but strong IPO market, and
venture capital filling the pipeline with the companies of the
future,'' said Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies are changing their focus. In the crowded
business-to-consumer Internet arena, firms need access to millions
of customers, many of whom are impulse buyers shopping for
relatively low-priced items, and with a random chance of becoming
repeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the business-to-business model operates quite differently.
Generally, corporate customers spend a lot more money, with formal
contracts and terms and high expectations for customer service.
While consumers often deal directly with an electronic commerce
provider, such as Amazon.com, the business-to-business marketplace
often relies on intermediaries _ companies that perform a variety
of sales and marketing functions for an e-commerce provider.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest of those intermediaries to receive funding in
the third quarter was MarketSoft Corp. of Lexington, Mass., a
40-employee firm whose customers include Compaq Computer Corp. and
Covad Communications, a provider of high-speed communications
services to businesses. The 20-month-old company, led by founder
and chief executive Greg Erman, received $15.25 million in
second-round funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned down $10 million more,'' said Erman, who nearly
three years ago sold Waypoint Software, an Internet company he
founded, to Open Market Inc. of Burlington, Mass. ``The
business-to-business space is heating up, as the amount of money
available has increased exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet intermediary, Bow Street Software Corp. of
Portsmouth, N.H., is attracting significant attention trying to
automate some of the selling processes and provide directory
services. Initially funded by Silicon Valley venture capital
powerhouse Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &AMP; Byers, Bow Street garnered
$20 million in funding in the third quarter. The company, whose
software costs $250,000 per year, recently helped an insurance
company's sales force get policy quotes to its customers over the
Internet in 10 minutes as opposed to three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that the Internet has done what a lot of people
predicted in commoditizing transactions for consumers,
business-to-business is infinitely harder, because you build
long-term relationships,'' said Jack Surface, Bow Street cofounder
and chairman. ``You are measured more for the services you provide
to customers, since the products you are selling are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Bow Street boasts a dozen major corporate clients, including
Federal Express, the Sabre airline reservation unit of AMR Corp.,
A. C. Nielsen, and Nortel, plus partnerships with IBM, Microsoft,
Oracle, and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Surface and others say that within five years,
business-to-business companies will command 80 percent of Internet
usage, with just 20 percent for business-to-consumer.
</P>
<P>
   For the Internet to remain robust, higher-speed switching
hardware and software will be needed. Of the $926.7 million raised
in the quarter, nearly $330 million went to companies such as Avici
Systems of North Billerica, Mass., which raised $44 million from
eight venture firms in a third-round financing.
</P>
<P>
   Not far behind are five companies that each raised more than $20
million. One of those is iBasis Inc., which received $25.1 million
in mezzanine financing this summer, only to launch an initial
public offering Nov. 10. Its stock has already more than doubled,
from 16 a share to a 34 3/4 close Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller amounts went to several niche companies such as
eTang.com Inc. of Concord, Mass., which received $4.5 million in a
first-round financing to develop an Internet portal from mainland
China, and HighWired.com, which raised $7 million to focus on
developing an on-line network for public and private high schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest investment in the third quarter went to
StorageNetworks Inc. of Waltham, Mass., among the early leaders of
firms providing on-line data storage services to large
corporations. The firm received $50 million in second-round
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable third-quarter investments:
</P>
<P>
   --Shuttle America Corp. of Windsor Locks, Conn., which recently
began an air service between Hanscom Field and several Northeast
cities, received nearly $1.5 million in second-round financing.
</P>
<P>
   --Zoots Inc. of Newton, Mass., which provides dry cleaning
services with Internet links in 12 Massachusetts communities,
received $38 million _ the third-largest investment behind
StorageNetworks and Avici Systems.
</P>
<P>
   --iDolls of Manchester, N.H., a spinoff of KidGalaxy Inc.,
received $7 million in first-round financing to market children's
dolls over the Internet, from Stardust Classics to the
top-of-the-line Gotz collection from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly $60 million was invested in six biotechnology companies
_ the highest amount since the fourth quarter of 1997 _ led by a
$19 million second-round financing for Variagenics Inc. of
Cambridge, which is studying genetic variations to develop more
personalized drugs. Nationally, New England's biotechnology
investments were second to the $81.2 million invested in Silicon
Valley biopharmaceutical firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotechnology start-ups are not growing in other parts of the
country other than New England and Silicon Valley,'' said Gray of
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter survey results were based on a package of
questionnaires, with a follow-up fax and telephone survey in which
504 venture capitalists participated, representing a 62 percent
final response rate, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.

WOLFEISMS; POOR SPORTS; SHERMAN'S BAD RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To call Tom Wolfe a peerless social observer is to get it only
half right, if the term observer implies a sociological neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the man in the white suit such fun to read is
that his technicolor descriptions of the contemporary scene are
salted with withering opinions. Wolfe is at it again in this
month's edition of the British magazine Tatler, this time with a
twist: He appraises the United States at the turn of the millennium
from the perspective of one writing from the future.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of his observations are recycled or updated
versions of previously published Wolfeisms, as when he relocates
the ``Masters of the Universe'' from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.
He argues, as he has for 20 years, that the term ``working class''
is laughably outdated at a time when ``the average electrician,
air-conditioning mechanic or burglar alarm repairman lived a life
that would have made the Sun King blink.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they buy that, future observers will probably
agree with Wolfe's description of America 2000 as a land consumed
by a ``feverish emphasis on sex and sexiness,'' where ``sexual
stimuli bombarded the young so incessantly and intensely, they were
inflamed with a randy itch long before reaching puberty.'' The 21st
century may also be as amused as Wolfe is by some of the silly fads
our intelligentsia succumb to. Here is Wolfe on deconstructionism:
``Oddly, when deconstructionists required appendectomies or bypass
surgery or even a root-canal job, they never deconstructed medical
or dental `truth' but went along with whatever their
board-certified, profit-orientated surgeons proclaimed was the last
word.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sports is anything but a game to those who run it, as we are
reminded yet again in Tennis and Esquire magazines this month.
</P>
<P>
   In Esquire, bicyclist Lance Armstrong describes the ugly
backdrop to one of the best sports stories this year: his comeback
from cancer to win the Tour de France. Armstrong recounts the
coldblooded way his old team discarded him when he was diagnosed
three years ago. No other teams stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought people would be jostling for the chance to be the
good guys, to help with the comeback,'' he says. ``But there were
no good guys. . . . Nobody was really out to give the cancer kid a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong made his own breaks, but it's clear that any illusions
about his sport have been permanently shattered. ``Cycling is so
much chew-'em-up, spit-'em-out, rider du jour _ anybody can be
replaced,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That same principle animated the lords of Wimbledon, who three
decades ago saw nothing wrong with awarding men's champion Rod
Laver nearly three times as much prize money as women's champion
Billie Jean King. But then King was relatively lucky: At smaller
tournaments, men got up to 12 times the prize money women did.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis magazine describes how King, Rosie Casals, and a
redoubtable handful of other players fought to change their world
by forming their own tennis tour in 1970. Within three years, women
were receiving purses equal to men's. An ironic sidelight: The
economic lifeline for the upstart tour came from none other than
Philip Morris, which saw a chance to promote its new cigarette for
women, Virginia Slims. It may have been the last time a cigarette
company played the good guy.

   With irony and cynicism suffusing the newsstands, there's
something invigorating about the near-utopian optimism of Astronomy
magazine's forecast for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy sees big things ahead for the new millennium,
including possibly the discovery of life-bearing planets and the
answer to a couple of questions that have been nagging at me
personally for a while now: ``Where do we come from, and are we
alone in the cosmos?''
</P>
<P>
   According to associate editor Robert Naeye, the answer could
come from a NASA program called Origins that relies on the
so-called Next Generation Space Telescopes. Equipped with a large
mirror and ultrasensitive infrared detectors, these telescopes
apparently will make the Hubble space telescopes look like the
space paperweights Dave Barry says they are. According to Naeye,
the newfangled telescopes will be able to peer so far back in space
and, thus, time that they ``will see the first galaxies assembling
a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.''

   Jarring, isn't it, how quickly science fiction morphs into

<P>
   William Tecumseh Sherman's march through Georgia is one of those
long-ago events that can still start fierce arguments _ and
historian Victor Davis Hanson is likely to start some doozies with
his lucidly argued brief on behalf of Sherman in American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman is seen in many quarters, especially in the South, as a
bloodthirsty barbarian who invented ``total war'' as he terrorized
civilians on a burning path through Georgia to the sea. But Hanson
contends that Sherman has been misunderstood and misrepresented. He
writes that the fierce-visaged general and his 60,000 soldiers
overwhelmingly confined their energies to the destruction of
property, with very few killings or rapes during the march. The
march ``redefined'' the Civil War, in Hanson's view, and saved many
thousands of lives in the South and North alike.
</P>
<P>
   Horrific as the destruction was, the civilians of the South _ as
defenders and economic beneficiaries of slavery _ did not exactly
occupy the moral high ground, Hanson points out: ``Once the free
Southern leadership and its citizenry chose to fight and kill on
behalf of human bondage, the destruction of their private property
. . . took on the logic of retribution and atonement.''

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving is demanding on many levels. First come the
horrible traffic and long lines at the grocery store. Then, the
menu boasts a main course so large, nothing else fits into the
oven. And when the other dishes do go in _ well, it seems like
they're all orange. There are the individual quirks to attend to,
as in family members who like, and expect, certain things. Those
items were probably instituted around the time you were born. Now
that Thanksgiving is held at your house, you're wondering, do you
have to go out and buy marshmallows?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the guest list situation and family dynamics in
general. Let's face it. Not everyone in attendance would be there
if they weren't blood relations. But look at it this way: Almost
everyone in every corner of the country is hosting or attending a
Thanksgiving celebration, and they're going through all of this,
too. Try a little Pollyanna.
</P>
<P>
   Like so: Thanksgiving is a chance to smooth family wrinkles and
eat well. The fall harvest boasts some of the finest cooking
ingredients. And don't worry about the small stuff: Everything will
get cooked or reheated, because you have all day. Tom Turkey is the
most patient guest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to get you through the day.
</P>
<P>
   First, set the table. Do this a couple of days in advance and
make place cards. Position your most accommodating guest next to
your boorish uncle, and try to solve all those other little
personality problems. Don't seat husbands and wives next to each
other, and alternate guests like this: exuberant, bashful,
exuberant, bashful.
</P>
<P>
   Deal with the main course. The most-often-asked question is: How
long does it take to thaw a turkey? In the refrigerator (breast up,
in a pan large enough to hold it), it will take 1 day per 4 pounds.
There are other methods, such as thawing in cold water (see chart),
but we don't recommend thawing in the microwave because it's not
safe. Our advice: Buy a fresh, natural turkey or a kosher turkey.
If you really care about the taste, these do taste better. When the
turkey is done (see accompanying chart), even if it's sooner than
you expected, remove it from the oven and let it sit in a warm
place. It's fine for 1 hour. Turkeys can't be carved right away,
anyway. You need to leave them on the counter for at least 20
minutes so the meat reabsorbs some of its juices, tastes moist, and
carves more smoothly. The best system is to time dinner so the
turkey comes out of the oven 1 hour before the guests arrive, you
can reheat the side dishes, and everyone can have something to
drink (including you).
</P>
<P>
   Now, make turkey stock. Use the neck and giblets from the turkey
and the vegetable scraps from cooking (celery tops, carrot and
onion ends, etc.) to make a pot of rich stock. Add chicken necks
and backs, if you have some in the freezer. Let it simmer for 2
hours. Later, use it for gravy (see recipe) and to moisten
stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Solve the orange vegetable glut and the two-potato dilemma. If
you make a potluck Thanksgiving, assign each guest one of the
classic orange items. At least it won't be you staying up past your
bedtime preparing redundant vegetables. But if you host a meal that
you make all by yourself, choose one or two, and don't make
yourself crazy trying to please everybody (you can't). Certainly
you don't need both pureed squash and mashed sweet potatoes. And
you'd be foolish to offer mashed sweet potatoes along with mashed
white potatoes. Then, of course, you'd have to dispense with
pumpkin pie. Try that, and the family will stage a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Make the mashed potatoes ahead. Except for the turkey, almost
everything on the harvest menu can be made entirely in advance.
Some people maintain that you can't do mashed potatoes ahead, but
here's how. Choose starchy potatoes (Idahos or russets) and mix
them with yellow ones (Yukon gold or Yellow Finn). Boil them in
water and milk (see recipe), then drain and mash them as usual,
adding hot milk and butter. Then pour a thin layer of hot milk onto
your beautiful mashed potatoes. When you reheat them just before
serving, you can stir the potatoes back to their original
fluffiness. It's magic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the green vegetable problem. You owe your guests
something crunchy. Steamed broccoli is a logical accompaniment, but
it's cumbersome to make for more than eight guests. Brussels
sprouts aren't light enough to fit the bill (though they're awfully
good steamed lightly, then sauteed with bacon). Green beans are out
of season, so the quality is undependable. You could offer salad
greens tossed with vinaigrette dressing. Or a cabbage and carrot
slaw with a slightly sweetened vinaigrette (see recipe). We add
lots of scallions and parsley right at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Make enough stuffing. If you want lots of stuffing and some left
over, you really need to make a separate dish in addition to what's
inside the bird. Double whatever you're making to fill the bird,
and put half into a well-buttered baking dish. Just before you
reheat the baking dish of stuffing, moisten the top with a couple
of generous ladles of turkey stock. The top of the stuffing should
brown while the inside remains moist.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the gravy, a nuisance for any cook. Good gravy is great,
so make the effort. The first step is to get the bird out of the
pan. Enlist a guest, roll up your sleeves, and go one, two, three,
heave-ho onto a large, warm platter. Cover the turkey loosely with
foil and set it aside in a warm place. Pour 1 cup of boiling water
into the pan. You don't need to set it over a burner. Simply scrape
up all the sediment on the bottom of the pan. Add another 1/2 cup
of water if necessary. Then tip the contents of the pan into a
saucepan to make the gravy (see recipe). The roasting pan is
cumbersome and, once set over two medium burners, it's a recipe for
wrist burns.
</P>
<P>
   First things first. What do you serve before a meal that is far
too abundant in the first place? You can always do an updated
version of the relish tray. Be sure to include celery hearts,
leaves intact, along with radishes, stems intact. (The French
spread a little butter on their radishes, but they're also
wonderful with kosher salt.) Big green unpitted olives should also
go on the tray, along with a little pot of chutney and a bowl of
crackers, or something heartier, like a roasted caponata or Cheddar
cheese spread.
</P>
<P>
   What about guests who want to bring something? Some cooks are
comfortable assigning recipes, others not. Take your stance and
announce it. If you want help, it's there. If you want to do it all
yourself, there are still bits and pieces your guests can bring:
flowers or fruit for a centerpiece, apple cider, wine, ice. Maybe a
pie. Or a relish for the hors d'oeuvres tray. If you were expecting
something homemade and it isn't, don't say a word or let anyone see
that funny disapproving look. When life gives you seared, fatty
drippings and sediment, remember: Make gravy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
MAKE-AHEAD MASHED POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In general, allow 1 medium potato per person, but on
Thanksgiving, when the table is full of side dishes, you can
stretch a pot of mashed potatoes to serve more people.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 medium potatoes (half Idaho or russet, half Yellow Finn or
Yukon gold)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 cups 1 or 2 percent milk
</P>
<P>
   1 quart whole milk, heated to scalding
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peel the potatoes and cut them into 2-inch pieces. Combine them
in a large pan with water to cover them completely. Add plenty of
salt and the 2 cups of 1 or 2 percent milk. Bring to a boil, lower
the heat, cover the pan, and simmer the potatoes for 15 minutes or
until they are tender. Drain them into a colander.
</P>
<P>
   Return the potatoes to the pan and add 1 cup of the whole milk
with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Sprinkle with plenty of salt and
pepper, and mash the potatoes until they are smooth. Add 1/2 cup
more milk and the remaining butter. Continue mashing until the
potatoes are fluffy. (You can add more butter, if you like.) Add
1/2 cup more milk, if necessary. The potatoes should be exactly the
consistency you like for serving. Taste for seasoning and add more
salt and pepper if necessary.

GIFT IDEAS FOR THE FILM BUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Friday, Nov. 19) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Macho, macho men. They all seem to be coming to DVD. First,
there's Clint Eastwood's ``The Man With No Name Trilogy'' (MGM;
$59.90). The set includes the three Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns
that helped to create Eastwood's tough-guy image _ ``A Fistful of
Dollars,'' ``For a Few Dollars More'' and ``The Good, the Bad, and
the Ugly.'' Leone's expressive style is often over the top, but
that _ and Clint's steely stare _ is what makes these films fun.
</P>
<P>
   While Eastwood went to Italy to become a star, bodybuilder
Arnold Schwarzenegger came to America, where he starred in
``Predator,'' ``Commando,'' ``The Running Man'' and ``Total
Recall,'' which make up ``The Arnold Schwarzenegger Collection''
(Fox; $56.95). All four are top-level action films, especially Paul
Verhoeven's ``Recall'' and John McTiernan's ``Predator.''
</P>
<P>
   McTiernan also directed the first and third entries in the ``Die
Hard Trilogy'' (Fox; $55.95). Starring Bruce Willis as constantly
messed-up but always wisecracking NYPD Detective John McClane, the
three ``Die Hards'' are a treat for those who like puns with their
guns. One caveat: The Eastwood and Schwarzenegger sets have some
extras normally found on DVD, but the ``Die Hards'' don't. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those romantically inclined, there are a number of terrific
DVDs out there. Try a couple of Nora Ephron-directed Tom Hanks-Meg
Ryan films. First, there's the special-edition ``Sleepless in
Seattle'' (TriStar; $27.95), which includes witty commentary by
Ephron and her sister Delia, who was the co-writer, as well as a
featurette on love in the movies and a music video of Celine Dion
and Clive Griffin singing ``When I Fall In Love.'' Then there's
``You've Got Mail'' (Warners; $24.90), which has a host of fun
extras, including commentary by Ephron and producer Lauren
Shuler-Donner, a behind-the-scenes documentary and an interactive
map tour of places visited in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who want a reason to pull out those hankies, on
Dec. 14 Columbia is releasing ``The Way We Were: Special Edition''
($24.95). This 1973 pairing of Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford
even had my dog by the end. This new edition includes commentary by
director Sydney Pollack as well as a 70-minute documentary that
features new interviews with Streisand and Pollack. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``High Noon'' theme song (``Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My
Darlin''') might be the refrain for classic films. Many studios
have been reaching into their vaults and releasing their classics
recently, and when it's done right, it's a joy for film fans. The
remastered ``High Noon'' (Republic Pictures; $24.90) is a stellar
example. The DVD of this Oscar-winning Western, starring Gary
Cooper as a lawman who must make a choice of conscience, includes a
making-of documentary hosted by critic Leonard Maltin that has
interviews with co-star Lloyd Bridges, director Fred Zinnemann and
producer Stanley Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Frank Capra's ``Lost Horizon'' (Columbia;
$27.95) was also remastered. While opinions are mixed about how
great a film it is, the lavish production certainly makes it a
milestone in filmmaking. Included on the DVD is commentary by
critic Charles Champlin and film historian Robert Gitt on the
restoration, and there are three scenes that were cut from the
original release.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you don't have to reach back that far for a classic.
On Nov. 23, Paramount is releasing the collector's edition of
``Chinatown'' ($29.90) to mark the 25th anniversary of this
film-noir homage starring Jack Nicholson. Included on the DVD are
never-before-seen interviews with director Roman Polanski,
screenwriter Robert Towne and producer Robert Evans. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty out there to entertain the kids. Disney is
releasing nine of its classic animated features on DVD in the next
two months, but one of my favorites is ``Mulan'' ($39.99). Based on
a Chinese fable about a young girl who disguises herself as a man
to help her family and her country, ``Mulan'' is both inspiring and
entertaining for adults and kids. Unfortunately, the DVD that
includes some extras like music videos from Christina Aguilera and
Stevie Wonder with 98 Degrees, won't be available until Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The other DVD Disney titles, which are likewise only available
for 60 days, are the wonderful ``Pinocchio,'' ``Lady and the
Tramp,'' ``101 Dalmatians,'' ``Peter Pan,'' ``The Little Mermaid,''
``Lion King II: Simba's Pride,'' ``Hercules'' and ``The Jungle
Book.''
</P>
<P>
   And Warners did a fabulous job of restoring ``The Wizard of Oz''
($24.90) to glorious Technicolor. The DVD even includes a number of
terrific extras. Also newly restored is the Beatles animated film
``Yellow Submarine'' (MGM; $29.98). A treat for kids and boomers,
the DVD has tons of fun features. &QL; 
Tough guys didn't begin with Clint. Gary Cooper was the prototype,
but in the Oscar-winning ``High Noon'' (Republic Pictures; $24.90)
the actor plays a lawman who must make a choice of conscience. This
remastered DVD is a stellar example of how to bring a classic to
life. It includes a making-of documentary hosted by critic Leonard
Maltin that has interviews with co-star Lloyd Bridges, director
Fred Zinnemann and producer Stanley Kramer.

<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 green bell peppers, cored and seeded
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches scallions, finely sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 head parsley, leaves removed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Use a food processor, mandoline, or chef's knife to shred the
cabbage. In a food processor or on a box grater, shred the carrots.
Transfer both to a large bowl, sprinkling the layers with salt. Let
the vegetables stand for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cut the peppers into the thinnest possible 2-inch
strips.
</P>
<P>
   Lift the cabbage mixture from the bowl, leaving the liquid
behind, and transfer the vegetables to a clean bowl. Add the green
peppers, cider vinegar, sugar, and canola oil. Add plenty of black
pepper to taste. Use tongs or clean hands to toss the cabbage
mixture so it is well mixed. Cover tightly and refrigerate
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, add the scallions and parsley. Taste for
seasoning and add more salt and pepper if you like. Transfer to a
serving dish, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside at
room temperature until serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
TURKEY GRAVY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before transferring the turkey to the oven, scatter 2 halved
onions, 2 halved carrots, and a stalk of celery around the bird.
Add 1 cup of water to keep the vegetables from drying out, though a
little burn is OK. The caramelization will give your gravy some
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drippings from 1 roast turkey
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1 1/2 cups boiling water
</P>
<P>
   3 cups turkey or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 cup red or white wine, brandy, or port
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cornstarch or arrowroot mixed with 1/3 cup cold
water (stir again just before using)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After you lift the bird from the roasting pan, set the pan in a
heatproof place where it will sit firmly. Add 1 cup of the boiling
water and scrape the bottom of the pan until you release all the
sediment. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of water if necessary. Tip the
contents of the pan into a saucepan (including the vegetables),
scraping the bottom well. Add the turkey stock and bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pan from the heat. Tip it slightly. Use a large metal
spoon to discard the fat from the surface of the liquid. There is
no way to shortcut this; just take your time.
</P>
<P>
   Return the saucepan to the heat and let it bubble steadily. As
the mixture boils, notice little pools of fat on the surface.
Continue skimming until the liquid is free of fat. Add the wine,
brandy, or port with salt and pepper. Simmer the mixture, stirring
occasionally, for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Use tongs to remove the onion, carrot, and celery from the
sauce. Taste the mixture for seasoning and add more salt and pepper
if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the cornstarch or arrowroot mixture with the water. Stir
half the cornstarch mixture into the boiling gravy and when it
thickens, see how you like the consistency. If you want the gravy
thicker, add the remaining cornstarch. Simmer the sauce for 2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the gravy into a sauceboat or bowl and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10.

UNLOVED STOCKS MISS THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them the unloved.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market continues to zoom ahead and the prices of
many individual issues climb to dizzying heights, some other
companies can't get the time of day from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Rate the public companies of Massachusetts by their price in
relation to profits and you would find a predictable collection of
troubled companies on the last rungs of the ladder, such as
Carematrix Corp. shares trading at less than three times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of other companies with no earnings
disasters or serious balance-sheet blemishes near the bottom, too.
Does that make them a screaming buy? Probably not to the degree you
might expect.
</P>
<P>
   Those unloved are mostly financial stocks of different stripes:
local thrifts, a regional brokerage, and an investment management
firm tied to a big insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Their stocks are often down compared with recent years. But they
are palest in comparison to the rest of a stock market that has
been propelled to unusually high valuations by very aggressive
expectations for growth.
</P>
<P>
   A passel of smaller Massachusetts thrifts, including Hingham
Institution for Savings, Medford Bancorp, and Andover Bancorp, all
trade near or even below 10 times trailing earnings, according to
Bloomberg News data.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Freedom Securities, the Boston-based brokerage and
investment banking firm, can be purchased for around 10 times
earnings recorded in the last year. The same is true for Liberty
Financial Cos., the Boston investment firm majority-owned by
Liberty Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a startling point of comparison: We count seven local
companies each with a stock market value of more than $500 million
that trade north of 100 times trailing earnings. (Kopin Corp. is
tops with a stock trading about 867 times earnings.) That doesn't
even take into account mega-popular small companies with no
price-earnings ratio because they have no profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many cheap stocks are even inexpensive compared with their own
prices of recent years. But often, the gap is less impressive than
it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the local thrift stocks trade around 10 times earnings.
That price-to-earnings ratio was about 14 two years ago and
typically hit a high of about 17 somewhere in the intervening
period.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity among thrifts tended to push most of those
stocks up at the time and those opportunities, though far from
dead, are fewer today.
</P>
<P>
   Go back further in time, and the average thrift stock price
looks a lot more like today's valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average thrift stock is cheap historically speaking over
the near term,'' said analyst James Ackor of Freedom Securities.
``But on a longer time horizon, they're not way out of whack. I
think there's some money to be made owning these stocks, but you're
not going to see the doubles like you once did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackor's pick among the unloved local thrifts: First Essex
Bancorp of Andover.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem for the unloved stocks: Their lower-growth
reputation is a true stigma in today's market, and it isn't going
to change soon.
</P>
<P>
   But investors who purchase stocks on the other end of the
spectrum, where prices are highest, face an entirely different kind
of dilemma. Some of those stocks will soar further, but many more
are likely to lose ground or melt down entirely.
</P>
<P>
   We tracked down 13 Massachusetts companies that were trading at
a minimum of 50 times earnings two years ago, a very heady
price-earnings multiple at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 13 have lost money since then and five have given up
more than half their value. The biggest winner in that go-go crowd:
Sapient Corp., which appreciated 570 percent. (Some companies with
no earnings at the time scored even bigger gains, such as CMGI Inc.
of Andover and its 3,633 percent appreciation.)
</P>
<P>
   All of the most expensive stocks of two years ago had appealing
high-growth stories and analyst forecasts to support them. But
picking which companies could grow fast enough to make good on such
projections and not stumble wouldn't have been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that get the big price-earnings multiples are
typically younger companies that have to prove they have a business
strategy that is scalable and can be met,'' said Barbara Friedman,
manager of the John Hancock Mid Cap Growth fund. ``It's a very
difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   Our question: If most of the stocks trading at more than 50
times earnings two years ago have failed to appreciate since then,
what's likely to happen to the seven priced at 100 times profits
today?

<P>
   Once again, it's time for our favorite holiday recipes. We have
run this column every year in the Thanksgiving issue. It's a twofer
column _ it makes the readers happy and it makes my holidays a
little easier. Thanks so much.
</P>
<P>
   This year we've added a recipe, one for Christmas pickles that
was entered in a recipe contest by Lori J. Bennett a few years ago.
Make them, or make Marty Aronowitz's fruitcake, or whip up a batch
of fudge, and let the scents of the season begin.
</P>

<P>
   TEXAS CHRISTMAS PICKLES
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1 gallon
</P>
<P>
   1-gallon jar of dill pickles
</P>
<P>
   5-pound bag sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 small bottle Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Drain all juice from pickles and discard. Slice pickles
lengthwise and place in jar. Add Tabasco and garlic. Add about
one-third of the sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Screw lid back on jar tightly, so no juice will leak out. Gently
tip jar back and forth several times to allow sugar and spices to
mix with pickles. Leave on counter at room temperature for about a
week.
</P>
<P>
   As sugar dissolves, add more until all sugar is used. Gently tip
jar back and forth daily to allow sugar and spices to mix.
</P>
<P>
   When all sugar is absorbed, pickles will be dark green and
crispy. Serve on platter with sliced vegetables.

   Fort Worth's favorite fruitcake: Marty Aronowitz shared this
recipe with the Star-Telegram in 1964. He died in 1986, but we
repeat this recipe every year with memories of all the pounds of
fruitcake he made, and the city made, with his recipe. Don't expect
a cakelike consistency; this is a chewy fruitcake combination.

<P>
   CINNAMON ORNAMENTS
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white glue, see note
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 cups water (less on humid days)
</P>
<P>
   Note: Elmer's Glue can be used, but don't use Elmer's School
Glue, because it is designed to be washed out of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients and mix well. The mixture should be a
consistency that can be kneaded.
</P>
<P>
   After kneading, roll out mixture to about 1/4-inch thickness.
Cut with cookie cutters. Dip fingers in water before smoothing any
rough edges. While ornament is still wet, stick in a straw near the
top of cut-out shape to make a hole for a ribbon to hang finished
decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Ornaments need to air-dry slowly and should be turned twice a
day. Avoid putting decorations under air vents _ drying too quickly
can cause them to crack. Drying takes 2 days to a week, depending
on humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon ornaments can be decorated with acrylic paint. Don't go
overboard with paint or you will smother the cinnamon smell.
Ornaments can be saved from one year to the next. Brushing with
cinnamon oil will rejuvenate the cinnamon smell annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We all love our rituals, especially this time of year. Soon
those hideous turkey-shaped candlesticks will get dusted off, trees
will get trimmed in the same manner, holiday presents opened in the
same order, with the same sort of fanfare. Rituals are universal,
and they run the gam-
</P>
<P>
   ut from simple to sublime.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet cup of coffee to get the day started. A religious rite,
like attending Sunday Mass. Or a cultural rite of passage, like a
bar or a bat mitzvah for a 13-year-old. It could be inherited or
invented. Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, for example, is a
veritable cuckoo clock of rituals, stepping up to the bat in a
particular rhythm, tugging at his batter's
</P>
<P>
   gloves in between pitches, scraping his feet in the batter's box
just before the ball is thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rituals provide time for the mind to become quiet and the body
to relax,'' says Oregon psychologist Marilyn Sorensen, author of
``Breaking the Chain of Low Self-Esteem,'' which touts the use of
ritual in daily life. ``They keep our personal goals in focus and
maintain peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the 20th century, peace of mind can mean
something different than it did even a decade ago. Not
surprisingly, contemporary rituals have evolved to meet
contemporary needs. Here are four examples.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Releasing distractions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Tecce's life is full of distractions. The car radio. Voice
mail. E-mail. Those noisy boomboxes, which he regards as ``one of
the worst inventions in the world.'' But he is not a man to suffer
distraction gladly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have this constant emotional stirring,'' says
Tecce, who teaches psychology at Boston College. ``If we are
bombarded with information every minute of the day, how can we ever
reflect on who we are, and what's meaningful in our lives?''
</P>
<P>
   So Tecce has devised what he calls ``a ritual of meditation,''
which, he says, controls the distractions in his life and improves
his ability to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a day _ once before breakfast and again before dinner _
Tecce closes the door, shuts off the lights, and meditates for 30
minutes. But unlike more traditional meditation techniques, which
strive to focus a person's attention, this so-called
distraction-meditation allows the mind ``to wander all over the
place and let out the distractions that you've been suppressing all
day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual is based on research results he has published,
showing that distractions interfere with brain activity. ``The goal
is to allow the distractions, which typically dribble in and out of
your consciousness all day, to come with full force and intensity
in a short period of time,'' says Tecce. ``Then they will be less
likely to crop up during unwanted moments during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   He has taught the technique to his students (more than 3,700 of
them so far, he estimates), and he begins and ends each class he
teaches with a 10-minute meditation ritual. A faithful practitioner
of this ritual for 25 years, Tecce says it has increased his
ability to work intensively, quickly, and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he knows it contradicts conventional American lifestyle
practices. ``Society says, `Don't just sit there; do something.' ''
Tecce, on the other hand, advocates the act of simply sitting
there. Doing so, he says, represents ``a declaration of
independence from a busy and demanding world.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The power of prayer
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Wray, 53, is not a religious man, at least not in the
conventional sense. The retired Framingham, Mass. businessman and
Y2K expert was raised in both the Catholic and Baptist faiths, and
today, he says, ``I'm not a great believer in organized religion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does believe in a higher power, which he feels ``is there
for those who seek it. If you prefer to go through life struggling
on your own, so be it. But my belief system says there is a power
there that is yours for the asking.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Wray asks. For more than 30 years he has conducted what
he calls a daily ``ritual of prayer,'' which he practices no matter
where he is and which enables him to ``tap into this power. I not
only ask for support but also offer thanks for assistance given.''
Every night at bedtime, he asks his God _ out loud _ to ``let me
wake up tomorrow'' and offers his thanks for what has happened
during the day. He is careful also to add that he is ``looking
forward to tomorrow.'' Every morning he says, ``Thank you for
letting me wake up this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If perchance I forget one day, I will apologize, because I
truly believe we are given permission to live on this earth, and
that we can't take it for granted,'' Wray says.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual is in keeping with his take on modern life. ``I have
a very positive outlook on life. I believe that everything will be
OK for those who are prepared. I guess that extends to my feelings
regarding the year 2000,'' says Wray, a former IBM marketing
executive who now does consulting on career and business management
for Levy Wray and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've researched it. I have gotten my documents together and
paid up my bills. I have alternative sources of heat and light.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this, he says, ``is empowering.'' As is prayer. ``I never
think there is a situation that will come up in which my God will
not either take care of me, or use it as a lesson.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Female celebration
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Amy Rewakowski was going through ``a
particularly tragic year'' of poor health and high stress. ``I had
many, many losses,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have made it without my friends,'' says Rewakowski
of Boston, now 34. ``They offered moral support and tangible,
concrete support, like bringing food.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was better, she decided to thank her friends by
inviting them to her home for a potluck gathering. To help break
the ice, since her friends didn't all know one another, she asked
each one to bring something ``symbolic of where they were in their
lives.'' Pictures of their children. Poems they had written.
Rewakowski, an artist and an administrator, made everyone a
thank-you gift.
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise, she found the impact of the event deeply
powerful _ and a ritual was born. ``A heartfelt connection
developed between the women,'' she says. ``These were women who had
been through a lot of changes and loss and self-searching, and they
all realized they weren't alone.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the gathering Circle of Friends. Today, it has
evolved into an annual tradition she describes as ``a celebration
of the power and empathy of women's friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a year, Rewakowski invites her friends back, always
choosing a theme such as ``gratitude'' or ``changes in our lives''
or ``celebrating the unknown.'' The Circle of Friends _ as many as
20 of them, between the ages of 21 and 40 _ come from as far away
as Ohio and the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start the circle and welcome people, and have people share
on the theme if they want to,'' says Rewakowski. After each woman
has spoken, she lights a candle and sets it in the center, where it
joins those lit for the others. ``It's as though, symbolically, we
are not in darkness anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes deliberate effort for her highly mobile generation,
says Rewakowski, to build communities. ``A real sisterhood of
friendship'' doesn't evolve naturally from neighborhoods or
villages. ``It's these simple but important things that keep us
human and keep us together,'' she says. ``It's a way of being
nurtured, like a massage, but it's something free, and something we
can count on.''
</P>
<P>

Power breakfast
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lee used to live in New Hampshire. And in California, and
Germany, then California again, Switzerland, Germany again, New
York, and Pennsylvania _ all in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others in academia, ``I've moved around constantly,''
says Lee, 33, an assistant professor of sociology at Penn State's
Du Bois campus. ``My limit for being in the same spot is two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his peripatetic lifestyle, he developed a knack for coping
with change of any sort. But there is one change he can't abide:
``My breakfast ritual,'' says Lee. ``My breakfast always has to
have the same ingredients. I can tolerate a weird lunch or dinner,
but without this breakfast, my day is shot. I get hungrier faster,
I'm not as relaxed, and unpredictable things are harder to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just any old ingredients go into this breakfast _ an
oatmeal-based cereal concoction made with yogurt, fruit, and nuts
inspired by the breakfasts he ate in Europe. All have been
carefully selected _ and painstakingly accumulated. Each component
represents an earlier time and place in Lee's life.
</P>
<P>
   The oat groats, which his grandfather taught him to eat and
which he hand rolls each night, are distributed by a Mennonite
farmer in Pennsylvania. (``Why a Mennonite? They have old-fashioned
values that occasionally overlap with mine.'') The raisins and
almonds come from the San Joaquin Valley in California, where he
was born. The yogurt comes from Vermont. And the Ost-Freisen tea is
German.
</P>
<P>
   He considers his breakfast to be ``autobiographical,'' combining
facets of his fragmented personal history into one unified,
predictable whole. ``It's a very postmodern, global thing,'' says
Lee, who studies rituals as a sociologist. ``Every time I move I
add something that really seemed to impress me in the place I
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the academic, he has analyzed his morning ritual and come
up with a theory for it. ``It speaks to the need for constancy and
stability when I am constantly bombarded with new things,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   It also speaks to his need to reduce complexity in a society
inundated with choices. ``It simplifies my life in at least one
area,'' Lee says. ``I don't have to think about the procedure
anymore. And when I'm done, I can start anything, no matter where I
am, because I've done this procedure that is so familiar and so old
and so me.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I missed out on the early days of television. I
missed out on Chrysler and Ford. This is a possibility of making
money for life,'' said Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, calling from Los Angeles, was referring to her first
foray into the Internet: her role as an equity partner and
spokeswoman for Flooz.com, an online gift-currency program that was
launched in February.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Goldberg isn't financially comfortable. She says she
does ``OK.'' But her venture into cyberspace could catapult her
into the leagues of the Internet rich. She is exchanging her
celebrity status for an undisclosed amount of stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is in the vanguard of personalities who are being
sought by Internet companies not only for their celebrity value,
but for their ``fit'' with a particular site's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Goldberg, for example, Flooz.com sees someone whose
irreverence and sense of fun are compatible with the Web site's
persona. So far, few celebs have actually been signed, and there
are still many Web sites that are waiting and watching before
moving, but word around the Internet companies is that the momentum
is beginning to build.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, while Flooz was breaking its $8 million national
outdoor and TV ad campaign promoting Goldberg, another Web company
called Estyle Inc. was trumpeting its own celebrity catch: Cindy
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   The startup company, which launched a maternity and baby
products site at address babystyle.com in May, toasted the model
and new mother as its latest board member and strategic consultant
at a party at the W Hotel's Whisky Blue here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to get into it,'' said Crawford, adding that
she had studied other Web opportunities before signing on with the
privately held Estyle for a piece of the company. How big a piece
no one would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside could be huge ... but I'm not looking to buy a Gulf
Stream or anything. This gives me a new dimension to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have started more than a year ago with ``Star Trek''
star William Shatner's radio commercials for Priceline, a Web site
that allows people to bid for airline tickets. And TV ads for
Internet companies have popped up featuring the likes of Geena
Davis and Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet sources expect Goldberg and Crawford, both of whom
see themselves as active business partners in their respective
ventures, could be the real trailblazers in a trend toward a deeper
partnership between celebrity and startup Web firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other startups, including many fashion sites, are now on the
hunt for a household name to act as a spokesman, spokeswoman or
consultant. The goal: to increase market share in an increasingly
competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   They include Beautyjungle.com, a beauty site that wants to hire
an actress or supermodel to star in its February ad campaign, and
Fashion 500, which will be launched early next year and will
include major designer brands.
</P>
<P>
   Others such as Ibeauty.com, Eve.com and Beautyscene.com all say
they are mulling the idea of teaming with a celebrity as an equity
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is very exciting, and the Internet industry has
matured,'' said Lisa Freedman, vice president of marketing at
Styleclick.com, a network of fashion sites. It just signed a deal
to be the e-commerce enabler of Daisy Fuentes.com and other
celebrity sites, and Freedman said she is studying other
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at all kinds of options in terms of how to
bring our celebrity contacts under our umbrella, including having
them participate as spokespeople,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities can take a company in its early stages and
catapult it into large exposure in a short time,'' said Tim Draper,
who runs his own venture capital firm called Draper, Fisher &AMP;
Jurvetson in San Francisco. It is an investor in Estyle.
</P>
<P>
   Already, executives at Flooz and Estyle said they are seeing an
increase in traffic to their site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at us very differently today than before we had
Whoopi,'' said Robert Levitan, co-founder of Flooz, citing a
traffic increase of 35 percent since the launch of the ad campaign
and what it calls its ``Whoopi gizmo'' on its site. The site
features an animated cartoon of Goldberg, promoting certain items.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, who was a co-founder of IVillage network for women,
added, ``Investors are pleased that Whoopi has given us a vote of
confidence. Consumers look at us with more legitimacy, and they
better understand our brand. This will be our first holiday season
that we are online, and we expect there will be a lot of noise out
there. Whoopi enables us to get above the noise this holiday
season. It helps us to scale faster, and we need to do it this
holiday. We have no time to wait on the Internet. Everything is
urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Estyle founder and chief executive officer Laurie
McCartney, nabbing Crawford has helped ``increase momentum'' in
only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase in our traffic,'' McCartney said. ``And
while it is partly due to our increasing our styles on the site,
Crawford has attracted a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The site features Cindy's Corner, where the model dispenses
style advice on maternity and baby clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is under intense pressure,'' said Lars Kry, vice
president of marketing at Beautyjungle.com, which officially
launches next month. ``It is so important to establish yourself
with an upscale image.''
</P>
<P>
   Kry added that Beautyjungle is working with advertising firm
Badger Worldwide to develop a short list of candidates and expects
to find someone within the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like a woman who embraces the values of our customer
... a modern woman who is intelligent and who has a good sense of
humor,'' he said. ``Some celebrities really embrace the idea;
others are apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we interested in celebrities, but celebrities
have been interested in us,'' said Patty Isen, fashion director at
Fashion 500, which has had several meetings with celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to give names, but said that she is focusing on
models turned actresses. She added that she is not sure what kind
of role that person will play, but options include having them
serve on the advisory board or making them part of the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But hiring a big name won't necessarily mean instant success.
Industry sources say that there has to be a strong connection
between a star and the startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the celebrity status will only work if it is
authentic. They have to use celebrities appropriately, and not
overuse them,'' said Judy Newman, a director at Maveron, a venture
capital fund that is an investor in Flooz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, a celebrity will only work if he or she is an
active participant in building a brand presence,'' said venture
capitalist Draper.
</P>
<P>
   Estyle's McCartney, who said she was besieged by Hollywood
agents, believes that Crawford, who gave birth 3 1/2 months ago, is
a perfect fit, who ``really resonates with our consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooz had reportedly been in talks with Lisa Kudrow and Sarah
Jessica Parker, but company officials wanted Goldberg because she
better matched the Flooz attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something magical about her,'' Levitan said. ``Whoopi
is the essence of Flooz. She is funny but smart. She's got attitude
but is dignified. She's on the edge but trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford, said McCartney, ``brings great insight into
fashion and style'' as well as ``great access to vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney added that she was also able to get access to
Crawford's personal stylist, Vivienne Turner, who suggested
featuring certain fashion styles for the pregnant woman: pashmina
shawls, a certain kind of bodyslimmer pantyhose that offers one
clean line, and V-neck cashmere cardigans, with a sexy piece of
lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy also told me about these great baby massage oils and a
baby monitor that we now feature on the Web,'' McCartney said. She
added that she plans to use Crawford in Estyle's other fashion
channels as they roll out, but declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was also helpful in critiquing Estyle's advertising
mockups for its radio campaign, which broke a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us how to make the message clearer,'' McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said that her venture into Estyle is ``like going to
business school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning a lot about how a company goes public, about the
different issues of stock,'' she said, adding that her role as
spokeswoman for Revlon did not allow her to get into the inner
workings of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who said she calls the Flooz office every couple of
days, said she wants to get ``incredibly involved'' with the
company and would like to get a seat on the board. Currently, she
is on the advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Goldberg, whose only other endorsement is for MCI, has
put her own stamp on the Flooz ad campaign, changing copy and
adding funny lines to most of the TV spots. The campaign broke on
11 cable networks recently, according to Jack Feuer, marketing
director at Flooz.

`TIMELINE' JOURNEY AMUSING, BUT INCOMPLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TIMELINE 
By Michael Crichton. Knopf, 384 pp., illustrated, $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Timeline,'' Michael Crichton's 12th novel, is slovenly but
sort of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton's literary specialty is to put a new spin on the plots
of old movies. What is ``Jurassic Park'' but ``Godzilla'' with more
up-to-date science? In ``Jurassic Park,'' Crichton brought the
prehistoric world into the 20th century. Now, in ``Timeline,'' he
reverses the process, sending a team of young academic historians
and archeologists back to a time and place earlier in the
millennium: the Perigord, in France, during the Hundred Years' War.
</P>
<P>
   The new spin is that our team returns there through an
application of quantum theory, to which Crichton devotes several
laborious pages of explication. A century ago, Mark Twain had it
easier when he wanted to deliver a Connecticut Yankee to King
Arthur's court _ a blow on the noggin was enough to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason these young people are fighting in the Hundred Years'
War is that they want to rescue their mentor, a Regius professor of
History at Yale, who has sent them a note that he is trapped there,
and dated it 4/7/1357. The reason the professor has gotten back
there is something Crichton keeps to himself for 300 pages, so
there's no point is spoiling the fun by telling you here _ this is
also presumably why all press comment on ``Timeline'' was embargoed
until Tuesday's publication date.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear from the beginning is that the professor and his
students are subsidized by a large, rich, secret corporation with
headquarters somewhere out in the middle of nowhere (Black Rock,
N.M., described as ``one hour north of Albuquerque,'' which is
about where Santa Fe is, and that is far from nowhere). Robert
Doniger, the brilliant founder of the corporation, has some
sinister purpose in view. One of the ways you can tell this is that
he is peremptory when he issues orders to his female assistant,
Diane Kramer. Ultimately, he does reveal his plan, in a speech to
the media, but once the design is out in the open, it hardly seems
worth all the buildup, and besides, readers of Crichton have met it
before, in ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes Crichton quite a while _ 164 pages, in fact _ to lay
the groundwork, some of it red-herring stuff, deliberately
misleading. Or is this simply a case of a first draft that changed
course midway, without ever turning back to fix up the beginning?
Crichton elaborately introduces characters and even plotlines for
which he will have no further use. He sets up a nosy cop named
James Wauneka from Gallup, N.M., for example, to be an antagonist
for Doniger, but then apparently changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   What finally happens when our crew arrives on the shores of the
Dordogne River, near the monastery, the mill, and the opposing
castles, Castelgard and La Roque? Well, they notice straight off
that there is no ambient noise from radio, TV, airplanes, or
passing cars; before long they discover that castle toilets don't
smell all that bad. There are some bad guys, however, that they
should have recognized from their own experience of TV _ Sir Robert
de Kere, for example, or the sneering Sir Guy de Malegant, a black
knight whose name means ``bad glove.'' Our friends try to keep
their mouths shut in an environment where everything is menacing,
but when they have to, they can communicate in English, French,
Latin, or Occitan, begin their sentences with ``Certes,'' and, when
all else fails, take flight. Soon, they are caught up in a 150-page
high-speed chase across historically correct battlements, with lots
of swordfighting, whizzing arrows, and double-dealing, not to
mention a high-spirited beauty named the Lady Claire. The professor
will find it prudent to invent gunpowder, just as Twain's
Connecticut Yankeee did. One of our heroes swings his lance wildly
in the air, ``like a metronome,'' which doesn't swing wildly (and
anyway, Herr Maelzel didn't get around to manufacturing that useful
device until 1816).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's a bad day at Black Rock. Is there any way the
professor and his proteges can make it back to the relative safety
of the 20th century? Will it have to be over Doniger's dead body?
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Crichton has done a fair amount of homework and
supplies a 3 1/2-page historical bibliography as well as an
additional half-page of references to quantum physics; he outlines
some historical facts, and the bare text is adorned with maps,
illustrations, and computer graphics so that the reader can
understand the architecture and structure of castles and mills the
characters are racing around.
</P>
<P>
   All this is fun, but Crichton fails at what should be the most
fun of all: convincingly put the reader back into the Middle Ages.
Instead, it puts the reader back into Errol Flynn movies. Crichton
lists no novels in his bibliography, and the best historical novels
do accomplish what Crichton never even attempts. Looking at
Marguerite Yourcenar's ``The Abyss,'' or any of the novels of Zoe
Oldenbourg, or any of the scrumptious confections of Dorothy
Dunnett, might have helped him show how people thought, believed,
moved through their own landscapes. His characters are only
insubstantial shadows on a screen, and ``Timeline'' is not a novel,
but a shooting script.

   NEW YORK _ ``I missed out on the early days of television. I

<P>
   Already, executives at Flooz and Estyle said they are seeing an
increase in traffic to their site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at us very differently today than before we had
Whoopi,'' said Robert Levitan, co-founder of Flooz, citing a
traffic increase of 35 percent since the launch of the ad campaign
and what it calls its ``Whoopi gizmo'' on its site. The site
features an animated cartoon of Goldberg, promoting certain items.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, who was a co-founder of IVillage network for women,
added, ``Investors are pleased that Whoopi has given us a vote of
confidence. Consumers look at us with more legitimacy, and they
better understand our brand. This will be our first holiday season
that we are online, and we expect there will be a lot of noise out
there. Whoopi enables us to get above the noise this holiday
season. It helps us to scale faster, and we need to do it this
holiday. We have no time to wait on the Internet. Everything is
urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Estyle founder and chief executive officer Laurie
McCartney, nabbing Crawford has helped ``increase momentum'' in
only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase in our traffic,'' McCartney said. ``And
while it is partly due to our increasing our styles on the site,
Crawford has attracted a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The site features Cindy's Corner, where the model dispenses
style advice on maternity and baby clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is under intense pressure,'' said Lars Kry, vice
president of marketing at Beautyjungle.com, which officially
launches next month. ``It is so important to establish yourself
with an upscale image.''
</P>
<P>
   Kry added that Beautyjungle is working with advertising firm
Badger Worldwide to develop a short list of candidates and expects
to find someone within the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like a woman who embraces the values of our customer
... a modern woman who is intelligent and who has a good sense of
humor,'' he said. ``Some celebrities really embrace the idea;
others are apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we interested in celebrities, but celebrities
have been interested in us,'' said Patty Isen, fashion director at
Fashion 500, which has had several meetings with celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to give names, but said that she is focusing on
models turned actresses. She added that she is not sure what kind
of role that person will play, but options include having them
serve on the advisory board or making them part of the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But hiring a big name won't necessarily mean instant success.
Industry sources say that there has to be a strong connection
between a star and the startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the celebrity status will only work if it is
authentic. They have to use celebrities appropriately, and not
overuse them,'' said Judy Newman, a director at Maveron, a venture
capital fund that is an investor in Flooz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, a celebrity will only work if he or she is an
active participant in building a brand presence,'' said venture
capitalist Draper.
</P>
<P>
   Estyle's McCartney, who said she was besieged by Hollywood
agents, believes that Crawford, who gave birth 3 1/2 months ago, is
a perfect fit, who ``really resonates with our consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooz had reportedly been in talks with Lisa Kudrow and Sarah
Jessica Parker, but company officials wanted Goldberg because she
better matched the Flooz attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something magical about her,'' Levitan said. ``Whoopi
is the essence of Flooz. She is funny but smart. She's got attitude
but is dignified. She's on the edge but trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford, said McCartney, ``brings great insight into
fashion and style'' as well as ``great access to vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney added that she was also able to get access to
Crawford's personal stylist, Vivienne Turner, who suggested
featuring certain fashion styles for the pregnant woman: pashmina
shawls, a certain kind of bodyslimmer pantyhose that offers one
clean line, and V-neck cashmere cardigans, with a sexy piece of
lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy also told me about these great baby massage oils and a
baby monitor that we now feature on the Web,'' McCartney said. She
added that she plans to use Crawford in Estyle's other fashion
channels as they roll out, but declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was also helpful in critiquing Estyle's advertising
mockups for its radio campaign, which broke a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us how to make the message clearer,'' McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said that her venture into Estyle is ``like going to
business school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning a lot about how a company goes public, about the
different issues of stock,'' she said, adding that her role as
spokeswoman for Revlon did not allow her to get into the inner
workings of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who said she calls the Flooz office every couple of
days, said she wants to get ``incredibly involved'' with the
company and would like to get a seat on the board. Currently, she
is on the advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Goldberg, whose only other endorsement is for MCI, has
put her own stamp on the Flooz ad campaign, changing copy and
adding funny lines to most of the TV spots. The campaign broke on
11 cable networks recently, according to Jack Feuer, marketing
director at Flooz.

<P>
   When the Spanish actress Penelope Cruz got a call that many
actors wait and wait for, it was she, at the tender age of 18, who
kept the caller waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drying my hair in the toilet, and my boyfriend at the
time told me, `Almodovar is calling.' I said, `Yes, of course,' and
kept drying my hair, thinking he was joking. Finally, I picked it
up after he'd been waiting so long, and he told he wanted me to
audition for `Kika.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz proved too young to play the title role in Almodovar's 1993
film, but the director gave her a small part in ``Live Flesh'' and
eventually offered her a major role in this fall's ``All About My
Mother,'' which debuted to great acclaim at Cannes and opened the
New York Film Festival on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the beautiful Cruz plays against type: She's a nun who's
had an affair with a drag queen, then learns she is pregnant _ and
dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want always to play the pretty woman,'' Cruz says in
her Spanish-tinged English. ``There is always going to be someone
more beautiful. I like to change. I like roles that people don't
recognize me in.''
</P>
<P>
   For his film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel ``All the
Pretty Horses,'' due out next spring, director Billy Bob Thornton
knew right away he wanted Cruz to play the role of a wealthy and
beautiful Mexican girl in love with drifter Matt Damon. The studio,
however, was less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy met me in L.A. one year ago, but for eight months I was
doing tests for the movie. We had to show Columbia that I had
chemistry with Matt, so I flew to Rome, and Anthony Minghella (who
was directing Damon in the upcoming ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'')
directed the audition. We were singing and dancing in that test.
Then we did more tests. Finally, Billy told me I got the part.
Imagine if I hadn't, after all that work!''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who's passing through Los Angeles between Brazil and San
Francisco, where she's shooting ``Woman on Top'' for Fox
Searchlight, adored working with Damon, whom she calls ``very
smart.'' But it was Thornton who won her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great director, actor and writer, and everyone around
him is in awe of him because he does everything, and he does it all
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old actress, who's been working nonstop since she
was 14, has had enough experience to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always very precocious,'' she says. ``I really wanted to
be a dancer, so I went to drama school and danced many hours a day.
Eventually, I had to realize I was getting sick from working too
hard, and I had to choose one career.''
</P>
<P>
   She threw herself headlong into acting. As a teen, she starred
in major European films like ``Jamon Jamon'' and ``Belle Epoque''
and landed her English-language debut last year in Stephen Frears'
``Hi-Lo Country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen `Dangerous Liaisons' 14 times,'' she says. ``It's
one of my favorite movies. When he called me, he came to Madrid,
where I live, and we did only one test. The next day he told me I
had the part. So I was spoiled, because I thought it was going to
be so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Pictures president Amy Pascal describes the actress'
appeal this way: ``Penelope Cruz is very sexy, but not threatening
_ both vulnerable and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz blushes a little bit when she hears the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those things about myself,'' she says. ``I know
I've been coquettish since I was 3 years old. I like clothes and I
like seduction in general, but I am like that with everybody:
children, dogs, men and women. I admit I want people to like me _
who doesn't? But not for just the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she makes clear, she remains loyal to her Czech
boyfriend, an assistant director she met on a European film who
shares her house in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke five languages, but he had to learn Spanish after he
met me. Czech is too difficult! We are very different, but I think
that's good. That Spanish temper is too strong to have two Spanish
people together.''

 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ How could Bill Galvin find 2,100 ``lost'' John
Hancock policyholders in a weekend when the insurer couldn't find
them in a year?
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts secretary of state proved again that he is a
man of exquisite timing with a nose for a headline when, on the eve
of the lone public hearing on Hancock's conversion to a stock
company, his computers were able to churn out the addresses of
policyholders who may be in line to cash in on the public offering.
Those policyholders will now be able to measure in dollars or
Hancock stock just what state government did for them this year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a direct hit for a man who has never minded tossing
spitballs at the powerful. We can only dream what might have been
had Galvin, and not Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt, been
overseeing the conversion of Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock surely has a little egg on its face and some questions
to ask about what it got for the $4 million it spent locating lost
policyholders. But say this much for the state's largest insurer:
It got the most important decision right. After pushing a very bad
law through the Legislature that would have allowed it to form a
holding company and go public without paying its policyholders a
dime, it reversed direction. Instead, it opted for a traditional
demutualization, which will allow the entire worth of the company
to be doled out to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Did Hancock's board really believe a demutualization was the
fair way to go? Or did it come to believe that not even mutual
policyholders, the most docile bosses any executive ever had,
wouldn't swallow the too-good-to-believe holding company farce? In
the end, what matters is that Hancock did the right thing. Now what
about you, Massachusetts Mutual?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday a sea of gray suits was expected to pack the hearing
on Hancock's conversion plan. Hancock's chairman, Stephen Brown,
will speak, followed by a series of executives who will testify why
the conversion is good for the company and its 2.8 million
policyholders. Then a string of consumer activists will tell us how
Brown &AMP; Co. are cheating those same policyholders out of what is
their's.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance is all about trust; we give our money to them,
trusting the insurers will stand by their promises. But in the past
few years that trust has been badly damaged. Company after company
has paid dearly to settle charges of deceptive sales practices _
Hancock among them, agreeing to provide policyholder benefits worth
$350 million or more to atone for its misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Should we now trust Hancock and other insurers like it to do the
right thing in the most important financial transaction in their
history, converting to a public company? Only if we keep their feet
to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance division's hearings will focus on issues that no
human being, only an actuary, could love. Should we use the
historic or historic plus prospective method in determining which
policyholders should get what? Why aren't variable life
policyholders eligible? Slightly more accessible is the question of
whether policyholders should get cash or stock.
</P>
<P>
   There are few right or wrong answers in this world, only
actuarial opinions that can range all over the lot. But the stakes
are huge: This is a world where hundreds of millions can be shifted
from one group of policyholders to another with the shift of one of
those opinions.
</P>
<P>
   How to feel safe in this arcane world? Let the light shine in.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance is infamous for its nondisclosure culture, both by the
companies and the regulators themselves. There is far too much time
negotiating with corporate executives behind closed doors, far too
much effort spent keeping the gadflys at arms' length. Regulators
might not want to admit it, but their little toy departments are
sadly outgunned by the industry they are trying to oversee. Love
them or hate them, Jason Adkins, Joe Belth and the others like them
are regulators' natural allies, not the enemies they make them.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Galvin just showed how one gadfly can make a difference.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Four Times Square, a new 48-story office tower, looks much like
any other modern skyscraper in the heart of New York City. But the
top 11 floors of the sleek glass exterior are unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The building's fashionable, light-blue skin contains an array of
electricity-generating solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a bank of giant fuel cells
lurking on the fourth floor, silently turning natural gas into
power. Four Times Square is its own freestanding environmentally
friendly electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as corporate dealmakers and the general public
understand the value of these kinds of buildings, they're going to
insist on them,'' predicts Bob Fox, the building's lead architect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edison's first lightbulb, an increasing number of people
have tied their energy fulfillment needs to the grid of
interconnected power lines. Now the trend is reversing, and
do-it-yourself power is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Local blackouts and Y2K anxieties have home owners and office
managers alike worrying about a power-grid failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, freestanding energy sources are getting
cleaner, cheaper and prettier. They can even be money-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states now require utilities to use net metering, which
allows consumers who generate their own power to cut their energy
bills by selling back any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, many buildings could sport solar cells on the roof,
natural-gas turbines and fuel cells in the basement and a link to a
wind turbine up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most dramatic changes have popped up in solar power,
long dismissed as visually unappealing and impractically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Architects who once shunned bulky blue solar panels are
marveling at solar cells incorporated discreetly into the surface
of roofing shingles, windows, skylights and wall facades.
</P>
<P>
   Misawa Homes of Japan, that nation's largest home builder,
recently showed off its spare, modernist Eco Energy House, which
turns its solar accoutrements into elegant design elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, President Clinton has launched the Million
Solar Roofs Initiative to get solar-energy tiles on the tops of 1
million buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prices keep dropping. Two decades of engineering
sweat have brought solar electricity costs down to an average of 20
cents per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   In sunny cities like San Diego, an equivalent flow of
conventional electricity during peak daytime hours can cost as much
as 28 cents, says Nancy Bacon, senior vice president of Energy
Conversion Diversion in Troy, Mich. At night, solar homes in San
Diego can switch to power from the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   First Solar in Toledo, Ohio, is starting to grow transparent
solar cells directly onto glass panes during their manufacture, at
a total cost only slightly higher than that of conventional glass.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, a typical glassmaker rolls out 600 tons of panes for
use in buildings. If just one plant were converted for making solar
glass following First Solar's technique, the glass it produced
would generate about 1 gigawatt of power a year, says Gary Dorer,
the company's vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost 10 times more than today's total solar-power
production worldwide,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells could also generate compact, do-it-yourself power.
The cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen _ usually
drawn from a fuel like natural gas or methanol _ with oxygen,
launching chemical reactions that spark a current. They work
silently and cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Four Times Square uses the cells for only a fraction of its
total power needs, but in other settings they could pull much
heavier duty. A basement fuel cell working in tandem with solar
cells on a house's roof could churn out all the necessary local
energy, rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a tactical standpoint, it's a beautiful combination,''
says Thomas Hoff, head of Clean Power Research in Napa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, a home's solar power would rev up, especially in
the middle of the day when it is needed most. In the darker days of
winter, the fuel cell would kick into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells generate warmth as they work, so they can be used to
heat rooms or water as well. Add energy-efficient lights and
appliances, and you've got a system that could drastically cut
emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce the threat of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   If advanced fuel cells eventually power some cars _ and
companies like Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Toyota are betting they
will _ mobile and stationary energy needs might someday merge. At
the end of the day, a home owner might plug the house into the
family car to light up the night.
</P>
<P>
   Most existing fuel cells rely on fossil fuels, but future
versions may tap cheaper renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, several breweries are powered by fuel cells that run
off waste gas produced during fermentation. Methane leaking from
landfills could become another useful source of
electricity-generating gas for fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you have a source of hydrogen-rich gas, you might
think of fuel cells,'' says Adam Serchuk of the Renewable Energy
Policy Project in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Energy Conversion Devices is combining solar and
fuel-cell technologies into the ultimate pollution-free home energy
system. Electricity from solar cells on the roof can split water
molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be
siphoned off, stored and used to power fuel cells in the home and
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greatest demand for high-tech distributed power
sources is coming from poor communities overseas. Worldwide, 2
billion people live without electricity. In rural villages in
China, Mexico and India, on-the-spot energy sources such as wind
turbines, solar panels and small biomass power plants make a lot of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the solar cells and wind turbines made in the
United States are shipped to such remote areas. These markets have
supported the development of do-it-yourself power even while the
United States has continued to rely on cheap oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the technology works,'' says Mike Bergey, president of
Bergey Windpower. ``Now it looks like we'll get a chance to prove
it here in the U.S.''

<P>
   Four Times Square, a new 48-story office tower, looks much like
any other modern skyscraper in the heart of New York City. But the
top 11 floors of the sleek glass exterior are unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The building's fashionable, light-blue skin contains an array of
electricity-generating solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a bank of giant fuel cells
lurking on the fourth floor, silently turning natural gas into
power. Four Times Square is its own freestanding environmentally
friendly electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as corporate dealmakers and the general public
understand the value of these kinds of buildings, they're going to
insist on them,'' predicts Bob Fox, the building's lead architect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edison's first lightbulb, an increasing number of people
have tied their energy fulfillment needs to the grid of
interconnected power lines. Now the trend is reversing, and
do-it-yourself power is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Local blackouts and Y2K anxieties have home owners and office
managers alike worrying about a power-grid failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, freestanding energy sources are getting
cleaner, cheaper and prettier. They can even be money-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states now require utilities to use net metering, which
allows consumers who generate their own power to cut their energy
bills by selling back any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, many buildings could sport solar cells on the roof,
natural-gas turbines and fuel cells in the basement and a link to a
wind turbine up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most dramatic changes have popped up in solar power,
long dismissed as visually unappealing and impractically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Architects who once shunned bulky blue solar panels are
marveling at solar cells incorporated discreetly into the surface
of roofing shingles, windows, skylights and wall facades.
</P>
<P>
   Misawa Homes of Japan, that nation's largest home builder,
recently showed off its spare, modernist Eco Energy House, which
turns its solar accoutrements into elegant design elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, President Clinton has launched the Million
Solar Roofs Initiative to get solar-energy tiles on the tops of 1
million buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prices keep dropping. Two decades of engineering
sweat have brought solar electricity costs down to an average of 20
cents per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   In sunny cities like San Diego, an equivalent flow of
conventional electricity during peak daytime hours can cost as much
as 28 cents, says Nancy Bacon, senior vice president of Energy
Conversion Diversion in Troy, Mich. At night, solar homes in San
Diego can switch to power from the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   First Solar in Toledo, Ohio, is starting to grow transparent
solar cells directly onto glass panes during their manufacture, at
a total cost only slightly higher than that of conventional glass.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, a typical glassmaker rolls out 600 tons of panes for
use in buildings. If just one plant were converted for making solar
glass following First Solar's technique, the glass it produced
would generate about 1 gigawatt of power a year, says Gary Dorer,

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   &UR; COSMIC CARTOGRAPHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, some cosmological studies indicated that the
universe is younger than the oldest stars, an obvious
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Freedman at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena,
Calif., recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to determine how
quickly the universe is expanding, then ran the picture backward to
figure out when it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Her international team estimates the cosmos is 12 billion years
old _ almost exactly the age of the most ancient stars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Does this end the age debate?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Before, people were arguing whether it was 10 billion or 20
billion years old. Now we're talking about differences of a billion
or two.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why is it such a hard problem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  To get the age, you need to know how fast the universe is
expanding, so you need velocities and distances. Measuring
velocities turned out to be easy, but measuring distances turned
out to be much harder than anyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   There's dust between stars, which blocks light. If you don't
correct for that, you get the distances wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter how long the universe has been
expanding?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The fact that we can measure an expansion rate at all tells
us the universe had a beginning. There was a time when galaxies
were close together, and before that there was the Big Bang. It
touches on the question of where we came from.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is the biggest unsolved problem in astronomy?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We don't know how galaxies came to be. We have no idea
about a time between roughly 300,000 and 1 billion years after the
Big Bang, when the universe was very hazy. There were no stars yet,
no galaxies yet. We have very little light available from that
time. It's a ``dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How will we ever learn about the dark ages of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  By looking at infrared radiation, astronomers can access a
lot of this region. A new generation of telescopes planned for the
next decade will go above the atmosphere, which blocks infrared
radiation, and tell when the first stars and galaxies appeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your personal motivation for doing this kind of
work?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Part of the joy of being human is you ask questions and you
discover _ it's natural human curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLINDED BY THE LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite giant new observatories and fancy satellites, scientists
find their view of the cosmos increasingly obscured by the
by-products of a technological society.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union in
Vienna, researchers singled out some particularly galling modern
pollutants:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Space Junk. &LR;  The Department of Defense tracks 8,500 objects in
orbit around Earth, including dead satellites and bits of expended
rocket stages. Orbiting debris threatens commercial and scientific
satellites alike. Even telescopes on the ground could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iridium communication satellites are shiny and flat. If a
telescope catches sunlight glinting off one of them, it can burn
out a detector,'' says Patrick Crane, an astronomer at
Interferometrics in Chantilly, Va.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Light Pollution. &LR;  Stray light from street lamps wastes energy
and robs city dwellers of the night sky's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers at Mount Palomar, near San Diego, have worked with
local officials to find mutually beneficial solutions. Mount Wilson
Observatory, near Los Angeles, has all but given up deep-sky
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Interference From Electronic Devices. &LR;  Cell phones, pagers and
other wireless gadgets are broadcasting their signals at some of
the frequencies that most interest radio astronomers _ and
companies are always looking to expand into new parts of the radio
band.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advertising. &LR;  There are serious proposals for placing
conspicuous billboards, mirrors and solar-power stations in Earth's
orbit. The first attempt at such a project, a Russian mirror that
would work as a huge spotlight, failed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHELTER FROM THE SOLAR STORM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every 11 years, a series of magnetic storms roils across the
sun, bombarding us with disruptive showers of charged particles.
</P>
<P>
   The particles wiggle the Earth's magnetic field, which, in turn,
can induce enough extraneous current in high-voltage power lines to
bring down the entire electrical grid.
</P>
<P>
   One such event in 1989 left 6 million Canadians in the dark for
nine hours and cost $10 million to fix.
</P>
<P>
   When the solar cycle peaks again next year, however, utility
companies will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring program called Sunburst 2000 will constantly check
power lines around the world, looking for small induced currents
that indicate the first puffs of a solar squall.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be relayed to power-system managers within
five seconds so they can adjust the current to keep the lines from
overloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunburst 2000 will allow power companies to carry more
electricity more of the time and only back off when a storm hits,''
says Bill Feero, an engineer with Electric Research and Management
in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Feero plans to link Sunburst 2000 with space outposts to
gain an extra half-hour of warning. With any luck, the next wave of
solar storms won't take anyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SURPRISE! SHE'S WIRED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Personal security will become more intimate with the Techno-Bra,
a fusion of miniature electronics and conductive fabric that
monitors the wearer's heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sudden change in pulse indicative of a panic
response, the bra transmits a radio signal that summons the local
police and indicates its location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discreet, comfortable, and won't label you as
vulnerable,'' says the garment's inventor, Kursty Groves, a recent
graduate of London's Royal College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In case of accidental fright, the wearer can hit a ``cancel''
button on the front clasp.
</P>
<P>
   The Techno-Bra should hit stores by Christmas 2000.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a rule, I never anticipate spending part of a weekend
suspended from a moving gasbag 800 feet above Times Square, so
imagine my surprise when I found myself doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   In popular parlance, of course, moving gasbags suspended over
cities are known as blimps, and New York certainly has its share.
On any given weekend, the skies over the five boroughs are
crisscrossed by a veritable exhalation of airships, including the
Goodyear blimp, the Fuji blimp, the Sea World blimp and the MetLife
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in an era of Lockheed wide-bodies and Air France
Concordes, any aircraft that can fit comfortably behind Bullwinkle
in a Thanksgiving Day parade is not going to cut an especially
dramatic figure, and few people would choose the plump and poky
ship when other means of travel are available.
</P>
<P>
   But could the blimp be getting a bad rap? Is there more to these
stately sky whales than meets the eye?
</P>
<P>
   The history of lighter-than-air flying ships began in 1783 when
the Montgolfier brothers _ Manny, Moe, and Jacques _ launched the
first working hot-air balloon, in Annonay, France.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was not actually much demand for hot-air
balloons, but the Montgolfier brothers had apparently shown up late
for Career Day, and after the Wright brothers and the Smith
brothers got dibs on airplanes and cough drops, they had to settle
for what they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Montgolfiers' achievement was impressive: They
built a balloon of fabric backed by paper that was 75 feet tall and
49 feet wide and contained 77,000 cubic feet of hot air, which was
heated by burning straw and wool.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-air balloons definitely had drawbacks, not the least being
keeping the air hot. An alternative was to fill the bladder of the
craft not with air but with hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen is the lightest of all elements and thus the most
buoyant. The problem is that hydrogen is also one of the most
temperamental elements, given to exploding in the presence of a
flame, a spark, or even an ill-considered remark:
</P>
<P>
   Bystander: Hey, has that hydrogen put on a little weight or
something?
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen: BOOM!
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the same year that the Montgolfiers flew their
balloon, French physicist J.A.C. Charles invented a
lighter-than-air craft of his own, featuring a rubber-coated silk
bladder capable of holding 22,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was Charles' design that hydrogen craft quickly
replaced hot-air models, and by the middle of the next century the
ships were in wide use, principally by the military.
</P>
<P>
   During both the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War,
balloons were put to work as aerial observation posts, helping both
to determine the course of military history and to fill the
newspapers of the era with countless memorable battlefield quotes
(``Yup, there's Prussians down there'').
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the balloons were given a simple, onomatopoeic name _
blimp _ thought to evoke the noise the giant gas bladder made when
thumped by a thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clever moniker, the ships had problems, and one
of the thorniest was their size. As lighter-than-air ships became
more and more popular, builders sought to lift bigger and bigger
loads of people and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the load, however, the more hydrogen you needed to do
the lifting, and this required enormous bladders, which were
difficult to manufacture with the relatively low-quality fabrics
available in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a whole new type of airship _ the rigid airship,
made with a skeleton of lightweight ribbing covered by a fabric
balloon that would remain structurally sound no matter how big it
got.
</P>
<P>
   The first rigid ship was launched in 1900 by Count Ferdinand von
Zeppelin of Germany, who, as luck would have it, was already named
after an airship.
</P>
<P>
   When World War I rolled around, Germany built dozens of the
ships, equipped them with propellers, and flew them across the
English Channel, where they were used to bomb Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   By law, of course, when German engineers invent so much as an
especially tasty strudel, they're required to at least try to bomb
Great Britain with it, and even today, whole British cities are
occasionally felled by aerial bombardments of Leica cameras and
Mercedes sedans.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked as though German zeppelins were going to
become the industry standard. In the '30s, however, all that
changed when Germany built the largest rigid airship ever
constructed, the 804-foot Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Launched just three years before the outbreak of World War II,
the ship was built in part to show the world the industrial prowess
of the German nation. Unfortunately, as the Hindenburg was
completing a trans-Atlantic crossing in 1937, it was apparently
struck by lightning, and before the ship even reached its mooring
mast in Lakehurst, N.J., it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, things went downhill for hydrogen airships,
with designers quickly switching to nonflammable helium. But the
damage to the lighter-than-air reputation was done.
</P>
<P>
   The principal characteristic that all the modern-day members of
America's blimp flock have in common is that they are blimps, as
opposed to zeppelins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigidity of rigid airships was always a disadvantage,''
says Jim Thiele, president of the American Blimp Corporation, an
airship manufacturer in Hillsboro, Ore. ``When you're working with
rigid structures, you have to be aware that if you bend them enough
they break. This means that you have to make them extremely strong.
With a soft structure, you can bend 'em and bend 'em and nothing
ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to build such flexible ships, contemporary
manufacturers like Thiele rely on materials not available to their
19th-century forebears. The main body of the blimps his company
makes is composed of two parts: an inner layer (the bladder) and an
outer layer, called an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder, which actually holds the helium, is made of
leak-resistant polyurethane that's welded together from strips. A
130-foot-long bladder capable of holding 68,000 cubic feet of
helium weighs only 250 pounds and leaks away little more than 1
percent of its helium per week.
</P>
<P>
   While resistant to leaks, though, the bladder is not resistant
to punctures, so it is protected by a comparatively heavy 450-pound
envelope made of a polyester ripstop fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Although the envelope is the outer structure, it's actually a
few inches smaller in volume than the polyurethane balloon it
surrounds. This deliberately poor fit helps prevent ruptures by
guaranteeing that when the blimp is fully inflated, it is the
sturdier envelope rather than the thinner bladder that takes the
load.
</P>
<P>
   But simply stuffing a bladder from the Big &AMP; Tall Men's Shop
into an envelope from Misses &AMP; Juniors is not enough to keep a
helium-filled blimp flying. Helium is an inert element _ that is,
it does not react easily with other elements _ and it is this
nonreactiveness that allows it to be used so safely not just in
blimps but at carnivals and birthday parties and in incandescent
lamps.
</P>
<P>
   But just because helium doesn't explode does not mean it doesn't
expand; it can change dramatically in response to the temperature
and pressure of the surrounding air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took a blimp and filled it with helium and floated it
higher and higher,'' Thiele says, ``the pressure inside would
steadily climb as the atmospheric pressure dropped. Ultimately, the
blimp would burst.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this from happening, all of Thiele's blimps are also
equipped with an additional, igloo-shaped balloon within the
bladder, called a ballonet. Filled with ordinary air as opposed to
helium, the ballonet represents about 20 percent of the total gas
volume of the blimp when it leaves the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the airship climbs higher and the atmosphere grows thinner,
air is vented from the ballonet to keep the pressure within the
bladder from growing too great. When the blimp descends into
thicker atmosphere, air is pumped back into the ballonet to prevent
the pressure from dropping too low.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele filled me in on more critical blimp data, but no amount
of talking about blimps was going to take the place of riding in
one, so I contacted one of American Blimp's customers _ the MetLife
insurance company _ to request a couple of hours aloft. To my
alarm, MetLife graciously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The mooring site where I was to find the MetLife blimp was at
the Linden Airport in Linden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piloting a blimp is like piloting no other aircraft,'' said
Charlie Graham, the man who would be behind the blimp controls
during my two hours aloft. ``Most of us are licensed to fly planes
or helicopters as well, but you still need a separate FAA license
to command a lighter-than-air ship. At the moment, there are only
about 30 active blimp pilots in the entire world, which makes us
rarer than space shuttle pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the meadow where the MetLife blimp ought to
have been, there was no blimp, no hangar, not so much as a single
tarmac attendant waving those extraterrestrial flashlights with
cones on the ends. All I saw was a 30-foot pole rising from the
ground and half a dozen guys standing around in matching polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our ground crew,'' Charlie said, indicating the men.
``And this,'' he added, pointing to the pole, ``is our garage.
Overnight, we moor the nose of the blimp to this mast and just let
it float there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few expectant minutes spent scanning the sky, I saw
somebody point roughly northeast and spotted an unmistakable blue
dot approaching from over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind is a big variable in landing a blimp,'' Charlie told me.
``The ideal situation is to hit a head wind just as you're making
your final descent. This slows you down and lowers your altitude
and ground speed. It also helps to have a cloud cover since bright
sun heats the helium and increases its buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   After two or three approaches, exactly the right conditions
suddenly prevailed, and the pilot was able to bring his blimp low
enough for the ground crew to get hold of its cables and wrestle it
into place.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few moments after that for the other pilot to hop
out and Charlie and me to climb aboard and cast ourselves off.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the ground in a lighter-than-air ship is a surprisingly
busy business. Outside the open window of the gondola, the twin
Limbach engines whined and churned. In front of me, the nose of the
blimp dipped, rose and swung lurchingly from side to side while the
ropes dangling from it swayed lazily back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   To my left, Charlie operated his throttles, rudder pedals and
ballonet cords in an absurd choreography that was equal parts Chuck
Yeager, Wilbur Wright and Willy Wonka.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the ride stabilized, and as we glided about 600
feet above the New Jersey coast, Charlie began our tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be approaching Manhattan from the southwest,'' he
shouted over the engines, ``so the first landmark you'll see will
be a pretty obvious one.''
</P>
<P>
   We made a lazy circle around the Statue of Liberty _ close
enough to elicit visible waves from the people around the pedestal,
far enough to get away safely if Liberty decided to drop the torch
and pick up a rolled-up newspaper _ before peeling off and heading
for Manhattan proper.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the part of the main island that
we were now approaching was the World Trade Center towers looming
just a few hundred feet ahead. Glancing at the altimeter, I saw
that we were about 800 feet high; the towers, I knew, rise above
1,300. Now, I don't pretend to be a Mr. Navigational Smarty-pants,
but you didn't have to be Ponce de Lesn either to know that left,
right, or up would have been good choices right about then.
Happily, Charlie chose left, and we skirted the northwest tower and
began to glide over the thicket of Manhattan itself.
</P>
<P>
   When at last we reached the airport, Charlie, impressively,
brought the blimp to a landing on just his first approach. More
impressively, he didn't point it out.
</P>
<P>
   Working his controls while the ground crew grappled with the
cables, he nodded a good-bye, and I jumped out. The blimp then flew
unceremoniously back into the blue, and Charlie drifted back off
for another couple hours of atmospheric ad work trooping the
MetLife colors.
</P>
<P>
   As trips aloft went, my two lighter-than-airborne hours had
lacked a lot _ no purpose, no destination, definitely no in-flight
snack service.
</P>
<P>
   But even if I live in New York another 50 years, it's almost
certainly the only time I'll travel so far uptown and know for
certain I'm going to make all the lights.

suddenly prevailed, and the pilot was able to bring his blimp low
enough for the ground crew to get hold of its cables and wrestle it
into place.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few moments after that for the other pilot to hop
out and Charlie and me to climb aboard and cast ourselves off.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the ground in a lighter-than-air ship is a surprisingly
busy business. Outside the open window of the gondola, the twin
Limbach engines whined and churned. In front of me, the nose of the
blimp dipped, rose and swung lurchingly from side to side while the
ropes dangling from it swayed lazily back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   To my left, Charlie operated his throttles, rudder pedals and
ballonet cords in an absurd choreography that was equal parts Chuck
Yeager, Wilbur Wright and Willy Wonka.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the ride stabilized, and as we glided about 600
feet above the New Jersey coast, Charlie began our tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be approaching Manhattan from the southwest,'' he
shouted over the engines, ``so the first landmark you'll see will
be a pretty obvious one.''
</P>
<P>
   We made a lazy circle around the Statue of Liberty _ close
enough to elicit visible waves from the people around the pedestal,
far enough to get away safely if Liberty decided to drop the torch
and pick up a rolled-up newspaper _ before peeling off and heading
for Manhattan proper.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the part of the main island that
we were now approaching was the World Trade Center towers looming
just a few hundred feet ahead. Glancing at the altimeter, I saw
that we were about 800 feet high; the towers, I knew, rise above
1,300. Now, I don't pretend to be a Mr. Navigational Smarty-pants,
but you didn't have to be Ponce de Lesn either to know that left,
right, or up would have been good choices right about then.
Happily, Charlie chose left, and we skirted the northwest tower and
began to glide over the thicket of Manhattan itself.
</P>
<P>
   When at last we reached the airport, Charlie, impressively,
brought the blimp to a landing on just his first approach. More
impressively, he didn't point it out.
</P>
<P>
   Working his controls while the ground crew grappled with the
cables, he nodded a good-bye, and I jumped out. The blimp then flew
unceremoniously back into the blue, and Charlie drifted back off
for another couple hours of atmospheric ad work trooping the
MetLife colors.
</P>
<P>
   As trips aloft went, my two lighter-than-airborne hours had
lacked a lot _ no purpose, no destination, definitely no in-flight
snack service.
</P>
<P>
   But even if I live in New York another 50 years, it's almost
certainly the only time I'll travel so far uptown and know for
certain I'm going to make all the lights.

<P>
   Four Times Square, a new 48-story office tower, looks much like
any other modern skyscraper in the heart of New York City. But the
top 11 floors of the sleek glass exterior are unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The building's fashionable, light-blue skin contains an array of
electricity-generating solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a bank of giant fuel cells
lurking on the fourth floor, silently turning natural gas into
power. Four Times Square is its own freestanding environmentally
friendly electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as corporate dealmakers and the general public
understand the value of these kinds of buildings, they're going to
insist on them,'' predicts Bob Fox, the building's lead architect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edison's first lightbulb, an increasing number of people
have tied their energy fulfillment needs to the grid of
interconnected power lines. Now the trend is reversing, and
do-it-yourself power is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Local blackouts and Y2K anxieties have home owners and office
managers alike worrying about a power-grid failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, freestanding energy sources are getting
cleaner, cheaper and prettier. They can even be money-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states now require utilities to use net metering, which
allows consumers who generate their own power to cut their energy
bills by selling back any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, many buildings could sport solar cells on the roof,
natural-gas turbines and fuel cells in the basement and a link to a
wind turbine up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most dramatic changes have popped up in solar power,
long dismissed as visually unappealing and impractically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Architects who once shunned bulky blue solar panels are
marveling at solar cells incorporated discreetly into the surface
of roofing shingles, windows, skylights and wall facades.
</P>
<P>
   Misawa Homes of Japan, that nation's largest home builder,
recently showed off its spare, modernist Eco Energy House, which
turns its solar accoutrements into elegant design elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, President Clinton has launched the Million
Solar Roofs Initiative to get solar-energy tiles on the tops of 1
million buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prices keep dropping. Two decades of engineering
sweat have brought solar electricity costs down to an average of 20
cents per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   In sunny cities like San Diego, an equivalent flow of
conventional electricity during peak daytime hours can cost as much
as 28 cents, says Nancy Bacon, senior vice president of Energy
Conversion Diversion in Troy, Mich. At night, solar homes in San
Diego can switch to power from the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   First Solar in Toledo, Ohio, is starting to grow transparent
solar cells directly onto glass panes during their manufacture, at
a total cost only slightly higher than that of conventional glass.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, a typical glassmaker rolls out 600 tons of panes for
use in buildings. If just one plant were converted for making solar
glass following First Solar's technique, the glass it produced
would generate about 1 gigawatt of power a year, says Gary Dorer,
the company's vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost 10 times more than today's total solar-power
production worldwide,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells could also generate compact, do-it-yourself power.
The cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen _ usually
drawn from a fuel like natural gas or methanol _ with oxygen,
launching chemical reactions that spark a current. They work
silently and cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Four Times Square uses the cells for only a fraction of its
total power needs, but in other settings they could pull much
heavier duty. A basement fuel cell working in tandem with solar
cells on a house's roof could churn out all the necessary local
energy, rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a tactical standpoint, it's a beautiful combination,''
says Thomas Hoff, head of Clean Power Research in Napa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, a home's solar power would rev up, especially in
the middle of the day when it is needed most. In the darker days of
winter, the fuel cell would kick into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells generate warmth as they work, so they can be used to
heat rooms or water as well. Add energy-efficient lights and
appliances, and you've got a system that could drastically cut
emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce the threat of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   If advanced fuel cells eventually power some cars _ and
companies like Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Toyota are betting they
will _ mobile and stationary energy needs might someday merge. At
the end of the day, a home owner might plug the house into the
family car to light up the night.
</P>
<P>
   Most existing fuel cells rely on fossil fuels, but future
versions may tap cheaper renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, several breweries are powered by fuel cells that run
off waste gas produced during fermentation. Methane leaking from
landfills could become another useful source of
electricity-generating gas for fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you have a source of hydrogen-rich gas, you might
think of fuel cells,'' says Adam Serchuk of the Renewable Energy
Policy Project in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Energy Conversion Devices is combining solar and
fuel-cell technologies into the ultimate pollution-free home energy
system. Electricity from solar cells on the roof can split water
molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be
siphoned off, stored and used to power fuel cells in the home and
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greatest demand for high-tech distributed power
sources is coming from poor communities overseas. Worldwide, 2
billion people live without electricity. In rural villages in
China, Mexico and India, on-the-spot energy sources such as wind
turbines, solar panels and small biomass power plants make a lot of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the solar cells and wind turbines made in the
United States are shipped to such remote areas. These markets have
supported the development of do-it-yourself power even while the
United States has continued to rely on cheap oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the technology works,'' says Mike Bergey, president of
Bergey Windpower. ``Now it looks like we'll get a chance to prove
it here in the U.S.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When it comes to introducing the cosmos to the
common man, John T. Brown has a credibility problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nightly, passersby peer into a 300-pound telescope he props up
on a sidewalk near the French Quarter. Then they try to figure if
he painted the wispy rings of Saturn or Jupiter's huge reddish hue
on the lens.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has to just about take apart his telescope to convince
people that his sidewalk show is pure science, that it is nothing
as suspect as the psychic stalls that line nearby Jackson Square.
But he doesn't mind. After all, he points out, Galileo had the same
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have lugged their telescopes around US cities for
about 25 years, business has never been as brisk for Brown and
other sidewalk astronomers, a loosely knit group of skywatchers
largely inspired by a former monk in San Francisco who built
inexpensive telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons cited for the resurgence of interest in the heavens are
the availability of inexpensive but powerful telescopes, cosmic
discoveries nearly monthly from NASA telescopes, and events such as
this week's Leonid Meteor Shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't be amateur chemists, they can't be amateur
physicists, but they can be amateur astronomers. '' said Mario
Motta, a member of Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Motta's group has been overwhelmed this year with requests to
hold ``star parties,'' where telescopes are set up in an open area
for people to peer through as a host lectures about sights in the
night sky. One such party, in a darkened Lynnfield middle school
parking lot earlier this month, lured 250 people. Five years ago,
the group would get 3 or 4 requests annually for the parties; this
year there have been more than 30 requests.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy publications are also seeing increased circulation:
Sky &AMP; Telescope Magazine sold 73,000 copies in 1987; now the
Cambridge, Mass. magazine's monthly circulation is 126,000.
Telescope makers and sellers say sales are booming, too. The
Telescope Store / Earth Treasures in Keene, N.H., sold about 300
telescopes last year; four years ago, it sold about 20, said owner
David Tong.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers say that a recent revolution in telescope design
that put computerized tracking equipment and powerful optics within
reach of family budgets has helped fuel the interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to know where to look in the sky anymore,''
said Ron Dantowitz, astronomy educator at the Charles Hayden
Planetarium in Boston. ``You just click on a button or mouse and
the telescope will find what you're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Power and complexity still come at a price, Dantowitz said, but
the same amount of money five years ago will today buy a much
better telescope today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few hundred dollars can get you a pretty good telescope,''
he said. ``But I often tell people that a book and a good pair of
binoculars is a good place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantowitz said amateur astronomy has never been more popular,
thanks to the availability of new information on the Internet and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is really into it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy did not start out as a street science. Often reserved
for academics and physicists, the heavens were wondered about, but
barely seen in detail; telescopes were too bulky and expensive and
there were few programs for the public. And while amateur telescope
societies have dotted the landscape since the early part of this
century, most programs were reserved for elite club members.
</P>
<P>
   After the Russian satellite Sputnik was launched in 1957,
however, public interest in the ``space race'' skyrocketed. The US
government began pouring money into space exploration, and people
began looking upward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a former monk, John Dobson, took to the streets of
San Francisco in 1967 teaching the public how to build inexpensive
telescopes, even using junkyard finds like roof shingles and
portholes from ships. Eventually, the ``Dobsonian'' method of
telescope-making was copied by commercial dealers, making the
instruments more accessible to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson also helped form the Sidewalk Astronomers Association,
dedicated to introducing novices to the skies. Almost weekly, the
group picks a San Francisco site and a time and invites the public
to show up and learn about planets, globular clusters, and the
Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dobson's sidewalk group was formed, similar associations
have cropped up in Toronto, Fort Worth, and Los Angeles. New
England does not host a sidewalk astronomer club per se, but the
dozen or so astronomy clubs in the region are dedicated to the same
purpose: increasing public awareness of the heavens. And
professional astronomers are doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The least we can do is to share what we know with the general
public,'' said Eric Chaisson, director of the Wright Center for
Innovative Science Education at Tufts. He has started several
astronomy nights and he lectures at universities and observatories
in the region. ``We're all sort of sidewalk astronomers, just in a
more organized way. The same philosophy is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown likes his method better _ showing off the stars to people
who would not attend a star party or astronomy lecture. The son of
a New Orleans musician, Brown, 51, began being interested in the
skies after he finished a three-year stint in Vietnam. He took his
last $500 and bought a telescope. He eventually meandered back to
New Orleans where he has been toting his telescope for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   While he is no astrophysicist, Brown can pick apart the sky for
just about anyone. Every clear night, he sets up outside the Cafe
du Monde on Decatur Street in the city's French Market. A bucket
off to the side collects donations _ a dollar or two a peek, $10
for a galaxy tour.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Shapiro, 43, of Cleveland, walked past Brown's set-up
two times before venturing over to peer in the eyepiece. He
wrinkled his face at first, curious if he was being had. But Brown
pointed Shapiro's naked eye to Saturn and Jupiter and then aimed
the telescope there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't think you're going to see anything that looks
so perfect,'' Shapiro said. ``It looks like a sticker on the
lens.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers are initially skeptical that a star or planet can
be seen against the bright backdrop of New Orleans' night life. But
Brown puts a small piece of cardboard in front of the eyepiece that
blocks interfering light.
</P>
<P>
   While you can't see everything, you can see enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all real,'' said Brown. ``It's all right there in the
sky. You just have to look up.''

   &UR; COSMIC CARTOGRAPHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, some cosmological studies indicated that the
universe is younger than the oldest stars, an obvious
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Freedman at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena,
Calif., recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to determine how
quickly the universe is expanding, then ran the picture backward to
figure out when it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Her international team estimates the cosmos is 12 billion years
old _ almost exactly the age of the most ancient stars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Does this end the age debate?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Before, people were arguing whether it was 10 billion or 20
billion years old. Now we're talking about differences of a billion
or two.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why is it such a hard problem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  To get the age, you need to know how fast the universe is
expanding, so you need velocities and distances. Measuring
velocities turned out to be easy, but measuring distances turned
out to be much harder than anyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   There's dust between stars, which blocks light. If you don't
correct for that, you get the distances wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter how long the universe has been
expanding?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The fact that we can measure an expansion rate at all tells
us the universe had a beginning. There was a time when galaxies
were close together, and before that there was the Big Bang. It
touches on the question of where we came from.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is the biggest unsolved problem in astronomy?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We don't know how galaxies came to be. We have no idea
about a time between roughly 300,000 and 1 billion years after the
Big Bang, when the universe was very hazy. There were no stars yet,
no galaxies yet. We have very little light available from that
time. It's a ``dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How will we ever learn about the dark ages of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  By looking at infrared radiation, astronomers can access a
lot of this region. A new generation of telescopes planned for the
next decade will go above the atmosphere, which blocks infrared
radiation, and tell when the first stars and galaxies appeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your personal motivation for doing this kind of
work?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Part of the joy of being human is you ask questions and you
discover _ it's natural human curiosity.

   Despite giant new observatories and fancy satellites, scientists
find their view of the cosmos increasingly obscured by the
by-products of a technological society.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union in
Vienna, researchers singled out some particularly galling modern
pollutants:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Space Junk. &LR;  The Department of Defense tracks 8,500 objects in
orbit around Earth, including dead satellites and bits of expended
rocket stages. Orbiting debris threatens commercial and scientific
satellites alike. Even telescopes on the ground could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iridium communication satellites are shiny and flat. If a
telescope catches sunlight glinting off one of them, it can burn
out a detector,'' says Patrick Crane, an astronomer at
Interferometrics in Chantilly, Va.

<P>
   &UR; Light Pollution. &LR;  Stray light from street lamps wastes energy
and robs city dwellers of the night sky's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers at Mount Palomar, near San Diego, have worked with
local officials to find mutually beneficial solutions. Mount Wilson
Observatory, near Los Angeles, has all but given up deep-sky
astronomy.

   &UR; Interference From Electronic Devices. &LR;  Cell phones, pagers and
other wireless gadgets are broadcasting their signals at some of
the frequencies that most interest radio astronomers _ and
companies are always looking to expand into new parts of the radio

<P>
   &UR; Advertising. &LR;  There are serious proposals for placing
conspicuous billboards, mirrors and solar-power stations in Earth's
orbit. The first attempt at such a project, a Russian mirror that
would work as a huge spotlight, failed last winter.

<P>
   &UR; SHELTER FROM THE SOLAR STORM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every 11 years, a series of magnetic storms roils across the
sun, bombarding us with disruptive showers of charged particles.
</P>
<P>
   The particles wiggle the Earth's magnetic field, which, in turn,
can induce enough extraneous current in high-voltage power lines to
bring down the entire electrical grid.
</P>
<P>
   One such event in 1989 left 6 million Canadians in the dark for
nine hours and cost $10 million to fix.
</P>
<P>
   When the solar cycle peaks again next year, however, utility
companies will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring program called Sunburst 2000 will constantly check
power lines around the world, looking for small induced currents
that indicate the first puffs of a solar squall.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be relayed to power-system managers within
five seconds so they can adjust the current to keep the lines from
overloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunburst 2000 will allow power companies to carry more
electricity more of the time and only back off when a storm hits,''
says Bill Feero, an engineer with Electric Research and Management
in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Feero plans to link Sunburst 2000 with space outposts to
gain an extra half-hour of warning. With any luck, the next wave of
solar storms won't take anyone by surprise.

<P>
   Personal security will become more intimate with the Techno-Bra,
a fusion of miniature electronics and conductive fabric that
monitors the wearer's heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sudden change in pulse indicative of a panic
response, the bra transmits a radio signal that summons the local
police and indicates its location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discreet, comfortable, and won't label you as
vulnerable,'' says the garment's inventor, Kursty Groves, a recent
graduate of London's Royal College of Art.

 By JEFFREY KLUGER  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a rule, I never anticipate spending part of a weekend
suspended from a moving gasbag 800 feet above Times Square, so
imagine my surprise when I found myself doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   In popular parlance, of course, moving gasbags suspended over
cities are known as blimps, and New York certainly has its share.
On any given weekend, the skies over the five boroughs are
crisscrossed by a veritable exhalation of airships, including the
Goodyear blimp, the Fuji blimp, the Sea World blimp and the MetLife
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in an era of Lockheed wide-bodies and Air France
Concordes, any aircraft that can fit comfortably behind Bullwinkle
in a Thanksgiving Day parade is not going to cut an especially
dramatic figure, and few people would choose the plump and poky
ship when other means of travel are available.
</P>
<P>
   But could the blimp be getting a bad rap? Is there more to these
stately sky whales than meets the eye?
</P>
<P>
   The history of lighter-than-air flying ships began in 1783 when
the Montgolfier brothers _ Manny, Moe, and Jacques _ launched the
first working hot-air balloon, in Annonay, France.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was not actually much demand for hot-air
balloons, but the Montgolfier brothers had apparently shown up late
for Career Day, and after the Wright brothers and the Smith
brothers got dibs on airplanes and cough drops, they had to settle
for what they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Montgolfiers' achievement was impressive: They
built a balloon of fabric backed by paper that was 75 feet tall and
49 feet wide and contained 77,000 cubic feet of hot air, which was
heated by burning straw and wool.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-air balloons definitely had drawbacks, not the least being
keeping the air hot. An alternative was to fill the bladder of the
craft not with air but with hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen is the lightest of all elements and thus the most
buoyant. The problem is that hydrogen is also one of the most
temperamental elements, given to exploding in the presence of a
flame, a spark, or even an ill-considered remark:
</P>
<P>
   Bystander: Hey, has that hydrogen put on a little weight or
something?
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen: BOOM!
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the same year that the Montgolfiers flew their
balloon, French physicist J.A.C. Charles invented a
lighter-than-air craft of his own, featuring a rubber-coated silk
bladder capable of holding 22,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was Charles' design that hydrogen craft quickly
replaced hot-air models, and by the middle of the next century the
ships were in wide use, principally by the military.
</P>
<P>
   During both the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War,
balloons were put to work as aerial observation posts, helping both
to determine the course of military history and to fill the
newspapers of the era with countless memorable battlefield quotes
(``Yup, there's Prussians down there'').
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the balloons were given a simple, onomatopoeic name _
blimp _ thought to evoke the noise the giant gas bladder made when
thumped by a thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clever moniker, the ships had problems, and one
of the thorniest was their size. As lighter-than-air ships became
more and more popular, builders sought to lift bigger and bigger
loads of people and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the load, however, the more hydrogen you needed to do
the lifting, and this required enormous bladders, which were
difficult to manufacture with the relatively low-quality fabrics
available in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a whole new type of airship _ the rigid airship,
made with a skeleton of lightweight ribbing covered by a fabric
balloon that would remain structurally sound no matter how big it
got.
</P>
<P>
   The first rigid ship was launched in 1900 by Count Ferdinand von
Zeppelin of Germany, who, as luck would have it, was already named
after an airship.
</P>
<P>
   When World War I rolled around, Germany built dozens of the
ships, equipped them with propellers, and flew them across the
English Channel, where they were used to bomb Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   By law, of course, when German engineers invent so much as an
especially tasty strudel, they're required to at least try to bomb
Great Britain with it, and even today, whole British cities are
occasionally felled by aerial bombardments of Leica cameras and
Mercedes sedans.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked as though German zeppelins were going to
become the industry standard. In the '30s, however, all that
changed when Germany built the largest rigid airship ever
constructed, the 804-foot Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Launched just three years before the outbreak of World War II,
the ship was built in part to show the world the industrial prowess
of the German nation. Unfortunately, as the Hindenburg was
completing a trans-Atlantic crossing in 1937, it was apparently
struck by lightning, and before the ship even reached its mooring
mast in Lakehurst, N.J., it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, things went downhill for hydrogen airships,
with designers quickly switching to nonflammable helium. But the
damage to the lighter-than-air reputation was done.
</P>
<P>
   The principal characteristic that all the modern-day members of
America's blimp flock have in common is that they are blimps, as
opposed to zeppelins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigidity of rigid airships was always a disadvantage,''
says Jim Thiele, president of the American Blimp Corporation, an
airship manufacturer in Hillsboro, Ore. ``When you're working with
rigid structures, you have to be aware that if you bend them enough
they break. This means that you have to make them extremely strong.
With a soft structure, you can bend 'em and bend 'em and nothing
ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to build such flexible ships, contemporary
manufacturers like Thiele rely on materials not available to their
19th-century forebears. The main body of the blimps his company
makes is composed of two parts: an inner layer (the bladder) and an
outer layer, called an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder, which actually holds the helium, is made of
leak-resistant polyurethane that's welded together from strips. A
130-foot-long bladder capable of holding 68,000 cubic feet of
helium weighs only 250 pounds and leaks away little more than 1
percent of its helium per week.
</P>
<P>
   While resistant to leaks, though, the bladder is not resistant
to punctures, so it is protected by a comparatively heavy 450-pound
envelope made of a polyester ripstop fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Although the envelope is the outer structure, it's actually a
few inches smaller in volume than the polyurethane balloon it
surrounds. This deliberately poor fit helps prevent ruptures by
guaranteeing that when the blimp is fully inflated, it is the
sturdier envelope rather than the thinner bladder that takes the
load.
</P>
<P>
   But simply stuffing a bladder from the Big &AMP; Tall Men's Shop
into an envelope from Misses &AMP; Juniors is not enough to keep a
helium-filled blimp flying. Helium is an inert element _ that is,
it does not react easily with other elements _ and it is this
nonreactiveness that allows it to be used so safely not just in
blimps but at carnivals and birthday parties and in incandescent
lamps.
</P>
<P>
   But just because helium doesn't explode does not mean it doesn't
expand; it can change dramatically in response to the temperature
and pressure of the surrounding air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took a blimp and filled it with helium and floated it
higher and higher,'' Thiele says, ``the pressure inside would
steadily climb as the atmospheric pressure dropped. Ultimately, the
blimp would burst.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this from happening, all of Thiele's blimps are also
equipped with an additional, igloo-shaped balloon within the
bladder, called a ballonet. Filled with ordinary air as opposed to
helium, the ballonet represents about 20 percent of the total gas
volume of the blimp when it leaves the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the airship climbs higher and the atmosphere grows thinner,
air is vented from the ballonet to keep the pressure within the
bladder from growing too great. When the blimp descends into
thicker atmosphere, air is pumped back into the ballonet to prevent
the pressure from dropping too low.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele filled me in on more critical blimp data, but no amount
of talking about blimps was going to take the place of riding in
one, so I contacted one of American Blimp's customers _ the MetLife
insurance company _ to request a couple of hours aloft. To my
alarm, MetLife graciously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The mooring site where I was to find the MetLife blimp was at
the Linden Airport in Linden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piloting a blimp is like piloting no other aircraft,'' said
Charlie Graham, the man who would be behind the blimp controls
during my two hours aloft. ``Most of us are licensed to fly planes
or helicopters as well, but you still need a separate FAA license
to command a lighter-than-air ship. At the moment, there are only
about 30 active blimp pilots in the entire world, which makes us
rarer than space shuttle pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the meadow where the MetLife blimp ought to
have been, there was no blimp, no hangar, not so much as a single
tarmac attendant waving those extraterrestrial flashlights with
cones on the ends. All I saw was a 30-foot pole rising from the
ground and half a dozen guys standing around in matching polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our ground crew,'' Charlie said, indicating the men.
``And this,'' he added, pointing to the pole, ``is our garage.
Overnight, we moor the nose of the blimp to this mast and just let
it float there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few expectant minutes spent scanning the sky, I saw
somebody point roughly northeast and spotted an unmistakable blue
dot approaching from over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind is a big variable in landing a blimp,'' Charlie told me.
``The ideal situation is to hit a head wind just as you're making
your final descent. This slows you down and lowers your altitude
and ground speed. It also helps to have a cloud cover since bright
sun heats the helium and increases its buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   After two or three approaches, exactly the right conditions
suddenly prevailed, and the pilot was able to bring his blimp low
enough for the ground crew to get hold of its cables and wrestle it
into place.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few moments after that for the other pilot to hop
out and Charlie and me to climb aboard and cast ourselves off.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the ground in a lighter-than-air ship is a surprisingly
busy business. Outside the open window of the gondola, the twin
Limbach engines whined and churned. In front of me, the nose of the
blimp dipped, rose and swung lurchingly from side to side while the
ropes dangling from it swayed lazily back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   To my left, Charlie operated his throttles, rudder pedals and
ballonet cords in an absurd choreography that was equal parts Chuck
Yeager, Wilbur Wright and Willy Wonka.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the ride stabilized, and as we glided about 600
feet above the New Jersey coast, Charlie began our tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be approaching Manhattan from the southwest,'' he
shouted over the engines, ``so the first landmark you'll see will
be a pretty obvious one.''
</P>
<P>
   We made a lazy circle around the Statue of Liberty _ close
enough to elicit visible waves from the people around the pedestal,
far enough to get away safely if Liberty decided to drop the torch
and pick up a rolled-up newspaper _ before peeling off and heading
for Manhattan proper.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the part of the main island that
we were now approaching was the World Trade Center towers looming
just a few hundred feet ahead. Glancing at the altimeter, I saw
that we were about 800 feet high; the towers, I knew, rise above
1,300. Now, I don't pretend to be a Mr. Navigational Smarty-pants,
but you didn't have to be Ponce de Lesn either to know that left,
right, or up would have been good choices right about then.
Happily, Charlie chose left, and we skirted the northwest tower and
began to glide over the thicket of Manhattan itself.
</P>
<P>
   When at last we reached the airport, Charlie, impressively,
brought the blimp to a landing on just his first approach. More
impressively, he didn't point it out.
</P>
<P>
   Working his controls while the ground crew grappled with the
cables, he nodded a good-bye, and I jumped out. The blimp then flew
unceremoniously back into the blue, and Charlie drifted back off
for another couple hours of atmospheric ad work trooping the
MetLife colors.
</P>
<P>
   As trips aloft went, my two lighter-than-airborne hours had
lacked a lot _ no purpose, no destination, definitely no in-flight
snack service.
</P>
<P>
   But even if I live in New York another 50 years, it's almost
certainly the only time I'll travel so far uptown and know for
certain I'm going to make all the lights.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a rule, I never anticipate spending part of a weekend
suspended from a moving gasbag 800 feet above Times Square, so
imagine my surprise when I found myself doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   In popular parlance, of course, moving gasbags suspended over
cities are known as blimps, and New York certainly has its share.
On any given weekend, the skies over the five boroughs are
crisscrossed by a veritable exhalation of airships, including the
Goodyear blimp, the Fuji blimp, the Sea World blimp and the MetLife
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in an era of Lockheed wide-bodies and Air France
Concordes, any aircraft that can fit comfortably behind Bullwinkle
in a Thanksgiving Day parade is not going to cut an especially
dramatic figure, and few people would choose the plump and poky
ship when other means of travel are available.
</P>
<P>
   But could the blimp be getting a bad rap? Is there more to these
stately sky whales than meets the eye?
</P>
<P>
   The history of lighter-than-air flying ships began in 1783 when
the Montgolfier brothers _ Manny, Moe, and Jacques _ launched the
first working hot-air balloon, in Annonay, France.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was not actually much demand for hot-air
balloons, but the Montgolfier brothers had apparently shown up late
for Career Day, and after the Wright brothers and the Smith
brothers got dibs on airplanes and cough drops, they had to settle
for what they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Montgolfiers' achievement was impressive: They
built a balloon of fabric backed by paper that was 75 feet tall and
49 feet wide and contained 77,000 cubic feet of hot air, which was
heated by burning straw and wool.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-air balloons definitely had drawbacks, not the least being
keeping the air hot. An alternative was to fill the bladder of the
craft not with air but with hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen is the lightest of all elements and thus the most
buoyant. The problem is that hydrogen is also one of the most
temperamental elements, given to exploding in the presence of a
flame, a spark, or even an ill-considered remark:
</P>
<P>
   Bystander: Hey, has that hydrogen put on a little weight or
something?
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen: BOOM!
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the same year that the Montgolfiers flew their
balloon, French physicist J.A.C. Charles invented a
lighter-than-air craft of his own, featuring a rubber-coated silk
bladder capable of holding 22,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was Charles' design that hydrogen craft quickly
replaced hot-air models, and by the middle of the next century the
ships were in wide use, principally by the military.
</P>
<P>
   During both the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War,
balloons were put to work as aerial observation posts, helping both
to determine the course of military history and to fill the
newspapers of the era with countless memorable battlefield quotes
(``Yup, there's Prussians down there'').
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the balloons were given a simple, onomatopoeic name _
blimp _ thought to evoke the noise the giant gas bladder made when
thumped by a thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clever moniker, the ships had problems, and one
of the thorniest was their size. As lighter-than-air ships became
more and more popular, builders sought to lift bigger and bigger
loads of people and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the load, however, the more hydrogen you needed to do
the lifting, and this required enormous bladders, which were
difficult to manufacture with the relatively low-quality fabrics
available in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a whole new type of airship _ the rigid airship,
made with a skeleton of lightweight ribbing covered by a fabric
balloon that would remain structurally sound no matter how big it
got.
</P>
<P>
   The first rigid ship was launched in 1900 by Count Ferdinand von
Zeppelin of Germany, who, as luck would have it, was already named
after an airship.
</P>
<P>
   When World War I rolled around, Germany built dozens of the
ships, equipped them with propellers, and flew them across the
English Channel, where they were used to bomb Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   By law, of course, when German engineers invent so much as an
especially tasty strudel, they're required to at least try to bomb
Great Britain with it, and even today, whole British cities are
occasionally felled by aerial bombardments of Leica cameras and
Mercedes sedans.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked as though German zeppelins were going to
become the industry standard. In the '30s, however, all that
changed when Germany built the largest rigid airship ever
constructed, the 804-foot Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Launched just three years before the outbreak of World War II,
the ship was built in part to show the world the industrial prowess
of the German nation. Unfortunately, as the Hindenburg was
completing a trans-Atlantic crossing in 1937, it was apparently
struck by lightning, and before the ship even reached its mooring
mast in Lakehurst, N.J., it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, things went downhill for hydrogen airships,
with designers quickly switching to nonflammable helium. But the
damage to the lighter-than-air reputation was done.
</P>
<P>
   The principal characteristic that all the modern-day members of
America's blimp flock have in common is that they are blimps, as
opposed to zeppelins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigidity of rigid airships was always a disadvantage,''
says Jim Thiele, president of the American Blimp Corporation, an
airship manufacturer in Hillsboro, Ore. ``When you're working with
rigid structures, you have to be aware that if you bend them enough
they break. This means that you have to make them extremely strong.
With a soft structure, you can bend 'em and bend 'em and nothing
ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to build such flexible ships, contemporary
manufacturers like Thiele rely on materials not available to their
19th-century forebears. The main body of the blimps his company
makes is composed of two parts: an inner layer (the bladder) and an
outer layer, called an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder, which actually holds the helium, is made of
leak-resistant polyurethane that's welded together from strips. A
130-foot-long bladder capable of holding 68,000 cubic feet of
helium weighs only 250 pounds and leaks away little more than 1
percent of its helium per week.
</P>
<P>
   While resistant to leaks, though, the bladder is not resistant
to punctures, so it is protected by a comparatively heavy 450-pound
envelope made of a polyester ripstop fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Although the envelope is the outer structure, it's actually a
few inches smaller in volume than the polyurethane balloon it
surrounds. This deliberately poor fit helps prevent ruptures by
guaranteeing that when the blimp is fully inflated, it is the
sturdier envelope rather than the thinner bladder that takes the
load.
</P>
<P>
   But simply stuffing a bladder from the Big &AMP; Tall Men's Shop
into an envelope from Misses &AMP; Juniors is not enough to keep a
helium-filled blimp flying. Helium is an inert element _ that is,
it does not react easily with other elements _ and it is this
nonreactiveness that allows it to be used so safely not just in
blimps but at carnivals and birthday parties and in incandescent
lamps.
</P>
<P>
   But just because helium doesn't explode does not mean it doesn't
expand; it can change dramatically in response to the temperature
and pressure of the surrounding air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took a blimp and filled it with helium and floated it
higher and higher,'' Thiele says, ``the pressure inside would
steadily climb as the atmospheric pressure dropped. Ultimately, the
blimp would burst.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this from happening, all of Thiele's blimps are also
equipped with an additional, igloo-shaped balloon within the
bladder, called a ballonet. Filled with ordinary air as opposed to
helium, the ballonet represents about 20 percent of the total gas
volume of the blimp when it leaves the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the airship climbs higher and the atmosphere grows thinner,
air is vented from the ballonet to keep the pressure within the
bladder from growing too great. When the blimp descends into
thicker atmosphere, air is pumped back into the ballonet to prevent
the pressure from dropping too low.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele filled me in on more critical blimp data, but no amount
of talking about blimps was going to take the place of riding in
one, so I contacted one of American Blimp's customers _ the MetLife
insurance company _ to request a couple of hours aloft. To my
alarm, MetLife graciously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The mooring site where I was to find the MetLife blimp was at
the Linden Airport in Linden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piloting a blimp is like piloting no other aircraft,'' said
Charlie Graham, the man who would be behind the blimp controls
during my two hours aloft. ``Most of us are licensed to fly planes
or helicopters as well, but you still need a separate FAA license
to command a lighter-than-air ship. At the moment, there are only
about 30 active blimp pilots in the entire world, which makes us
rarer than space shuttle pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the meadow where the MetLife blimp ought to
have been, there was no blimp, no hangar, not so much as a single
tarmac attendant waving those extraterrestrial flashlights with
cones on the ends. All I saw was a 30-foot pole rising from the
ground and half a dozen guys standing around in matching polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our ground crew,'' Charlie said, indicating the men.
``And this,'' he added, pointing to the pole, ``is our garage.
Overnight, we moor the nose of the blimp to this mast and just let
it float there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few expectant minutes spent scanning the sky, I saw
somebody point roughly northeast and spotted an unmistakable blue
dot approaching from over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind is a big variable in landing a blimp,'' Charlie told me.
``The ideal situation is to hit a head wind just as you're making
your final descent. This slows you down and lowers your altitude
and ground speed. It also helps to have a cloud cover since bright
sun heats the helium and increases its buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   After two or three approaches, exactly the right conditions
suddenly prevailed, and the pilot was able to bring his blimp low
enough for the ground crew to get hold of its cables and wrestle it
into place.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few moments after that for the other pilot to hop
out and Charlie and me to climb aboard and cast ourselves off.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the ground in a lighter-than-air ship is a surprisingly
busy business. Outside the open window of the gondola, the twin
Limbach engines whined and churned. In front of me, the nose of the
blimp dipped, rose and swung lurchingly from side to side while the
ropes dangling from it swayed lazily back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   To my left, Charlie operated his throttles, rudder pedals and
ballonet cords in an absurd choreography that was equal parts Chuck
Yeager, Wilbur Wright and Willy Wonka.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the ride stabilized, and as we glided about 600
feet above the New Jersey coast, Charlie began our tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be approaching Manhattan from the southwest,'' he
shouted over the engines, ``so the first landmark you'll see will
be a pretty obvious one.''
</P>
<P>
   We made a lazy circle around the Statue of Liberty _ close
enough to elicit visible waves from the people around the pedestal,
far enough to get away safely if Liberty decided to drop the torch
and pick up a rolled-up newspaper _ before peeling off and heading
for Manhattan proper.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the part of the main island that
we were now approaching was the World Trade Center towers looming
just a few hundred feet ahead. Glancing at the altimeter, I saw
that we were about 800 feet high; the towers, I knew, rise above
1,300. Now, I don't pretend to be a Mr. Navigational Smarty-pants,
but you didn't have to be Ponce de Lesn either to know that left,
right, or up would have been good choices right about then.
Happily, Charlie chose left, and we skirted the northwest tower and
began to glide over the thicket of Manhattan itself.
</P>
<P>
   When at last we reached the airport, Charlie, impressively,
brought the blimp to a landing on just his first approach. More
impressively, he didn't point it out.
</P>
<P>
   Working his controls while the ground crew grappled with the
cables, he nodded a good-bye, and I jumped out. The blimp then flew
unceremoniously back into the blue, and Charlie drifted back off
for another couple hours of atmospheric ad work trooping the
MetLife colors.
</P>
<P>
   As trips aloft went, my two lighter-than-airborne hours had
lacked a lot _ no purpose, no destination, definitely no in-flight
snack service.
</P>
<P>
   But even if I live in New York another 50 years, it's almost
certainly the only time I'll travel so far uptown and know for
certain I'm going to make all the lights.

WHAT CLINTON MIGHT SAY ABOUT THE LOSERS RUNNING FOR HIS SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   God. I look at this crew of people who want to follow me as
president, and I could lick any one of 'em with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   What a posse of palookas. They don't know if they're on foot or
on horseback. George W.? He couldn't caddy for me on his best day.
Forbes? Give me a break. I could take that geek and wrap his flat
tax around his neck about four times before he even got his mouth
open.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain? He'd be a problem, I have to admit. I'd give him a
good leaving alone all during the primaries. My hunch is the
Republicans would never dare nominate a guy who's so tough on soft
money and campaign finance. That money-raising advantage is why the
Republicans control Congress to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   But if McCain ever did get the nomination, I'd have to work
harder, but I could still take him. I'm not saying this is a
particularly weak field. They say that every four years, that the
wrong people are running, and that the best won't try. What a lot
of bull. The so-called best won't try because they can't take the
heat. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Taking heat is what I'm good at. Best around, if I do say so.
These idiots on the weekend talk shows blather about ``Clinton
fatigue.'' If it wasn't for the 25th Amendment, I'd be running
again _ and I'd win!
</P>
<P>
   My approval rating is still higher than Reagan's heading into
his eighth year. You want to talk peace and prosperity? I can talk
peace, and I can talk prosperity. I can go anywhere in the world,
just about, and be hailed as the world leader who makes the good
things happen. Well, I guess Greece is still a bit of a problem.
But if I get half a break in the Middle East, and just a little
more give in Northern Ireland, I'll walk out of here as the
greatest peacemaker since Mr. Colt invented his .45.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you want to talk about the economy? Be my guest. I cannot
believe Al Gore never even mentioned how well New Hampshire is
doing when he went up there to debate Bradley on TV. Unbelievable.
That was even dumber than allowing word to get out that he had
hired what's-her-name to advise his campaign for 15 grand a month.
Was that unbelievable, or what?
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore ticket carries New Hampshire, and every other
New England state, not once, but twice! And Mr. Vice President
never even mentions that the state has never been as prosperous as
it is today. When I went up there against Paul Tsongas and Bob
Kerrey in the last year of Bush's term, those people were just
aching, and a lot of those old white clapboard houses badly needed
a lick of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're all working, they've got health insurance and 401
(k)s, and things have never been better. But do you think it ever
occurs to Big Al to remind folks they've never had it better up
there? Noooooo. But I'll just have to make sure Al gets the
nomination. I learned my lesson when I lost the Congress in the '94
election: if you give your sworn enemies the power to investigate
you, they're at your throat all day and all night.
</P>
<P>
   No way do I want George W. and the gang that runs him the chance
to beat up on me for four long years. Nope, Al's my man, even if he
is kind of lame as a campaigner. Still, I'm pretty confident he can
take Bradley. Those 800 super delegates give him a huge head start
on what he needs to take the convention.
</P>
<P>
   He can even lose New Hampshire and still make it. I really can't
see Bradley coming from the left and taking it from Gore. Health
care? That's Bradley's big ticket item? Where was he when I was
bleeding from every limb, trying to get Congress to pass that. Pat
Moynihan never could stand me. That's the trouble with those
intellectuals. They can't stand it when someone as smart as them is
better at politics too.
</P>
<P>
   Same for Bob Reich, my old Oxford buddy. Some ``Friend of
Bill.'' Well, Bob always was a ``soak-the-rich'' guy. Let them all
flock to Bradley. We'll still nail it down for Gore. We've got
labor, even though the AFL-CIO hates my trade policies. We've got
plenty of business types, even though they'd slink back to George
W. at the earliest opportunity, if I let 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. I'm going to be here, still in the business at the
same old stand, for another 14 months and change, baby. And don't
think I won't react if someone tries any funny business with
Bradley, or Bush, for that matter. All these pinhead pundits write
about me being a lame duck and all.
</P>
<P>
   Those idiots don't know the first thing about getting the people
on your side. I do that better than anybody in politics today. That
``Clinton fatigue'' crowd keeps writing about Lewinsky and
impeachment and all that. They don't know squat about how I
operate. I've got the people behind me because I deliver, baby. I'm
the Mailman in this league. I'm the Man when it comes to giving
them what they want.
</P>
<P>
   God, those Republicans running Congress are so dumb. Sure,
fellas, go ahead, shut down the government! Hey, why not trash
Social Security? What morons those guys are. It's hard for me to
keep a straight face when they come in here. Trent Lott and his
freshly starched white shirts. That Ole Miss frat boy just doesn't
get it. And Denny Hastert? Please. He can't deliver his own caucus,
never mind 51 percent of the House.
</P>
<P>
   I get China under the tent of the World Trade Organization, and
Old Trent can't handle it. I knew he was a no-hoper during
impeachment. He just doesn't have what it takes to tell his own
crowd when to shut up and take the deal. Just like the Kosovo
bombing campaign: Lott can't take the heat for a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's almost time for me to roll up my sleeves and haul
this Gore applecart out of the ditch. I just wish he'd be less
touchy about listening to me. After what we've been through,
Hillary and me, we can just about handle anything. If you know
anything about me, you know I'll do what it takes to win. And that
goes double for the first lady. Those people writing us off, like
I'm dead meat and she's some cream puff, they don't have a clue.
The reason we're here is because we know what it takes, and we've
got what it takes.

WAS AGNEW RIGHT ABOUT TV NEWS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ He was well-dressed and soft-spoken. He seldom
shouted or waved his arms. Spiro T. Agnew was a unique vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little over a week ago, I took a rather unusual step for a
vice president,'' he told a Republican dinner at Harrisburg, Pa.,
on Oct. 30, 1969. ``I said something. Particularly, I said
something that was predictably unpopular with the people who would
like to run the country without the inconvenience of seeking public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnew chose the targets of his icy wrath himself, just as he
chose the words from his off-kilter vocabulary. College students
protesting the war in Vietnam were ``encouraged by an effete corps
of impudent snobs who characaterize themselves as intellectuals,''
he said. Agnew was an overnight sensation among Republicans 30
years ago, which brought him to the attention of President Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon saw a bigger target: television news. Nixon's
speechwriter, Patrick J. Buchanan, ``went over the speech line by
line with the president,'' according to another Agnew speechwriter,
William Safire. Nixon approved Agnew's speech in Des Moines Nov.
13, to be telecast live, saying to Buchanan, ``This really flicks
the scab off, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The Agnew speech attacked the ``instant analysis and querulous
criticism'' after a Nixon speech on Vietnam and rallied conspiracy
theorists against ``a tiny and closed fraternity of privileged men,
elected by no one and enjoying a monopoly sanctioned and licensed
by government.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McCarthy called Agnew ``Nixon's Nixon,'' after the
slasher role Nixon played as VP for President Dwight D. Eisenhower
in the 1950s. The parallel also applied to Agnew's Throttlebottom
status. Ike mostly ignored Nixon and Nixon did the same to Agnew.
Another bond: Nixon and Agnew barely escaped jail.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later after this clumsy intimidation, conglomerates have
chewed up conspiracy theories. Some conservatives still see ABC,
CBS, and NBC as liberal, but a tiny and closed fraternity? Among
millions of stockholders in Disney and General Electric?
</P>
<P>
   One change has been good for those concerned about politics and
policy. C-SPAN is a beacon of such merit and probity that one wants
to pinch it. Instead, fans can cite the giddy Celia in
Shakespeare's ``As You Like it'': ``O wonderful, wonderful and most
wonderful wonderful! And yet again wonderful, and after that, out
of all whooping!''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the constants in television remain time and money.
The Television Advertising Bureau says that the average American
home set works a full shift, flickering for seven hours and 15
minutes daily. That dominance translates to total broadcast TV
revenues of $34.6 billion in 1998, up almost 7 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   When a television station comes up for sale, a new Gold Rush
erupts. Here in the nation's fourth-largest market, The Chronicle
Co. sold Channel 4, KRON-TV, for $823 million to Young
Broadcasting. The prospectors included the Gannett Co. and Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Since Agnew's attack, the networks have shrunk in budget and
influence and lost their central place in television news. ``The
networks have a smaller piece of the pie because of cable news and
local news,'' says Barbara Cochran, director of the Radio and
Television News Directors Assn. ``People don't rely on networks for
breaking news, so like newspapers, they depend more on analysis and
follow-up. Not only has the quantity of news increased locally, but
so has its influence. No one believes me when I say this, but local
television is the most trusted source of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnew's complaint is sometimes still echoed by those who enjoy
many more choices. The First Amendment still allows every citizen
to turn the dial or even to try out one of the most satisfying
features of every television set, the off button.

WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FIRESTORM OF SCHOOL TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The firestorm of school testing is raging out of control, with
thousands of children howling, trapped on the high floors of
expectation. The great debate is what to do next, whether to rush
in and save them from this test, or to tell them to jump, even
though we have made it clear that there is no safety net.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing for sure is that if we do not decide quickly, the
children and their futures will become ashes.
</P>
<P>
   This was evident from the 1999 Massachusetts Comprehensive
Assessment System scores. Passing the MCAS will be a mandatory
requirement for graduation in 2003. If it was mandatory today, 32
percent of 10th graders would fail in English and language arts, 38
percent would fail in science, and 53 percent would fail in
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   For the 10th graders, that represented a slight decline in
performance on the test. As bad as that is, the story for
African-American and Latino students is much worse.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of the 1998 MCAS scores released last week, the
Gaston Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy
at UMass-Boston found that among 10th graders, 49 percent of
African-American and 58 percent of Latino students failed English.
In science and technology, 65 percent of African-American and 70
percent of Latino students failed.
</P>
<P>
   In mathematics, 80 percent of African-Americans and 83 percent
of Latinos failed. A separate study by Tufts University found that
79 percent of Native American students also failed math.
</P>
<P>
   The failure rates are so high that the Gaston Institute predicts
that nearly one out of every three Latino students and one out of
every four African-American students will drop out of school.
``This is devastating to the community,'' said Miren Uriarte, a
researcher at the Gaston Institute. ``It will have a very heavy
economic impact in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a five-alarm emergency. While African-Americans and
Latinos are taking the hardest shots from the test, the Gaston
study showed that 13 percent of Asian and 10 percent of white
students may also give up and drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting an emergency like this will require parallel
strategies. Some parents are courageously challenging the validity
of the test itself as a mandatory part of graduation. Despite the
rush by politicians to impose high-stakes tests on school children
all across the nation, there is unbelievably little data, whether
at the K-12 level or at the college level, to prove that one-shot
standardized tests truly measure all the capabilities and skills
needed by individual students for either graduation or to predict
what they will become in college.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in their book ``The Shape of the River,'' former
Harvard and Princeton presidents Derek Bok and William Bowen
researched what became of 700 African-American students who would
have been bumped out of their chosen schools on test scores. About
70 of the freshmen became doctors, about 60 became lawyers, about
125 became business executives, more than 225 earned professional
degrees or doctorates, more than 300 are leaders of civic
activities. The average earnings of the 700 are more than $71,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test scores and grades are useful measures of the ability to
do good work, but they are no more than that,'' Bok and Bowen
wrote. ``They are far from infallible indicators of other qualities
some might regard as intrinsic, such as a deep love of learning or
a capacity for high academic achievement. Taken together, grades
and scores predict only 15 to 20 percent of the variance among all
students in academic performance and a smaller percentage among
black students.''
</P>
<P>
   The parallel reality is that the disastrous scores of
African-American, Latino, and Native American students in
particular and the mediocre statewide scores in general are utterly
unacceptable. Students must be held accountable within their normal
classwork for levels of reading, writing, and arithmetic necessary
to avoid being zombies in an economy that metaphorically speaking,
offers them only two choices, Microsoft or McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   But since many studies have well established that many urban
school systems have low expectations of their students, and since
the state cynically imposed the MCAS with all the subtlety of a
spiked gauntlet, fully expecting half of students to fail,
improvement will not come willingly from the schools or the state.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for achievement must come from parents, churches,
civil rights organizations, and student peer groups. If communities
decide to put their energy into teaching to the test, fine. If they
decide to fight the test, fraught as it is with issues of unequal
resources in the schools, and demand a richer curriculum, that
would be better. Doing nothing is not an option. That would leave
our children at the mercy of the leaping flames of school testing.
Their future is well on the way to being cremated.

MOAKLEY POLITICS PLAY WELL IN EL SALVADOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ US Rep. J. Joseph Moakley never claimed to be a
global thinker. The South Boston Democrat brags he is a
``bread-and-butter politician'' and proudly recalls that when he
first heard of El Salvador more than a decade ago, he couldn't find
it on a map.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason Moakley is so popular here.
</P>
<P>
   He was first sent to El Salvador to investigate a crime that
erupted into a diplomatic crisis: the killing of six Jesuit
priests, exactly 10 years ago this week. But when Moakley returned
here last weekend for the anniversary of the murders, along with
Representative James P. McGovern of Worcester, his former aide, he
was treated more like a local hero than a foreign diplomat. And
there were signs his involvement has helped pave the way for El
Salvador to begin solving bread-and-butter problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla rebels who once fought to topple the government now
lobby officials for access to clean drinking water. Roads once
dotted with security checkpoints are now being paved in an attempt
to focus on public works. And on Monday, for the second time in
Salvadoran history, officials opened a constituent services center
where voters can speak directly with their elected leaders _ an
idea straight out of the Moakley book.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in El Salvador ended just seven years ago, and the
country is still plagued with severe problems, including a
staggering violent crime rate and soaring levels of poverty. But
faith in the democratic system is starting to grow, a development
that by many accounts grew out of the process Moakley set in motion
with his 1989 investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundations of democracy are strong,'' said Ruben Zamora,
a member of the Salvadoran National Assembly who worked closely
with the Massachusetts congressmen during the investigation. ``That
is a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, after touring the country for three days, summed it up:
``The people that were shooting bullets at each other are now
shooting ballots at each other in the legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Such changes were virtually unimaginable on Nov. 16, 1989, when
the six Catholic priests, their cook and her teenage daughter were
dragged out of bed and shot dead in the garden of the University of
Central America where they worked.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of the crime scene were splashed across international
newspapers, arousing the passions of many Americans previously
unmoved by a war that had raged in El Salvador for years. House
Speaker Thomas Foley immediately demanded an investigation to
determine which of the warring factions had committed the murders _
leftist guerrillas or the Salvadoran military.
</P>
<P>
   It took Moakley and McGovern nearly two years to complete what
became known as the Moakley Commission, a controversial report that
concluded that top Salvadoran brass had ordered the Jesuit priests
killed because of for their leftist sympathies. The report made
Moakley a pariah among US foreign policymakers who supported the
Salvadoran government as part of the Cold War effort to back
anti-Communist forces around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But among many Salvadoran civilians _ who rarely heard US
politicians attack their government so vehemently _ the
investigation made Moakley and McGovern into symbols of justice.
Even today, McGovern says, the case grew into a larger crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both Catholics, so at first there was an element of,
`How dare they go out there and kill these priests?' '' McGovern
said. ``But as we got into it more and more, we realized this case
was an example of the larger issues in El Salvador. We realized
that a lot more was riding on this than just finding out who did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the Moakley Commission set the stage for the 1992
ceasefire that ended the civil war and allowed democracy to take
root. But brokering a peace agreement was never quite on Moakley's
agenda. He was busy adopting the Massachusetts-sized country as a
sort of sister constituency, having grown attached to so many
Salvadorans during his time there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew my name,'' he recalled. ``They always felt they
had a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a role he still revels in. Returning last Friday to speak
at the university where the priests were killed, Moakley and
McGovern were greeted by dozens of Catholic priests and local
officials. Many still requested their help, as much in solving
local problems as in elevating El Salvador's status in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Driving an hour outside the capital of San Salvador to a region
devastated by Hurricane Mitch, the congressmen stood in the blazing
sun and listened through a translator to a local leader describe
the living conditions: No electricity. No water. Virtually no
income from their meager crops.
</P>
<P>
   As they entered another town, young children stood at the edge
of the road holding homemade signs that read, ``We want dikes,
roads, drains!'' The congressmen pressed US Embassy and Salvadoran
officials about the timetable for getting public works in place,
aware that some of the $25 million in US funds allocated for
Hurricane Mitch relief would be picking up the tab. At one point,
McGovern encouraged a village resident to contact him in six months
to let him know whether a rural electrical system had been
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the residents seemed to understand the process of getting
their own elected officials to help, but they were eager to learn.
Mauricio Ramirez Santos, a former rebel fighter with the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, said he would welcome the
government into his 77-family community if it would mean new roads
and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the government cannot do everything in the post-war
period, but we think it is their responsibility to see how to solve
our problems,'' Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   The government faces many problems throughout the country, many
of which seem insurmountable in a stagnant economy that is only
getting worse. Some 30 percent of the country has no drinking
water, a higher rate than anywhere in Latin America. And crime is
worse in El Salvador than virtually anywhere else in the western
hemisphere, according to official estimates. More than 100,000 of
the country's 6 million civilians carry guns, according to one
account, and as many as two dozen people are killed by violent
crime each day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to surveys conducted by US Agency for
International Development, confidence in all branches of the El
Salvadoran government has increased. Charles E. North, director of
USAID's strategic development office in San Salvador, said the
agency is constantly asking itself: ``Are we making headway on
democracy issues?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are, in some ways,'' North said. ``We have seen
some improvements that, in some cases, are quite striking. Even
confidence in the police has been rather high.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one Salvadoran paid homage in a unique way to
Moakley's impact here. Nelson Recinos, 40, a financial consultant
for a coffee cooperative, said he had had a conversation that led
him to worry about Moakley's safety on the trip, and he decided to
contact authorities.
</P>
<P>
   To Recinos, his decision to report his qualms in itself signaled
a change. ``I felt confident that I was doing the right thing. I
wouldn't have thought that 10 years ago,'' he said. ``I even said
they could use my name. . . It was my way of showing thanks. It's a
way of thanking Moakley.''

MEXICO SCHOOLS IMPORT A US-STYLE SECURITY TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULTITLAN, Mexico _ With one exception, the typical school day
at the Juan Ignacio Ramirez High School is pretty much the same as
it always was.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200 students at this suburban Mexico City campus wear
their required maroon and green plaid uniforms with crisp white
shirts. Gym class is held in a dusty, enclosed playground, between
the concrete basketball court and the row of blooming
bougainvilleas. And the curriculum is the usual mix of basics,
English, and college-prep courses.
</P>
<P>
   But now students have to be ready at any moment for ``Operation
Backpack,'' when teachers and administrators conduct surprise
searches of their bags for anything that shouldn't be there _
especially guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know these are good kids,'' Francisco Islas Austria, the
school's principal, said last week while standing in his office,
full of trophies recently won by students. ``But it's gotten to the
point that we have to do this out of our conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   A sad but common reality of American school life has trickled to
its southern neighbor. Out of growing concern for troubled students
_ influenced by US-exported media images and affected by family
problems ranging from alcoholism to divorce _ teachers here have
adopted the American-style tactic of searching students' belongings
in order to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Islas said his school has been conducting these spontaneous
searches for a year, apparently making the school one of the first
in the country to resort to this strategy. At any point in the day,
even in the middle of a class, a small of group of teachers may ask
students to open their bags for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Education officials in Mexico state, the densely populated
region that arcs around the capital city, recently decided to
expand the bag-searching program to include all of the state's
14,000 elementary, middle and high schools. A total of 3.2 million
students would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Adding urgency to the implementation of ``Operacion Mochila,''
as the project is known in Spanish, was an incident two weeks ago
at Juan Ignacio Ramirez High School.
</P>
<P>
   A student brought a .22-caliber pistol to school by hiding it in
his bookbag on a day when no searches were done. He accidentally
shot himself and another student while taking the gun out to show
his friends. One of the students _ officials would not say which
one _ lost a thumb, but neither was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators insist that such incidents are rare in Mexican
schools, which are known for imposing a heavy dose of discipline.
What's more, authorities said, the country's strict gun ownership
laws make it difficult for anyone to have easy access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Gun permits must be obtained directly from the military. And
large-caliber weapons are forbidden to civilians, although they can
be bought on the black market, which smuggles US-made weapons
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   While many teachers and parents here say they have heard the
stories about places like Columbine and Jonesboro, where American
students opened fire on their classmates, their decision was not
based on worries that a similar tragedy would happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of what really affects students happens outside the
school, with friends, family, or strangers,'' said Eduardo Luis
Rivera Garcia, Tultitlan's former schools director. ``It's beyond
teachers' control, so this is a way to take some of our preventive
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor adding to teachers' concerns about what students
are doing outside the classroom, Rivera said, is the growing number
of students who show signs of problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of that, perhaps, is that teachers are finding
more drugs, knives, and other ``problem'' items in the backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children learn first from their parents, then from the
media,'' Rivera said. ``When the parents aren't there because of
money, alcohol, or separation, then that's when the problems begin,
and eventually those problems show up at school.''
</P>
<P>
   A few schools in Mexico City already use metal detectors to
check students for weapons. But Operation Backpack would be the
largest effort of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they will begin the program once all schools
have received approval from parents' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Most mothers and fathers, as well as local human rights groups,
seem to support the idea so long as the searches are limited to
students' bags and not their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate, especially if it means making things
safer for our children,'' said Magdalena Ornelas, 31, as she walked
near the town square with her 10-year-old daughter, Daniela. ``But
teachers must respect the children's privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she thought about the project, Daniela wrinkled her
nose in a half-frown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want someone going through my things,'' she said,
tossing a quick glance up toward her mother. ``But now I won't keep
anything special in my backpack.''

Muslim stereotypes. Egyptians here are rallying around Batouty, a

to be taking the suicide-based conspiracy theories surrounding the

U.S. SEES LITTLE COOPERATION FROM MEXICO IN ABDUCTION CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Norma Luna is proud that her Texas-born daughter
speaks fluent Spanish and could easily visit with relatives in
Mexico. It was a place where her daughter could learn about her
family's culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   But Luna, who lives in Buda, south of Austin, never suspected
that Mexico would become a hideaway where her now-missing daughter,
Laura, and hundreds of other children could be stashed by parents
bent on revenge after losing often-bitter custody battles in court.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department reported this month that at least 750
children caught in custody battles have been abducted by a parent
and taken to Mexico since 1991. It is the leading destination,
followed by Canada and Europe, for one parent fleeing the other
with their American children in tow. A congressional report to be
released in January finds that Mexico is among the countries least
likely to comply with an international agreement for the return of
abducted children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her and miss her; I am willing to do anything to get
her back,'' a tearful Luna, 25, said late last week of 7-year-old
Laura, who has been missing two years.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe that the girl was taken by her father,
Joel Garcia, to the border state of Tamaulipas. Officials say
problems can arise when parents have dual citizenship and in
determining whether an order by a judge in one country is valid in
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matters involving the welfare and custody of children are some
of the most difficult and emotional cases with which we must
deal,'' Mary Ryan, the State Department assistant secretary for
consular affairs, told a congressional panel earlier this month.
``When a parent abducts, or wrongfully retains, a child from his or
her home and prevents the child from having a relationship with the
other parent, the trauma to the child is immediate and compounded
each day the child is not brought home.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration, rage and sadness about children spirited from the
United States have led some parents to hire lawyers, lobby
government officials, recruit former soldiers trained in abduction,
and resort to ``snatch backs'' _ literally snatching a child and
bringing him or her back across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Americans taken out of America,'' said Thomas Carter
Jr., a former Green Beret and co-founder of Strategic Security
Group Inc., a company that charges as much as $100,000 to recover a
child. ``The longer (parents) wait, the harder it is for us,'' said
Carter, who recently helped parents recover children abducted in
Uruguay and South Africa but has not been hired for a similar
mission in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a rough deal. The Department of State has limits on what
it can do,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has traveled through mountains and jungles and posed as a
tourist to recover missing children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can either go through the legal system and not get your
child, or you can be proactive and get your child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jess Ford, director of international affairs for the U.S.
General Accounting Office, the investigative branch of Congress,
said the federal government has had mixed results in recovering
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of upset parents out there,'' said Ford, who
in mid-October forwarded to Congress a preliminary report on
international child abduction. ``It is a nasty situation. You are
talking about custody fights,'' he said from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's findings single out Mexico, Austria, Honduras, Mauritius
and Sweden as ``the most serious'' violators of an international
agreement regarding parental-child abductions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Mexican Embassy in Washington declined to
comment about the situation, as did the Secretary of Foreign
Relations in Mexico City. t( At the center of debate is the 1980
Hague Convention, an agreement among 54 nations that establishes
procedures to find children and resolve custody cases. State
Department personnel say that, while the agreement has been
successful, it can take years to get a child back and there are no
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Marshal, director of children's issues for the State
Department, said that while progress is being made to improve the
recovery of children, as the world changes, there are more cases of
a parent abducting a child and fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an ever-increasing problem as more and more
couples are multicultural,'' said Marshal, whose office helps
parents pursue the return of abducted progeny. ``It is more
importantly a family problem. These are children, and sometimes
parents in their anger forget what is best for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are hamstrung in dealing with Mexico on these
cases. While the United States honors about 80 percent of the
return requests from Mexico, Mexico honors about 3 percent of the
U.S. requests, according to statistics from the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children, an organization funded by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Mexican officials have met in California and most
recently in Mexico City to discuss international child abduction.
In what was described by the State Department as a ``small step,''
Juan Rebolledo, the Mexican undersecretary of foreign affairs,
agreed on the importance of the issue and suggested that
representatives of both nations meet as soon a possible to explore
solutions.

   SCI-GENE-LIFESPAN (Undated) _ Yielding a sharp insight into the
genetic reasons for death, a team of Italian scientists has
discovered a gene that controls lifespan in the mouse. In people,
where the gene was first found, the effects are unknown, but the
Italian scientists and other experts in aging say they can envisage
drugs that affect the gene being used as an anti-wrinkle skin cream
and perhaps for more serious rejuvenation effects. The new gene
fits into a pattern of other findings about aging, many of them

a major driver of the aging process. By Nicholas Wade. (1200 words)

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Consumer prices were subdued in October,
rising at 0.2 percent _ in line with expectations and the slowest
pace since June. The core rate of the Consumer Price Index, which
excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent after a 0.3
percent increase a month earlier. Cheaper energy prices were cited
as the reason for the slowdown from September, when consumer prices
surged 0.4 percent, even though energy prices have been rising
sharply over the last two weeks. Still, the tame data should
solidify expectations in the market that the Federal Reserve is
done raising interest rates for some time. By Louis Uchitelle.

<P>
   INDONESIA-HYPERMARKETS (Jakarta) _ The turmoil that accompanied
the collapse of Indonesia's corrupt regime could have been expected
to wreck the economy, impoverishing the affluent. Instead,
Indonesia's middle and upper classes have survived the crisis
intact, thanks to traditional values of thrift and mutual family
support, economists say, and now control a reservoir of wealth
capable of returning the region to long-term economic health.
Nowhere is this island of affluence amid a sea of recession more
visible than in a boom in hypermarkets. Carrefour and another
French chain, Promodes, now have five sprawling stores in Jakarta.

   INDONESIA-HYPERMARKETS (Jakarta) _ The turmoil that accompanied
the collapse of Indonesia's corrupt regime could have been expected
to wreck the economy, impoverishing the affluent. Instead,
Indonesia's middle and upper classes have survived the crisis
intact, thanks to traditional values of thrift and mutual family
support, economists say, and now control a reservoir of wealth
capable of returning the region to long-term economic health.
Nowhere is this island of affluence amid a sea of recession more
visible than in a boom in hypermarkets. Carrefour and another
French chain, Promodes, now have five sprawling stores in Jakarta.

NEW YORK TAKES A STEP TOWARD CLEANER AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD   
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki recently proposed that New
York adopt California's toughest-in-the-nation auto emission
controls. His decision provides an opportunity to inject a hearty
dose of reality into the fight to reduce pollution and impede
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminants spewed by each and every moving vehicle, but
more so by some than by others, contribute mightily to fouling the
air we breathe. It is a permanent truth, as certain as death and
taxes, that Americans will continue to elect to transport
themselves to work, personal chores and play in private cars and
trucks, forsaking public transportation when it happens to be
available.
</P>
<P>
   To combat such undermining of air and water quality, along with
helping to alter established weather patterns, many forms of
pollution need to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   For many activists, the demanding California standards were a
weapon to bludgeon car makers into producing zero-emission
automobiles. For a while, much hope was invested in electric cars.
The realities of producing a functioning and practical model put
that prospect on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the darling of those who seek a non-polluting auto is a
car fueled by hydrogen. Early signs point that this possibility is
at best also many years off.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it is eminently sensible to hold in abeyance the
part of the California standards that called for 10 percent of new
cars to have no emissions within five years. Instead, it is more
realistic to use those tougher requirements to compel manufacturers
to produce a more realistic product, one in which steady yet
incremental reductions are achieved for their fleets on average. By
these means, tailpipe emissions would be reduced by half or more
over the early years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Without having to hold our collective breaths waiting for the
electric or hydrogen car to materialize as the answer to our
pollution problems, it is preferable to force car makers to upgrade
vehicle performance today.
</P>
<P>
   This means that Washington and the states have to end the
practice of giving in to industry pleadings and pressures for
exceptions and postponements of performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   The weightiness of the announcement made by New York's
Republican governor resides in the fact that the auto industry from
now on will have to cope with more stringent regulations in their
two largest markets in this country. As Massachusetts has also
declared readiness to go along, auto manufacturers face a coalition
of three states in which the industry sells approximately one out
of every four vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its own
tougher requirements. Both sets of rules are more demanding, and
will in stages include sports utility vehicles, which along with
small trucks had enjoyed immunity from regulation not shared by
conventional cars. Because they are bigger and heavier, they use
more gasoline. Because they are so strikingly popular with car
buyers, they loom as a major and increasing polluting factor in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Left unconstrained by the sort of emission requirements imposed
on cars, they would vastly boost the speed at which the environment
would be undermined. There is no sign that the love affair between
Americans and their cars will diminish. Mobility is the
underpinning of the dynamics of our economy and, indeed, our
society and culture.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much worth preserving, but on terms that do not harm
our health and welfare. If there is any country in the world where
the skills and abilities exist to provide for cars that meet those
standards, it ought to be the United States.

PARENTS, GIRLS URGED TO DISCUSS MENSTRUATION EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELDA SILVA  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ She still plays with Barbies, loves Disney movies,
and likes to hear bedtime stories, but your little girl is growing
up _ maybe faster than you think.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the typical girl begins to menstruate at
age 12.5. However, girls may start as early as age 9. It is not
unusual for girls in third or fourth grade to have menstrual
periods, said Judy Robinson, director of the National Association
of School Nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard thing to imagine, but it does happen and these
young women need to be prepared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When is the right time to have The Talk with girls about
menstruation?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a social debate as to when to start talking to children
about sexual education, but I think certainly by the fourth grade
the concept of menstruation should be discussed with young girls,''
said Craig Witz, assistant professor in the department of
obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Health Science
Center in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Weston, a columnist for Girls' Life magazine and the
author of five books, including ``Girltalk: All the Stuff Your
Sister Never Told You,'' said discussing menstruation should be an
ongoing conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers should seize the opportunity to discuss the subject when
it arises, said Weston, who is featured in ``Straight Talk ...
Period,'' a 20-minute video produced by Playtex Products Inc. The
video is inteneded to stimulate conversation between girls and
parents about menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that your daughter is going through your purse
looking for a toy or a dollar and there's a tampon there. You
shouldn't say, `That's none of your business' or even in a nice way
`That's not for you' or `I'll explain that later,''' Weston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if your daughter is just, say, 9, you can go ahead and
say, `You probably know mature girls and women have something
called their periods once a month and this is something that I use
for that.' You can kind of normalize all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents should start talking to their children about their
bodies early on, Robinson said. ``They'll often ask about body
parts. We encourage parents to name them properly rather than
giving them cutesy names, just like you would talk about your
stomach. We encourage parents to talk about `your penis' or
whatever, so kids start to name things (correctly). And that takes
away from it being something to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   When it is time to talk about menstruation, a girl's body will
provide cues, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a matter of watching the changes that are going
on in children, and if your daughter is showing some of those
signs, that would be the time to start talking to her about what to
expect with those body changes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the first signs of puberty in girls are the budding
of breasts, some hair under the arms and the pubic area, and a
rapid growth spurt. Robinson said girls typically will have their
first period about six months later.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 study by the American Academy of Pediatrics,
girls are entering puberty earlier than previously suggested in
medical textbooks, budding breasts and sprouting pubic hair as
early as age 8. The same study says the average age at which
American girls begin to menstruate, however, has not changed
significantly in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that young girls are going through puberty earlier
than they did before has to do with nutrition almost assuredly,''
Witz said. ``Young girls who are better nourished have menstrual
periods at an earlier age. There's been all this concern and
arm-waving: Does it have to do with environmental factors and other
toxins? Are little girls being exposed to hormones earlier? Maybe.
But probably the big issue is, compared to 100 years ago in
industrialized nations, young women are given better nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   While the age the mother got her period may be a good indicator
for when her daughter will start, Robinson said parents should not
assume a girl will get her period at the same age her mother did.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the menstruation cycle lasts 28 days. About two weeks
before the start of the menstrual period, an egg is released by one
of the ovaries. The egg travels down one of the fallopian tubes to
the uterus. During the cycle, the uterus has developed a thick,
velvety lining to nourish and protect a baby in case of pregnancy.
If the egg is not fertilized by a man's sperm, the lining is shed
through the process of menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   The fluid that leaves the body through the vagina is
brownish-red in color, and though it may seem like more, it is only
about four to six tablespoons. Typically, menstruation lasts three
to five days.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, a girl's period may last longer. For the first couple
of years, menstruation may be irregular.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sometimes is a little bit disconcerting,'' Witz said.
``Older women during the reproductive age can predict when they're
going to have bleeding, which is every 28 days or so. That's
typically not the case with a 12-year-old. It's going to be
irregular, so she needs to be prepared.''

find a drawing on it,'' said Barksdale Maynard, who is researching
the life of Cole, one of the most famous artists of the Hudson
River landscape school. The ``drawing'' he discovered was in fact a

PERHAPS IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER MARTIN LUTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL S. HORTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of America's tots were going door-to-door for candy,
many Protestant churches were celebrating the day that a stocky
German monk nailed 95 debating points to a church door. Only this
year, on the 482nd birthday of that event marking the Reformation,
the Roman Catholic Church and a major worldwide Lutheran body
reached a milestone agreement on how human beings are saved, or
reconciled to God.
</P>
<P>
   I want to offer this sweeping indictment: Generally speaking,
Protestants no more than Roman Catholics give much thought to the
disturbing question that drove Martin Luther, as it did the
prophets and apostles before him: ``How can I, knowing who I really
am, ever hope to find a merciful God?''
</P>
<P>
   According to recent surveys, even most professing evangelicals _
who have counted themselves guardians of the gospel _ confuse the
gospel with helpful tips for life. Some reputable studies
demonstrate that 86 percent of this conservative Protestant
grouping agree with the statement, ``God helps those who help
themselves,'' and 75 percent say that human beings are basically
good.
</P>
<P>
   I expect this when I catch Robert Schuller on TV, but now
evangelicalism and mainline Protestantism seem to be generally
characterized by vague moralism _ not an outright rejection of the
beliefs that have shaped their communities in the past so much as a
lazy love affair with the present moment.
</P>
<P>
   We all want to believe that, deep down, we're good people who
just need a little direction. But Christianity tells us that the
bad news is worse than we thought. ``There is no one righteous, no
not one,'' Scripture declares. What we need is not redirection but
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   These alternative ways of viewing salvation no longer represent
Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, respectively. Today, despite
their official theology, Protestants are just as likely to think in
terms of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.
</P>
<P>
   I know a lot of Catholics who don't believe that they are
accepted by God because of their merit, and no doubt those who
reached the recent Lutheran-Catholic agreement thought that they
were defending both unity and the gospel. But not all of us are
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that Rome has changed. (In fact, Rome would want
us to say that it has not changed in its doctrine.) But it's
incontrovertible that Protestantism has.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Attended with regal celebrations, Cardinal Edward Idris Cassidy,
the papal emissary for church unity, and Bishop Christian Krause,
president of the Lutheran World Federation, officially agreed that
the central issue of division is no longer an obstacle to unity.
</P>
<P>
   That apparent obstacle to unity is the doctrine of
justification.
</P>
<P>
   According to Luther, John Calvin and a host of Reformers whose
spiritual descendants represent the largest and most vibrant branch
of Protestant Christianity, Scripture is perfectly clear about how
salvation happens. It starts with a sober view of human nature
after the fall of our first parents, leaving all of us helpless to
save ourselves _ even with God's help.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect righteousness and holiness that God's character
requires (with which God endowed humanity in creation) has been
lost, and it cannot be regained by human effort. Even the
Christian's best deeds are mingled with self-interest and
self-righteousness, so (as St. Paul addressed the subject) ``the
righteousness which is of the law'' is a path that can only lead to
condemnation, while ``the righteousness which is of faith'' is a
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: God sent Jesus Christ into the world, not
merely as a moral example to show us how to become acceptable to
God but rather to live under the terms of the law, perfectly
fulfill its righteous demands, while taking upon himself our guilt
on the cross. There he was judged by God for our unrighteousness;
and in his resurrection, we _ the guilty _ are now declared
righteous.
</P>
<P>
   Our guilt is ``imputed'' or ``credited'' to Jesus Christ, while
his righteousness is imputed to us. Luther called it ``the
marvelous exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at the time of the Reformation (as in our day, across
the denominational landscape), popular religion had been seized by
superstition and ignorance. This is not even disputed by Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger, chief doctrinal officer for Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Salvation could even be purchased, as a popular ditty expressed
it: ``When the coin in the coffer clings, a soul from purgatory
springs.'' It was this practice that Luther's famous theses
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   When Renaissance scholars began to investigate the original
Greek New Testament texts, many among their number concluded that
the medieval church had fundamentally misread the Scriptures. A
popular slogan of medieval theology was: ``God will not deny his
grace to those who do what lies within them.'' Do your best, God
will take care of the rest _ or as Benjamin Franklin put things,
``God helps those who help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The official Roman Catholic position adopted at the Council of
Trent in response to the Reformation was that although salvation is
by grace (God's unmerited favor), it is not by grace alone. Initial
grace in baptism was a gift, but it could be improved or lost based
on one's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, believers could never be certain that their
obedience and cooperation were sufficient to merit final
justification _ that is, acceptance before God on Judgment Day.
</P>
<P>
   Is this righteousness or justice that God requires possible in
this life? That was one of the big questions. Maybe not in this
life, said Rome, but perhaps in the next (i.e., purgatory).
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant Reformers argued that here again Scripture was
perfectly clear. Jesus announced that his mission was ``not to call
the righteous, but sinners,'' which is only good news if one really
recognizes and experiences oneself to be a sinner. Although a
Christian will never be good enough to deserve God's acceptance,
even with God's grace working in one's life, he or she could be
fully accepted in Christ through faith alone. Christ's
righteousness alone, not the believer's, made one acceptable to
God.
</P>
<P>
   That was the heart of the Reformation _ in comparison to which
debates about such matters as the authority of the pope, the nature
of the sacraments and the role of Mary paled. St. Paul called the
doctrine of justification by grace alone, through faith alone,
because of Christ alone, ``a stumbling block'' _ even a
``scandal.'' It was and still is a tough pill to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's Council of Trent ``anathematized'' (condemned) this
teaching that the churches of the Reformation regarded as nothing
less than the gospel itself, and classed its adherents as heretics.
</P>
<P>
   So why this walk down memory lane? Because nobody seems to
remember. Most _ even regular churchgoers _ just haven't heard
these distinctions in a generation or two. The ignorance in
Protestant churches today may even rival that of medieval religion.
People today, including evangelicals, appear to be more interested
in being ``relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to be useful to a culture driven by fads doesn't exactly
accommodate a faith that has historically been concerned about
passing the convictions of one generation of Christians down to
another. Doctrine, that rewarding but difficult matter of what one
believes and why one believes it, is a liability these days.
``Whatever works for you,'' people say, as if there were no such
thing as a God of justice as well as mercy, a future reckoning or a
future life. Religion equals therapy, at least one version of it.
</P>
<P>
   Other Protestants have increasingly come to regard religion as
the expression of one's own inner experience or social and
political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Luther's warning is, therefore, just as relevant today among
Protestants and Catholics alike: If you look within, at your own
inner experience, resources, morality or felt needs, you will never
find salvation. It only comes by looking outside of oneself, to the
God who has spoken clearly in Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``gospel'' means ``good news,'' and if salvation
depends on my performance to any degree at all, then I would say
that Christianity represents a serious instance of false
advertising. A recent convert could reasonably complain: ``Look,
you told me that my salvation depended entirely on what God has
done in Christ _ and now you believe that it's OK to believe that
it depends in part on what God has done in Christ and in part on
what I have done for God.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a different emphasis, an improvement on theological
hair-splitting _ rather, it determines whether we're fudging a bit
when we say that this is good news.
</P>
<P>
   I'm aware of the ecumenical discussions that have taken place in
recent years. In fact, I've closely studied the ecumenical
documents from the time of the Reformation (when the Reformers
themselves burned the midnight oil to attempt to achieve agreement
with Rome) to the present. There have been great successes in this
process.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this past Oct. 31 in the city of Augsburg,
Germany, where the Lutheran Confession was adopted, the
announcement was that agreement on justification had been achieved
at last, even though there was no evidence of Rome having changed
its official position.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the rhetoric is more charitable. In fact, phrases
are used that seem to affirm that salvation is by God's grace alone
on the basis of Christ alone through faith alone _ but these things
are not actually said. They are not actually said because Rome
continues to affirm, as its most recent catechism illustrates, that
after believers die, ``they undergo purification'' in purgatory
``so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of
heaven'' (page 268).
</P>
<P>
   ``Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for
ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification,
for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of
eternal life'' (page 487).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not Rome that has changed, but Protestants. While
Rome has remained reasonably faithful to its principle of ``semper
idem'' (always the same), modern Protestantism has craved
innovation, often at the expense of what some of us would still be
willing to call ``truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting that we return to a
period like the 19th century in which we caricatured each other's
views, and feared that any day the pope would try to take over the
world (or at least America) through Irish immigration. Furthermore,
who can doubt that we have a lot to learn from each other and to
affirm together?
</P>
<P>
   The conversation should continue. In fact, judging from the
state of affairs in Protestantism, conservative to liberal,
misunderstanding the gospel is a serious problem for all of us. The
difference is that Rome still officially condemns the message that
we are ``justified freely by his grace apart from works of the
law,'' as Scripture puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is willing to make a choice between the gospel's
clarity and pursuing the unity of Christ's visible church. But the
general reporting on this event has ignored the dissent of millions
of relatively friendly, open-minded Christians who insist on the
priority of the gospel over unity.
</P>
<P>
   For us, it's not about winning an argument or getting the other
side to admit they were wrong. It is a lot deeper than that. It has
to do with whether we can know that we have peace with God and
confidently relate this good news to other sinners like us. There
is no reason for accepting this age-old division if Protestantism
itself is largely mired in a benign moralism that has reduced it to
a feel-good religion for America's middle class.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's only religious bigotry that would keep us
divided when there were not inalienable matters of conscience at
stake. But for those of us who are still convinced that
justification or acceptance before God is, as St. Paul declared,
``by faith apart from the works of the law,'' the denial of this
leaves us in complete despair.
</P>
<P>
   These two gospels are easily distinguished without a lot of
theological jargon. One says that on Judgment Day, God will find in
me the righteousness that he justly requires because I have
fulfilled his will. The other says that on that day, although God
will find nothing more in me to merit eternal life than he might
find in the most vilified criminal, the merit of Christ is
sufficient to acquit me before his bar and robe me in perfect
righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   Is this just a bunch of theology, remote from our concerns? If
so, it only measures the extent to which our churches have been
willing to ignore the most important part of their job. Those who
think that they are good enough to appear before God's judgment in
their own righteousness, albeit assisted by God's grace, are
welcome to give it a try. But, convinced that a day of reckoning is
up ahead, a lot of us are still unwilling to call that ``good
news.''

HIPPIE COUTURE IS COOL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSE MARY BUDGE  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Wow, man. What a flashback. Embroidered bell
bottoms, peasant blouses, ponchos, fringe and beads _ plenty of
beads _ have emerged from nostalgia as free-spirited hippie styles
make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Call it neo-hippie chic. Call it Bohemian. Call it a backlash
against boredom. Bohemian dressing stands in sharp contrast to the
plain styles that have dominated the fashion scene for many years.
Forget tailored blazers and basic-black T-shirts. We want color,
and we want embellishments such as embroidery, feathers and fake
fur to crank up the wardrobe volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most colorful things you've ever seen _ really
fun clothes _ and just seeing them puts you in a good mood,'' said
Donna Kaler, who runs Anniegoglin, an apparel boutique in San
Antonio. ``There's a strong influence from other countries and
cultures, lots of pattern mixing, decoration and texture. But the
secret lies in the mix. You combine the elements in your own way,
which gives every outfit personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sui, Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford for Gucci are just a few of
the big names into the mix. And they're charging big prices (you
need $3,000 for those feather-trimmed Gucci jeans). The good news
is, there's no need to pay so much. Watch for inexpensive knockoffs
_ there are plenty of them for less than $50. Thrift shops and
second-hand stores also are an option. Get some faded bell-bottom
jeans and add your own embellishment.
</P>
<P>
   With free-wheeling hippie haute, the attitude counts more than
the label. There hasn't been such a liberated attitude in fashion
since the '60s when flower children shed their ladylike suits and
panty girdles for braless blouses, bell bottoms and embroidered
denims. Couturier Yves Saint-Laurent sanctioned the movement in the
1970s when he presented an entire collection of folkloric looks and
peasant dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Kaler gets a kick watching teen-age customers discover Bohemian
dressing. ``They just go wild over the possibilities,'' she said.
``But the styles aren't just for the young. Almost everything is
suitable for any age. And for those of us who've worn it and loved
it all before _ oh, what memories!''
</P>
<P>
   Trend-tracker David Wolfe of the New York-based Donnegar Group
thinks nostalgia is behind the Bohemian boom. People are reflecting
on times past and longing for lighthearted clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Bohemian styles fill the bill. They help you connect with
history and with other cultures. They allow you to play with fun
stuff such as fringe, feathers, embroidery and beads. In an age
that's mass-marketed and machine-produced, the styles celebrate
arts, crafts and individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put the clothes together almost any way and it's
fine,'' said Irene Ojeda of Christine's in San Antonio. ``Long
coats work with short skirts, stripes can mix with animal prints
and feathers can go with fur. You can dress the clothes up, you can
dress them down _ the look can be casual, exotic, Oriental,
contemporary or just about anything else. There really aren't any
rules. I guess you sort of make up your own rules as you go
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this fashion freedom might make some people
nervous. For the fashion-timid, Kaler said, one or two pieces
instead of a complete turnout might be best. For example, a woman
could wear embellished jeans with a conservative sweater, carry a
crochet bag with an afternoon dress or combine an embroidered top
with a business suit. Little touches can reflect the trend, she
explained. But you will never know how much Gypsy is in your soul
without experimenting.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to ``A History of Fashion'' by J. Anderson Black,
Madge Garland and Frances Kennett (William Morrow &AMP; Co., $15.95)
Bohemian dressing originated with the Gypsies who traveled Europe,
adding colorful elements to their costumes everywhere they went.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s and '70s, this ethnic dressing moved to the
forefront when designers got interested in other cultures. Gaucho
trousers tucked into Russian Cossack boots, cheongsams from the Far
East, sarongs from the East Indies and embroideries from Japan
marched down the runways shaking up couture. Eventually it all
filtered down to the hippies, who naturally gravitated to offbeat
forms of dressing.
</P>
<P>
   But is offbeat dressing appropriate most places?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the occasion and the crowd and make sure the outfit's
appropriate,'' Ojeda said. ``Maybe underplay things if you're
really concerned. But on the other hand, don't worry too much. To
make a fashion statement these days, you need to be a little
daring.''

AUSTEN' MOST CHALLENGING WORK VIBRANTLY BROUGHT TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  3 stars  
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent years have brought us a number of Jane Austen movies, but
no filmmaker has had the nerve to tackle her most challenging work,
``Mansfield Park,'' until now. For one thing, it's a big book,
ideally suited for a miniseries (the BBC produced one in 1985). And
its main character, a Regency period Cinderella named Fanny Brice,
is passive and restrained, hardly the kind of heroine in which
movies delight.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Patricia Rozema has solved that problem in her lively
adaptation of ``Mansfield Park'' by going straight to the heroine's
source _ Ms. Austen herself. Rozema, who wrote and directed the
film, consulted what remains of Austen's letters and journals to
create a new Fanny, a headstrong writer with the sly sense of humor
and distinct moral vision.
</P>
<P>
   In doing this, Rozema has created a cinematic composite: part
adaptation, part biography. Austen lovers, as well as moviegoers
who love a good costume drama, should be pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Mansfield Park'' opens, Fanny is 10 years old, living in
a squalid, rat-infested home in Portsmouth. Her mother, wanting a
better life for her eldest child, sends Fanny to live with her
wealthy relatives, the Bertrams, at the solemn Mansfield Park. Life
is easier here, but hardly rewarding. Fanny is treated as an
inferior to the Bertrams' two daughters. (Lady Bertram tells them
to prepare for ``gross ignorance.'') Her only solace comes from her
kindhearted cousin Edmund, who encourages Fanny to pursue her
passion for storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   As Fanny (Frances O'Connor) becomes a young woman, she matures
into a spirited and clever writer and begins to attract the
attention of visitors to the estate. The arrival of the libidinous
Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola) and his equally worldly sister,
Mary (Embeth Davidtz), plays havoc with Mansfield's social order.
</P>
<P>
   Henry becomes smitten with Fanny after a brief flirtation with
the eldest (and engaged) Bertram sister, Maria (Victoria Hamilton).
Mary zeros in on Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller), much to Fanny's silent
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in a host of unrequited loves, societal pressures and artful
dialogue and you have all the trappings of an arousing Austen
adaptation. That's not to say that all of Rozema's tinkerings add
up. She flirts with a lesbian attraction between Fanny and Mary for
no apparent reason and fails to generate enough convincing heat
between Fanny and Edmund (it was OK to love your cousin in those
days) to give their romance the necessary tension. The latter is a
rather significant failing.
</P>
<P>
   Rozema does play it deliciously close to the vest, though, when
it comes to the true characters of the Crawfords, particularly the
dashing Henry. Fanny, like Austen herself, has doubts about
marriage, even though the institution was vitally important to a
woman of her limited means. And Fanny, rightly or not, mistrusts
Henry. In bringing the Crawfords' sexuality to the fore, Rozema
gives the movie a force that many of these period pieces lack.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is uniformly good. O'Connor, seen previously in the
Australian comedy ``Love and Other Catastrophes,'' is a revelation
as Fanny, bringing the heroine alive with a scintillating spark.
Davidtz and Nivola pack plenty of heat as the cosmopolitan
Crawfords, and playwright Harold Pinter is excellent as the
fallible patriarch of Mansfield Park.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the best Austen adaptation to appear in recent years,
but Rozema, with her revisions, has created a fresh piece of work
and a fascinating heroine, a modern (for her time) woman that Jane
Austen would undoubtedly have loved.

the house, picked it up and turned it over. ``I was astonished to
find a drawing on it,'' said Barksdale Maynard, who is researching
the life of Cole, one of the most famous artists of the Hudson
River landscape school. The ``drawing'' he discovered was in fact a
eerie rendering of a castle, done on a lithographic stone. ``Cole
died in the 1840s,'' he said. ``It's astounding that this artwork
would be just kicking around, for 150 years.'' By Tracie Rozhon.

   &QL; 
``MY MOVIE BUSINESS'' &QL; 
By John Irving (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New &AMP; Notable has had occasion to talk with a
number of good writers whose books have been made into movies,
including Alice Walker (``The Color Purple''), Michael Ondaatje
(``The English Patient''), Sue Miller (``The Good Mother''),
Russell Banks (``The Sweet Hereafter''), Anna Quindlen (``One True
Thing'') and David Guterson (``Snow Falling on Cedars''). Almost
without exception, the happiest among them were those who had
relinquished control, who recognized from the start that they were
writers of novels, not screenplays. They took the money, handed
over their books and waited to see what came of it. Over the years,
John Irving has chosen a different path. He declined to write the
screenplay for ``The World According to Garp,''but he was involved
enough in the filmmaking process to rankle under the changes that
Steve Tesich made in his novel. He also declined to write the
screenplay for ``The Hotel New Hampshire,'' then watched as Tony
Richardson made a farcical exaggeration of the book. Irving did not
decline to write a screenplay for ``The Cider House Rules.'' In
fact, he wrote many of them, draft after draft for director after
director. Over the course of 13 years, he worked with four
directors and wrote so many versions of the script that he learned
how to do it right. His first draft, written when he still believed
a film should be true to a novel, would have made a nine-hour
movie. The final script whittled a 500-page novel down to 136
pages. By that time, Irving knew that ``a screenplay, as a piece of
writing, is merely the scaffolding for a building someone else is
going to build.'' This memoir of his moviemaking experiences is
unabashedly self-indulgent, a chance for Irving to talk about his
novels, his children and friends, his grandfather (whose work as an
obstetrician influenced the story of ``Cider House'') and his
success. It's also a chance to plug the movie, which is set to open
here next month. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE ART OF THE STORY'' &QL; 
Edited by Daniel Halpern (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This international anthology of contemporary short stories
includes work from 78 contributors from 35 countries. All of the
writers were born from 1938 to 1970 and were chosen by Halpern to
represent a greater sensitivity to popular culture than those
included in his earlier volume, ``The Art of the Tale.'' These
stories, he says, are ``less in `the classical mode' and more
reactive to the media in all its venues. These younger writers have
distanced themselves _ sometimes subtly, sometimes less so _ from
the influential writers practicing during the first two or three
decades of the 20th century.'' Raymond Carver just made the cut, as
did Margaret Atwood, Richard Bausch, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates,
Amos Oz, Kenya's Ngugi Wa Thiong O (EDITORS: how it's listed at
amazon.com ) and Argentina's Luisa Valenzuela. Among the younger
writers are Lorrie Moore, Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, Bobbie Ann
Mason, Tobias Wolff, Barry Hannah, James Kelman, Richard Ford,
Deborah Eisenberg, Banana Yoshimoto, Martin Amis, Turkey's Murathan
Mungan, Ghana's Ama Ata Aidoo and Lebanon's Hanan Al-Shaykh. Also
here are writers from Cuba, Nigeria, Martinique, India, Haiti,
Vietnam, Russia, Hungary, Somalia, Uruguay, France, Tanzania,
Poland, Scandinavia, South Africa and China. &QL; 
``ENCHANTED NIGHT'' &QL; 
By Steven Millhauser (Crown, $17) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the night of revelation. This is the night the dolls
wake. This is the night of the dreamer in the attic. This is the
night of the piper in the woods.'' This passage is a sign of
ethereal things to come. Millhauser, who won a Pulitzer Prize for
``Martin Dressler,'' has written an otherworldly story in brief
passages that portray people in a Connecticut town one hot summer
night. There is Havershaw, a 39-year-old man who lives in the attic
of his mother's house and struggles to find some justification for
his life. There are ``the outlaws,'' a gang of teenage girls who
break into houses and steal unimportant things (refrigerator
magnets, toothbrushes), always leaving behind the same note _ ``We
Are Your Daughters.'' There is Janet Manning, a young woman with
sensuous thoughts of the handsome stranger she met on the beach
that day, and William Cooper, a young man with a crush on a lovely
mannequin in the window of a department store (a mannequin that
will, on this magical night, come to life). And all across town,
the old, forgotten dolls stored in attics begin to wake up and
shake their dusty limbs. Some town, huh? Millhauser's dreamlike
tale _ a mere 109 pages long _ is grounded in the familiar longing
of his characters and played out under a big, white moon on an
enchanted summer night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FRONTIER CHILDREN'' &QL; 
By Linda Peavy and Ursula Smith (Oklahoma, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was sadder to see than the graves of children who died
along the westward trail as their families traveled with the wagon
trains of the mid-1800s. And nothing was more triumphant than news
of children who made the journey and began a new life. Peavy and
Smith, whose previous collaborations were ``Pioneer Women'' and
``Women in Waiting in the Westward Movement,'' offer a clear-eyed
view of what frontier life was like for youngsters of Chinese,
Hispanic, Native American, African-American and European
backgrounds. Because the experiences of these children were largely
undocumented, the authors have relied on stories handed from one
generation to another, the few existing letters and diaries written
by frontier children, journals kept by explorers and missionaries,
and, most important, photographs. Their text is accompanied by 206
black-and-white images, and some of them will break your heart. &QL;

 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a year ago that Diamond Multimedia introduced the
Rio PMP300, the world's first portable MP3 music player, and
spurred an audio revolution in downloaded music.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are more than a dozen variations on the theme,
portable players offering features like FM-radio tuners and
easy-to-use controls. More important, the players _ costing from
about $200 to $400 _ are moving toward improved storage capacity so
they can carry more tunes. Most players store no more than 64
minutes of high-quality music.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fewer than a million MP3 players have been sold in the
United States. But audio market analysts and MP3 player makers say
they expect sales to be brisk this holiday season and beyond. One
reason is that mainstream America has begun discovering digitized
music on the Internet. Every day, about 17 million MP3 files are
downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous portable players, MP3 players have the
significant advantage of having no moving parts. As a consequence,
they are practically skip- and flutter-proof and the batteries they
use last longer. And the sound is near CD quality.
</P>
<P>
   The rage for MP3 has manufacturers scrambling to ride the next
digital wave. In the spring, Samsung Electronics plans to introduce
an MP3 player that will play not only downloaded music files but
also still pictures and video from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the widening popularity of online music and portable
devices that play it, Packard Bell NEC recently introduced the NEC
Home Music Studio system, a personal computer that is designed to
capture, manage and make digital music. Built-in software allows it
to download and upload music to and from an MP3 player.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is no guarantee that MP3, which is a format for
compressing and storing digital audio signals, will continue to be
the compression format of choice. Sony has introduced a digital
player that uses its own audio format. And there are other software
approaches to storing digital music on the way from major players
like Microsoft, IBM, Liquid Audio and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But a Betamax-style demise of MP3 may be years off, some
analysts say. In the meantime, one MP3 maker, Creative Labs, is
hedging its bets with its new Nomad II, a digital player equipped
to adapt to whatever audio format is winning the day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such future-proofing comes with a cost: about $100
more than the price of its nearest competitor. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. SONY CD WALKMAN D-EJ01 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sony's CD Walkman D-EJ01, a sleek, slick and shiny update of the
portable CD player, looks as if it might have fallen off the
starship Enterprise. Breaking with classic clamshell design, the
D-EJ01 does not open; it loads CDs with a slide-in mechanism and
plays them with remarkable fidelity and power. Besides being
reasonably shock resistant, the $349.95 player also promises 62
hours of continuous playback with NiMH rechargable batteries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. SKIPDOCTOR  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SkipDoctor is a $34.99, handheld, hand-cranked device that lives
up to claims that it can repair damaged optical discs, whether they
are CD, CD-ROMs, DVDs or game discs like those used in Sega's
Dreamcast. SkipDoctor is best used to repair troublesome scratches,
and is reliable and fairly simple to use. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. PANASONIC DVD-L50 PORTABLE DVD/CD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DVD-L50 Portable DVD/CD player by Panasonic is nothing less than
a home theater that can fit in the palm of your hand. Amazingly
compact, the $999 player opens to reveal a five-inch LCD color
screen and half-dollar-size stereo speakers linked to a fully
functioning DVD/CD player. Films are remarkably sharp whether they
are seen on the player or are piped to a television with supplied
patch cords. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. REPLAYTV 2001 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first of several new tapeless video recording devices to
arrive this year, ReplayTV lets you watch a ``real-time recording''
of a live program, put it on pause to answer the phone or grab a
snack, then return to pick up your viewing where you left off, even
as the recording continues.
</P>
<P>
   The ReplayTV 2020 model ($699) records up to 20 hours of
television programs on a hard disk drive and enables couch potatoes
to create their own television channels based on their favorite
themes _ not just series names like ``Star Trek'' but also
``fishing'' or ``Michelle Pfeiffer.'' It requires a phone jack to
download the latest program schedules each night, but in doing so
it also automatically resets the clock. The era of the flashing
12:00, alas, is over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   5. SONY MDR-IF330RK CORDLESS HEADPHONES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MDR-IF330RK cordless headphones by Sony ($129) are designed for
anyone who wants to have his sound delivered without being tethered
to its source. The headphones, which also connect to home audio
systems, televisions and VCRs, provide a solid sound with good deep
bass capacity. Its transmitter, which promises 100 hours of
(rechargeable) battery life, has a range of 24 feet. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. AUDIOVOX MP DJ &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lower-cost MP DJ by Audiovox is a late but notable entry
into the MP3 music player category. Tiny, even by MP3 standards,
the MP DJ has a startling sound nonetheless. Taking advantage of
its odd, stop-watch shape, the MP DJ has a large liquid crystal
display and logically placed controls. The $179.95 player comes
with 32MB on board and can be upgraded with additional memory. Even
the download software that comes with it is cute. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. SRS LABS WOW THING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WOW Thing by SRS Labs is a makeup-case-size device that when
plugged into a personal computer's sound system creates stunning
power and 3-D sound effects _ on the cheap. Costing $29.95 and sold
only on the Web at www.wowthing.com, the device is simple and
effective. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. CREATIVE LABS CD-RW BLASTER 8432 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW Blaster 8432 by Creative Labs is a handy and, better yet,
speedy way to use a personal computer to create or copy CDs and
CD-ROMs. The $299.99 CD writer and rewriter is among one of the
fastest and most modestly priced devices of its kind. It can record
(to write-once disc) 60 minutes or 545 megabytes of data in under
nine minutes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. AUDIBLE.COM MOBILEPLAYER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to take the author Frank McCourt on the road,
Audible.com, which offers thousands of downloadable versions of
books on tape available for PCs and PDAs, also makes the
MobilePlayer. The 2-megabyte device can hold two hours of audio and
comes with a cradle for downloading. Alone, the player is $99; the
player is free when you purchase $9.95 of content from Audible.com
every month. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10. RIO 500 DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more powerful version of the planet's first MP3 player, the
new Rio ($269) is elegant and packed with 64MB of memory that can
be expanded with an additional memory card to 96MB. The Rio 500
connects to computers (PCs running Windows 98 and Macs) by way of a
USB port and a much improved download software. Most of all, its
sound is rich, full and detailed.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   11. SONY MINIDISC MZ-R55 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a year on the market, MiniDisc MZ-R55 by Sony is still the
finest and smallest digital device to record and play back
prerecorded music. While it is barely larger than the
2.5-inch-square blank minidisc, the device can faithfully record up
to 74 minutes of music on the disc from practically any source.
Handsome in its metal skin, the $349 MZ-R55 produces a sound that
is true, full of dynamic range and highly resistant to skips. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12. SONY GLASSTRON PLM-S700 PC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLM-S700 PC Glasstron virtually allows wearers to carry a large
screen in their pocket. A pair of hyperhi-tech wraparound glasses

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not difficult to attach an exhaust vent to a clothes
dryer, but the hookup must be done properly to avoid the
possibility of fire. According to the National Fire Protection
Association, almost 14,000 fires each year are caused by improper
venting of the dryer or careless maintenance procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Before hooking up a vent line to your dryer read the owners
manual. This will outline the steps for installing the vent, but
beware, because some of guidelines may not meet code requirements
in your community. A few manuals, for example, say that it is
acceptable to vent the dryer indoors if it is in a large, open
room.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons this is not a good idea. In the first
place, most codes prohibit this type of venting. Second, the
average load of wash from the washing machine will retain about one
to two gallons of water after the final cycle. The dryer pulls that
moisture from the clothes and expels it into the air as vapor. This
extra humidity will eventually condense on insulation, timbers and
metal, causing them to deteriorate, rot or rust. Also, venting a
gas dryer indoors can be dangerous because the air discharge can
contain a combination of potentially lethal combustion gases.
</P>
<P>
   Dryer manuals specify the diameter of the ducting to be used for
venting. Most dryers have a four-inch diameter male take-off
fitting on the back of the appliance. Attach a duct of the same
diameter to this fitting. Using duct with a narrower diameter would
restrict the airflow. Using a wider duct would diminish the force
of the airflow and allow lint to settle at the bottom of the duct
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Codes are often strict about the length of a dryer vent. Most
codes limit a straight run, without bends, to 25 feet. Subtract
five feet from that distance for each 90-degree bend. Thus a dryer
vent with two 90-degree elbows cannot exceed 15 feet in length. The
type and size of the vent hood at the end of the duct also affects
the total length. The standard vent hood that has a four-inch and
will not affect the length of the duct run. If, however, you
substitute a hood with a narrower two-and-a-half-inch reach you
must subtract six feet from the length of the total duct. Thus the
15-foot dryer vent in the previous example would now be shortened
to 9 feet if a two-and-a-half-inch hood were attached.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even with a hood the duct is still an open hole that
could prove inviting for small rodents, birds or insects. Some
homeowners place a piece of screening across the opening to keep
out pests. The problem with screening is that it captures lint and
restricts the airflow. This could cause the dryer to overheat
during operation. It is better to install a back-draft damper
(available at home centers and appliance supply stores) in the
duct. The damper has a spring-controlled flap that remains shut
until the force of the dryer air pushes it open.
</P>
<P>
   Duct material includes flexible vinyl, flexible Mylar foil,
flexible aluminum and rigid aluminum. Flexible vinyl was once
popular as a ducting material, but now many codes prohibit using it
and foil for dryer ducts. The main problem with using flexible
ducting is that the ridges throughout the length of the duct catch
lint. These accumulations of lint will block the airflow so the
duct must be cleaned periodically. This is not a problem with rigid
aluminum ducts. For this reason rigid aluminum ducts, not flexible
ones, should be used if the duct is to be enclosed in a wall or
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Now matter what type of ducting material you use, the sections
should be joined end to end with either approved clamps or tape.
There are two types of duct clamp available. One is all metal and
it looks like a large hose clamp for a washing machine or
automotive radiator hose. The other type of clamp is made of
flexible plastic. Both are available at home centers.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the familiar gray fabric duct tape or metal foil
tape to join sections. Fabric tape is cheaper than metal foil tape
but not as durable. The hot air passing through the duct will cause
it to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you use clamps or tape is largely a matter of
preference. Do not, however, use sheet metal screws or pop rivets
to joint sections of duct. These would snag lint and pose a fire
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   All dryer ducts should be inspected and cleaned at least twice a
year. This may require disconnecting a section or two so you can
look inside and vacuum out lint accumulations. Afterward,
reassemble the sections then check all the connections to make sure
they are secure.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE BUYING A COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After nearly a quarter-century of intense research by many of
the greatest technical and marketing minds on the planet, personal
computers still force the average consumer to decipher an
eyeball-glazing catalog of technical mumbo-jumbo like this, from a
recent newspaper advertisement: ``ATX w/300 Watt PS, 48x CD Rom,
9.1 GIG LVD U2W 2MB Buffer, 128MB PC100 ECC RAM, Intel PIII 500
w/Fan, 8 MEG ATI Xpert 98 AGP, 3Com 905TX 10/100 NIC ... ''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Apple iMac has been such a popular computer. Until
recently, the most daunting task for iMac buyers has been choosing
a color: Grape? Tangerine?
</P>
<P>
   Some day, likely early in the next millennium, most computers
will be as easy to buy as the iMac. The emergence of so-called
information appliances, Web pads, smart phones and new-generation
PC's is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be people whose socks roll up and down in
excitement when they see a list of specifications for a new PC,
just as there are those who care passionately about the cubic
inches, cylinders and horsepower of an automobile engine, or the
combined slugging percentage and on-base average for baseball
players. For many people, especially professionals, the megahertz
and megabytes are worthy of intense scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us the goal is to get the best deal on a
personal computer that will meet our computing and communications
needs, and budget, for a few years before it becomes obsolete. To
make that choice easier, I offer a guide to buying a personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that almost any personal computer sold now has more
than enough power to handle tasks like word processing, e-mail,
keeping a calendar, managing a contact file, balancing the
finances, playing games, running educational software and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But the real value of a PC is not as a calculating engine but as
a communications device. Sending and receiving e-mail has become
the most commonly cited task for personal computers, followed
closely by doing research on the Internet. An Internet connection
harnesses the resources of millions of computers worldwide and
transforms an ordinary desktop PC into the most powerful and
versatile knowledge machine available to the average person.
</P>
<P>
   So, no matter what computer you choose, get a modem. To grossly
oversimplify it, a modem is the telephone that a computer uses to
call the Internet over regular phone lines. Specifically, get a 56K
modem, often called a V.90 modem.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, for those who plan to spend a lot of time online
and who have access to a high-speed cable or digital subscriber
line (DSL) Internet service, get an Ethernet card. Cable and DSL
are the two leading options for connecting to the Internet at
speeds many times faster than a 56K modem. Such services require
something known as a Network Interface Card, or NIC. An Ethernet
card fits the bill. Macintoshes come with Ethernet cards.
</P>
<P>
   BRAND NAME _ The differences in actual components used by the
major manufacturers are minimal. Any decent byte mechanic can screw
together off-the-shelf components to make a PC that works just as
well as one assembled by a corporation. The real issue is how well
the PC maker deals with you before, during and after the sale.
Experienced PC users who need no hand-holding can find good deals
from clone shops. For beginners, I recommend staying with one of
the big companies.In the most recent PC Magazine survey of service,
reliability and support, only IBM, Dell and a smaller vendor,
Quantex, earned Readers Choice ``A'' ratings for desktop computers.
IBM and Sony topped the list for notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   WINDOWS VERSUS MACINTOSH _ The choice between these operating
systems is almost religious in nature. Mac users are in the
minority but believe they are a click closer to heaven. Windows
could be described as a digital code version of a Hieronymous Bosch
painting, but it has a monopoly on PC sales, or so the judge says.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the more specific stuff.
</P>
<P>
   MICROPROCESSOR _ There are no practical, functional differences
between the market-leading Intel and Advanced Micro Devices chips,
or the less common Cyrix chip.Intel makes two flavors, the basic
Celeron, which is a good value for home PC's, and the advanced
Pentium III, which is favored for games, multimedia and more
demanding professional applications. The Advanced Micro Athlon chip
is an impressive performer and represents the most serious
challenge to Intel's hegemony. Do not buy anything slower than 350
megahertz unless you plan to replace the PC soon. Do not buy
anything faster than 600 MHz unless you are spending someone else's
money or are seriously into video and gaming.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORY _ RAM, or random access memory, is system memory. When
people ask how much memory your computer has, RAM is what they
usually want to know. Typically measured in megabytes, RAM is like
your own memory: It works great when you are awake (the power is
on), but evaporates when you go to sleep (the computer is shut
down). More RAM is better, because it means the processor does not
have to run to the filing cabinets so often. So if you can afford
it, pile it on. If the budget is tight, it is better to upgrade the
RAM and downgrade the processor. Do not buy less than 64 megabytes
of RAM. Get 96MB if you can, or 128MB if you have used the word
``multimedia'' in a sentence more than once this week.
</P>
<P>
   Another important kind of memory is called Level 2 (L2) cache,
which mainlines data to the processor at high speed and improves
system performance. The important thing is that there be an L2
cache. The amount, usually measured in kilobytes (for example,
512KB), falls under the more-is-better rule, but any is better than
none.
</P>
<P>
   Video or graphics memory is another type. Make sure your system
has at least 4MB of this kind, or, if games and multimedia are
important, 8MB. Some larger monitors need more video memory.
</P>
<P>
   STORAGE _ If you are like me, it is imperative to write things
down lest they be forgotten. That is where storage comes in. Most
personal computers come with a hard disk drive, whose capacity
these days is typically measured in gigabytes (GB). Do not get less
than 6GB. If you plan to save a lot of digital photographs or MP3
music files, or are a compulsive pack rat, go for 10GB or more.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all computers today come with a CD-ROM drive. Some PC
makers tout their CD-ROM speed, like 40X or 48X, but in general
anything over about 20X is superfluous. If you can afford it,
consider replacing the CD-ROM drive with a DVD drive. It does
everything a CD-ROM drive does, but it also transforms the PC into
a DVD movie player.
</P>
<P>
   Hard disks fail, although not as often as they used to.
Inevitably, they fail when you forget to make a backup of your data
files. Backing up your files is the computer equivalent of brushing
and flossing your teeth, only more important. Floppy disks are fine
for backing up a handful of important files, but now that hard
disks are measured in gigabytes, it would take a bushel of 1.44MB
floppies to make a dent in one's backup duties.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, get a Zip drive, which stores 100MB on a relatively
cheap, removable disk. Zip drives get the job done. For more fun,
however, get a CD-RW recordable drive. But we're running out of
space, so that will be discussed in a future column.
</P>
<P>
   MONITOR _ The new standard is 17 inches. Once you have opened a
bunch of World Wide Web pages, you will understand why anything
smaller is a pain. If desk space is tight, or if budgets are loose,
consider a new flat-panel monitors. A 15-inch flat panel offers the
same screen size as a 17-inch conventional monitor.
</P>
<P>
   PORTS _ The computing world is shifting to Universal Serial Bus
(USB) as a common standard for connecting printers, scanners and
other peripheral devices. The connections are faster and easier
than the older serial and parallel ports. But then remember to buy
USB peripherals.

   Memories of a Favorite Rose
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I always admired the lovely pink roses that
used to grow near the sculpture of Gandhi at the south end of Union
Square Park in Manhattan. These wonderful bushes seemed to start
blooming in June and still went strong into November. What were
they, and could they be grown in our Zone 4 garden in upstate New
York?
</P>
<P>
   A. If she was anything like her floribunda rose namesake, the
real Betty Prior might have been that pretty girl in high school we
all loved to hate. Not only has it been a very popular rose since
its release in England in 1935, it had already won a gold medal two
years before.
</P>
<P>
   The clusters of mildly fragrant, single flowers are simple and
lovely, pink with white centers, reminiscent of dogwood blooms.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific bloomer, it is often the first to flower in summer
and the last to quit. It is a perfect blender, welcome in any
garden, getting along well with annuals, perennials and evergreens.
</P>
<P>
   While Betty Prior is reasonably tolerant of cold, heat, disease
and amateur gardeners, Zone 4 is chancy at best. Winter protection
and a sheltered site may work, but you would be better off with a
rose from the Canadian Explorer or Parkland series, hybrids with
the hardiness of rugosas and the prolific, long bloom periods of
modern roses. Like that girl in school, Betty Prior is good, but
not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for the Explorer and Parkland Series roses include
Roseraie at Bayfields, P.O. Box R, Waldoboro, Maine, 04572-0919
(207-832-6330; free catalog), and Pickering Nurseries, 670 Kingston
Rd., Pickering, Ontario L1V 1A6 (905-839-2111; catalog is $3).
</P>
<P>
   Can These Shrubs Be Tamed?
</P>
<P>
   Q. We recently moved into a city neighborhood with many large
houses built in the 1920s. The foundation plants consist of very
old yews, andromeda, junipers and some azaleas. They've been
allowed to grow quite high and have been ``shaped'' with a hedge
trimmer. Many are obstructing the light coming in the ground floor
windows. I'd like something more interesting and am inclined to
replace many of them. On the other hand, I wonder how they would
fare if I simply chopped them off at an acceptable height and
allowed them to grow in.
</P>
<P>
   A. As you suspect, not all shrubs can be arbitrarily chopped off
successfully. While your yews would probably be fine after many
years of recovery, the junipers would be iffy. The Japanese
andromeda (one of the more confusing common names for Pieris
japonica) would never recover its grace or beauty and, if cut too
far down, would die. The azaleas, however, would respond well to
pruning, even if you took them down to only a foot tall for a major
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   If the andromeda and yews are 8 to 10 feet tall, you may want to
try pruning the shrubs up from the ground, turning them into small
trees. The view through their trunks is bound to be more
interesting than looking into thick foliage.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to replace them, think before you act. Practically
every garden-worthy shrub has many named cultivars available,
including ones that are shorter than the typical species. Visits to
libraries or botanical gardens and an evening spent with a few
gardening catalogs should be your first steps.
</P>
<P>

43rd St., New York 10036, or by e-mail to gardening(AT)nytimes.com.

YOU CAN'T HAVE GOODS SENT TO A MOUSE PAD

  (One of a series of articles on holiday online shopping) 
 (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By IAN AUSTEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-Commerce is like comedy. Coming up with ideas is easy;
delivery is hard.
</P>
<P>
   If the explosion in online shopping had taken place in 1959
instead of 1999, getting packages delivered might have been easier.
In 1959, many homes still had milk boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a disconnect,'' said Carter Griffen, a
co-founder of Mental Physics, an e-commerce systems company, based
in Vienna, Va., that is hoping to profit from the situation. ``The
front end of e-commerce _ placing an order _ is very sexy, very
easy. Receiving the order, however, is problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   His company is one of a few promoting the idea of a jumbo
mailbox for online parcels. After recently purchasing the patent
rights to Smartbox, a roll-up household parcel container that was
invented by a Kansas City, Mo., dry cleaner but never made it to
market, Mental Physics is developing a series of locked, reinforced
boxes of various sizes that will sit outside houses.
</P>
<P>
   To allow access to all delivery services, the yet-to-be-named
devices will be wired to the Internet. When the box owners make an
online purchase, special software will create and transmit a code
for each order. A delivery driver can punch in the code on a keypad
to unlock the box and make the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Streamline.com, has at least one variation of
that idea already in place. The company, which runs errands and
delivers a variety of goods to suburban customers outside Boston
and Washington, installs boxes with a full-size
refrigerator-freezer and two room-temperature shelves in the
basement or garage of customers as part of its service fee of $30 a
month. To allow its drivers access to the boxes, Streamline also
fits keypad locks on its customers' doors. About 3,700 houses now
have Streamline's boxes, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a widespread belief that any kind of superbox for
parcels will be a hard sell and perhaps unworkable outside spacious
suburbs. Even Streamline is developing portable dry ice containers
that it will leave outside the houses of customers who will not, or
cannot, accept more permanent boxes. It's a solution that has been
used for decades by Omaha Steaks, a mail-order giant turned
e-commerce merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see boxes working right now,'' said Elaine Rubin,
chairman of Shop.org, a trade group for online retailers. ``I've
got enough bikes, baseball bats and other junk in my garage
already. I don't need a big box in there as well. Outside, it's an
eyesore. And how often do people order online, anyway? About three
times a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out where parcels can be safely sent is an issue that
buyers from ordinary mail-order catalogs, which outsell online
merchants by a wide margin, have long encountered. Jill Frankle,
director of retail research at Gomez Advisors, said she expected
online buyers to use the same kinds of solutions for the next three
to four years. ``The current system works for most people,'' Ms.
Frankle said.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, Ms. Frankle suggested, a solution is getting
packages delivered at work. While she knows of no firm data that
support her view, Amazon.com's ``purchase circles'' lend it at
least some anecdotal support. To help its customers make choices
about books, music CD's and videos, Amazon creates best-seller
lists grouped around shipping destinations, including corporate
offices.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those lists are filled with books that are
probably work-related (Boeing's is heavy on engineering and
computer tomes, and the most popular book on Microsoft's list is
the latest offering from its chairman, William H. Gates 3rd), many
strongly suggest that either a lot of niche book clubs are meeting
in cubicles or offices have become a handy delivery spot for
Amazon's boxes. The top seller at the Gillette Co. is Bret Lott's
``Jewel,'' a novel about a child with Down syndrome, which is
followed on the list by Thomas Harris' novel ``Hannibal.'' At
Nabisco, the cookie and snack maker, diet books figure prominently.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Amling, the director of e-commerce for United Parcel
Service, has no doubt that many of the boxes its brown vans deliver
to offices are either online or catalog purchases. While he is not
aware of any companies that have complained to UPS about being
overwhelmed by employees' holiday shopping, Amling said, ``As
volumes continue to increase, it would make sense that some
employers would object.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubin, of Shop.org, anticipates that as online shopping
increases, the answer to delivery problems will come from the
delivery companies themselves, who might start allowing customers
to schedule delivery times, particularly after work. ``I think
that's more reasonable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amling said such schemes would not be viable for some time.
Until then, he said, solutions depend on drivers' initiative. ``Our
drivers,'' he said, ``have a relationship with their customers that
allows them to know who wants us to leave the package under the
lawn chair and who wants it on the front porch.''

DIGITAL CAMERAS IMPROVE AS THEIR PRICES FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is one in a series of articles on holiday online
shopping)  
 (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Digital photography and digital video are two of the
fastest-growing uses for today's personal computers. Analysts
expect more than 3.5 million digital cameras to be sold this year
in the United States, typically to PC owners who want to send
photographs via an e-mail message, create family photo albums on
personal Web pages or simply explore digital imaging as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of digital photography is such that America
Online, the world's largest Internet service provider, has added a
``You've Got Pictures'' greeting to augment the familiar ``You've
Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Early digital cameras were expensive and had such low picture
quality, or resolution, that they fared poorly in a comparison with
a $10 disposable camera. But that changed this year. Megapixel
digital cameras, which capture images made up of more than a
million picture elements, or pixels, are now available for less
than $500.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of even better cameras, with two-megapixel
resolutions, arrived this summer for about $1,000. The smallest of
the two-megapixel cameras, the Fuji MX2700, is made of aluminum and
can be carried discreetly in the pocket of a jacket. It is
available for less than $600.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with relatively inexpensive, photo-grade inkjet printers
and photo scanners, these cameras along with computers enable
consumers to take, edit and print high-quality color photographs at
home. Using glossy paper, even a casual shutterbug can produce
photos that are nearly indistinguishable from the prints from a
decent 35-mm camera and a professional film developer, except that
no film is involved. The high-grade paper is expensive, though,
about $1 per 8x10 sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, digital video cameras that can transfer movies
directly to a home computer screen for editing are becoming common,
although they are not as popular in this country as they are in
Japan. The new Apple iMac DV computers come with a program called
iMovie that lets amateur videographers create everything from home
videos to short features. Apple expects desktop video to eventually
become as popular as desktop publishing.
</P>
<P>
   One tip: If digital imaging seems appealing, make sure the
computer has lots of memory, lots of storage space, lots of
processing power and fast connection ports like USB or, better,
IEEE 1394.
</P>
<P>
   Nikon CoolPix 950
</P>
<P>
   Resolution, measured in megapixels, is one way to evaluate a
digital camera. On that score, the Coolpix 950 offers an impressive
2.1 megapixels. The camera has an excellent autofocus and gives the
serious amateur photographer control over aperture, shutter speed
and metering. The lens is top-notch and offers 3X optical zoom. But
the 8 megabyte Compact Flash card is stingy. The price of the
camera is listed at $999, but is frequently discounted. Batteries
and a charger are extra, so expect to spend about $1,000 even if
the camera is discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Canon Canoscan FB 1200S
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras are great, but most people have albums and shoe
boxes full of old photographs. The Canoscan FB 1200S is a
convenient way to capture those prints as digital images so they
can be stored and edited on a computer. This flatbed model has a
optical resolution of 1,200 dots by 1,200 dots per inch, with a
color depth of 36 bits (yielding more accurate colors than many
other scanners). It can be found online for less than $500.
</P>
<P>
   Visioneer OneTouch 7600
</P>
<P>
   The OneTouch makes it easy to copy documents and attach them to
e-mail messages, make faxes and, of course, scan color photographs.
Although the speed and quality (maximum 600 x 1,200 dots per inch)
will not be quite as good as with the Canon model, the price is
better, less than $150. It is easy to use, and made easier by a USB
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Deskjet 970Cse
</P>
<P>
   The Hewlett Packard Deskjet 970Cse ($399) does a superb job with
digital photos and is an excellent printer for text documents. It
prints text pages at up to 12 pages per minute, and it is a duplex
printer, which means it can print on both sides of a page. The
970Cse has a new engine and an improved color cartridge with more
nozzles and smaller ink droplet size. That allows it to produce
color photos (on special paper) with resolutions up to 2,400 by
1,200 dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   Sony DCR-TRV510 Digital Handycam
</P>
<P>
   Sony's Digital 8 Handycam has many of the features of the new
digital camcorders, including superior picture quality, near
CD-quality sound and the ability to snap digital still photographs,
add special effects and easily transfer images to a personal
computer. Unlike other digital camcorders that require special
cassettes, the Sony Digital 8 uses the less expensive and widely
available 8-mm and Hi8 video cassettes. The DCR-TRV510 is larger
and heavier than most DV camcorders. The list price is $1,399.

GIFTS EASY TO BUY ONLINE, HARDER TO RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (One of a series of articles on holiday online shopping) 
 (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While hauling merchandise back to the store after the holidays
is an inconvenience, digging up receipts, finding addresses and
boxing up items to ship back to an Internet retailer thousands of
miles away can be an off-the-charts hassle, so much so that many
shoppers simply do not return items they bought online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes me a couple of months before I get around to
sending it back, and after a while, itbecomes too late,'' said
Ruth Hereford of Las Vegas, who shops regularly at NetMarket, CDNow
and Amazon. ``For something that costs $20, it's just not worth
packing it up, putting some note in it and going to the post
office.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in store for Web gift-givers and recipients after all the
wrapping paper's been stuffed into recycling bags?
</P>
<P>
   Most reputable online retailers give a consumer 30 days to
return a product for a refund, a store credit or an exchange, but
the similarities in their ``100 percent satisfaction guarantee''
return policies often end there.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon.com, for example, will grant a full refund,
minus the cost of shipping and handling, other online purveyors of
CD's, software and consumer electronics will penalize shoppers for
opening packages or for not returning items right away. Insight
(www.insight.com) and Egghead (www.egghead.com) are two of many
retailers that charge restocking fees of 15 to 20 percent on the
price of an item, including taxes. Both Insight and Egghead will
levy the fee if the product is not returned within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the merchant has sent the wrong item, shipping charges
for returned items are always the consumer's responsibility. If the
buyer has documentation showing that something was sent by mistake,
most retailers will cover the cost of shipping it back. For that
reason, it is important to keep a printed confirmation of the order
form that the retailer sends via e-mail and to pass it along to the
recipient of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Martinez, chairwoman of the New York State Consumer
Protection Board, advises against purchasing any insurance offered
toward the safe delivery of a product. ``If it breaks on the way
over, it's their responsibility,'' she said. If the product does
arrive damaged, and it was purchased with a credit card, Ms.
Martinez said, a consumer may have recourse through the credit card
company.
</P>
<P>
   People who buy and return new PC's and other computer equipment
will confront a hurdle in the return process known as the Return
Merchandise Authorization number. In most cases, a consumer must
call the customer service number listed in the packing materials or
on the company's Web site to get an authorization number and attach
it to the returned item before sending it back. Consumers must get
a Return Merchandise Authorization number before the manufacturer's
deadline, which can range from 15 to 90 days from when the product
was received.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization number helps ensure that a merchant is not
being sent merchandise bought elsewhere. ``Especially in the
consumer electronics industry, merchants have to be careful that
people are returning what they say they bought,'' said Richard
Chin, a spokesman for Amazon, which now sells computer-related
equipment. ``It also allows customer service to understand why it's
being sent back.''
</P>
<P>
   If a product is defective when it arrives or breaks during use,
some electronics companies will offer the customer a refurbished
replacement unit. Palm Computing, for example, gives each customer
an option: After mailing back a PDA, the customer can wait up to
several weeks for repairs or can accept a refurbished device as a
permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how necessary return authorization numbers are,
getting them can be challenging. Some companies make their customer
service numbers difficult to locate on their Web sites or, worse,
require the buyer to write a letter to customer service to get a
Return Merchandise Authorization number.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Internet shoppers is that many online clothing
and home-furnishings retailers also operate brick-and-mortar
storefronts. Banana Republic, Gap, Eddie Bauer and Barnes &AMP; Noble
will permit customers to return items they bought online at actual
retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who must ship items for a refund or exchange, the
two most viable delivery options are through United Parcel Service
and the Postal Service. If the item is sent via UPS, the merchant
will often enclose a return label that can be attached to the box.
The UPS Web site (www.ups.com) is equipped to calculate return
charges based on package weights and geographic distances, and
shipping tags can be bought with a credit card and printed out.
Although the Postal Service has started an electronic merchandise
return service called Returns(AT)ease that allows customers to pay
for and print out merchant return labels, only Altrec.com, an
outdoor clothing and equipment retailer, has signed on to use the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither UPS nor the Postal Service Web options provide an easy
solution for those who need to return merchandise in large packages
from their homes. UPS charges about $10 for each pickup; shipping
is an additional charge. Express couriers like Federal Express and
Airborne Express will make pickups, but they can charge much more
than $50 for pickup and shipping, depending on the shipment's size
and weight. And although a Postal Service letter carrier will
accept packages for sending out, ``within reason,'' said Robert
Anderson, a spokesman for the Postal Service, a more likely
situation is that shoppers will draw on their dwindling reserves of
holiday cheer and head to post offices themselves.

EXPLORING WORLDS ON CD-ROMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is one in a series of articles on online shopping)  
 (af)  
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interactive CD-ROMs have largely been ignored in the frenzy of
the Internet land grab, left to collect dust on computer store
shelves, but intriguing educational titles are still being
released. The descriptions below are drawn from articles that
appeared in Circuits this year.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE'S BIRTHDAY ADVENTURE
</P>
<P>
   (Humongous Entertainment; $29.99; Macintosh Power PC, System 7.1
or later, and Windows 95 and 98; for ages 3 to 6.)
</P>
<P>
   All the genius of ``Blue's Clues,'' the much acclaimed preschool
television program, has made its way into this clever think-along
CD-ROM. Children help the dog named Blue and her owner, Steve _ our
human guide through a cut-paper landscape _ prepare for Blue's
birthday party. Children work through nine activities, each of
which can be set to a different skill level.
</P>
<P>
   This is a thoughtful piece of software. Decisions are reviewed,
clues are repeated and praise borders on the lavish. And when all
the clues are in, everyone repairs to the Thinking Chair to
consider alternative solutions. Smart. (Feb. 11)
</P>
<P>
   JAMES CAMERON'S TITANIC EXPLORER
</P>
<P>
   (Fox Interactive; $29.98; Windows 95 and 98, Power Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   This three-disc package is more than just a video of the popular
movie. A timeline using archival photographs, documents and brief
clips from the movie, with narration, provide a nice visual and
oral summary of the ship's history.
</P>
<P>
   The software is at its best when feeding the insatiable appetite
for Titanic trivia. There is a modest but fascinating archive that
includes a complete passenger and crew list, builders' plans for
every deck and biographies of many passengers and crew members.
(April 8)
</P>
<P>
   POWERS OF TEN INTERACTIVE
</P>
<P>
   (Pyramid Media; $79.95; Windows 95 and 98, and Macintosh 7.1 and
later.)
</P>
<P>
   Powers of Ten Interactive is dedicated to expanding the ideas of
the husband-wife design team of Charles and Ray Eames. Charles
Eames is best known for his furniture _ the plywood chairs and
chaise longue he did for the Herman Miller company. But with Ray,
he was also a multimedia innovator. Together, they created about 88
short films and pioneering multiscreen and multipanel exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   There are many wonderful pieces here, like a short video that
takes the viewer up a road, across a meadow and into the living
room of the Eames house in Los Angeles, a landmark construction of
off-the-shelf industrial parts.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating the Powers of Ten disc, however, proved to be a
challenge. The program slaps together portraits of thinkers on time
and space, from Descartes to Einstein, with bits of science and a
history of the Eameses' work thrown in: exactly the sort of
needless complexity it was the genius of the Eameses to cut
through. (May 13)
</P>
<P>
   BODY VOYAGE
</P>
<P>
   (Southpeak Interactive; $24.95; Windows 3.1, 95, 98 and NT, and
Mac 7.0 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   This eerie tour of the human body is about as close as you are
likely to get to the atmosphere of a Renaissance dissection. A
computer artist selectively reconstructed the digital images of a
cadaver (a Texas murderer) into colored cross-sections and airy
three-dimensional renderings.The viewer can twirl the entire
skeleton on its axis, peel off layers of skin and muscle to reveal
the organs underneath and pan along the various planes of the body
as if peering from a tiny helicopter traveling over, under and
through the body's terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Body Voyage is not the place to learn rigorous anatomy. But
there is plenty of ambience. (July 8)
</P>
<P>
   DICK HYMAN'S CENTURY OF JAZZ PIANO
</P>
<P>
   (JSS Music; $49.95, Home version; $99.95, Pro version; Windows
3.1 and later, and Macintosh 7.0 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hyman, the jazz pianist and historian, has spent his career
educating audiences about the great figures of prewar jazz. As a
result, the videos, etudes, biographical nuggets and diabolically
difficult quiz on this two-disc set are weighted toward the early
giants of jazz piano.
</P>
<P>
   One large section is given over to Art Tatum, where Hyman
details runs and intervals, analyzing Tatum's style; in ``Ragtime
to Stride'' and other segments, he emphasizes how successive styles
built on what came before, like how the role of the left hand
gradually changed from ragtime into stride to the sophisticated
post-stride of, say, Teddy Wilson and finally to the jabbing bebop
minimalism of Bud Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman is not offering beginner piano lessons here. But for
pianists or even vaguely interested casual musicians with a bit of
jazz knowledge, Hyman gracefully connects the historical dots.
(Aug. 5)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY.COM'S CENTURY OF COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   (Starworks; $29.98; Windows 3.1, 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   Billed as ``the world's first interactive country music
encyclopedia,'' this disc is designed to appeal, so say its
creators, to both casual and academic fans. They may be half-right.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hear Sleepy LaBeef discuss his debt to rock 'n'
roll, this is the place. If you want a video clip of Hank Williams,
you will be disappointed, as is the case for almost every other
major star.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus of Century of Country is its encyclopedia. One
outstanding feature is a searchable database of awards, record
labels, management companies, birthdays, even fan clubs. But the
CD-ROM has one overriding weakness: its silence, odd for a
multimedia disc about one of America's great indigenous art forms.
(Aug. 5)
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPLETE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
</P>
<P>
   (National Geographic/Mindscape; $149.95 for CD-ROM, $199.95
(DVD-ROM); Windows 3.1 and later, Macintosh 7.5 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic Society boasts that the collection
includes every cover (1,247), every page (190,000), every article
(9,300), every photograph and illustration (180,000) and every
advertisement to appear in its pages, all scanned directly from the
original magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And the pictures look great. The magazine's pages are displayed
a spread at a time, and the scans were optimized to favor the
photographs. The words, however, are often faint and barely
legible, even on a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the 109-year archive yields split-second results. But
browsing is the best way to follow National Geographic's evolution
from a scholarly scientific journal with a conservative, dark-brown
cover and no photographs into a legendary publication that today
reaches 50 million adults and children each month. (May 13)
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIAN TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   (Maptech Windows; $39 for each CD-ROM, $139 for set of four;
Windows 95, NT and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   The Appalachian Trail _ 2,160.3 miles, from Springer Mountain in
Georgia to Baxter Peak in Maine _ is no walk in the woods. Hikers
who travel a section of the trail make up the bulk of the users,
and they are the ones who would benefit most from this set of
CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The discs offer plenty of maps, photographs and descriptions.
The guides include trail mileage, elevation ascents and descents,
locations of shelters and sources of water. There is also a
description of what a hiker will encounter. A 2.3-mile stretch of
the trail in Virginia near Hawksbill Mountain in Shenandoah
National Park, for example, includes the altitude at the summit
(4,050 feet, the highest point in the park), the mountains visible
from the trail and the places to find the three-toothed cinquefoil,
which blooms in late spring. (Sept. 30)
</P>
<P>
   THE SUPREME COURT'S GREATEST HITS
</P>
<P>
   (Northwestern University Press; $29.95; Macintosh and Windows 95
and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   The Supremes have a compilation disc, but don't expect to hear
Diana Ross on this one. Instead, this CD-ROM platter, produced by
Northwestern University Press, is crammed with more than 70 hours
of often passionate legal debate that was recorded on tape in the
nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Included on the compilation are memorable cases like Roe vs.
Wade, New York Times vs. Sullivan and Miranda vs. Arizona. The
recordings, which date from 1955, can be heard in their entirety.
The CD-ROM also includes pictures and biographies of all the
justices who have served since 1957 and background information on a
range of opinions that cover issues like race and freedom of the
press. (Sept. 2)
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY TREE MAKER DELUXE VERSION 7.0
</P>
<P>
   (Broderbund; $89.99; Windows 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of those people who has been meaning to compile
your family history since ``Roots'' was broadcast in 1977, help is
here. Broderbund's latest version of Family Tree Maker contains a
whopping 20 CD-ROMs of genealogical information, and the program
promises access to more than a billion names.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to templates for your own family tree, the deluxe
version offers the digitized Social Security Death Index and an
International Marriage Records Index, plus discs containing
American military records, land records and 900 years of birth
records for the United States and Europe. Users also receive a free
four-month subscription to GenealogyLibrary.com, a Web site with
more than 2,000 rare books, census microfilm records and online
databases to search.

   Flat-panel monitors are sleek and stylish, but they are at least
triple the cost of conventional CRT displays. This ``stealth
black'' beauty, a $1,249 work of desktop sculpture, offers
brilliant images and as much usable screen space as a 17-inch CRT

   MICROSOFT INTELLIMOUSE EXPLORER
</P>
<P>
   With its sleek silver-and-gray body and glowing-red underbelly
and taillight, this mighty mouse is unlike anything else out there.
It uses optical sensors to find its way around with greater
precision than any conventional mechanical mouse. The big
difference is that it uses a tiny video camera instead of a more
traditional rolling ball and scans any surface (except glass) 1,500
times a second, which translates into high-precision control of
cursor movements.
</P>
<P>
   The Intellimouse Explorer has five buttons, including a scroll
wheel, which makes it an ideal mouse for World Wide Web browsers.
Web pages rarely fit in one screen, and a scrolling wheel means
that the user doesn't have to mouse over to a scroll bar and click
up or down. The Explorer works with Macs as well as Windows, and it
costs $74.95. It has no mechanical or moving parts, and it doesn't
accumulate the belly-button lint that causes mechanical mice to
skip, get stuck or lose their bearings.

(including a CD labeling system) and reads any disc that can be
read by a CD-ROM drive, including Photo CD. This external USB

   NEW YORK _ Crafts as up to date as a titanium dreidel are the
focus of ``To Life and Light: A Celebration of Judaica,'' a
four-day show and sale at the American Craft Museum, 40 W. 53rd St.
``We are not showing any reproductions,'' said June Sgobbo, vice
president for retailing at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is the first Judaica event in the museum's 43 years. A
jury headed by Laura Kruger, a curator at the Hebrew Union College
Gallery in Manhattan, chose works by 40 artists from 90 who
applied. Eighteen of the artists created one-of-a-kind pieces, and
five Israeli artists are showing work in the United States for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The objects range from unusual Hanukkah dreidels _ four-sided
tops, each side bearing a Hebrew character _ like those made by
Kathleen Gahagan in titanium and sterling ($122 to $439), to
custom-made wedding canopies by Jacqueline Lissy, a New York
artist, and a pared-down aluminum traveling Sabbath set of
candlesticks, candles and matching kiddush, or benediction, cup by
Yaakov Greenvurcel of Jerusalem. Kristina Bozic, a Chicago artist,
created simple, satin-finish aluminum candlesticks and
nine-branched Hanukkah menorahs ($56 to $467).
</P>
<P>
   The craft works can be seen and bought in the museum's
lower-level exhibition space Thursday through Sunday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When two Gustav Stickley cabinets go up for sale at
Christie's on Nov. 29, as part of Barbra Streisand's Arts and
Crafts collection, representatives of the Craftsman Farms, the
Stickley home that the cabinets were designed for, will be there
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the farms, a nonprofit house museum, began raising
$75,000 as a war chest to recapture the cabinets. It also made
public its frustration with Ms. Streisand for refusing to donate
the pieces or sell them privately to the Stickley house. But the
tactic may be backfiring: with the winds of war _ and publicity _
rising, the estimates have escalated from $26,000 to $34,000 to
$40,000 to $60,000 each. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear:
house museums are busting the dust on the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   They now number 4,000 to 5,000, from the White House, with 1.25
million visitors annually, to the typical out-of-the-way
institution like Craftsman Farms in Parsippany, N.J., which had
10,000 visitors last year. After years of polite attrition, they
are capitalizing on the potential of their cultural assets. With
tourism breaking attendance records at the nation's large
institutions, house museums are pushing hard at endowment goals to
restore buildings, add visitors' centers and expand programming,
and they are exercising a new aggressiveness in their strategies
for acquiring objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historic house field is the next phase of American museums
to professionalize,'' said Kenneth Snodgrass, curator at the Samuel
F.B. Morse Historic Site in Poughkeepsie, which began construction
on a 22,000-square-foot visitors' center last year. Snodgrass, a
graduate of the New York University museum studies program, is an
example of the new breed of historic site curator: he does much of
his shopping for the Morse house online, at eBay.
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, Conn., at the Mark Twain House, filmmaker Ken Burns
is shooting the orientation film for a visitors' center scheduled
to open in 2001. Because Twain was a humorist, Garry Trudeau, Roy
Blount Jr. and Calvin Trillin have appeared for evening events.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, said John Boyer, executive director of the Mark
Twain House, ``the entire framework with which collections are
built has changed because of the aggressive marketing strategies of
Christie's and Sotheby's and the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   House museums need the goods, and they are going after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the historical site business is all about,'' said
Edward Bosley, director of the Gamble house, designed by Charles
and Henry Greene, in Pasadena, Calif. ``It's very rare to step into
a house and be confronted with what was there in 1908, for
instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions don't work, Bosley continued, adding: ``In many
cases, the reproductions are too good; they're better than the
originals. They're overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   When house museums don't have the money, they use pull. Or try
push.
</P>
<P>
   When an urn designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for the Susan
Dana-Thomas house in Springfield, Ill., now a state-owned site,
came up for sale at Christie's New York earlier this year, former
Illinois Gov. James Thompson made the successful bid on behalf of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went off to New York with $150,000,'' said Thompson, now
chairman of Winston &AMP; Strawn, a Chicago law firm, having gone down
his list of chief executives and friends, including the Pritzker
family. It cost him $260,000; Thompson's list made up the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   He also went to The Chicago Sun-Times before he left town, which
ran several articles on the house's interest in returning the urn.
Thompson is on the paper's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I needed all the help I could get,'' said Thompson.
He added that he didn't think the maneuver was a conflict of
interest, or that it gave him an unfair advantage over other
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have to compete against publicity,'' he said,
``only compete against my dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also bid on items for the Dana-Thomas house at
Christie's in 1987, as governor. Because of advance publicity that
the house wanted them, Thomas Monaghan, then chairman of Domino's
Pizza, who was Wright's most active private collector, gave
Thompson $25,000 toward purchases, agreeing not to bid against him.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that collectors' attitudes had changed. In 1987,
``there was forbearance on the part of the collecting community,''
he said, to allow the Dana-Thomas house to make the winning bids.
``They thought it was a noble purpose,'' he said. In 1999, in the
case of the urn, he said, ``Collectors now are willing to go up to
bat against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stein, the curator at Monticello, said with philosophic
sadness, ``Our entrepreneurial values so far outweigh the idea of
public patrimony.'' Ms. Stein added that the dilemma would only get
worse: ``The decorative arts are becoming increasingly valuable,
and being treated more like works of art, like paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most older house museums, Monticello has rarely depended on
the kindness of strangers. When she wanted two chairs from the
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sale at Sotheby's in 1996, Ms. Stein
made arrangements with Patricia Kluge, a neighbor and benefactor,
who bought them with an agreement that they would go to Monticello
in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was not so lucky. It lost the bid on a writing
table at which President John F. Kennedy signed the nuclear
proliferation treaty, though it had expressed interest in the item
privately, prior to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction had its historical irony.
As first lady, Mrs. Kennedy virtually invented the patriotic
popularity of returning objects to the White House, including a
French chair from the Monroe administration that a woman in
Pennsylvania donated after recognizing its matching table on
television during the first lady's 1962 White House tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her televised tour was a major factor in publicizing the
interest in bringing things back,'' said Betty Monkman, the White
House curator.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Kennedy's style of civic responsibility has become as
rare in the world of house museums as the objects they hope to
retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crying shame,'' said James Rees, resident director of
Mount Vernon, ``when truly wealthy collectors place their objects
at auction, often without even contacting the houses in question.
Even if they don't intend to donate, it's nice to think that the
home would be given a chance _ like a right of first refusal.''
Rees added: ``Most times, I am aware that an item is coming up when
we receive the printed catalog. At that point, it's very hard to
put together the funds to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional incentives like tax advantages for charitable
donations must now compete with the prospect of inestimable prices
realized in the open market, especially in fashionable, fast-moving
collecting fields like Arts and Crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein at Monticello said that newer financial devices like
the bargain sale helped to attract donors, by bridging the gap.
``The seller sells an object to a museum, at something under its
appraised value, and is able to claim the difference as a
charitable donation,'' she explained. ``There's an element of
philanthropy as well as benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements with larger, more prestigious institutions, like
long-term loans or the promise of gifts, present themselves less
frequently to small house museums. ``It can take generations to get
it right,'' Morrison Heckscher, a curator of American decorative
art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said of fruitful
relationships with collectors. ``It's not something that can be
rushed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the specter of public sale can produce impatience, if not
panic. Tommy McPherson, executive director of Craftsman Farms
Foundation, is prepared to take a quicker offensive, and risk
professional disapprobation, as the foundation is doing with the
Streisand sale. ``It would be more unfortunate for the foundation
not to attempt to return them and simply wait for another
generation of collectors to return them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House museums have no reason to believe that the next generation
of collectors will be charitable. ``Though there's a huge
transition of wealth now, to the baby boomers,'' Boyer said,
``there's a part of me that worries about the upper middle class
giving away objects when you look at the rest of their lives:
educating their kids, managing retirement, putting their parents in
nursing homes.'' As collectors, he continued, ``they may have
bought objects because they loved them, but they might be forced to
view them as investments.'' Collectors strapped for cash ``won't be
able to be art patrons,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But taking collectors to task for selling objects on the open
market discounts the role they play in conserving the furnishings
at all; in many cases, they are alone in their interests _ and
their investments _ until their collections create appreciation at
auction level.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Wolfson has collected decorative arts for 30 years for
his public collection, the Wolfsonian at Florida International
University in Miami Beach. It was only after he bought neglected
treasures like Harry Clarke's stained-glass window, commissioned,
then rejected, by the Irish government as its contribution to the
League of Nations in Geneva, that institutions like the Irish
government sought their return.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made them respectable,'' he said of his possessions,
`` &UR; then &LR;  they wanted them back.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One Sunday morning back in the 1980s, long before the
art galleries invaded Chelsea, two architects were riding their
bikes down the old West Side Highway. As the men, G. Phillip Smith
and Douglas Thompson, turned off at 23rd Street, pedaling east,
they noticed a vacant lot on the northwest corner of 10th Avenue.
``We came screeching to a halt when we saw the `For Sale' sign,''
Smith said. ``It was love at first sight.''
</P>
<P>
   The corner lot was the perfect size for their purposes. Once the
site of two brownstones, it measured 54 by 40 feet. They also liked
the rough-edged, mixed-use nature of the neighborhood, which had a
gas station on one corner, the old elevated train tracks to the
west and the Empire Diner and London Terrace apartment complex
across 10th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this thing about vacant lots,'' Thompson said. ``It's
the blank piece of paper, the empty canvas. We always had a dream
to claim a corner of space and build ourselves a decompression
chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to renovate an old building. They wanted to
start from scratch and create their own structure from the ground
up. That's why they started to ride their bikes around the city
every weekend searching for an empty lot. The architects phoned the
real estate broker first thing the next day and learned that the
property had already been sold, for $50,000, but they asked the
agent to keep them posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let her know that we really wanted the property,'' Thompson
said. After three years of waiting, their patience paid off. The
property came back on the market, for more than $200,000, four
times the previous price. This time, armed with a drawer full of
credit cards (which they quickly maxed out) and a short-term
construction loan, the architects were able to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a gradual, reflective way in contrast to New York's
frantic pace of life, the two men began to evolve a concept for
their space. In their spare time, they sketched ideas out on
napkins and tablecloths, planning a building that would serve
several purposes: living space, a design studio for Smith &AMP;
Thompson Architects, and _ to help pay its own way _ commercial
tenants. All would be mixed into an intriguing village of spaces,
courtyards and terraces that could also provide an oasis from the
urban environment.
</P>
<P>
   How often does the chance come along to own a piece of
Manhattan? Not often, unless you're Donald Trump. Most people are
used to renovating an older building, fitting into the envelope of
someone else's design. But New York offers a surprising number of
options for those who are resourceful and adventurous, willing to
challenge conventions. Vacant lots in odd configurations or out in
peripheral, frontier neighborhoods wait to be developed. Smith and
Thompson, through a combination of imagination, methodical planning
and a kind of do-it-yourself Zen persistence, would spend the next
10 years shaping their dream into a reality. ``Remember,'' Smith
said, ``none of this had anything to do with real estate
speculation. We weren't interested in maximizing the site for
future profit. We wanted to make a beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream had been percolating in their imaginations ever since
they first met as architecture students at Columbia University
during the turbulent 1960s. After completing their studies, both
men, with the help of fellowships, went on design pilgrimages
around the world, studying ancient and modern architecture. Smith
worked for the Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi, whose buildings
would have a profound influence on his later work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doshi's office in Ahmadabad was in a built-up urban
neighborhood,'' he recalled, ``but it had a courtyard, and you went
in from this noisy street into a quiet and magic environment.''
Later, he would work with the Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who
left a deep impression on Smith by successfully combining
transparency and openness on a gritty street corner in Tokyo with
his 1989 Tepia Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   For their oasis in Chelsea, Smith and Thompson would synthesize
traditions of 20th-century modernism with ideas they had
accumulated in their travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, we thought about just living like gypsies on the
site,'' Thompson said, ``parking a trailer on it and building a
swimming pool. Then we could drive away whenever we felt
restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually a more realistic idea evolved, one that acknowledged,
even honored, the geometric reality of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think of Manhattan as a closed, finite kind of
space with the grid as the dominant force,'' Smith said. They
decided to try to maintain the urban grid while inserting a fluid
sequence of spaces within the enclosed area.
</P>
<P>
   They knew from the start that there had to be a courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Noguchi museum in Long Island City was a constant
touchstone,'' Smith said. ``It is one of our favorite places in the
city.'' They also knew that they wanted to establish a presence on
the corner of 23rd and 10th, with at least two stories, respecting
the lines of the street and giving the structure an inner
transparency.
</P>
<P>
   Another important influence on their thinking was an old house
in Cairo that they had seen in a book about traditional Egyptian
architecture. ``It was extremely rich in plan and elevation, with
so many different levels of interest,'' Thompson said. There were
many similarities to what they ended up designing: an L-shaped
building organized around an open courtyard for both public and
private functions, with balconies and multi-level terraces.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, they looked for an economy of means and
flexibility. By designing everything themselves, they were able to
eliminate architectural fees, and they also acted as their own
general contractors. To save costly labor, all phases of
construction were carefully orchestrated. After the foundation work
ended, a framework of steel I-beams was bolted and welded into
place like a jungle gym, a job that took only two days because
steel sections had been stacked on the delivery trucks in the order
of assembly.
</P>
<P>
   More money was saved by using cold-rolled steel as it came
directly off the mill, in precut sheets of 10 by 20 feet. The size
of the plates established a modular 10-foot-square unit that the
architects used throughout the project. (This also worked nicely
with the dimensions of the lot.) The architects searched through
stacks of steel the way decorators look at fabric swatches. ``Every
steel mill has a unique finish,'' Thompson said. ``Most come out
fairly black.'' A set that came from a mill in Pennsylvania had a
consistent powdery red finish, a kind of cordovan color, that
caught their eye.
</P>
<P>
   After the exterior steel walls were in place, they were coated
with a parafin-based sealer to prevent rusting and to protect
against graffiti. Conventional timber framing was used for the rest
of the structure and then covered in some places with gray stucco
or white resin-coated fiberglass, which contrasts with dark steel.
Cubic elements stacked like blocks were designed in such a way that
different spaces could be combined and recombined over time and
could easily be adapted to changing functions. The building, which
is approximately 4,800 square feet, ended up costing about $140 a
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The courtyard and two gallery spaces on the lower floors were
finished first, in 1997. Several restaurants expressed interest in
renting the space, for higher revenues, but Smith and Thompson
wanted sympathetic neighbors in their little village. The J.
Cacciola Galleries moved from Soho into the ground-floor space,
with 2,400 square feet, including a subterranean level. Jim Kempner
Fine Arts also left Soho and moved to the second floor (1,400
square feet).
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is helping us all to be together,'' Smith said.
``It's really like a small community.''
</P>
<P>
   As you approach from the west, the building appears to be
hovering like a lantern in the late October twilight. It seems too
thin at first _ rice-paper thin _ too insubstantial for this city,
more like a temporary structure erected for a street fair. Where
are the defensive barriers? The thick walls and narrow entry points
that normally signal the line between public and private space?
They are almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Getting closer, you begin to see that the effect is a skillfully
composed illusion. The perimeter walls are not paper after all, but
armor-plated with steel. Step through the portal into the
courtyard, and something changes. Even though the outer membrane is
only a quarter-inch thick, street noises are muffled, and it is
surprisingly peaceful, even meditative. The city is still out
there, rude and clamorous, but it suddenly seems distant.
Everything fits neatly into a framework of solid and void, except a
parabolic opening that has been cut to accommodate the branch of a
tree that stretches into the courtyard. The floor of the courtyard
is covered with gravel. Pavers, made from recycled plastic decking,
have been placed like stepping stones in a Japanese garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see many buildings like this in New York,''
said Dru Arstark, the director of Jim Kempner Fine Arts. ``Everyone
loves it. We have so many new clients. Many of them just walk in
off the street. The building draws people in.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``My heart melted when I first saw the opening in
the wall for the tree. What kind of architects would do that? I
loved their sensitivity to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   For such a relatively small structure, there is a great deal
going on. Each space leads into the next with a surprising clarity
of purpose. One is constantly aware of the sky and the drama of the
street. Lines of sight are intentionally arranged to create a
shifting play between privacy and exposure, transparency and
opacity. Multiple views and openings divide and transform the
action on the outside of the building into a series of
mini-theatrical events: advertisements on the side of a bus,
pedestrians passing, the yellow flash of a speeding cab are
glimpsed briefly through slit-like openings.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional borders were further dissolved in the way the
architects arranged their combination work-and-living area on the
third floor. A system of ``Murphy desks'' fold up into the wall so
that the space can be open for entertaining or living on the
weekends. Then there is a small sleeping loft, perched precariously
above the design studio.
</P>
<P>
   The architects led the way up a folded steel-plate staircase to
one of two roof terraces. Looking out over the busy intersection of
23rd Street and 10th Avenue, Smith pointed out how the building
continues to grow as a work in progress. New spaces set back like
rooms of a pueblo village will soon rise in tiers toward the bare
wall of an adjacent building. The roof terrace will become a ``sky
room,'' with walls but no roof and a private sanctuary for
sleeping. ``This process is completely open-ended,'' Smith said.
``The building continues to unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hectic city streets, this building is a study in
slowness. This gradual, almost organic approach is not just for
small buildings, they believe, but can just as easily be applied to
much larger projects. (The team recently completed an award-winning
design for the phased expansion of the Jacques Marchais Center of
Tibetan Art on Staten Island.)
</P>
<P>
   There is something inherently quiet about the place and the men
who designed it. In explaining their philosophy about living and
working in one place, Smith paraphrased a Zen Buddhist saying he
heard in Japan: ``The real master in the art of living makes little
distinction between his art and his leisure,'' he said. ``He simply
pursues his vision of excellence in whatever he does, leaving
others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is
always doing both.''

   NIRELAND-TALKS (Belfast) _ The Irish Republican Army said

peace agreement, and it agreed to appoint a go-between to the

   ``The New Jewish Holiday Cookbook, An International Collection
of Recipes and Customs''
</P>
<P>
   By Gloria Kaufer Greene
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   As savvy American cooking has become increasingly influenced by
flavors from the far corners of the earth, so Jewish cuisine has
expanded in recent years beyond the traditional Eastern European
dishes Ashkenazi Jews brought to America in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated Jewish cook preparing a celebratory meal today
is likely to look for Spanish, Middle Eastern or even
Indian-influenced dishes to add interest to the holiday table.
Glora Kaufer Greene's ``The New Jewish Holiday Cookbook,'' the
cream of this cookbook crop, combines a smattering of traditional
Eastern European recipes with a wide range of international,
especially Middle Eastern, dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is an explanation of how to braid a Sabbath challah,
but there are also recipes for djaja m'kafli (Moroccan-style lemon
chicken with olives) for breaking the Yom Kippur fast, and
picadillo (spicy ground beef with fruit and almonds) for
celebrating Tu B'Shevat (the New Year of the Trees).
</P>
<P>
   Organized by holiday, each section begins with an explanation of
customs from various Jewish cultures associated with that holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a knock-'em-dead flourless dessert for Passover? How
about hazelnut-chocolate Viennese torte or pears poached in red
wine?
</P>
<P>
   This book's a winner.

</P>
<P>
   Hot pastrami!
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2nd Ave Deli Cookbook'' is as much a celebrity salute to
the New York City deli scene as it is a recipe guide. Looking for
the definitive recipe for chicken soup? There are four here: Aunt
Mary's chicken soup; chicken soup Live! With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee;
Antonio Pagan's chicken soup; and Art D'Lugoff's Moroccan chicken
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Who's Art D'Lugoff? A jazz impresario who founded the Village
Gate on Bleeker Street, which hosted such music greats as Paul
Robeson, John Coltrane and Billie Holiday, we're told as an
incongruous lead-in to a recipe for vegetable cholent.
</P>
<P>
   And so this book goes. A picture of Paul Reiser and Jerry
Seinfeld here, a recipe for schmaltz and gribenes there.
</P>
<P>
   Buy this book for the memories, buy it for fun, but don't buy it
to expand your repertoire of recipes.

   ``Shabbat Shalom, Recipes and Menus for the Sabbath''
</P>
<P>
   By Susan B. Friedland
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis tell Jews who want to become better acquainted with their
religion to begin by rediscovering the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   This day of rest _ a gift from God _ is meant to be a day of
joy. Indulge the senses. Sex on the Sabbath is good. Likewise,
wonderful food should be enjoyed on this day.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a conundrum: Work is forbidden on this holiday, and
that includes cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, Jews have developed a repertoire of Sabbath
foods, elaborate dishes lovingly prepared before the Sabbath to be
eaten on Friday night (Sabbath evening), and slow-cooking stews and
bean dishes warming overnight on a fire and eaten on Saturday
(Sabbath day).
</P>
<P>
   ``Shabbat Shalom'' is a reverential compilation of these
traditional recipes with commentary on the history and religious
significance. The notorious gefilte fish, for instance, has its
origin in the belief that removing bones from fish was work, making
it impossible to eat whole fish for a Sabbath meal. So fish was
boned, mixed with filler and stuffed back into the skin (in later
years shaped into balls) _ and thus gefilte fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shabbat Shalom'' is an excellent book for someone new to
Judaism, or for someone trying to re-create the feel of Friday
nights at Grandma's house.

   ``A Drizzle of Honey: The Lives and Recipes of Spain's Secret
Jews''
</P>
<P>
   By David M. Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   In the late Middle Ages, the Inquisition terrorized the Jews of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Many converted to Catholicism, but others went underground,
secretly holding on to their Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Drizzle of Honey'' is a culinary salute to these
crypto-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   These recipes from the Sephardic Jewish tradition combine
techniques from Christian and Islamic cooks with Jewish dietary
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   There are foods from Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Peru and other
countries. Lamb, fish, eggplant, chickpeas, almonds, cilantro and
cumin are featured prominently in these recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling adventurous? Try Maria Garcia's dove pie, Canary Islands
goat stew or Jewish mint pistachio partridge.
</P>
<P>
   Not up to something quite that exotic today? There's Diego Diaz
Nieto's haroset balls for a change of pace for the Passover meal,
or Mexican halvah for a treat any time.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable collection of recipes, this beautiful book serves
as a reminder to respect and cherish the many cultures of our wide
world.

   MOROCCAN-STYLE LEMON CHICKEN WITH OLIVES
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, grated
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 garlic cloves, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried cilantro leaves or 2 tablespoons finely
chopped fresh cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   About 31/2 pounds meaty chicken pieces, skin removed
</P>
<P>
   1 medium fresh lemon
</P>
<P>
   1 cup green olives, whole or pitted with any pimento removed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 fresh lemon cut in wedges for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a Dutch oven, combine water, grated onion, chopped onion,
garlic, parsley, cilantro, ginger, turmeric and pepper. Add
chicken, and bring liquid to a boil over medium-high beat. Lower
heat and simmer, covered, for about an hour, until chicken is very
tender.
</P>
<P>
   While chicken is cooking, use a sharp knife to score four or
five very shallow 1-inch cuts in the surface of the lemon peel. Put
lemon into a saucepan and cover it with water. Bring to a boil,
then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. The peel
should be very tender. Rinse lemon under cool running water to stop
the cooking. Cut open lemon along one of the scored marks. Discard
seeds and any loose lemon pulp. Cut peel (without any attached
pulp) into small pieces. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   While lemon is cooking, bring olives to boil in plain water, and
simmer for 3 minutes; discard water and let olives soak in cool,
clean water. When chicken is tender, stir 2 tablespoons lemon juice
into sauce. If chicken has given off a lot of liquid and the sauce
is thin, raise heat and boil sauce down until it has thickened to
desired consistency. Reduce heat to low, and stir in olives and
reserved pieces of cooked lemon peel. Simmer gently about 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, put chicken on large platter, and spoon sauce with the
olives and lemon pieces over the top. Garnish with lemon wedges.

Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church and a major worldwide
Lutheran body reached a milestone agreement on how human beings are
saved, or reconciled to God. I want to offer this sweeping
indictment: Generally speaking, Protestants no more than Roman
Catholics give much thought to the disturbing question that drove

CHEAP DIGITAL CAMERAS ABANDON THE ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is one in a series of articles on online shopping) 
(th) 
 By TOM VANDERBILT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is the holiday camera buying guide made simple: Buy the
Holga 120S.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the camera has become little more than a computer
with a lens, the Holga stands at the ready, fully Year 2000
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at these somewhat peculiar features: Place of
manufacture: China. Body: plastic (you will need to cover the back
with electrical tape to keep out the light). Lens: plastic
(fuzziness, flares and occasional warping included at no extra
charge). F-stops: two. Shutter speed: one. Chance of frame slippage
or problem in advancing film: great. Price: around $15. Neck strap:
included.
</P>
<P>
   The Holga, like the celebrated Russian Lomo camera or the YN-300
Fantastic Plastic 35-millimeter camera, is a toy camera. Its
primary audience, however, is not children, but photographers who
have grown weary of the tyranny and sterility of the perfect image.
In addressing the fabled Diana, a predecessor to the Holga
manufactured by the Great Wall Plastic Factory of the Kowloon
district of Hong Kong, in his book ``Photographic Possibilities,''
Robert Hirsch wrote: ``The Diana summons up the Dadaist traditions
of chance, surprise and a willingness to see what can happen. This
lack of control can free you from worrying about doing the `right'
thing and always being `correct.'''
</P>
<P>
   So even if children are by and large not flocking to the Holga,
it is still a toy, and thus its chief virtue is that it allows its
user to play, even if it is capable of performing the same
essential function as a $3,000 Leica.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Bauhaus rationality and high-tech sobriety, toy
cameras possess a sense of fun, not only in their occasionally
whimsical design, but in the very way they take photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures on the Nickelodeon Photo Blaster, for example, come
four to a photograph, which means that the user can not only
quadruple the number of shots but also that it is a mystery _ more
Dadaism _ as to which pictures will be juxtaposed next to which
pictures when the film is finally printed (you can go up to 144
shots).
</P>
<P>
   The big thing in photography, of course, is the market for
digital cameras. The good news is that the lower end of the market
has begun to expand, and there are now several bona fide toy
digital cameras, which, like their analog counterparts, possess a
certain charm in their imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the digital cameras in this price range produce
anything approaching the resolution of the simplest point-and-click
camera, they can be used to produce instant images for e-mail
dissemination. An additional feature is that their flaws, as well
as the flaws one can build in with the available software,
occasionally make for compelling images.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most entertaining of these is Nintendo's Game Boy
Camera, an heir of sorts to two previous beloved, and now defunct,
child-tested, artist-approved digital camera technologies:
Pixelvision and Fax Camera, both from Fisher-Price.
</P>
<P>
   The Game Boy Camera is essentially a cartridge you plug into a
Game Boy as if it were a game; a small, movable orb captures the
images. Indeed, the resulting ``funtography'' (Nintendo's phrase)
is akin to a game, with the same graphics and music of a typical
handheld video game accompanying the production of images.
</P>
<P>
   The images themselves are of the infrared, surveillance-camera
variety. But even these have a captivating expressionism, as well
as providing the novelty of seeing yourself in real time on a Game
Boy screen, as if you had been transported to the innards of the
game. Many effects are possible, as well, like panoramic images and
time-lapse photography; features like those can make the unit a
kind of portable history of the medium. As a final step, you print
the image on calculator tape.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its limitations, the Game Boy Camera has developed a
cult following. Intrepid sorts have created programs to transfer
its still and moving images to the computer and to video, opening
up possibilities for Game Boy auteurs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   KB Gear Interactive's JamCam looks and handles like a
traditional digital camera, but at a retail price of less than $90,
its makers are billing it as the cheapest 640-by-480-pixel
resolution camera on the market.
</P>
<P>
   With its rubberized side grips and large buttons, the JamCam is
clearly intended as a primer camera for children, but its
durability and ease of use make it ideal for experimentation at all
age levels. At its highest-resolution setting, the JamCam can store
eight pictures; at its lowest, 24.
</P>
<P>
   After uploading into a computer, images can be manipulated with
Microsoft Picture It 99, ArcSoft Photo Fantasy or Pictureworks' Hot
Shots (all included). Only the last program, however, will work
with a Macintosh. None of the other low-end digital cameras
reviewed here worked with a Macintosh, which seems surprising given
the popularity of the iMac among younger users.
</P>
<P>
   If you are impressed by the graphic design or in-ring antics of
professional wrestling, then Toymax's Slam Cam might appeal. An
unfortunate mix of red and gray plastic with a spray-painted WWF
logo blaring out from the face, the Slam Cam is one of a number of
toy cameras on the market that have a theme; Mattel's flowery and
pink Barbie Photo Designer camera is another.
</P>
<P>
   The Slam Cam and Barbie Photo Designer cameras sell for similar
prices, about $80, and have similar features _ users can put
themselves into a variety of fashionable Barbie environments or
into the headlock of Stone Cold Steve Austin. One senses an
opportunity for a new strike by the same media pranksters who a few
years back switched voices on Barbie dolls and G.I. Joe dolls.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything disquieting about these cameras, it is the
emphasis on manipulating a photo to make it ``better'' or on
inserting oneself into environments of someone else's making. It is
as if reality is no longer sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn the most ordinary photo into a work of art by applying
some special effects,'' the instruction book for the Slam Cam says.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, the special appeal of toy cameras is that one
never wants to take an ordinary photo, as if the ordinariness of
the camera itself had freed the user to find art in everyday life.

ENRIQUE IGLESIAS ENJOYING CROSSOVER SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enrique Iglesias, already one of the best-loved Latino crooners
in the world, is about to get even more popular.
</P>
<P>
   Poised to release his first English-language album, ``Enrique,''
next week, Iglesias is no stranger to the top of the pop charts. He
reached No. 1 over the summer with the compelling ``Bailamos''
(``We Dance'') from the ``Wild Wild West'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's hard to imagine that initially, Iglesias _ 24-year-old
son of globe-trotting ``Latin lover'' Julio Iglesias _ was
considered a hard sell by record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was starting out at age 19, Spanish ballad singers
were supposed to be 40 and up. Iglesias was rejected by three
labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to take a chance,'' he said Monday from Paris,
where he was in the midst of a brief promotional tour. ``I believed
in what I was doing, but people in the industry said it wasn't
possible for someone so young.''
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias, born in Madrid but raised in Miami, spent his early
teens listening to Top 40 acts like Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood
Mac, Billy Joel, Peter Gabriel, Sting, John Mellencamp and Dire
Straits, realizing that while these artists were considered
rockers, their biggest hits were actually ballads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple ballads, too _ no more than three or four chords,''
Iglesias explained. ``Spanish pop at that time was so complicated,
with too many chords, too many changes, too many violins and cheesy
lyrics instead of being simple and direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias began writing his own songs, striking gold with his
1995 self-titled debut, which sold more than 6 million copies, as
did his second effort, ``Vivir'' (``To Live''). His third album,
``Cosas del Amor'' (``Love Things''), was issued last year.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic and sincere, Iglesias is anxious to prove that the
English-sung ``Bailamos'' was just the beginning of a long-term
bilingual career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enrique'' (Interscope/UMG), which arrives in stores Tuesday,
includes the single ``Rhythm Divine'' (which reunites him with the
Groove Brothers production team behind ``Bailamos'' and Cher's
``Believe'' smash), and showcases a mix of Latin and Mediterranean
rhythms, romance and classic pop influences.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the flamenco-tinged ``Bailamos'' and five new
songs penned by Iglesias, the forthcoming disc features the
singer's first-ever duet, with Whitney Houston on the Diane
Warren-written, David Foster-produced ballad ``Could I Have This
Kiss Forever,'' recorded at the suggestion of Arista Records
president Clive Davis, who masterminded Santana's current hit
single and album.
</P>
<P>
   Another moment sure to attract attention is Iglesias'
tip-of-the-hat tribute to one of his favorite artists _ a cover of
Springsteen's ``Sad Eyes'' _ a track suggested by Interscope
co-chairman Jimmy Iovine, who helped oversee the completion of
``Enrique'' and previously worked with Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Why don't you try this song?''' Iglesias said. ``So,
here's a Latino doing Springsteen. I expect people will say, what
the hell is this about? But everyone really loved how it came
out.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Iovine said he knew Iglesias had the potential to
sell truckloads of albums to both Anglo and Spanish audiences even
before figures were released showing sales of Spanish-language
music in the U.S. had jumped 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught his live show, which was incredibly strong,'' Iovine
said. ``He's a rock-based performer and judging by what his stage
show looked like, it was clear this was someone who could do
extremely well for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his commitment to continue recording in Spanish,
Iglesias' new album contains Spanish-language versions of three
songs: ``Ritmo Total'' (``Rhythm Divine''), ``Mas es Amar'' (``Sad
Eyes'') and ``No Puedo Mas Sin Ti'' (``I'm Your Man'').
</P>
<P>
   Like fellow Latin-pop superstars Ricky Martin and Luis Miguel,
the 1997 Grammy-winning Iglesias has seen chart explosions before.
The fact that he sold more than 14 million copies of his first
three Spanish-only albums and scored 12 No. 1 Latin singles since
1995 led to his reported $40 million multirecord deal with
Universal's Interscope Records (which released ``Bailamos'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict Enrique will have a long career in both Spanish and
English and with his new single (``Rhythm Divine''), I can see he's
definitely heading in the right direction,'' said Pio Ferro,
program director at local Spanish-language adult contemporary radio
KLVE-FM (107.5), one of the first stations to spin ``Bailamos'' as
a European import two months before the song erupted on Spanish-
and English-speaking radio throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to KLVE's audience, the station often takes the
Spanish and English versions of a hit like ``Bailamos'' or Martin's
``Livin' la Vida Loca'' and ``mates'' them, creating a special
bilingual mix, Ferro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're playing the Spanish version of `Rhythm
Divine' and if it takes off, we'll make a bilingual version,''
Ferro said.
</P>
<P>
   With such hip-hop-tinged, nonsymphonic material, Iglesias _ set
to appear with Sting, Andrea Bocelli, Aretha Franklin and others at
Celebration 2000, a high-profile New Year's Eve event at New York's
Jacob Javits Center _ clearly reaches a much younger audience than
his father does.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about his relationship with his famous dad, who
several years ago was the top Latin pop singer in the world but was
apparently too busy to spend much time with his three children from
his first marriage to a Spanish socialite, Iglesias demurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a good work ethic from him,'' Iglesias says. ``But I
can't see us ever singing together. I do respect his music even
though it was never my favorite thing to listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the son _ crowned 1998's ``Sexiest Man Alive'' by People
en Espanol, the Spanish-language edition of People magazine _
outsells the father. And Iglesias, who is single and lives in
Miami, says he never wants the ``Latin lover'' tag his father
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like women as much as the next guy but I don't ever want to
be known for that,'' he said. ``That's his thing.''

   The general notion has been that the song you won't be able to
escape on New Year's Eve will be Prince's ``1999.'' And that may be
the case. But the best choice for an album to play until the
countdown is this one. Offensive only to people with an aversion to
fun, ``Willennium'' offers well-chosen samples such as Diana Ross'
``Love Hangover'' on ``Freakin' It'' and the Clash's ``Rock the
Casbah'' on ``Will 2K.'' There are also such surprising but
well-chosen guests as hard-core rappers Eve (``Can You Feel Me?'')
and Lil' Kim (``Da Butta''). And somehow in all this good company,
even Will Smith himself manages to do his thing _ and get to the
end of the album before his game of rhyme time becomes sickening.

   What Electric Light Orchestra was to the Beatles, Bush is to
Nirvana. That is, a brazen rip-off of infinitely less consequence,
but fun in a cheesy, lowbrow sort of way. Bush, a foursome of
sour-faced rockers led by mopey hunk Gavin Rossdale, seem all too
aware that critics find them a pale reflection of the gods of
grunge. To make amends, the group recycles riffs lifted from Kurt
Cobain and company into consistently catchy radio fodder. Bush's
third release is its most irresistible, as Rossdale and the boys
crank up the guitar and angst in the service of several soon-to-be
alterna-hits, including ``The Chemicals Between Us'' (already a
radio anthem) and ``Prizefighter.'' Rossdale sounds more
gruff-but-lovable than ever, croaking such supremely self-conscious
(and amusingly apt) lines as ``I memorize the basics, making
strange faces / Tread slowly for I know there's a thousand miles to
go'' (from the roaring lead-off track, ``Warm Machine'').

<P>
   Ever prone to pithy album titles (see: ``Please,'' ``Very'' and
``Disco''), the Pet Shop Boys have christened release No. 9 with
their most bluntly obvious moniker to date. Anybody who has ever
shimmied and swayed on a dance floor to the strains of ``West End
Girls,'' ``Opportunities'' or ``It's Hard'' knows the British
twosome's work has always been about nightlife _ Neil Tennant's and
Chris Lowe's songs evoke disco ennui, stolen kisses in the back of
rented limos and caustic quips over martinis at an after-hours
bistro. Following their halfhearted 1996 release, ``Bilingual,''
which featured some truly wrongheaded forays into Latin fusion, the
Boys are back in fine form. A few tunes, including the rueful ``You
Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk,'' rank among the duo's
cleverest compositions. Yet there's a strong whiff of deja vu about
the album, suggesting that the Boys' all-night party may come to an
end sometime soon.

 &HT;    `Spy' a hilarious romp in bad taste
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Chaos hits Carnaby Street when our favorite dentally impaired
British superspy has his mojo, and much of his second movie, stolen
by Dr. Evil. But because Mike Myers plays both the good guy and the
bad guy (and a third character to boot), he has only himself to
blame for the scene-stealing.
</P>
<P>
   This gas of a sequel gives us a new curvy love interest (Heather
Graham) while bringing back Seth Green as Dr. Evil's sullen son
Scott and Robert Wagner and Mindy Sterling as No. 2 and Frau
Farbissina. We also get Rob Lowe doing a perfect Wagner imitation
as Younger No. 2 and tiny Verne Troyer as Dr. Evil's clone,
Mini-Me.
</P>
<P>
   As shaggy as it is shagadelic, ``Spy'' is really just an excuse
to revel in gleeful bad taste. That includes toilet humor involving
a greasy, flatulent, kilt-wearing, obese Scotsman (Myers in a body
suit); a genital-biting battle between Austin and Mini-Me; and
scatological shadow play. The gags this time out are more body
humor than boudoir. In other words, kids will love it.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie doesn't always hit its comic targets, it's
peppered with celebrity cameos _ Tim Robbins, Willie Nelson, Woody
Harrelson and more. These celebrity visits underscore the charm of
the flick. It's a pop-art party where the host is happy to do
anything to keep the guests laughing, whether that means wearing
rotten teeth and a chest pelt or running around in a bikini.

 &HT;    Apple's `Pawn' lush and luminous listen
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laugh at her if you will. But we need performers who dish out
their dizzy idiosyncrasies as they grow up in public, fearless even
when feckless, and always aware that in our disconnected lives a
grand foolishness may be the better part of wisdom. Fiona Apple
fills the bill with an awkward, guileless manner that can't be
faked, something you can read scribbled between the lines in the
ongoing psychodrama of her songs.
</P>
<P>
   If the title of the 21-year-old musician's second album, a
90-word poem that begins ``When the Pawn ... ,'' is self-conscious
babble better left to a journal entry, the song cycle it introduces
is so winningly accomplished that you can't fault the audacity.
Hooked up with producer Jon Brion (on board for Apple's
breakthrough debut, ``Tidal''), the singer comes up with a richly
layered collection, one that combines her unerring feel for an
early-1970s quirky-but-soulful songwriter vibe with an eclectic,
post-hip-hop ear for musical detours and sonic hiccups. The
assertive yet vulnerable persona evoked by her lyrics is fleshed
out in the fluid jazz inflections of her voice. It thrives in the
solitude of a sparse few piano notes and swings into high gear
before the syncopations that make Apple's songs sound like nothing
else in pop right now. Tunes such as ``Limp'' emphasize that
sophistication, tossing a percussive jam session into the middle of
a three-minute pop song, as Apple points her finger: ``You fondle
my trigger, then you blame my gun.'' Nothing if not Freudian, the
singer, like the old psychoanalyst, appreciates a good joke.

 &HT;    Full-throttle Rage cranks it up loud in `Battle' assault
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might be misleading to call this the best rock album of the
year. In so many ways, Rage Against the Machine's third effort
sounds like the only rock album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it suggests the pyrotechnic blues of Jimi Hendrix gone
thermonuclear by way of Public Enemy, the band's ruthless sonic
assault comes off less self-consciously retro than radically sliced
and diced. And, importantly, it's virulent, where most of what's
marketed as alternative rock is designed to be harmless or
boneheaded.
</P>
<P>
   The group's mix of left-wing warrior cries (Hispanic rapper Zack
De La Rocha, armed with a soapbox and a megaphone) and guitar
heroics (the ungodly good Tom Morello) owes steep dues to punk-era
acts such as the Clash, Gang of Four and Minutemen, bands that, for
the most part, did it better.
</P>
<P>
   What Rage does with such punishing success, as De La Rocha
chants on ``Guerrilla Radio,'' is ``turn that (stuff) up!''
Especially Morello, who, like the Stooges and Sonic Youth before
him, knows that distortion and idiosyncratic tunings can make a
guitar into a symphony of terrible beauty.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say what percentage of the band's audience cares
about the issues it raises _ from Central American politics to
``the naked cold millions gaspin' for air.'' It's a problem Bruce
Springsteen, whose ``The Ghost of Tom Joad'' has been covered by
Rage, can relate to. But there's nothing halfway in their
presentation. ``The Battle of Los Angeles'' is fought tooth and
nail _ and amps cranked to 11.

 &HT;    Time to revisit some reliable holiday treats

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The requests from Marie Musser and Judy Ackerman were
for recipes we've published before that are particular favorites
during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Musser lost her copy of Spiced Cranberries, which ran in a
Thanksgiving story two years ago. With a bumper crop of cranberries
this year, it sounded like a good time to reprint the Ursula's
Cooking School version.

husband's favorites. We published this recipe from Tennessee in
1990.

 &HT;    Mini movie reviews
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Tea With Mussolini'' (PG) _ Known in 1930s Florence as ``the
scorpioni,'' thanks to their collective sting, a band of British
and American expatriate women (Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright and Cher) become surrogate mothers of a young boy named
Luca. Based on his autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film
is an uneven but enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Blackshirt
Italy, entrusted to a handful of Auntie Mames. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' (R) _ Loses its way all too
often, but never loses its audience. Disconnected and dreamlike,
Mike Figgis' episodic film is as maddeningly self-indulgent as it
is disturbingly primal. A British filmmaker (Julian Sands) in
Tunisia thinks back on various former selves: a little boy in
Kenya, a fat boy in gym class, a lust-filled teenager. Meanwhile, a
very black Adam and a very white Eve act out their Garden of Eden
tragedy on a decaying estate. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Instinct'' (R) _ Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar
winner Anthony Hopkins plays an anthropologist locked up in a
psychiatric prison, surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates (a la ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''). It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds (a la ``Gorillas in the
Mist''), he went berserk and killed two natives. Why? It's up to a
psychiatry student (Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr.) to pick his mind
(a la Hopkins' own ``Silence of the Lambs''). It's twaddle. Grade:
D+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Castle'' (R) _ A sunny little sleeper from Australia. A
cheerfully dimwitted working-class bloke named Darryl (Michael
Caton) takes on the system when the neighboring airport decides to
expand and tries to force him and his family out of their home.
It's a genial and just-goofy-enough David-and-Goliath
(Darryl-and-Goliath?) comedy that aims to do little more than put a
smile on your face. Which it does. Handily. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Phantom of the Opera'' (PG) _ In this version the phantom
doesn't wear a mask, just greasy long hair. What makes him scary is
that he's played by career weirdo Julian Sands. In this
surprisingly lackluster tale from Italian goremeister Dario
Argento, the scares are outnumbered by the sillinesses. Grade: D

 &HT;    Holiday help isn't far away
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the original hotline between the White House and the
Kremlin that was set up to avert nuclear confrontation during the
Cold War, a telephone hotline suggests an emergency. With the
number of food-related hotlines up and running for the holidays,
you could get the idea that cooking a turkey is akin to dismantling
a bomb _ an activity fraught with danger and dread.
</P>
<P>
   Well, cooking a turkey should hardly be anxiety-inducing. The
death toll from roasting turkeys is virtually nil, and if you use
common sense (just think of it as a big chicken), it's not only
fairly simple, but fun. And there's no potpourri on earth that
smells better than a turkey roasting in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   That said, just in case you do have a question or something
unforeseen happens in your holiday kitchen, you can relax. There's
probably no other undertaking that elicits such a proliferation of
easily accessible information. Food companies, farms and government
agencies all pitch in staffing hotlines and tip lines to help you
get that holiday meal successfully to your table.

 &HT;    A short route to a truly knockout feast
 &HT;    By Susan Puckett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ingredient list for these dishes could hardly be shorter _
but they're all long on flavor. Cookbook author Rozanne Gold, the
source of most of these recipes, carries the minimalist theme over
to her table settings _ showing off their vibrant colors on
oversize dark-white dishes and placing small, natural centerpieces
down the center of the table instead of one big arrangement in the
middle.

   Cooking time: 12 minutes
</P>
<P>
   These addictive nibbles are sure to whet the appetite. Be
careful, though; they're hard to stop eating.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, plus more for drizzling
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound pecan halves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In nonstick skillet, melt butter and add Worcestershire sauce.
Add pecans, pinch of salt and freshly ground pepper. Stir and cook
over medium heat for a few minutes, until nuts are coated.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, stirring
often. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and
additional Worcestershire sauce. _ From ``Entertaining 1-2-3'' by

<P>
   Rozanne Gold devised this refreshing cocktail especially for her
Thanksgiving guests. We tried it with Pernod, which adds a subtle
licorice flavor.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup apple cider (Gold prefers unpasteurized)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 ounce arrack or Pernod
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus 1 strip lemon rind
</P>
<P>
   Put 4 ice cubes in large old-fashioned or rocks glass. Add cider
and arrack, and stir. Add lemon juice and stir again. Serve with
long, thin twist of lemon rind and stirrer. _ From ``Entertaining

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This pretty salad tastes like fall.
</P>
<P>
   1 (5.2-ounce) package Boursin cheese with garlic and herbs,
well-chilled
</P>
<P>
   8 medium Belgian endives
</P>
<P>
   4 medium-large ripe green or red pears
</P>
<P>
   For the dressing: Break cheese into several pieces and place in
bowl of food processor. With the motor running, slowly add 1/2 to
2/3 cup cold water and process until smooth, thick and creamy.
Taste and add a little salt if needed. If using immediately, set
aside at room temperature while you prepare salad. If using later,
cover and refrigerate. Let come to room temperature before using.
If it's too thick, add a little water.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare salad: Immediately before serving, wash endives and
pears and dry well. Cut endives on the bias into slightly less than
1/8-inch-thick slices. Place in mounds in center of 8 large plates.
Cut pears in half through the stems and remove seeds. Cut each pear
half in 1/8-inch-thick slices. Drizzle several tablespoons dressing
over each mound of endives. Shingle pear slices on top. Drizzle
with 1/2 tablespoon dressing. _ From ``Entertaining 1-2-3''

</P>
<P>
   Turkey With Lemon
</P>
<P>
   and Sage
</P>
<P>
   Makes 16 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 3-3 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 16- to 18-pound fresh turkey, bought from your butcher, at
room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dried sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 large lemons
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the fat from the rear of the turkey. Melt it in a small
nonstick pan. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the neck of the turkey, slip your fingers under the
skin and carefully separate the skin from one entire side of the
breast; most of your hand eventually will be under the skin.
Continue downward and, with your index finger, separate the skin
around the thigh. Repeat on the other side of the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Crumble the sage leaves and sprinkle them with freshly ground
black pepper. Spread 1 tablespoon sage on breast and thigh, beneath
the skin, on each half of the turkey. Prick each lemon several
times and insert in the bird's cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Put the neck and giblets in a baking pan; do not use liver. With
a pastry brush, thoroughly coat the breast with the rendered fat,
then sprinkle the entire bird with more pepper. Fold a double
thickness of paper towels in half and cover the entire breast.
Carefully pour cold water on the towels to thoroughly moisten them,
then cover the breast area with an aluminum-foil tent. Place the
bird on a rack over the gizzards and put in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Every 20 minutes, pull the turkey from the oven, remove the foil
tent and thoroughly moisten the paper towels with cold water. Some
water will flow into the pan and into the turkey; it will become
part of your pan juices.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1/2 hours, check the turkey temperature with a meat
thermometer; the thigh should be about 145 degrees and the breast
125 degrees. If they are not, continue to cook (cooking time will
depend on the initial temperature and size of the bird).
</P>
<P>
   If they are, remove the foil and the paper towels and return the
turkey to the oven for about 45 minutes. The breast will brown and
temperatures will be 175 degrees to 180 degrees in the thigh and
155 to 160 in the breast.
</P>
<P>
   Take the turkey out of the oven and remove the lemons. Tip the
liquid inside the turkey into the roasting pan and then transfer
all the pan juice and brown bits to a saucepan. Let the turkey rest
under the foil tent. Skim the fat from the saucepan. Add 1/2
tablespoon juice from one of roasted lemons and bring to a boil.
You should have about 1 1/2 cups liquid; either add water or reduce
the liquid accordingly. Carve the turkey and serve with the pan
juices. _ From ``Recipes 1-2-3'' by Rozanne Gold (Little, Brown,

   Polenta _ for Thanksgiving? If you favor corn bread stuffing,
it's not as weird as you think. In fact, it is quite delicious _

<P>
   1 1/2 cups white cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1 small clove garlic, pushed through a garlic press

   Place the cornmeal and 1 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan.
Gradually add 5 cups water and then the garlic, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon to remove any lumps. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, about 10 minutes. Add 5
tablespoons grated cheese and continue cooking and stirring
frequently for 5 minutes more.

   This mixture of sweet potatoes and Yukon Golds has a lovely hue
and just a hint of sweetness. And the buttermilk adds rich flavor.
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds large sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup buttermilk, at room temperature (plus more, if needed)
</P>
<P>
   Peel the sweet potatoes and the Yukon Gold potatoes. Cut them in
large chunks and put them in a large pot with cold salted water to
cover. Bring to a boil, lower heat and cook 30 minutes, or until
potatoes are very soft. Drain the water. Mash potatoes with a
potato masher or put them through a ricer. Mix well, adding
buttermilk until potatoes are creamy and smooth. Add salt and
pepper to taste. Reheat gently before serving, adding buttermilk if

</P>
<P>
   Here is a simple, elegant take on pumpkin pie. The sauce tastes
like creme anglaise; who'd ever guess it's commercial eggnog that's
simply been cooked down to a thicker consistency?
</P>
<P>
   2 level cups pumpkin
</P>
<P>
   pie filling
</P>
<P>
   4 cups eggnog
</P>
<P>
   4 extra-large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In bowl of electric mixer, put
pumpkin pie filling and 3 cups eggnog. Mix well. Add eggs and blend
very well.
</P>
<P>
   Pour mixture evenly into eight 6-ounce custard cups. Place cups
in a deep baking pan. Pour boiling water in pan until it reaches
halfway up sides of the cups. Bake 40-50 minutes, until firm.
Remove from water bath and refrigerate until very cold.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Serve with eggnog custard sauce: Put 1 cup remaining
eggnog in small heavy saucepan. Reduce by half very slowly, 20 to
25 minutes, over low heat, whisking often. Chill custard sauce well
and spoon 1 tablespoon on top of each flan, smoothing down with a
small, flexible spatula or a butter knife. _ From ``Recipes 1-2-3

   This rich-tasting cake actually becomes moister and more

</P>

 &HT;    Thanksgiving around the corner, opt for minimal preparations
 &HT;    By Susan Puckett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE MINIMALIST
</P>
<P>
   With only a week left until T-Day, you're cutting it close if
you're still thinking of preparing
</P>
<P>
   a full-fledged, made-from-scratch feast. Unless, that is, you
opt for today's menu. It's stylish, sophisticated
</P>
<P>
   and superbly flavored _ and includes dishes calling for only
three ingredients
</P>
<P>
   In years past, I knew of but one way to improve upon the
traditional Thanksgiving menu: Embellish it.
</P>
<P>
   I would start with the basic recipes, then personalize them with
as many of my own flourishes as I could dream up. I might float a
turkey-shaped puff pastry cutout in the squash soup. Spike the corn
bread dressing with a shot of armagnac. Simmer cranberries and
exotic spices into a complex chutney. Throw chocolate chips into
the pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   So what if it took every pot and pan in my kitchen and left me
with an arsenal of ingredients guaranteed to rot long before they'd
ever get used again. Or that, deep down, I was fully aware that a
pumpkin pie made straight off the Libby's can label would have
suited my guests just fine. For me, the thrill of Thanksgiving has
always been trying to outdo all previous efforts, without veering
too far out of the realm of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But this year I'm taking a radically different tack. I'm going
radically simple. Instead of adding ingredients to my shopping
list, I'm paring it down. Way down.
</P>
<P>
   No dish on the menu I'll be serving, in fact, will contain more
than three ingredients (assuming you don't count salt, pepper or
water). Yet not one of the fabulous flavors and textures and smells
that I love about this holiday will be sacrificed. After giving it
a test drive, I can attest that it not only works, it's delicious.
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration I turned to Rozanne Gold, a New York chef and
restaurant consultant who has written three award-winning cookbooks
on the three-ingredient principle. I've been hooked on her 1996
book, ``Recipes 1-2-3,'' ever since my husband made me a
five-course birthday dinner that was as wonderful as any restaurant
meal in recent memory _ entirely from Gold's book. And as I explore
her sequels _ ``Recipes 1-2-3 Menu Cookbook'' and ``Entertaining
1-2-3'' _ I become more convinced that Gold's less-is-more theory
isn't just another gimmick, but a winning formula for producing
great food without stress.
</P>
<P>
   Gold admits that, like many other contemporary chefs, she has
been guilty of engaging in ``flavor cover-up: masking a dish's
elemental flavors by piling on too many ingredients.'' Then, a few
years ago, she imposed on herself the challenge of achieving
maximum flavor by going in the opposite direction, focusing on the
fewest possible ingredients. Now it's a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very manageable,'' Gold says. ``You don't get overwhelmed
during the shopping or the cooking. And that's important,
especially when you're entertaining for the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   But would that concept fly at Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it last year at my house, and I will be this year,
too,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So how does she go about planning the menu?
</P>
<P>
   First, by focusing on the flavors she most associates with the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet potatoes, sage, the flavor of cooked bones, members of
the allium family _ those say `Thanksgiving' for me,'' Gold says.
``I like the sharpness of the cranberries, the interplay on the
plate between sweet and salty and savory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing those tips in mind, I put together this menu _ along
with a few of my own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised at how easy it was to find three-ingredient
recipes that came so close to tradition. And all of us who sat down
to eat it were even more amazed at how satisfied we were by meal's
end.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't even miss the corn bread stuffing with Gold's
garlic-and-Parmesan-flavored polenta in its place, which tasted all
the better when doused with the sage-scented turkey drippings.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most liberal-thinking of cooks, I realize, may have a
hard time buying that one. So make an exception _ you won't hurt
Gold's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't serve stuffing last year, and nobody seemed to miss
it,'' she says. ``But to tell you the truth, I love stuffing. I
just make the Pepperidge Farm kind, adding twice as many
caramelized onions and some crumbled sausage.''
</P>
<P>
   By combining recipes with just a few ingredients, you can
orchestrate a wonderful meal with elegance and ease. And at
holidays especially, it keeps you from getting overwhelmed.

 &HT;    Kessler's bird and other fowl delights
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is restaurant critic John Kessler's favorite method for
cooking turkey, along with the tried-and-true method of Rick
Rodgers, author of ``Thanksgiving 101'' (Broadway Books, $15).
We've also included the bizarre but much-requested recipe for
deep-fried turkey popularized in Cajun country.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   John Kessler's
</P>
<P>
   Upside-Down Turkey
</P>
<P>
   Makes 18 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 3-3 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   Standing time: 1 hour, 20 minutes, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 (18-pound) turkey, fresh or thawed
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 branches fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons melted butter
</P>
<P>
   Position oven rack in lowest position and preheat to 325
degrees. Remove the turkey from the fridge and allow it to rest at
room temperature for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve turkey neck and giblets to use in gravy or stock. Rinse
turkey inside and out with cold water. Pat turkey skin dry. Place
thyme, garlic and onion in turkey cavity and season well with salt
and pepper. Turn turkey on its breast. Fold wings behind back or
tie to body with kitchen string. Place drumsticks in hock lock or
tie together with kitchen string.
</P>
<P>
   Brush breast-side-up turkey all over with melted butter. Season
with salt and pepper. Place turkey, breast side down, on V-shaped
rack in roasting pan. Brush all over with melted butter. Season
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Roast turkey for 2 hours. Remove roasting pan from oven, and
using wads of paper towels or turkey lifters (gadgets that look
like small pitchforks), turn the turkey breast side up and place
back in the V-shaped rack. Baste well with pan juices. Baste every
15 minutes and cook for about another 1 to 1 1/2 hours until an
instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh
reads 180 degrees. (See note.)
</P>
<P>
   Transfer turkey to large serving platter and let stand at least
20 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Note: In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that I
roast the turkey only until the thermometer reads 165-170 degrees.
Though the USDA does not recommend this practice, many experts say
that an unstuffed turkey is pathogen-free by the time this
temperature is reached. You can find a good discussion of this
issue, bolstered with independent tests, in ``The Cook's
Illustrated Complete Book of Poultry'' (Potter, $32.50).

<P>
   Perfect Roast Turkey With Best Ever Gravy
</P>
<P>
   Makes 18 servings (including about 7 cups gravy)
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 35-40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: about 5 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 (18-pound) fresh turkey
</P>
<P>
   12 cups (about) of your favorite stuffing
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly milled black pepper
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 cups (or as needed) homemade turkey stock or purchased
chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   Melted unsalted butter, if needed
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup bourbon, port or dry sherry (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Position oven rack in lowest position and preheat to 325
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve turkey neck and giblets to use in gravy or stock. Rinse
turkey inside and out with cold water. Pat turkey skin dry. Turn
turkey on its breast. Loosely fill neck cavity with stuffing. Using
thin wooden or metal skewer, pin neck skin to the back. Fold
turkey's wings behind back or tie to body with kitchen string.
Loosely fill large body cavity with stuffing. Place any remaining
stuffing in lightly buttered casserole, cover and refrigerate to
bake as side dish. Place drumsticks in hock lock or tie together
with kitchen string.
</P>
<P>
   Place turkey, breast side up, on rack in roasting pan. Rub all
over with softened butter. Season with salt and pepper. Tightly
cover breast area with aluminum foil. Pour 2 cups of turkey stock
into bottom of pan.
</P>
<P>
   Roast turkey, basting all over every 30 minutes with juices from
bottom of pan (lift up foil to reach breast area), until meat
thermometer inserted into meaty part of thigh (but not touching
bone) reads 180 degrees and stuffing is at least 160 degrees, about
4 1/2 hours. Whenever drippings evaporate, add stock to moisten,
about 1 1/2 cups at a time. Remove foil during last hour to allow
breast skin to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer turkey to large serving platter and let stand at least
20 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees. Drizzle 1/2 cup turkey
stock over stuffing in casserole, cover and bake until heated
through, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pour drippings from roasting pan into heatproof glass
bowl or large measuring cup. Let stand 5 minutes, then skim off and
reserve clear yellow fat that has risen to top. Measure 3/4 cup
fat, adding melted butter if needed to reach that level. Add enough
turkey stock to skimmed drippings to make 8 cups total.
</P>
<P>
   Place roasting pan over two stove burners over low heat and add
turkey fat. Whisk in flour, scraping up browned bits from bottom of
pan, and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Whisk in
turkey stock and bourbon, if desired. Cook, whisking often, until
gravy has thickened and no trace of raw flour taste remains, about
5 minutes. Transfer gravy to warmed gravy boat. Carve turkey and
serve gravy and stuffing along side.

   This is a messy but novel way to cook a turkey. But every year
we get many requests for it _ so here it is. Plan on getting a
kettle big enough to cook the bird whole; measure ahead of time by
placing the uncooked turkey in the pot with enough water to cover.
We strongly recommend you cook the turkey over a heat source
outdoors, since you can expect splashing and drips while the turkey
is cooking and being taken from the kettle.

   2 teaspoons ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, chopped, or garlic powder to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped chives
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, cut in eighths
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 ribs celery, cut in 3-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 gallons peanut oil (no substitutions)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Cajun poultry seasoning
</P>
<P>
   Pierce turkey all over with fork. Place in roasting pan. Season
with soy sauce, shrimp boil, black pepper, garlic powder and
chives, sprinkling on all surfaces and in cavities. Place some
onions and celery inside turkey; place remainder alongside it. Add
water to pan.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate, covered with pan lid or aluminum foil, in coldest

basting with pan liquids.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to prepare, heat oil in large heavy pot until very
hot, about 325 to 350 degrees on a thermometer. Remove turkey from
marinade, remove vegetables from cavities and drain excess liquid.
Sprinkle generously with Cajun poultry seasoning. Using two forks
or holding turkey by legs, lower carefully into hot oil. Cook,
breast side down, about 15 minutes; turn and cook for about 10
minutes until browned. Carefully remove with two forks; place on
wire rack to drain. Serve hot or cold.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Cooking time is about 2 minutes per pound; do not
overcook, or turkey will fall apart when removed from oil. If
undercooked, complete cooking in microwave oven.

 &HT;    Do it your way: Relax _ and don't fret all the fun out of
cooking the turkey
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about cooking the Thanksgiving turkey is
that none exists. Every year at this time the newspaper food
sections and cooking magazines are filled with a panoply of advice,
tips and techniques guaranteed to pop your pop-up timer.
</P>
<P>
   You start the oven on high, and then turn it down. You start low
but not so low that your guests are felled by salmonella. You
stuff. You don't stuff. You roast the turkey upside down. You tent
foil over it. You wrap it in cheesecloth. You immerse it in hot
oil. You buy frozen. You buy fresh. You baste every 20 minutes like
your life depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   One year, for an article, I decided to put it all to the test
and cooked so many turkeys my family worried for my sanity. I
cooked turkey after turkey until I reached a couple of conclusions
about the whole enterprise:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The first and most important conclusion is that overcooked
turkey is not such a terrible thing. Seriously. I'd rather have
overcooked turkey than overcooked roast beef or overcooked
asparagus any day. The white meat will get that weirdly crumbly
texture if you leave it in a couple of hours too long, but it's
nothing that extra gravy and stuffing can't rectify. And the dark
meat is close to indestructible. So relax.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The second conclusion is that technique does make a
difference, but it all depends on you _ your skills, your kitchen,
your pots and pans. You'll have much greater success cooking the
turkey the way Mom or Betty Crocker taught you if the effort
required for some of these other techniques gives you the willies.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I pitted three stylish turkeys _ one brined, one
wrapped in cheesecloth, one upside down _ against a gobbler cooked
Mom's way, i.e., plunked in a disposable roaster and tented with
foil. I didn't try deep-frying; I'm sorry, but a cauldron of
350-degree oil is not something I want to contend with on
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   All the various techniques have the same goal: to keep some
moisture in the breast meat while giving the legs the time they
need to cook through.
</P>
<P>
   The brining was a fascinating technique. You rub the turkey
inside and out with 2 pounds of salt, then cover it with water and
let it soak for 4-6 hours. Then you rinse it well and roast as
normal. The one I brined did have better flavor and more succulence
than regular turkey, though succulence is a relative term when
you're talking turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, I'm not sure it's the kind of project I want to
undertake on Thanksgiving. I don't want to donate four-fifths of my
precious refrigerator space to a bucket of salt water big enough to
immerse a 25-pound carcass in.
</P>
<P>
   The cheesecloth method calls for wrapping the whole turkey in
several thicknesses of cloth, then smearing it with soft butter or
oil. I ended up with no noticeable betterment of the breast meat,
but a gorgeous skin _ the kind of mahogany shellack that I had seen
only in commercials. Nonetheless, I didn't like having to demummify
the turkey prior to serving, particularly since the cheesecloth
stuck to the skin in several places.
</P>
<P>
   The upside-down method seemed a winner through and through. I
bought an adjustable V-shaped rack. I painted the turkey with
melted butter and roasted it, breast down, in the rack. While the
sky-high thighs cooked faster, the juices ran down into the breast.
Before the last hour of cooking time, I flipped it with wads of
paper towels, which wasn't as difficult a task as you might think.
It did look a little pointy _ like a baby delivered with forceps _
but I managed to rack up a lot of compliments on that turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mom's turkey wasn't so different. Like Mom, I roasted the
turkey with foil loosely tented over it until the last hour or two
of cooking, then removed the foil and began basting every few
minutes to get some color into the skin.
</P>
<P>
   When all was said and done, though, I switched to the
upside-down method. It works for me and, well, I invested in that
V-shaped rack. What other time am I going to use it?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For parents who fruitlessly searched empty store aisles for last
year's blockbuster electronic toy, Furby, or who braved lines that
would have done the retail system of the Soviet Union proud to wait
for a Tickle Me Elmo in 1996, take heart: the toy industry feels
your pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good actually,'' said Alan Marcus, a spokesman
for FAO Schwarz, in discussing the annual shortages that seem to
turn the quest for each year's hot toy into a frustrating treasure
hunt. ``It builds customer excitement. It keeps customers on their
toes. It makes the experience fun when people keep their
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary parents can expect even more perspective this year,
perhaps enough to wonder whether these apparent shortages aren't as
manufactured as Furby's canned speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way hot toys become hot toys is completely marketing and
hype,'' said Marianne Szymanski, president of Toy Tips
(www.toytips.com), which tests toys in affiliation with Marquette
University. ``First, their manufacturers declare them to be the hot
toy of the year. It's just their opinion, but it gets picked up by
the media. Then it's been my experience that when parents rush out
to stores, they can't get the toys. That suggests that either the
toys are not there or the manufacturer won't get them there until
the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers and retailers, however, recoil at the suggestion that
they create shortages _ or at least the impression of shortages _
to build interest. ``It would never benefit us to create any kind
of shortages,'' said Lana Simon, a spokeswoman for Tiger
Electronics, the Hasbro unit that makes Furby. ``We don't win;
customers don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Simon said the production of Furbys was intended to
be sufficient but demand had been unexpectedly high. ``Last year
between Oct. 2 and the end of December we sold four million
Furbies, which is a lot of product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furby, like many toys, was first unveiled to buyers during last
year's American International Toy Fair, the biggest toy trade show
in the Western Hemisphere. Toy Fair takes place in February, just
after toys from the previous holidays have been broken or
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Furby's fuzzy exterior was still incomplete and its
full set of electronic tricks were still in development at the 1998
fair, Marnie Lawrence, a senior buyer for FAO Schwarz, knew that
Tiger had a winner. ``Even in that form you could see that it was a
wonderful toy, innovative and interesting,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   By late spring of 1998, most stores had ordered their holiday
stock. In the summer, the creatures were mass-produced in China,
where nearly all electronic toys are now made. Then they were then
shipped by sea to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Szymanski concedes that long lead times can make it
difficult for toy sellers and makers to estimate how many units it
will take to sate the public's appetite for a new toy. Furby was
scheduled for an elaborate introduction on Oct. 2, 1998, at FAO
Schwarz's flagship store in Manhattan. Before it was released, the
toy got a head start from a long, laudatory article in Wired
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Thanksgiving, the demand for Furby started to
outstrip store inventories, and Tiger was soon caught in a squeeze.
After an order was placed by Tiger at its headquarters in Illinois,
it took 10 days to manufacture a Furby in China and two to four
weeks to ship it by sea. In November, Tiger began flying the toys
across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lawrence confesses that she didn't foresee that come
November 1998, a Furby famine would quickly develop, creating a
black market in the nattering dolls and empty shelves in toy stores
everywhere. ``Oh my goodness, no,'' she said. ``It's one of those
toys that comes along once in a career.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fact that another six million Furbys have been
sold this year, during the slowest period for toy sales, suggests
that the holiday backlog was probably impossible to overcome last
year, Ms. Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with several toy industry representatives produced
no clear answers to the question of what electronic toy might
follow Furby as this year's runaway hit _ or even if there will be
a toy that will scale such heights.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Barlett, a spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of
America, said that while many _ if not all _ new toys were billed
as the next big thing, those claims were proved only when the
holiday buying season was well under way. While Tickle Me Elmo
dominated the 1996 season, she said, ``it wasn't until the Friday
after Thanksgiving that Tickle Me Elmo was declared to be a hot
item.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever really knows for sure what's going to be hot,''
she said. ``I haven't heard about any surprise hit for this year.
I'm as curious as anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents who can't take another season of long lines but also
fear disappointing their children, Ms. Szymanski offers a consoling
thought: ``Before the hype begins, the hot toy of the season is not
at the top of children's lists.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her research has found that the gadgety features that
have become a required feature of hot sellers often hold little
sustained appeal for children. Much to Ms. Szymanski's amazement,
every annual survey of toy popularity Toy Tips has conducted since
1991 has been topped by the same toy: the Twister game, where a
vinyl sheet is about as high-tech as things get. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Choices for Electronic Toys Include Old Favorites and Some New
Challengers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hot or not, here are some choices for electronic toys this
season. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. HAMMERHEAD FX The smoothly sculptured Hammerhead FX game pad
($39.99) houses tiny vibrating motors that offer force-feedback
shakes, rattles and rolls in response to on-screen blasts and
bang-ups. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. LEGO MINDSTORMS No computer is needed for two new products in
the Mindstorms line of buildable, programmable robots _ the
Robotics Discovery Kit ($149.99) and the Droid Developer Kit
($99.99). Instead, there are programming buttons on the systems'
brick-size microcomputer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. SIDEWINDER FORCE FEEDBACK PRO This $129 game controller from
Microsoft is perfect for those whose love to shake, rattle and
roll. A standard joystick costs closer to $29, but the SideWinder
is better engineered and smarter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. SAITEK R100 RACING WHEEL Why should anyone not use a racing
wheel and pedals to hurl their virtual speedsters through their
paces? This $50 system attaches quickly and easily to any PC game
port. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. SEGA DREAMCAST The best television-based game platform around
(for now), the 128-bit Dreamcast system produces dazzling 3-D
graphics and CD-quality sound. At $199, it can play games that
rival those played on a good computer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. QX3 COMPUTER MICROSCOPE Mattel and Intel created a clever toy
and learning tool that for $99.95 magnifies anything from bug wings
to flower petals up to 200 times _ showing its findings on
computers running Windows 98. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEO GEO POCKET COLOR The first true challenger to the ubiquitous
Nintendo Game Boy and Game Boy Color, the 16-bit Neo Geo has a
larger screen, can display more vibrant and varied colors and has a
natural-feeling horizontal design. There are 20 or so games
available for the $69.95 Neo Geo, by SNK.

ONLINE SHOPPING GUIDES HUNT FOR BARGAINS, THE BARGAINS THEY WANT
YOU TO SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The agents are ready for service. The question is, whom will
they serve?
</P>
<P>
   For years, futurists have said that the World Wide Web will
enable automated shopping robots, or bots, to instantly scan
hundreds of merchants to help penny pinchers find the best goods at
the lowest price.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been some comparison shopping services, but they
have often been on small sites started as hobbies or technology
demonstrations. Often users found searches that turned up either
nothing or too many, often irrelevant items.
</P>
<P>
   But now, just in time for the holiday shopping frenzy, there is
a new generation of bots to help shoppers sort through the vastly
expanding array of merchandise on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest services, like America Online and Yahoo, have them.
And some of the little startups, like MySimon (www.mysimon.com) and
DealTime (www.dealtime.com), have raised money and are upgrading
their sites with more products and better searching technology.
</P>
<P>
   There are comparison services for special areas, like Cnet
Shopper for computers (shopper.cnet.com/) and DealPilot for books
and music (www.dealpilot.com/). And even Amazon.com
(www.amazon.com), the giant of electronic commerce, has just
introduced its ``all product search'' shopping agent, which will
help people find out who carries items that Amazon does not stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these can help shoppers save time and money. But buyer
beware: that shopping agent is probably a double agent, with
loyalties to someone other than the consumer. The evidence: many of
the sites, like MySimon and Cnet Shopper, have stopped
automatically listing items with the lowest cost first. They put
items from advertisers first unless the user requests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and Disney's Go Network will not even list
merchants that do not pay for exposure.
</P>
<P>
   And even services that loudly proclaim that their shopping
listings are unbiased, like Frictionless Commerce on Lycos
(www.frictionless.com/), still take payments from merchants for
sending customers to their stores.
</P>
<P>
   The only bot that does not take money from merchants appears to
be Amazon. But to no surprise, its search engine skips over Barnes
&AMP; Noble and other big competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The other shopping agent companies say they have no choice but
to take money from the very merchants they are trying to compare.
After all, shoppers show little interest in paying fees to see
unbiased comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer, in terms of who pays the bills, is the
merchant,'' said Josh Goldman, chief executive of MySimon, one of
the more popular shopping sites. ``The technology is very cool that
can bring product information and prices to consumers, but it's
very threatening to merchants. They think comparison shopping is a
threat to their brands and a threat to their profit margins.''
</P>
<P>
   So Goldman changed the site so that merchants can pay to add
their logos and information about their promotions and special
services. Moreover, instead of listing products with the lowest
price first, it gives priority to these paying merchants.
</P>
<P>
   At first, merchants tried to block the shopping bots. And even
now, Ebay is blocking sites like AuctionWatch and Bidder's Edge,
which want to compare its auctions with those of other auction
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But most merchants now largely accept the comparison sites as
another source of customers. Although Amazon, the best-known name,
does not actively cooperate with other shopping agents, neither
does it block them from searching its site.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com (www.buy.com), a site devoted to selling computers,
books and other goods at near break-even profit margins, got many
of its initial customers through shopping bots.
</P>
<P>
   And even some merchants that are not the cheapest in the market
are embracing the shopping agents, particularly those that
de-emphasize price shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the comparison services are a good thing,''
said Greg Drew, chief executive of 800.com (www.800.com), a site
that sells consumer electronics. ``But I work to make sure the CEOs
of those sites understand that for complex products, like the ones
we sell, there are other factors besides price, like service,
after-purchase support and whether the merchant is an authorized
dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 800.com site has bought preferred placement on sites like
MySimon and Bottomdollar.com.
</P>
<P>
   But online shopping analysts say that as customers begin to
understand that many sites are now favoring advertisers, there may
be a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the search result is sorted by price, it doesn't leave any
room for editorial misdeeds,'' said Ken Cassar, a shopping analyst
with Jupiter Communications. ``But as soon as they alter the sort
order to one that is not relevant to the consumer, they raise
questions of integrity. And in the long run, users will gravitate
to the sites that are the least biased.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman says MySimon is providing a better service to consumers
than most other agents, because it lists 1,800 merchants and most
of them do not pay the company anything.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we list everyone in the world we can think of,
whether they pay us or not, says we are the only bot that can claim
to be unbiased,'' he said. ``Does someone say the Yellow Pages is
biased because one plumber has a quarter-page ad with a picture of
their truck and their phone number in big type?''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact shopping bot users seem to respond to these
promotions the way Yellow Pages users will often call the plumber
with the big ad.
</P>
<P>
   For example, only 21 percent of the users of the Cnet Shopper
site select the button that sorts listings by price, with the
cheapest first. If they do not, advertisers who paid to have their
logos displayed are listed first, followed by those that paid for
bold listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked'' by how few people sort by price, said Kevin
McKenzie, the co-head of electronic commerce at Cnet. ``But a lot
of people will pick a branded listing even if it is way off the
lowest price.'' This is great news for Cnet, which hopes to get
half its revenue from selling listings on the shopping site.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike MySimon, Cnet and many other sites will not even list
merchants unless they agree to some sort of payment.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually a benefit for both consumers and merchants,
argued Kevin D. Brown, the head of shopping strategy for Inktomi, a
company that operates the shopping search for a variety of sites
including Disney's Go Network, Time Warner's CNNfn and Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers don't want 100 undifferentiated merchants,'' he
said. ``And we can say to companies that are nervous about
comparison shopping that we are not overloading a category, so you
have a good shot of getting to a consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which operates the busiest shopping mall on the
Internet, just introduced a new service that lets users search and
compare more than one million items. But all those items are sold
by the 275 merchants who pay millions of dollars a year to be on
its shopping channel.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Gates, the head of AOL's shopping service, argues that
customers will find all the goods they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the 80-20 rule,'' he said. ``The brands we have online
drive the majority of the business.'' But there are notable
exceptions. Since Barnes &AMP; Noble is the exclusive bookseller on
AOL, Amazon, the No. 1 Internet retailer, never shows up in AOL's
product search.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's search does not give certain merchants priority over
others. But neither does it give users the option to sort results
by price. The only criteria for listing is the company's
proprietary ``relevance'' ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not hearing a lot of demand for price comparison from
our customer base,'' Gates said. ``People want to find the products
they are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's shopping search also emphasizes those merchants who pay
to be in the Yahoo Stores mall. But unlike AOL, which caters to the
richest merchants, Yahoo Stores is mainly a way for mom-and-pop
businesses to go online with relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a search on Yahoo Stores is likely to turn up unusual items
at small vendors but will miss many of the largest online
merchants. Unlike AOL, however, Yahoo offers a second search
option. After a user looks at all the offerings of its stores, it
will offer to search other nonpaying merchants on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the big portals get into the comparison shopping
business, there is a generation of new services that purport to be
the better bot, often by claiming to be more objective.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Frictionless Commerce, an offshoot of MIT
research, which lets users describe what they are looking for based
on a number of criteria.
</P>
<P>
   So shoppers can say whether they want the cheapest price, the
most liberal return policy or the strictest privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Search results will be ranked based on these factors and cannot
be influenced by advertising. But if a merchant that it lists has
an ``affiliate program'' that pays for referring customers,
Frictionless will sign up and take the money.
</P>
<P>
   DealTime is a service that lets users camp out on the steps of
merchants, waiting for prices to fall. Users enter what they want
to buy and the price they want to pay, and DealTime will e-mail
them as soon as it finds someone offering that price. Advertisers,
however, are listed first on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Another new approach is shopping bots that hover in the
background as a user surfs the Web. Once a user finds something,
say, a book on Amazon, the bot will search other sites to see
whether there are better deals elsewhere. These services are just
being introduced by ClickTheButton (www.clickthebutton.com/) and by
DealPilot, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne Ehrlich, the founder of ClickTheButton, says that the
year-old company is too new and that he does not know yet how it
will make money, but that it will probably try to earn some sort of
commission for introducing buyers to sellers.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the company does not exclude nonpaying merchants,
and it will always list items with the cheapest first, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who use comparison services don't want to go through
four screens to find the lowest price,'' Ehrlich said. ``The people
who say that price doesn't matter all have stock options and don't

 &HT;    COMDEX REPORT: HOME COMPUTER NETWORKS GAIN FAVOR
 &HT;    Moving in (l) lifestyle and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ When every member of the family loves to use the
Internet, standing in line to go on line is no fun.
</P>
<P>
   But some easy-to-use and affordable technology being showcased
here at Comdex, the big computer trade show, suggests that for
people with two or more personal computers in their homes, the long
wait may soon become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that more than 20 million U.S. homes already
have multiple PCs. That number is continuing to rise as young
family members ask for their own machines to download their
favorite music or complete homework assignments over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The trend may soon extend to the kitchen. Specialized computers
being shown here come with bar code readers that automatically let
homemakers know when food supplies are running low or when
freshness deadlines are about to expire. When linked to the
Internet, these computers can compile a grocery list tailored to
the family diet and arrange for delivery at a convenient time.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it's been too costly and complex for most
homeowners to connect their computers to a network so they can
share printers, scanners and access to the Internet, as well as
data files.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone can plug a telephone into a wall jack, using the
familiar plastic connector that phone companies call an RJ-11.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom Corp., a Silicon Valley firm, makes chips for units
selling for less than $100 under a variety of brand names that
connect computers via existing phone lines. The lines can be used
simultaneously for ordinary phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Such PC makers as Dell Computer Corp. will now install the RJ-11
networking jacks on their machines if customers request them.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology is gaining favor mainly through the need for
high-speed Internet links, currently installed in about 3 million
U.S. homes. But it can easily be extended as well to such
entertainment devices as game systems and the newly popular DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really shouldn't have to purchase a $500 machine for every
room in the home where you might want to watch a movie,'' said Adam
Stein, marketing director for Broadcom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extra cost and installation needs, some home users
still prefer Ethernet wiring, which can handle data at speeds up to
100 times faster that the 10 megabyte-per-second current capacity
of the phone lines. About 1 million homes are now
Ethernet-equipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some folks, it's the equivalent of putting marble counter
tops in their kitchens,'' said Jerry Devlin, general manager of
3Com Corp.'s personal communication division, which installs
Broadcom chips in many of its units.

IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE PANIC
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was how my holiday shopping began this year: As we were
driving home the other day, my 8-year-old middle daughter leaned
forward into our car's front seat airspace, brushed her bangs from
her eyes for the 10th time that hour and said: ``Dad, you're
Jewish, and so are Zoe and Clementine and me. We celebrate
Hanukkah. So why do we get presents on Christmas, too?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband said, ``Because your mother grew up with Christmas,
and she loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Ella replied wearily: ``Dad, how many times have I told
you? You should have stopped to think, before you married her,
about how confusing this was going to be for us kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, Ella, sorting out which holidays to celebrate can be
very confusing even for the adults in our family. The uncertainty
manifests itself in our annual holiday shopping system, which I
would describe in general terms as a belligerent refusal to
confront either an impending holiday or the need to shop for it
until, say, the day before. This is followed by a frazzled dash to
an overcrowded mall where we buy the children gifts for both
Hanukkah and Christmas, although spoiling them only results,
apparently, in even more cheekiness.
</P>
<P>
   That is why I vowed to change this year by doing all my holiday
shopping early and online.
</P>
<P>
   But holiday shopping does not migrate to the computer screen so
easily. The British anthropologist Daniel Miller has theorized,
after all, that shopping for those closest to you is an intimate
way to define your relationship to them. Holiday shopping,
therefore, is fraught with far more painful emotional overtones
than buying groceries or toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are really obsessed by are a few close personal
relations, with partners, children and so forth,'' he told me
recently. ``The consequence of the physical act of shopping for
those people is that you confront and define your relationships to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what I hoped to avoid. I wanted to bypass the sensations
of touching, of smelling, of wondering if a certain fuzzy grayish
blue sweater the exact color as Ella's eyes would be a more
appropriate gift for Hanukkah or for Christmas, then wondering
darkly if my decision would be symbolic of an unconscious
ambivalence toward _ oh, let's not get into it here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, let's just say I was looking forward to a comparatively
clinical approach. Online, I could point, click, enter some
emotionally neutral information about the expiration date of my
credit card. By changing the rules of the ritual, I hoped to
transform the fundamental nature of the shopping experience itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what happened:
</P>
<P>
   _ I bought no Christmas tree ornaments. Why is this significant?
Because I always buy Christmas tree ornaments. In other words, the
kinds of things I bought online were different. If I were wandering
through real stores redolent with holiday smells of candles and
potpourri and the subtle pressure of carols piped into the sound
system, I would have made holiday-related impulse purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I bought safe things that I didn't need to see or to
touch to appreciate, like books and board games that I played with
as a child. Later, I found out that this pattern of buying is
typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a living example of my research, I must say,'' said
Eugene Fram, a professor of marketing at the Rochester Institute of
Technology in upstate New York, who has conducted two studies of
online shoppers' habits in the last five years. ``You're in
cyberspace, and cyberspace is cold. So online shoppers buy safe
products, those without risk of color, fabric, style, complexity. A
book is a book is a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, safe does not have to mean boring. I bought bottles
of invisible ink, a set of pens to tint black-and-white photographs
and a cardboard playhouse with walls you can color, all from Flax
Art and Design (www.flaxart.com), a San Francisco art supply store
that I would not have stumbled into except online.
</P>
<P>
   _ I started shopping earlier than ever. And instead of a single
shopping marathon, I shopped a little bit each day. It was so easy
to do without leaving my desk.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I still couldn't beat the crowds. For instance, when I
visited www.mujionline.com, a Web site that was set up to attract
overseas holiday shoppers to the Japan-based Muji department store,
two of the three items I wanted were sold out _ in early November.
Only when I tried to add them to my shopping basket did I learn
they were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   At www.toysRus.com, the crowds were so thick one recent
afternoon that it took me an hour to get onto the site's Big Book
page, where the company is offering first-time buyers $10 off
purchases of $25 or more through Nov. 20. Once there, I found
problems. The price on one item, a Play-Doh Super Value set, did
not match the price in a print catalog that I received in the mail
a few days earlier. So I didn't buy it. Also, the site was so
sluggish that it took me 13 minutes to successfully place two items
into a shopping basket, and then it took an additional 17 minutes
to complete the order.
</P>
<P>
   This could be because, as a company spokeswoman explained to me
later, 62 million people received the same catalog that I did,
causing the site's traffic to increase 1,000 percent in a single
week. Good for Toys ``R'' Us sales? Maybe. But very annoying for
me.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous, online shortages and traffic jams are
expected to get worse. ``Shop early, because I think there will be
some major problems with fulfillment of orders; a lot of these
virtual retailers and distributors will not be able to handle the
movement of goods in a timely fashion,'' said Jack Gifford, a
professor of marketing at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. ``I
just bought two pieces of software online from Microsoft _ who
should be good at this _ and there's a 40-day wait. I probably
could walk into a real store and get it today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some online businesses are starting with a storefront, but
don't have the fully integrated back-room systems that real stores
would. They're madly building warehouses to try to catch up. But
that takes time,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the holidays loom closer, follow the advice of Nick
Karris, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors, which publishes reviews
of online merchants at www.gomez.com. ``Ask yourself, is this a
credible site?'' Karris said. ``How long has it been in business?
And ask yourself, do they have a clear policy on how they are going
to support me if I have to return something or if I have a
question?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ I saved money. Comparison shopping was so much easier to do
online, where I could check out a dozen or more merchants' prices
in a half-hour. And I found that the selection was much better. For
instance, when I went hunting for Playmobil dollhouse furniture, I
learned that I could beat the price advertised at www.etoys.com by
$5 by bidding on the same item at www.ebay.com. Of course, the Ebay
item was not new from a store. But it did arrive in a never-opened
box that looked just like new.
</P>
<P>
   And I saved in other ways. While shopping for books to ship to
five nieces and nephews, I found that the prices were virtually
identical at www.amazon.com and at www.barnesandnoble.com. Since
Barnesandnoble.com was offering free shipping the second week in
November (an incentive for early shoppers that may not be repeated
this holiday season, a spokesman said), I did my research on
Amazon, where its software knows my preferences, then placed the
order with Barnesandnoble.com. My savings: $7.75. A few days later,
however, follow-up e-mail from Barnesandnoble.com listed shipping
charges. I called the site's toll-free number; a polite customer
service representative apologized for what he described as a system
error and credited my account.
</P>
<P>
   _ I began to crave human contact. Well, what I really missed was
advice from helpful sales clerks. So I went to www.thegift.com,
which has a Gift Finder assistant to help shoppers make selections.
The site's chief executive, Jeff Swearingen, had told me in a phone
interview that after I entered information about the recipient, the
tool would search through a database of about 500 gifts to come up
with a list of 30 that would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   So I told the Gift Finder the recipient of the gift (my
husband), his age (over 20) and how much I wanted to spend (any
amount). That last answer was a lie, of course, but to put a price
on love (one of the other options was ``$20 or less'') seemed a
little cold, even for me.
</P>
<P>
   Then I got hung up describing the recipient's personality
traits; none of the eight choices, ranging from ``homebody'' to
``dainty and demure,'' conjured a mental image of my husband. I
settled for ``career-minded,'' but the recommended gifts all
sounded too impersonal, so I gave up. I mean, what would your
husband say if you handed him a three-pound tin of jumbo cashews
($28) and called it a gift?
</P>
<P>
   The problem here, and at a number of other sites that steered me
toward merchandise sold by their merchandising partners, was that
the selection was too limited. It made no sense, to me, to retreat
to the restrictive setting of Internet shopping malls that
showcased a limited number of retailers, like www.bocado.com and
www.foofoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ I bought just as much for myself as usual. Maybe more, come to
think of it, because more of the things I wanted were available
online than, say, if I had been standing in the science-kits aisle
of a local toy store. Online, I bought a wooden artists' mannequin
and a political poster from the Cultural Revolution that depicts
cheery Chinese farmers walking home from work.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I have completed about half of my holiday shopping
online. While the experience has been, for the most part, pleasant
_ I'm convinced that I am living in the golden age of shopping _ it
has not changed the fundamental nature of the shopping experience.
No, Ella, it did not miraculously make everyone in our family
Jewish. It didn't even give us all the same last name. Nor did it
help me decide which holiday would be more appropriate for someone
to receive a heather-gray V-neck sweater from www.delias.com (free
shipping on orders of more than $40).
</P>
<P>
   When I reported my conclusions to Professor Miller at University
College London, he said that maybe I had expected too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just finished a new book about the use of the Internet,''
he said, ``and I found that it makes far less difference than
people seem to expect. When the telephone first came out, we
thought it would change basic relationships. Instead, it's just a
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the tool made it easier to buy two sweaters.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milder weather will spread east from the Plains reaching the
southern Great Lakes and Middle Atlantic states by Thursday
afternoon. High pressure centered over the Carolinas will circulate
the warmer air toward southern New England Friday. Sunshine will
abound Thursday from the southwest Plains to the central Atlantic
seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a mound of frigid air will push southeastward from
Quebec into northern New England. Clouds and a few patches of light
snow will develop over the higher terrain and in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore winds will bring ocean clouds and perhaps a shower to
eastern Florida. More humid air streaming north into Texas should
produce fog in the hill country. Despite strengthening winds from
the south, which will gust to 35 miles an hour, bright and
unseasonably warm conditions will cover the central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance developing over Nebraska will begin to cause
inclement weather in the upper Plains. Showers will commence in the
central Dakotas in the afternoon, but farther west, rain will
change to snow with a few inches likely in eastern Montana and
western North Dakota. Snow showers will linger in the higher
elevations of Wyoming, eastern Utah and western Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler air will be the rule in the Rockies. High pressure
cresting over Idaho will keep temperatures near seasonal levels.
The interior Southwest will turn cooler while offshore winds will
bring sunshine to southern California. Breezes from the south will
direct milder, dry air into the Northwest, but clouds will increase
ahead of cold front off the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Lenny's Legacy
</P>
<P>
   With a central barometric pressure of 27.55 inches on Wednesday,
Hurricane Lenny became not only the strongest November hurricane of
record, but also one of the most powerful storms in the northeast
Caribbean. The tempest rapidly intensified Wednesday in a part of
the sea that usually finds hurricanes weakening. Most storms are
just entering the Caribbean from the east when they encounter a
band of high-level winds from the west that inhibit their
development. Instead, Lenny was aided by this wind flow and
strengthened further as it moved east through the northern Leeward
Islands.

WHERE ELECTRONIC CONSUMERS CAN GIVE AS WELL AS RECEIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(One of a series of articles on online holiday shopping) 
(jt) 
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-Commerce may do many things, but wiping out world hunger won't
be among them. Nonetheless, the anticipated droves of consumers
heading online this holiday season may come across a proliferation
of charity malls and other Web-based programs that offer
opportunities to donate to a worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet shopping is good for philanthropy,'' said Mark
Rovner, director of CMS Interactive, a Web consultancy for
charitable organizations based in Arlington, Va. ``People who've
bought five or more items online are more likely to give online as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prevalent and convenient ways holiday shoppers
can make donations while they shop on the Internet is through
charity malls, including iGive.com, 4Charity.com and
Greatergood.com. These sites are set up to let consumers buy
products from leading online merchants and designate a charity to
receive a percentage of the money spent. When a shopper registers
at iGive (www.igive.com/html/intro.cfm), for example, then heads to
the American Greetings site to buy a stack of Christmas cards,
American Greetings will contribute up to 15 percent of the purchase
to a selected cause.
</P>
<P>
   The charity mall model also extends to portals that do not
necessarily have philanthropy as their focus. When shoppers
register at Zipple.com, for example, &UR;  &LR; a new Jewish portal
(www.zipple.com), a percentage of the proceeds from the products
they buy at Zipple links will be donated to Jewish charities like
the Jewish Federation of Chicago and the Jewish Federation of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of giving till you drop may have an appeal,
some charity malls keep part of the proceeds to pay for their
overhead. In addition, many online merchants who participate in
such programs require minimum purchases before the charity receives
its portion of the proceeds. As a result, experts say there are
more effective ways to donate money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen whether any of the charity portals are
going to reach critical mass,'' Rovner said. ``I think the
Internet's real promise is for facilitating direct relationships
with the charities themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of such online charitable programs say even
incremental sums of money gathered from consumers while they shop
online are worth seeking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's money that wouldn't otherwise be going to the charities
to begin with,'' said Dan Langan, a spokesman for the National
Charities Information Bureau in Manhattan. ``If they can give while
shopping at L.L. Bean, that's all to the good.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the charity malls, a number of sites let shoppers
direct rebates, gift certificates and rewards to charitable
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dash.com, a virtual mall at www.dash.com where 100 retailers
offer 5 percent to 25 percent discounts on their products, will
give consumers the option of donating the money saved to one of
four charities: the American Cancer Society, Greenpeace, the United
Way of America or the World Wildlife Federation, beginning
Thanksgiving Day. Dash charges no administrative fees, and the
charities receive the entire amount of the discounts, said Andrew
Surwilo, Dash's vice president for partnership marketing.
</P>
<P>
   _ GiftSpot.com (www.giftspots.com/Giftspot/default.asp.) sells
gift certificates for retailers, including eToys and Sharper Image.
Shoppers can apply the full amount (or the change) to charities
like the American Lung Association and Easter Seals.
</P>
<P>
   _ ClickRewards.com, a site that uses air miles as a reward for
consumers who shop at one of 60 retail partners at
www.clickrewards.com, will match every dollar donated to CARE, Dads
and Daughters, Rainforest Action Network, the Special Olympics and
Unicef with two ClickMiles, which are redeemable for frequent-flier
miles and upgrades at nine airlines.
</P>
<P>
   _ MyPoints.com rewards its members by giving points for
responding to retail advertisements on its site
(www.mypoints.com/index.html). Members who usually apply their
points toward gift certificates to retailers like Macy's and Barnes
&AMP; Noble can turn their points into cash to be donated to the
American Red Cross or the Toys for Tots Foundation through the end
of December.
</P>
<P>
   Online gift catalogs produced by smaller nonprofit organizations
like the Heifer Project (catalog.heifer.org) and World Vision
(www.worldvisiongifts.org/worldvision/appeals.nsf/stable/agc) allow
shoppers to make donations in someone's name as a gift without
having to shop at another online retailer. The Heifer Gift catalog
features a selection of animals, birds and trees that can be bought
for a family in need in any of the 60 countries it sponsors. At the
World Vision site, shoppers can buy animals, sponsor a child or
donate money toward the distribution of clothing and food.
</P>
<P>
   Other gift catalogs, including One-Nest.com (www.onenest.com),
which goes live in December, and World2Market.com showcase and sell
artwork, jewelry and crafts made by artisans around the world
(www.world2market.com). Both organizations work with nonprofit
organizations to help artisans establish businesses over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers who are low on funds or just browsing can head to the
Hunger Site (www.hungersite.com), where it's not necessarily the
thought, but the click that counts. Hitting the Donate Free Food
button will call up a page of banner advertisements from companies
including Games2Learn and ProFlowers. Each company pays the Hunger
Site a half-cent every time its advertisement appears, enough to
buy a quarter-cup of rice for the United Nations World Food
Program, which serves 80 countries. The combined sponsors add up to
about three cents for each click, ultimately generating 100 tons of
food each week, said John Breen, a computer programmer based in
Bloomington, Ind., who opened the site in June.

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's it like at the top when all your colleagues
are animated and you live in a paper-cutout house? Steve is the
human host of Nickelodeon's ``Blue's Clues,'' the most watched
preschool television show in the United States. A man-boy who is
not afraid of looking dumb, Steve towers, physically, over the
Muppets, the alien Teletubbies and the pocket monsters that are the
rock stars of the kiddie-entertainment circuit. If Pokemon is
mythically hip, Steve is nerd transcendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a micro-celebrity, about as small a celebrity as you can
be,'' said Steven Burns, 26, who has played Steve since the first
show in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when F.A.O. Schwarz sponsored the May 1998 introduction
of show-related products, 7,000 people turned out to meet Steve and
his sidekick, Blue, a powder-blue ``girl'' dog.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Zier and her daughter, Maggie, 4, were among the
well-wishers who waited in the rain. ``I don't think anyone knew
until that morning what a sensation the show was,'' Ms. Zier said.
Next week, a 63-foot-tall Blue will join Macy's Thanksgiving Day
parade.
</P>
<P>
   With pie-plate eyes and a full spectrum of affirming thumbs-up
gestures, Steve is a Candide for the millennium, fending off
cynicism and teaching children that needing to be clued in is cool.
In each episode, Blue leaves paw-print clues for Steve to find and
assemble into a story, song or activity.
</P>
<P>
   Steve the character may live in a bright yellow house with
different patterned wallpaper in every room and a big red Thinking
Chair, but Steve the person wanted a minimal loft with a leather
sofa and a view of the Brooklyn Bridge. There isn't a television in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Burns admitted that when he was a young couch potato, watching
Mr. Rogers made him uncomfortable. Now, he thinks of Mr. Rogers as
a gentle genius. The antic Pee-wee Herman, before his disgrace, was
also an inspiration, but Burns' true role model, in terms of
sincerity, humor and sheer lovability, is the blue Muppet Grover.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I used to sit around and talk about the
importance of Samuel Beckett, James Joyce and David Mamet,'' said
Burns, who studied theater at Allentown College in Pennsylvania.
``Now, I sit around and discuss the importance of Grover's early
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Clues,'' seen by 14.6 million viewers each week, is a
major success for Nick Jr., the educational arm of Nickelodeon.
Aimed at children between 2 and 5, the show is churning up the
sandbox in the small but intensely orchestrated world of children's
quality television.
</P>
<P>
   Much hinges on the ability of Steve to work on multiple levels.
``Here's the mail, it never fails; it makes me want to wag my tail,
and when it comes, I always wail, `Mail!''' Steve performs the
oft-repeated ditty with gusto (wagging his rear end) and with a
knowing hint of Al Jolson in his voice. Children jump up and shake
their own bottoms; parents are left wondering, who is this guy?
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Nobody &LR;  could be that guy,'' Burns said. ``He wouldn't last
30 seconds in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The signature green-striped rugby shirt is off as Burns, in a
black sweater over a black T-shirt, downed a slab of sausage pizza
last week at a favorite Italian restaurant in Brooklyn, around the
corner from his new loft. Youngsters nearby didn't recognize him.
``If I don't turn it on, kids don't know it's me,'' he said. ``But
I can make them recognize me by going a little bit yopey-dopey.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he pounces and somersaults from set to set with
considerable agility, Steve still has a hard time finding clues and
needs all the help he can get from an animated cast of chatty
extras and the children who are watching. The show's techniques are
without precedent: snail's pacing, viewer participation required to
advance the plot, constant repetition of set pieces (``We just
figured out Blue's clues, we just figured out Blue's clues, We just
figured out . . . '') and perhaps most radical, a male host who
asks for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're raising a generation of boys who are not going to be
afraid to pull into a gas station and ask for directions,'' said
Brown Johnson, the senior vice president at Nick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pee-wee Herman and Mr. Rogers, Steve, who stares
trustingly straight at the camera with Rudolf Valentino eyes, has
developed an avid following among both preteen girls and mothers.
The former send torrents of e-mail; the latter scrutinize the show
with an intensity that might make even Elmo, the red Muppet, blush.
</P>
<P>
   One mother, Lottchen Shivers, dressed up her 5-year-old son as
Steve for Halloween, right down to the rugby shirt and a haircut
with fringe bangs. (Little Sammy didn't buy it; he wanted to be a
lion.) Heather Mee and her son, Eric, have been fans ``from the
very beginning,'' she said, adding, ``I watch his performances
really closely to see if and when he's going to lose it, but he's
brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention Burns has received isn't all upbeat. Last spring,
when disturbing rumors began to circulate that Steve had been in a
car accident, taken a drug overdose or been diagnosed with cancer,
Rosie O'Donnell invited Burns to appear on her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I died a whole lot of different ways,'' the actor said of the
inexplicable reports. ``It didn't bother me except when they
involved negative things. Rosie's kid is a big fan, so I just went
on and said, `Hi, I'm alive. Bye.' It was pretty easy to prove I
wasn't dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who comes across as the sedated twin of the hyperactive
Steve, acknowledged that meaning so much to impressionable children
is both a privilege and a burden. ``At first, I really did see it
as a little bit of a sentence,'' he said. ``I thought, `This really
cool kids' show just got huge, and I'm stuck in this green striped
shirt for the rest of my life.''' Quickly he added, ``But it's not
like that _it's great working for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Burns, a co-producer of the show, has his own plans for Steve's
future. ``I'd like to see him loosen up,'' he said. Recently, Steve
slipped in an Elvis impression. ``It was hysterical,'' Gay Feldman
said. ``I felt he was really doing something aimed at me as an
adult. My kids wanted to know why I was laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Boyertown, Pa., the youngest of three children, Burns
set out for New York, he said ``to fail privately as an actor''
before moving onto something else. He paid his dues, living in a
basement apartment around Times Square with views of hustlers from
the knees down, and he made guest appearances on ``Homicide'' and
``Law and Order.'' When he first found success it was as a
voice-over artist recording advertisements (McDonald's Arch Deluxe,
1-800-Collect). When he showed up to audition for the part of
Steve, he had long hair and an earring. ``I was a bit of a skate
rat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' loft seems to owe equal parts to the brooding extras he
has played and the man-boy he is on ``Blue's Clues.'' It's a guy's
pad: lots of space and not much in it. The black couch has a coffee
table in front of it made of rusted steel. (Worry about tetanus
shots, not dents.) The refrigerator (empty but for club soda,
champagne and a half-pint of EggBeaters) is decorated with
photographs of women in bikinis. They're just friends, Burns said.
``I'm painfully single at the moment.'' An electric guitar stands
in the corner (his favorite music: the mopey British rock band
Radio Head). In the bedroom, a red velvet Thinking Chair, just like
the one on the show, is piled with laundry. ``I just can't bring
myself to sit on it,'' he said.

 BEYOND THE PALM PILOT: NEW BRANDS AND FEATURES FOR PDAs  
 (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to personal digital assistants, ``Hey, beam me your
number'' might become the most popular line in singles bars before
too long. With the success of the Palm Pilot line, the era of the
personal digital assistant has truly arrived. Features have
increased, prices have decreased and the devices are becoming
ubiquitous in certain circles. Think about how many of your friends
have innocently purchased one and then become wholly engulfed by a
new love and a cult-like zeal, caressing the device at frequent
intervals and scouring the Web for hot new applications to download
and lovingly install.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the peaceful era of the PDA may be ending, a victim of the
gadget's success. There are so many new features being added _ tons
of RAM, wireless communications capabilities and interchangeable
expansion modules, for example _ that today's PDA may be
unrecognizable in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Consider its history: The first two models of the Palm Pilot,
both released by U.S. Robotics in 1996, each had less than a
megabyte of RAM within their square gray plastic cases. But the
Pilot was a winner because of its ease of use, the speed and
flexibility of its operating system, its ability to synchronize
easily with a desktop computer (Windows or Macintosh) and its
fairly accurate handwriting recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Three years and several names and models later, the trusty Palm
Pilot _ or just Palm, as most of the new ones are called _ has
become a must-have accessory for everyone from fashion mavens to
stockbrokers. For those who want a truly pocket-size PDA that
wrangles their contact and schedule information with blazing speed
while still leaving plenty of zip and room for scads of other
programs, Palm Computing offers a range of Palm models and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has taken the opposite tack with its PDA operating
system, Windows CE, which it offers to hardware manufacturers like
Casio and Compaq. While the Palm provided a platform that expanded
to handle different models with thousands of software applications,
Windows CE devices try to cram an entire Windows desktop inside a
PDAs tiny plastic frame. Mobile professionals who need multimedia
and a familiar computing environment for the road may want to
consider one of the Windows CE devices. Some of the newer models
will let you play audio files, view full-color images and, if you
have the right equipment, even record your own mini-movies.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you choose among PDAs, knowing that, as with personal
computers, a new platform or feature may leave you technologically
stranded? One alternative may be the Visor, the recently introduced
handheld organizer that uses the popular Palm operating system and
has some nice features of its own, like the Springboard cartridge
slot on the back that expands the unit's functions. Cartridges that
will let you turn the Visor into an MP3 player, a multicity travel
guide and a video-game player are out or in the works. For users
investing in the future, the Visor mixes Palm power with room to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your needs in terms of pocket computing, there is bound
to be something out there that will fit your needs this holiday
season. And with miniature computers becoming smaller and faster
with each generation, it seems as if it won't be too long before
they will be tiny and indispensable enough to be directly implanted
into the brain (although the add-on cartridges might be a little
uncomfortable).
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   SOME POPULAR PDAs
</P>
<P>
   1. PALM VX  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the major complaints about the Palm Vx's predecessor, the
Palm V, was it came with only two measly megabytes of RAM
installed. Ample RAM is important for storing the things that
really make the Palm a vital tool: third-party programs. The Palm
Vx fixes that problem by giving users eight megabytes of memory in
that same wafer-thin, anodized-aluminum case. While this model does
not offer built-in wireless connectivity and instant Internet
access, as Palm Computing's Palm VII model does, the Palm Vx is
small and robust enough to make itself indispensable for those with
a budget large and robust enough to handle its $449 price tag.
Those who still pine for wireless access might want to hold on
until early next year, when OmniSky Corp. and AT&AMP;T will roll out a
wireless modem and Internet services for Palm V-series users.
</P>
<P>
   2. HANDSPRING VISOR DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   Although Handspring's new Visor, which runs on the Palm OS, may
seem like a budget version of the Palm, it has an ace up its
sleeve: the Springboard slot, which handles cartridges containing
games, reference guides and MP3 players. Although there are not
very many Springboard cartridges on the market yet, there are
plenty in the works. The most expensive model, the Visor Deluxe,
sells for $249 and comes with eight megabytes of RAM, a built-in
microphone, USB connectivity, a leather case and the cradle needed
to synchronize the device with a desktop computer. All the Visor
models work with both Windows and Macintosh systems.
</P>
<P>
   3. CASSIOPEIA E-105
</P>
<P>
   Color screens are a popular reason for picking a Windows CE
device over a Palm OS device, and the Cassiopeia E-105 screen seems
brighter and crisper than those of its CE competitors. The
expensive ($599) E-105 is also a versatile multimedia device; it
comes with a CD of audio and video programs that let you play music
and watch film clips after you have finished scheduling your
appointments for the day in the Pocket Outlook program that comes
with the unit. The Cassiopeia E-105 has 32 megabytes of RAM and a
Compact Flash card slot on the back for expansion modules. One nice
add-on: Casio's JK-710DC digital movie camera card for $299; it
lets you make your own tiny color movies, which can be exported to
your desktop machine.
</P>
<P>
   4. RHINOSKIN TITANIUM SLIDER
</P>
<P>
   Once you have sunk your money and all your personal data into
your trusty PDA, the last thing you want to do is to drop it on the
cold hard ground and watch its screen shatter. The new Titanium
Slider case from Rhinoskin ($99.95) for Palm computers has a
pewter-colored industrial finish on its hard outer case and a
neoprene inner lining to absorb shocks on the inside. True to its
name, the Slider's cover smoothly opens and slides under the back
for easy access to your machine.
</P>
<P>
   5. DOONEY &AMP; BURKE LEATHER PALM V CASE
</P>
<P>
   If your taste runs to the classic, try one of Dooney &AMP; Burke's
fine leather cases for Palm organizers. The Palm V case ($49.95)
comes in several colors. Other covers fit the larger Palms and
pagers.
</P>
<P>
   6. STOWAWAY THINK OUTSIDE
</P>
<P>
   Getting lots of text into a handheld computer is difficult and
tedious. The new Stowaway from Think Outside ($99) is a full-size
keyboard that folds up to the size of a handheld and can fit in a
pocket. It's the perfect accessory for a Palm V, and versions are
in the works for the Visor and the Compaq Aero 2100.

STUDY SHOWS CHILDREN ARE HOODED ON TV, COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Children spend so many hours watching
television, playing video games and the like that media use could
qualify as their full-time job, a study released Wednesday shows.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that the typical
American child spends more than 38 hours a week as a ``media
consumer'' in a home that averages three televisions, three tape
players, three radios, two VCRs, two CD players, a video game
player and a computer, as well as newspapers, magazines and comic
books.
</P>
<P>
   Children are less likely to live in a home with just one
television than in a house with five or more. Forty-two percent of
the children surveyed reported that a television is on at home
``most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that a third of young children and two-thirds
of older children have televisions in their bedrooms. More than a
third of all children have their own VCRs and/or video game
players, and about one in six has a bedroom computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to look at this research and not be hit square in
the face by the sheer amount of media that all kids use,'' said
Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The study is based on a representative sampling of 3,155
children ages 2-18 and was compiled based on school questionnaires,
in-home interviews and weeklong media-use diaries. It is the first
extensive study that takes into account not just television but the
full spectrum of media. It did not analyze or judge content - just
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials indicated, however, that the amount of time the
children spent with the various media is not cumulative, in that
the children sometimes did two things at the same time, such as
reading while listening to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that the typical child spends 5 1/2 hours per
day using media, and that television still overshadows all the
other options. Despite widespread access to computers, fewer than
half of children use a computer each day, and they spend very
little time doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewing accounted for 2 hours and 46 minutes per day,
followed by listening to CDs or tapes (45 minutes); reading
magazines, books, comics and newspapers (44 minutes); listening to
the radio (39 minutes); using the computer for fun (21 minutes);
playing video games (20 minutes); and using the Internet (8
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Supervision is often minimal or nonexistent. Half of the
children surveyed do not have any parental rules limiting their
time in front of the television or the kinds of programs they may
watch. For children 8 and older, 61 percent said they watch what
they want, when they want.
</P>
<P>
   Altman contends that the media saturation of childhood merits
special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how these kids will relate to nature and to
real human relationships,'' he said. ``What happens when they drive
to a mountaintop and take in a spectacular view: Will they get it,
or will it not move fast enough for them?''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Children from poor, single-parent, black or Hispanic families
are more likely to be heavy television watchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children who watch a lot of television also spend more time
reading on average than children who watch less television.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four out of five children will read or be read to in a typical
day, not counting school or homework, but they still spend five
times as much time in front of a television or computer screen as
they do reading. And the older they get, the less they read.

CHRISTMAS, HANUKKAH AND KWANZAA: THE VIRTUAL TRADITIONS

<P>
   Religious holidays abound at this time of year, but so do
holiday Web sites, which means you don't have to take a course in
comparative religion to figure out what to buy for what occasion or
to simply satisfy your curiosity about celebrations of Christmas,
Kwanzaa and Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   Searches for Christmas topics typically yield thousands of
vendors, family pages and other types of home pages. Several sites
explore the meaning of Christmas and how it is celebrated around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   A Holy Christmas 1999 has dozens of pages and links
(www.Rockies.net/spirit/sermons/christmaspage.html). There are
biblical accounts, Advent calendars, songs, sermons, classic
stories, games, articles on holiday stress and pages on Christmas
customs in Mexico, Germany, Poland and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the personal pages that are linked to the Holy Christmas
site no longer exist, but it is still an excellent resource for a
variety of information.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Eternal, from the Lattimer Memorial Methodist Church
in Belton, S.C., explains the origins of Christmas traditions like
Santa Claus, candy canes and placing candles in windows
(Members.carol.net/asmsmsks/xristmas.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Recipe.com (www.Christmasrecipe.com/) has everything
from cranberry salad to hot spiced cider, as well as multiple
recipes for fruitcake.
</P>
<P>
   The history and care of Christmas trees, holly, mistletoe,
poinsettias and other holiday plants are explored in an article on
About.com called ``The Botany of Christmas'' 
(Botany.miningco.com/education/scilife/botany/library/weekly/aa12239
7.htm).
</P>
<P>
   The Web also has sites for finding exotic holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Shop, for instance
(www.Therussianshop.com/russhop/christmas/christmas.htm), sells
brooches, cards based on historic Russian lacquered box paintings
and handmade nesting dolls, like those of Grandfather Frost and a
family of penguins.
</P>
<P>
   The Iguana site offers art items from around the world,
including Mexican tin Christmas ornaments and European blown-glass
ornaments (St14.yahoo.com/iguanacgs/christmas.html).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Internet has opened the borders for Christmas speeches
from around the world. Anglophiles and British expatriates can
watch Queen Elizabeth's annual address on the BBC site
(News.bbc.co.uk).
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa is celebrated for seven days beginning Dec. 26.
Festivals.com is a good starting point for learning about the
holiday (www.festivals.com/kwanzaa/). It has links to several other
Web sites, including the official Kwanzaa page, which begins with a
greeting from Dr. Maulana Karenga, who started Kwanzaa in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   There are also links to pages for events to be held in North
Carolina, Washington and New York; a Swahili dictionary (there are
more than 40 words for gift), and recipes for the Kwanzaa feast,
including two for African vegetable stew and another for futari, a
dish of squash and yams simmered in coconut milk.
</P>
<P>
   Melanet (www.melanet.com/kwanzaa/) also has extensive
information, including a detailed description of Kwanzaa's rituals.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a room for online chat about the seven principles
that form the holiday's core teachings: unity, self-determination,
collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose,
creativity and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Most Kwanzaa sites suggest giving educational gifts. The Melanet
page has a list of books about Kwanzaa for children, and a page at
the site of the public library in Flint, Mich., has a bibliography
that includes videos and fiction and nonfiction titles for children
and adults
(www.flint.lib.mi.us/fpl/resources/holidays/kwanzaa.html).
</P>
<P>
   There are many places on the Internet to purchase menorahs for
the eight nights of Hanukkah, including Jewish Source
(www.jewishsource.com/chanukkah/) and the Simon Wiesenthal Center
Museum of Tolerance (www.wiesenthal.com/bstore/galleria.html).
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution (or kaution) when searching the Web for
information on Hanukkah: it is variously spelled Hanukah, Hannukah,
Chanukah and Chanuka. Chanuka.com (www.chanuka.com/index.shtml) and
Holidays.net (www.holidays.net/chanukah/) offer pages for learning
more about the holiday, with history, recipes, games and links to
other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Two promising sites are still under construction _ and they had
better hurry, since Hanukkah begins at sundown on Dec. 3. Virtual
Jerusalem will offer children's pages and information on holiday
customs (www.vjholidays.com/chanukah/index.htm), and Chanukah 99
says it will have menorah lighting ceremonies around the world,
Hanukkah trivia and games with spinning dreidels
(www.chanukah98.com/).
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Communication Network (www.jcn18.com) offers a
slightly irreverent look at the holiday (search on ``Hanukkah''),
with songs like ``Hanukkah in Santa Monica'' and ``Macabees Are
Coming to Town.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also recipes for latkes, including one with jalapenos
and another with crab meat, which is a prohibited food for Jews who
follow kosher dietary laws. ``Must be the Alabama Baptist
influence,'' the page's editor notes.
</P>
<P>
   There are several calendars that note other December holidays.
The Multnomah County Library in Oregon has a comprehensive
diversity calendar
(www.multnomah.lib.or.us/lib/divcal/december.html) that includes
the start of the Islamic month of fasting, Ramadan (Dec. 9), and
Las Posadas (Dec. 16), a Mexican holiday leading up to Christmas
that re-enacts the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Many holiday Web sites have links to sites like Blue Mountain
Arts, where you can send a free e-mail card for Kwanzaa, Hanukkah
or Christmas (www.bluemountain.com/eng/seasonal/).
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mountain Arts has many seasonal cards, including one with a
dog, a cat and a mouse holding paws before a rising sun, in the
spirit of peace on earth.

TOOLS THAT LEVEL THE FIELD AND EASE THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is one in a series of articles on online shopping)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN C. MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the business traveler _ the Road Warrior or the home-based
worker, there is a wide range of useful gadgets that can help level
the competitive playing field or at least provide some fun.
</P>
<P>
   The trend as always is to make things smaller, faster and more
powerful, but also to combine functions and cut the cord. Wireless
is the buzzword. High-technology companies are releasing products
and services that deliver information from one of the wireless
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Those products and services include everything from interactive
pagers to Web surfing on a cell phone. You can check your e-mail
from the back of a cab, get real-time stock information on a pager
or bounce a signal off a satellite with a handheld computer to
pinpoint your location.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop computers, the Road Warrior's best friend, have gotten
lighter, smaller, more powerful and _ finally _ cheaper. (The
recent earthquakes in Taiwan may have disrupted the shipment of key
components enough to send prices back up.)
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of a DVD the new batch of laptops can double
as a portable office and a traveling entertainment center: audio
CDs or DVD movies counteract the limited choices on airplanes or
the expensive hotel fare.
</P>
<P>
   For those who work at home, the trend is to save space and be
efficient, making devices like flat-panel monitors and all-in-one
copier-printer-fax machines popular. The goal is to use these
devices to compensate for not having the support services you would
if you worked in a large company.
</P>
<P>
   Less technological but useful are items like: screen wipes,
canned air to get the dust out of keyboards, personalized mouse
pads and books about anything but computers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. GBC GUARDIAN CROSS-CUT 35x &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shredders have come out of the wastebasket and onto the desktop.
The self-contained GBC Guardian Cross-Cut 35x ($99.99) shreds three
to four sheets nicely into 400 unreadable chips (dumped into an
enclosed drawer that must be emptied frequently).
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to clutter up their desktop with a
shredder, the device can be mounted on the wall. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. DIGITAL PERSONA U.ARE.U FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION SYSTEM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now you can forget your password, again. For $99, the U.are.U
system from Digital Persona can read your fingerprint from any
angle and compare it with a securely stored image.
</P>
<P>
   The USB system, which does not require any power supply of its
own, can protect any or all of your applications, e-mail accounts
and Web pages. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. CASIO ALGEBRA FX 2.0 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As soon as handheld calculators appeared in classrooms,
educators warned that students would turn into mathematical
invalids. With the release of the Algebra FX 2.0, Casio
acknowledges that the doomsayers were partly right.
</P>
<P>
   The $149 calculator, designed for students in grades seven and
up, teaches by allowing students to work out the solution step by
step to math problems and corrects their efforts along the way. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. COREX CARDSCAN EXECUTIVE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Corex CardScan Executive, which retails for $299, plus
$14.95 for shipping and handling, solves the problem of getting
business cards out of your wallet and into your database.
</P>
<P>
   Connected to your personal computer or laptop, it can read a
surprising number of idiosyncratic business cards and gets the
information correct. One new feature in the software allows the
device to go online and update all the changes in area codes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   5. TEC-2000 LAMP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working at home often starts with the search for enough
electrical outlets. One solution is the power strip, and a lot of
crawling under your desk. A more elegant solution is a lamp ($145)
from Ki-tov Lamps of Brooklyn that puts the power strip in its base
along with a data port for modems. Best of all, there is enough
light to see what you are doing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. SIEMENS POCKET READER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Text scanners, like the Pocket Reader from Siemens ($99.95), are
starting to resemble highlighters. Hold the Pocket Reader upright,
roll it over a sentence, then download the data to a Windows or
Macintosh computer. A screen lets you check on the captured text. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. CREATIVE LABS VIDEO BLASTER WEBCAM GO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Video Blaster Webcam Go is a standout among a slew of relatively
inexpensive video cameras made to work through a PC. The Webcam Go,
a $150 device made by Creative Labs, does just that _ it goes,
breaking away from its PC base. It can snap still pictures and
capture snippets of video. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. VTECH E-MAIL POSTBOX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   E-mail-only devices offer low-cost text e-mail access without a
PC _ no Web surfing, no graphics, no attachments. The e-mail
PostBox from Vtech plugs into a standard phone jack and offers easy
use, large letters on a clear screen, a full-size keyboard and
compact design. The device is $99.99 and can be ordered only
through the Web site (www.vtechworld.com) or by calling (888)
468-8324; an e-mail account costs around $8 a month. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Road &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. COMPAQ ARMADA M300 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq Armada M300 takes a lot of the compromise out of
choosing a laptop. At about $1,899, it manages to deliver a compact
system with a nearly full-size keyboard and a decent-size screen.
Even with a portable docking station, it weighs only about four
pounds. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. LODIS EXEC-ON-THE-GO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting a computer off your shoulder calls for a case on wheels.
The Lodis Exec-On-The-Go models, which range in price from $275 to
$400, bring style and elegance to the pedestrian computer roller
bag. The all-leather bag does not look like a computer bag; it
looks like what it is, a fine piece of luggage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. SHARP TELMAIL TM-20 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using the Pocketmail system, the Sharp Telmail TM-20 allows you
to send and receive e-mail without modems, cables or antennas: just
hold a Pocketmail device up to any phone (home, office, cordless,
pay phones, analog cellular) and the messages are sent and received
through barely audible transmission signals. The lightweight
Telmail also acts as an electronic organizer that connects to your
PC. The price ranges from $99 to $120, and a Pocketmail account
(through www.pocketmail.com) costs $9.95 a month for unlimited
access through a toll-free number. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. ELECTROFUEL POWERPAD 160 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many business travelers, Captain Kirk was always begging
for more power. The PowerPad 160 from Electrofuel ($499), which
sits flat under the laptop, will power a computer for as long as 16
hours. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. OLYMPUS DS-150 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breaking memory limits on early digital recorders, the Olympus
DS-150 ($199) can hold up to 2 hours and 40 minutes of dictation or
chat, then can easily download the captured words to any PC with a
USB connection. The DS-150 comes packaged with an older version of
IBM's Via Voice software for automatic, although not flawless,
transcription. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. KESTREL 2000 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web may offer seemingly infinite weather data, but it is not
much good when you are in the middle of nowhere. The $119 Kestrel
2000 (www.kestrelinstruments.com) is effectively a pocket-size
weather station that indicates temperature, wind speed and wind
chill. For an extra $40, the Kestrel 3000 also measures relative
humidity and calculates both the dew point and heat index, the warm
weather version of the wind chill factor. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. GARMIN EMAP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garmin's eMap wants to be the iMac of GPS receivers
(www.garmin.com/eMap.html). Colored a stylish purple-blue and not
much larger than a calculator, the $242.84 unit is more a handheld
map than an electronic compass and includes a base highway map of
North and South America that among other things shows the service
centers coming up. The $300 deluxe version has a computer
connecting cable and additional memory that lets its users download
detailed city maps of major cities from CD-ROMs.

THE ROAD TO THE FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: Joe Drape chooses 16 teams with the weapons and the nerve
to make a run at the Final Four, which will be held at the RCA Dome
in Indianapolis, Ind.) 
(jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; LAST TEAM STANDING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (22-9)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they were the Baby Bruins _ as high spirited and
impetuous off the court as they were talented on it. Now, they are
a year older and boast the most talented 10-man rotation in the
nation. Nine of them started last year because Coach Steve Lavin's
``This-ain't-no-country club'' credo meant playing time was earned
in practice and awarded game-to-game. You want addition by
subtraction? Baron Davis was the NBA's third pick.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Earl Watson takes over for him at point guard, and the
Bruins may be better off for it. Last year, Watson proved he had a
better head than the gifted Davis. He played the most minutes,
scored 13.3 points a game, handed out 4.5 assists, and was UCLA's
best defender as a shooting guard. The Bruins are big: 6-10
sophomores Dan Gadzuric (8.6 points) and Jerome Moiso (10.8) have
moves to go with bulk. They are athletic: sophomores JaRon Rush
(7.3 rebounds) and Ray Young (5.4 points) key a frenetic fast
breaking offense. Freshman Jason Kapono is a 6-7, 3-point shooter.
Leading them to a championship will be Watson, fittingly, a player
John Wooden would have loved to coach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANOTHER THREE FOR INDY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT (34-2)
</P>
<P>
   Can Khalid El-Amin replace Richard Hamilton as the Huskies'
go-to guy, as well as provide the defensive grit of departed Ricky
Moore? No, as UConn found in its opening loss to a less talented
but more committed Iowa squad. He is special college player, but
not superhuman. The trick for the Huskies is becoming even more of
a T-E-A-M than last year's superb edition. Forward Kevin Freeman,
center Jake Voskuhl and guard Albert Mouring were vital role
players on one of the most balanced and unselfish bunches in
college basketball history. Those three need to do more and El-Amin
less if the Huskies are to repeat. The point guard will get his
points and steals, but he's most effective setting up others. The
Huskies' smothering defense will hold the line until someone
develops into a scorer.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPLE (24-11)
</P>
<P>
   Every year the combination of a disciplined offense and a
nettlesome zone defense earns praise for Coach John Chaney at
tournament time. Nobody wants to face the Owls. This time around
the focus will be on Temple's big-time talent. Mark Karcher (13.4
points) has lost 30-pounds and can score as much as Chaney will let
him. Lamont Barnes, 6-10 (12.9 points), and Kevin Lyde, 6-9, are
impenetrable in the blocks. Senior Pepe Sanchez (5.9 assists)
directs, if you can believe it, an explosive Temple team.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA (24-10)
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Guthridge has won the most games ever for a
second-year coach - 58 - but has been under relentless criticism
from the Carolina for essentially not being Dean Smith. The coach
fires back this season with senior Ed Cota directing an up-tempo
attack that was absent last year. Sophomore Jason Capel (9.1
points) is pain free after off-season back surgery, and 7-foot,
265-pound center Brendan Haywood promises to be a more fearsome
presence after a confidence building campaign with the USA's gold
medal-winning World University Games over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOUR KNOCKING ON THE DOOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN (29-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers return four starters, including Southeastern
Conference player of the year Chris Porter, from the team that went
to the round of 16 last year. They will terrorize the South with a
swarming baseline-to-baseline attack. Porter, a 6-7 senior who
averaged 16 points and 8.8 rebounds, owns the inside. He also has
plenty of help from the SEC's best center, 7-0 Mamadou N'diaye, who
blocked 77 shots last year. And point guard Doc Robinson (11.5 and
5.0 assists) runs a deep, balanced offense.
</P>
<P>
   SYRACUSE (21-12)
</P>
<P>
   The Orangeman have all five starters back from a team that was
alternately dazzling and disastrous last year. Center Etan Thomas
was lithe enough with his 6-9, 247-pound frame to block 4 shots a
game and be named Big East defensive player of the year. Jason Hart
(13.9 points, 4.3 assists) is an all-America-caliber point guard.
Ryan Blackwell (11.7) and Damone Brown (9.5) can score. No doubt
they are talented, but now must find a steady heart.
</P>
<P>
   DePAUL (18-13)
</P>
<P>
   Three sophomores figure to return the Blue Demons to the
national stage, including last year's national freshman of the
year, Quentin Richardson. The 6-7 forward is another Mark
Aguirre-type _ an inside-outside player who averaged 19 points and
10 rebounds a game. Bobby Simmons, 6-7, gives them more punch in
the paint, after averaging 11.2 points last season. Finally, 6-9
Lance Williams, the team's second-leading scorer last year at 13.9,
will roam between the wing and center. That's because 7-0 freshman
Steven Hunter is that good. Don't be surprised when they get this
far.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH (28-5)
</P>
<P>
   Hanno Mottola is back; Andre Miller is not. Still, the Utes
remain the-second best team in the West. Mottola, the 6-10 Finnish
center (15.3 points), and 6-7 forward Alex Jensen (12.1 points, 7.6
rebounds, 3.4 assists) are tough-minded finesse players. And Rick
Majerus is one of the most adaptable coaches around. He'll move the
attack inside. Utah will be precise and disciplined. More talented
opponents will beat themselves. The Utes will get themselves deep
into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EIGHT THAT COULD HANG AROUND LATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OHIO STATE (27-9)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Redd (19.5) and Scoonie Penn (16.9) are the nation's
best backcourt and are intent on returning the Buckeyes to the
Final Four. But it is Kevin Johnson who holds Ohio State's keys to
Indianapolis. The 6-11 senior center managed just 6.4 points and
5.7 rebounds in the regular season before coming alive in the NCAA
tournament with 21 blocked shots. If he begins the year like he
ended it, the Buckeyes contend for the title.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA (22-9)
</P>
<P>
   They're not quite Kentucky, but the Florida Gators have the
thoroughbreds to run Rick Pitino's full-court defense and
bombs-away offense. Skinny sophomore Mike Miller led the Gators in
scoring with 12.2 last year. Sophomore Ted Dupay contributed 11
points, and center Udonis Haslem, undersized at 6-7, pulled down 5
boards a game. He gets help from Donnell Harvery, a 6-8 freshman
who averaged 23.8 in high school and heads another blue chip class
of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN STATE (33-5)
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Mateen Cleaves was all set to return the Spartans to
the Final Four. Then he suffered a stress fracture in his right
foot when practice started last month, had surgery, and won't
return until December. Can returning starters Andre Hutson (5.2
rebounds) and Charlie Bell (7.8 points) - along with last year's
super sub, Morris Peterson (13.6 points), hold Michigan State
together in the meantime? Will Cleaves be able to pick up where he
left off. Whatever, it's a tough way to start.
</P>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S (28-9)
</P>
<P>
   No team in the nation lost as much as the Red Storm did when Ron
Artest decided to turn pro. But St. John's still has sophomore
point guard Erick Barkley (4.7 assists), shooter Bootsy Thornton
(14.9 points) and slasher Lavor Postell (13.1). If Anthony Glover
lives up to his high school promise after sitting out as a
non-academic qualifier, the Red Storm can surprise again.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (27-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats are Autumn's perennial darlings who never quite
bloom in the spring _ they've lost in the second round in the last
three tournaments. The muscle inside returns with 6-9 Kenyon Martin
(2.4 blocked shots) and 6-6 Pete Mickeal (14.9 points) and the
perimeter game should get a boost from freshman Dermarr Johnson - a
6-9 shooter who thought about going pro after averaging 26.9 points
in high school. Maybe this year, the Bearcats live up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY (28-9)
</P>
<P>
   If Jamaal Magloire keeps his head better than he did when he
first entered and then withdrew from the NBA draft, the Wildcats
may be dangerous come tournament time. The 6-10 center (66 block
shots) and point guard Saul Smith (Coach Tubby Smith's son) have to
provide the experience for a team that replaces three starters with
very young talent. Among them is the sophomore Tayshaun Prince, who
added 30 pounds to his 6-9 frame, and looks like a better- shooting
Jamal Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE (37-2)
</P>
<P>
   Last year's runner-up for the national title has devolved from a
team for the ages to one that needs aging. Gone early to the NBA
are Elton Brand, Corey Maggette and William Avery. But Coach Mike
Krzyzewski has four new McDonald's all Americans to replace them.
Jason Williams is the first true freshman to start at point guard
for Duke since Bobby Hurley. Carlos Boozer, a 6-9, 260-pounder from
Alaska, bangs inside like Brand. Mike Dunleavy Jr., whose father is
the Portland Trailblazers coach, is a pure shooter. Returning
starters Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier will help develop the
youngsters in a hurry. They lost twice in last week's Coaches
Against Cancer tournament, but will be rounding into form
tournament time.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA (22-7)
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats replace Jason Terry with 5-10 freshman and 22.6
points a game high school scorer Jason Gardner so Arizona's
tradition of back court excellence continues - Damon Stoudamire,
Mike Bibby. The story here is up front: 6-7 sophomores Richard
Jefferson and Michael Wright combined for 25 points a game last
year. They might double that this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FIVE WHO WILL DOMINATE THEIR POSITONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Point guard:
</P>
<P>
   Matt Santangelo, Gonzaga, 6-1 senior.
</P>
<P>
   He out Stocktons the Bulldogs' forerunner and future NBA Hall of
Famer John Stockton. He averaged 12 points, five assists and made
35 percent of his three-pointers. As the nation learned when
Gonzaga made it to the Final Eight, a two-handed chest pass can be
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard:
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Guyton, Indiana, 6-1, senior
</P>
<P>
   He is a Hoosier's Hoosier who apparently doesn't mind Bobby
Knight as he would have been a first round draft choice in each of
the last two drafts. He averaged 16 points last year on 45 percent
shooting by weaving in an out of a maze of screens. Great range and
can take it down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Center
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mihm, Texas, 7-0, junior
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he showed Tim Duncan-type footwork and soft hands to
average 13.7 points and 11 rebounds. Over the summer, he worked on
his face the basket moves and three point shooting. Biggest knock
is that he doesn't play hard every game. An all out effort will
make him the best college center since, well, Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Power Forward
</P>
<P>
   Mark Madsen, Stanford, 6-9, senior
</P>
<P>
   He's never far from the ball _ when it bounces into the stands
he dives face first to get it. Last year, he put up 13.1 points,
grabbed 9.1 rebounds and shot 60 percent. Most impressive? 109
offensive boards. A more talented Charles Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   Small Forward
</P>
<P>
   Terence Morris, Maryland, 6-9, junior
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was overshadowed by Steve Francis _ except
statistically. His 15.3 points and 7.1 rebounds is just a hint of
what he can do. Morris was the only player in the premier Atlantic
Coast Conference to finish in the top ten in field goal and free
throw percentage, blocked shots, steals, rebounding and scoring. He
quite possibly is the best all round player in the nation.

JOURNALIST SINGS PRAISES OF BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SUSAN L. RIFE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The instant and personal communication between an author and a
reader is what appeals to Robert MacNeil about books.
</P>
<P>
   ``In picking up a book, I don't feel condescended to, I don't
feel patronized, I don't feel exploited, I don't feel my
intelligence is being insulted,'' MacNeil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something very personal that comes from reading that
you don't even get from watching TV. The nearest analogy is the
radio _ you feel you are being spoken to personally. With
broadcasting I feel I'm part of an audience, that I'm a piece of an
audience, often a piece of, as Pauline Kael said, `that jerk
audience.'''
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil, of course, was for nearly 40 years on the other side of
the screen from the broadcast audience, first as an ``NBC News''
correspondent, then as a reporter for the BBC, and then for 20
years as partners with Jim Lehrer on public television's
``MacNeil/Lehrer Report,'' later called ``The MacNeil/Lehrer
NewsHour.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired four years ago to devote much of his time to writing,
although he still works with MacNeil/Lehrer Productions on
documentary projects.
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil's recently published novel, ``Breaking News,'' draws on
his 40 years of journalism for a look at television news, which, to
judge from the novel, is in a sorry state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the problem: There's been a huge cultural shift away
from early evening news,'' MacNeil said in a telephone interview
from his New York City home.
</P>
<P>
   Because viewership of networks' early evening news programs has
dropped, there is a vacuum of national news programs late in the
evening. Fragmentation of the audience through cable television has
forced network television news shows to ``look over their shoulder
all the time at what cable might be doing to suck viewers out of
their orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil's response of late has been to work with MacNeil/Lehrer
Productions to develop an 11 p.m. nightly news program ``that would
be an alternative to local news.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite his continuing involvement with the broadcast world,
MacNeil, 68, prefers the written word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started off at the beginning of this life wanting to be a
creative writer,'' he said, adding that after more than 40 years of
journalism he realized ``I want to go back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I'd just done it long enough and I longed for days
when I wasn't forced to every morning fill my head up with that
stuff. You have to be up-to-date. Now I can read it in the
newspaper, or not, as I choose. To have command of your own
attention is a wonderful gift, to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside of MacNeil's retirement is what he calls
``deinstitutionalization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The routines of television, especially if you do daily
television _ it institutionalizes you in many ways. And then you
also have enormous assistance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a recent trip to Germany for work on a
documentary about the 10-year anniversary of the fall of the Berlin
Wall, he told his guide he would send a copy of a book he had
written about the building of the wall. Sending the book meant
spending half a day finding a copy, wrapping it for mailing,
filling out customs forms and waiting in line at the post office _
all tasks an assistant would have handled in the ``MacNeil/Lehrer''
days.
</P>
<P>
   Mundane tasks aside, MacNeil loves the writing life and
advocates the reading life to people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``A book is a product of a single mind, usually, and that
creates a different kind of communication from what is created by
many people,'' he said. ``What a reader is getting in 250 pages of
a book is the distilled creative energy of one person over hundreds
and hundreds of hours. You are getting intimately the product of a
human brain, which may be one of the best brains that's ever walked
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider that you pay $25 for a hardcover book, and
you're getting the gift of one person's intellectual energy over
hundreds and hundreds of hours, that's a tremendous gift to pass on
to somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Books, once people are hooked on them, ``have an appeal that is
unlike anything else,'' MacNeil said. ``A book, in a way, is a
conversation highly organized and, one hopes, beautifully presented
_ a conversation for hours at a time with the most interesting
person you could possibly meet at that time, and alone with you.''

UP A RIVER, BEGGING FOR PAINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATSKILL, N.Y. _ The limestone tablet was lying face down, a
mere doorstop in the dusty remains of Thomas Cole's studio here. On
a late-summer afternoon, an architectural historian visiting the
cobwebby old studio in back of the house picked it up and turned it
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished to find a drawing on it,'' said the
historian, Barksdale Maynard, who is researching the life of Cole,
the father of the Hudson River School of landscape painting. The
drawing he discovered was in fact a romantic pencil sketch of a
castle, done by Cole on a lithographic stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cole died in the 1840s,'' he said. ``It's astounding that this
artwork would be just kicking around for 150 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The sketch is only moderately valuable _ the image is not fully
realized _ but it is ``very significant, very important and still
rather mysterious'' as it relates to the undocumented history of
the house and studio, Maynard said.
</P>
<P>
   While the stone is now safe with one of the house's trustees,
Maynard fears for the Cole house itself. Although it has received a
financial boost from the state and a fund-raising campaign, the
project needs more than $3.5 million of an estimated $4 million to
restore the house and grounds and establish a museum there.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the Cole house is not grand or full
of priceless antiques; in fact, it is viewed by some as kind of a
poor relation of Olana, the Moorish mansion just across the river,
conceived and built by Cole's student Frederic Edwin Church,
another master of the school.
</P>
<P>
   But the restoration of the Cole house, known as Cedar Grove, is
not about aesthetics. Its backers do not want it to be just another
house museum, treasured only for its celebrity associations and its
pretty window swags. They see it as a significant cultural and
historical link to one of the nation's most important artistic
movements. ``Without Cole's role as the first to rhapsodize about
the Hudson River and the wilderness in general, in his paintings
and in his teachings, the story is vastly diminished,'' said
Darlene Lee Downing, executive director of the Catskill Center for
Conservation and Development.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the house is closed to the public and is probably
past what might be called the ``fixer upper'' stage. In fact, it
may have reached the next stage: wreck. The porch is sagging; the
plaster walls are cracked; an old wooden shutter bangs open and
shut, knocking against the brick facade of the 1810 building, a
yellow federal villa.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, Cole descendants who were still living there
offered to sell it to the state for $125,000, with its furnishings
_ including what would now be valuable Cole paintings. But the
state refused.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was not as ridiculous as it sounds today. The
Hudson River painters were then out of vogue. Take the famous Cole
landscape ``The Oxbow,'' at the Metropolitan Museum. Worth more
than $5 million now, it probably would have fetched less than
$250,000 at the time, several dealers and curators say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the paintings and furniture _ originals, in many cases _
were eventually piled up on the lawn and sold off in 1979, when the
descendants moved to Florida. The house was then bought by the
Catskill Center, which promptly arranged for an easement to protect
the buildings and the land and then sold the property to the Thomas
Cole Foundation, whose principals included the Manhattan gallery
owner Ira Spanierman, a specialist in Cole and other Hudson River
artists. (This week, Spanierman called the house ``the spiritual
birthplace of American landscape painting.'') But the foundation
let the house languish. In 1998, it agreed to sell it for $92,500
to the Greene County Historical Society, which appointed a
committee to oversee the restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been watching this house disintegrate for 20 years,'' Ms.
Downing said. Looking at the two front parlors, with their marble
fireplaces and high ceilings, she said she hoped that at least
those two rooms would be open to the public by summer, with some
historical material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a little money,'' she said, ``and we'll see what
color is appropriate to the period.'' Furnishing the rooms is
tricky, she said, because so little of the furniture is original.
(A roomful of late Victorian carved rosewood, upholstered in pink,
is hardly consistent with the 1810 house or with the tenure of
Cole, who died in 1848.)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bernadette Castro, the state commissioner of parks,
recreation and historic preservation, said the state had recently
turned down another chance to buy the Cole house, because the
restoration would cost so much. Her agency is overwhelmed with the
ambitious restoration of Olana, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she was excited about the Cole house, especially
when she thought of the two houses as part of an assemblage of
artists' homes. ``Although we won't own both of them, we look
towards a link through some kind of interpretation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that her office had just given $192,500 to the Cole
project, money that was more than matched by private contributions.
But the state and private contributions come to less than $500,000,
and the state money, Ms. Castro said, can be used only for exterior
work.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the money for the interior come from? Can the Friends
of Olana help the friends of the Cole house?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they're supportive of our efforts,'' said Raymond
Beecher, a retired schoolteacher who is the Greene County historian
and a vital force behind the efforts to restore the Cole house.
Beecher, 82, contributed $130,000 of the private matching funds,
although, as he put it, he is ``not a millionaire.'' The Olana
supporters, he explained, are ``busy raising their own money.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Friends of Olana is trying to raise $20 million for its
own house, the grounds and the collections, said Sara Griffen, the
executive director. And although the idea of an ``artists' trail''
that would include the Cole house has come up, ``other priorities
have taken over,'' she said. Asked if her group might help raise
money for the Cole house, Ms. Griffen said it was ``outside the
purview of our mission statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs at Cedar Grove, the front room where Cole painted in
the winter, and where he died, needs only some paint and plaster.
And this fall, the house received a new furnace. Thanks to the
state grant and the matching donations, it will probably also
receive a new roof.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``it's still very far away from being saved,''
Maynard said.

GAMES TO SUIT EVERY PLATFORM AND EVERY TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is one in a series of articles on online shopping) 
(th) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Industry sources on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley have
informed me that Santa has signed co-branded content and e-commerce
agreements with Sony, Nintendo and Sega, promising to drive traffic
in return for sales commissions and (most important) stock options.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt this is a smart strategic arrangement for all
concerned, considering the volume of video-game requests to Santa's
headquarters and the difficulty of keeping track of every hardware
manufacturer and software publisher. (At the North Pole, as
everywhere, good database administrators are in short supply.)
</P>
<P>
   Santa has assured analysts that wish-list processing and
Christmas Eve delivery will meet or exceed traditional standards of
quality and reliability. But which gifts light up the television or
computer screen this holiday season, that's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   With three video-game consoles on the market (and hundreds of
millions of dollars being spent to promote them), the burning
question is which system to buy, especially because that decision
also commits you to a particular library of software titles.
Despite the surfeit of choices, each console has clear strengths
and drawbacks, depending on who you are (or for whom you are
buying).
</P>
<P>
   NINTENDO _ If you're buying for a young child, Nintendo is
probably the best bet. At $99, Nintendo 64 costs three times as
much as a Furby, but it will take much longer to wear out.
Nintendo's software is also skewed to a young audience (under 10
years old) and tends to be less violent than Sega or Sony fare.
There are fewer titles available for Nintendo than for Playstation,
but for parents that is a definite advantage _ there's less to beg
for. And the titles out there make up in quality what they lack in
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   The 900-pound gorilla of Nintendo's Christmas season is Donkey
Kong 64 (published by Nintendo, $69.95, for all ages). Like Mario
and Zelda, Donkey Kong has made the leap to 3-D, and the results
are spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mario and Zelda, Super Smash Brothers (published by
Nintendo, $49.99, for all ages) features them and other members of
the old-school Nintendo posse in a combat free-for-all, in case
you're in the market for a fighting game.
</P>
<P>
   In the racing category, F-Zero X (published by Nintendo, $29.99,
for all ages) is superb _ although 1080 Snowboarding (published by
Nintendo, $39.99, for all ages) has an edge among extreme-sports
fans. For its innovative play and controls, Glover (published by
Hasbro Interactive, $59.95, for all ages) is a personal favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Lest one forget the Pokemon phenomenon, there is the Nintendo 64
cartridge called Pokemon Snap, in which the player scours a
tropical island on a photographic expedition to document the
creatures. And, of course, there is the original Game Boy
capturing-and-collecting cartridge, which now comes in three
flavors: red, blue and yellow. Different-colored cartridges feature
the same game but contain a different menagerie of creatures. The
idea is that you link your Game Boy with one that has a different
cartridge and exchange Pokemon until everyone has a complete
collection.
</P>
<P>
   If your child argues that he or she needs more than one Pokemon
cartridge to complete a collection, feel free to point out that
players are meant to acquire Pokemon by trading with other people
and that just buying another cartridge is a lazy shortcut and might
even be considered cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Another Nintendo toy to consider is the Game Boy Camera ($59),
which allows the schoolyard set to take thumbnail-size pictures and
add custom effects, then trade the images or turn them into
stickers on a miniature printer, which is sold separately. The
resolution is low, but pixel for pixel, the Game Boy Camera is more
fun than digital cameras with 10 times the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   SONY _ The price of the Playstation has also dropped to $99; it
delivers tremendous video-game bang for the entertainment buck, and
it's probably the best bet for gamers 12 and older. There are
thousands of games in the Playstation library, and the greatest
hits can be had for $19.99 apiece after their initial flush of
popularity has worn off.
</P>
<P>
   With Sony's next-generation console on the horizon, the
Playstation will be singing its swan song this holiday season. But
the Playstation 2 will be backward-compatible _ all the old games
will work on the new system, including this season's hottest games.
The original format is expected to play well into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For role-playing fans, there is Final Fantasy 8 (published by
Squaresoft, $49.99, for teen-agers), the latest sprawling epic in
the best-selling series by Squaresoft. Final Fantasy 8 is a big
commitment, falling somewhere between ``The Lord of the Rings'' and
``The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' in terms of the time
required to play. But for fans of the genre, it's a no-brainer.
This game is The One.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your aesthetic sensibilities, there are two racing
games worth playing. Wipeout 3 (published by Psygnosis, $39.99, for
all ages) is a rave-inspired future fantasy with a techno
soundtrack. It's a deep-dish slice of graphic design and club
culture, a sly piece of eye candy for the fashion-conscious gamer.
</P>
<P>
   Gran Turismo 2 (published by Sony, $40, for all ages) is less
trendy and more muscular, a spectacularly meaty showcase of
real-world cars, high-performance engines and screeching tires.
Playing Gran Turismo is the automotive equivalent of air guitar.
</P>
<P>
   On the fighting front, there are two ways to go. For spectacle,
Tekken 3 (published by Namco, $27.99, for teen-agers) rules the
Playstation. But for hands-on play and sheer coolness, Fighter
Maker is the champ. Fighter Maker (published by Agetec, $42.99, for
teen-agers) lets you choreograph a fighter from templates or from
scratch, fine-tuning everything from upper cuts to victory taunts.
Tweaking wire-frame models teaches you a lot about computer
animation _ Fighter Maker is more a design exercise than a martial
arts contest. It's more fun to make your own.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to creature breeding and training, Monster Rancher
for Playstation (published by Tecmo, $39.99, for all ages) is among
the quirkiest titles on any platform. The game uses regular music
CDs to ``spawn'' baby monsters. (Playstation reads the audio disc's
number and track lengths and converts that data into monster DNA.)
</P>
<P>
   Once your creature is born, you are responsible for feeding and
training it into a fierce fighting beast to pit against other
monsters in single combat. Monster Rancher is a virtual pet with
teeth, ensuring its appeal to both boys and girls. And for
audiophiles, nothing is more satisfying than seeing what your music
library looks like as a digital zoo.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for an addictive puzzle game, buy Devil Dice
(published by THQ, $39.95, for all ages). It's better than Tetris.
Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SEGA _ If you have to be the first kid on your block to own the
coolest game machine, you'll be celebrating the millennium with
Dreamcast (if you haven't got one already). The Dreamcast is this
year's cutting-edge box, although its processing speed and graphic
capacities will be superseded by next year's Playstation 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sega's top game, bar none, is NFL 2K (published by Sega, $49.95,
all ages), which is the best-looking football game ever. Similarly,
Soul Calibur (published by Namco, $39.99, for teen-agers) is the
best-looking fighting game ever. Many of the other new Dreamcast
titles are arcade conversions, so a trip to the local coin-op
emporium should give you a pretty good test drive.
</P>
<P>
   For something completely different (and geared to younger
children), Pen Pen Tri-Icelon (published by Infogrames, $39.99, for
all ages), a penguin racing game from Japan, is worth picking up.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER GAMES _ For graphics quality, the computer is still
king, especially when it's equipped with a graphics accelerator
card. As usual, there is a slew of CD-ROMs for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Half-Life (published by Sierra, $49.95, ages 17 and up) is the
benchmark action shooter, although Unreal Tournament (published by
GT Interactive, $39.99, ages 17 and up) provides an excellent
death-match experience for people too shy to venture onto the
Internet. (The CD-ROM functions as training wheels for multiplayer
action; think of it as Deathmatch for Dummies.)
</P>
<P>
   Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit (published by Electronic Arts,
$19.99, for all ages) is the hottest racer. Homeworld (published by
Sierra, $39.99, for all ages) and Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun
(published by Virgin, $47.99, for teen-agers) are top picks for
sci-fi strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, Sid Meier's Gettysburg (published by
Electronic Arts, $19.99, for children or adults), Railroad Tycoon 2
(published by Gathering of Developers, $39.95, for all ages) and
Microsoft's Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings (published by
Microsoft, $54.95, for teen-agers) allow you to replay the Civil
War, the robber baron era or the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy adventure fans can revel in Drakan (published by
Psygnosis, $37.99, 17 and up), a gorgeously rendered story world
featuring a leggy female dragon rider. (Move over, Lara Croft.)
SimCity 3000 (published by Electronic Arts, $49.95, for all ages)
beckons armchair urban planners to construct their own metropolis,
while Creatures 3 (published by Mindscape Entertainment, $39.99,
for all ages) serves up a digital terrarium to breed new forms of
artificial life.
</P>
<P>
   For children of all ages, Midnight Play (published by Simon &AMP;
Schuster Interactive, $15) is a beautifully crafted story book. And
for sheer nostalgia, there's Pong: The Next Level (published by
Hasbro Interactive, $19.95) _ bell-bottoms are optional.

   What follows are (possibly) real quotes lifted (probably

from around our (or somebody else's) country and posted (possibly
by means of witchcraft) on the Internet (whatever that is):
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of `I give' is `I take.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Verb conjugations have never been my strong suit, but this
sounds right. Of course, it's possible that the subject was not
English grammar but economics, in which case the answer is
definitely right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parts of speech are lungs and air.''

<P>
   I think this student is forgetting the diaphragm, the lips and
the tongue. Unless the person is a politician, in which case you

   ``Water is composed of two gins Oxygin and hydrogin. Oxigin is

   This kid is destined to be either a chemistry major or a

   Define H2O and CO2: ``H2O is hot water and CO2 is cold water.''

   Mix them together and you get El Nino. Or a gimlet. Or

   ``A virgin forest is a forest where the hand of man has never

</P>
<P>
   This seems like an awkward way to walk through a forest, virgin
or otherwise, but if that's what it takes to save our trees, then I
guess I'm all for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general direction of the Alps is straight up.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you happen to be standing on top of the Alps, in which
case the general direction is straight down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who followed the Lord were called the 12
opossums.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a terrible confession: I ran over one of the Lord's
opossums while driving home from work the other night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spinal column is a long bunch of bones. The head sits on
the top and you sit on the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds dreadfully uncomfortable. Couldn't I at least have a
pillow?
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not raise silk worms in the United States, because we
get our silk from rayon. He is a longer worm and gives more silk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like ol' Rayon is one busy worm. After a hard day of
spinning silk for the entire USA, I bet he pours himself a stiff
oxygin/hydrogin cocktail _ shaken, not stirred.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scout obeys all to whom obedience is due and respects all
duly constipated authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be tricky. Should scouts demand to see an empty box
of Ex-Lax from the authority in question before they obey? What
about authorities that are just constipated part of the time? It
seems like a secret handshake, or something, would make a lot more
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``One by-product of raising cattle is calves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other by-products include oxygin and hydrogin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver Cromwell had a large red nose, but under it were deeply
religious feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if he had been born earlier, he might well have been
one of the 12 opossums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word trousers is an uncommon noun because it is singular
at the top and plural at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas T-shirts are plural at the top and singular at the
bottom. This new grammar is easy once you get the hang of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syntax is all the money collected at the church from
sinners.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what we need. Another tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spring, the salmon swim upstream to spoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad trick, considering salmon don't have hands. Presumably
by fall, the more dexterous salmon have advanced to a knife and
fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iron was discovered because someone smelt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps iron is another by-product of raising cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the 18th century, all the morons moved to
Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not true. Some of them didn't arrive until much later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person should take a bath once in the summer, not so often
in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it wasn't iron that someone smelt.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget utility, convenience and productivity. In the wireless
world, style rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you feel the need to match your cell phone with the
clothes you are wearing _ even the color of your lipstick _ you
can. The popular Nokia 5100 and 6100 series cell phones have
removable face plates. On the 5100 you can snap them into place.
The 6100 requires a screwdriver. The interchangeable face plates
are available from Nokia or third-party suppliers, mostly on the
Web. Try www.gost.fi or www.mobileart.com.
</P>
<P>
   At sites like these, you can order a plate bearing your
astrological sign or the flag of your choice. You can even design
your own face plate. While you're at it, swap the generic number
pad for one with big squishy buttons. And last week, Nokia,
together with AT&AMP;T and Disney, began selling face plates featuring
Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Donald.
</P>
<P>
   Sound matters, too: not just quality but musical taste. Digital
phones, of course, come with a variety of options for ringing
tones. Now you can program your phone with a ringing tone of your
own creation. Make a sound file of the Notre Dame fight song, for
example, transfer it to your phone and impress your fellow alumnae.
</P>
<P>
   Other cell phone manufacturers are catching on to the style fad.
Motorola sells interchangeable battery covers with NFL logos for
its new Startac Talkabout phones. The logos are also available on
leather holsters and pager carrying cases. Body Glove, the folks
who brought style to the wet suit crowd, makes neoprene fashion
statements out of shock absorbent, water-resistant cell phone and
beeper covers. It started with the Cell Suit for the Startac. The
coolest by far is the cover that wraps around the Nokia 5100 and
6100 phones, with snap-on flaps that come in various colors.
</P>
<P>
   Headset sales are rising, and headsets designed for mobile
phones are getting a new look, too. Plantronics, the Santa Cruz,
Calif., company known for its high-quality headsets, has introduced
a new line for cell phones with a decidedly younger, trendier
customer in mind. Try a hook-behind-the-ear model, or if you would
like to style yourself after Jodie Foster in ``Contact'' or after
Tom Cruise in ``Jerry Maguire,'' try an over-the-head unit.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of wireless headsets is improving, and they will get
even better as products built with Bluetooth, a technology that
uses radio frequencies, show up on the market over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you're not a total slave to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   SOME WIRELESS PRODUCTS
</P>
<P>
   Here is a selection of phones and pagers that do considerably
more than ring and beep.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Phones
</P>
<P>
   1. QUALCOMM THIN PHONE
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Phone is definitely slim, thanks to interesting battery
innovations, and it weighs a little more than 4 ounces. It has a
four-line screen, which means it is not going to give you much in
the way of Web surfing, but it will give you simple pieces of
information off the Web, like the weather, stock quotes, flight
schedules and sports scores. The cost of the Thin Phone ranges from
$79 to $149, depending on the carrier's subsidy. Networks that use
the phone include Sprint, PrimeCo, Bell Atlantic Mobile, GTE
Wireless and AirTouch Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   2. NOKIA 8860
</P>
<P>
   This is no ersatz Web browser. In fact, it's no Web browser at
all. The Nokia 8860 is pure style. It doesn't offer Internet
access, but this pricey ($799 to $999) chrome, trimode phone, which
switches from analog to digital cellular to PCS networks, is the
high-priced phone of choice for customers on the AT&AMP;T Wireless
network. At just under 4 ounces, it is probably the only digital
phone that could be mistaken for a cigarette lighter, which means
it isn't for anyone with big or clumsy hands. You turn the phone on
and off by opening and closing the sliding cover: no flipping
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   3. NEOPOINT
</P>
<P>
   This little phone with the big screen is still getting a lot of
attention as the first microbrowser-cum-cell phone to seem useful.
The screen is a reasonable size, 11 lines long, with a highly
readable liquid crystal display. The phone uses a special system
for speeding up text entry and also has speech recognition. The
phone comes with a docking station that lets you synchronize
information with your PC and recharge the phone battery at the same
time. The Neopoint, $399 from Sprint PCS, weighs 6.4 ounces. It
also doubles as a wireless modem. The only caveat: carry a bottle
of screen cleaner with you, because the screen is very
smudge-prone.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers
</P>
<P>
   4. MOTOROLA PAGEWRITER 2000X
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola Pagewriter 2000X, a two-way pager billed as a
``wireless communications center,'' looks like a personal digital
assistant, and it is just as functional. You can send and receive
pages and e-mail, call up the weather, buy and sell stocks, buy a
book, bid on Ebay, load up a scheduler, synchronize data with your
PC and play blackjack. The unit starts at about $360, and service
fees vary depending on what you choose. As for the marks against
it: it's expensive, and it's not a cell phone, but at 6.7 ounces
it's still heavier than one.
</P>
<P>
   5. MOTOROLA i1000 PLUS
</P>
<P>
   The $299 middleweight (5.4 ounces) Motorola i1000 Plus phone,
used only on the Nextel and SouthernLinc networks, has a two-way
digital radio that lets you reach other users on your network. Two
of the phone's best features are the see-through flip cover and the
speaker-phone option. The built-in microbrowser gives you access to
the usual suspects _ stock prices, airline information, weather
reports and more. The phone's biggest aesthetic drawback is an
oddball bump protruding from the front of the flip cover.
</P>
<P>
   6. RESEARCH IN MOTION
</P>
<P>
   The new pagers from Research in Motion are a departure from
conventional paging, and a move toward wearable computers. The RIM
850 costs $359, with an additional flat rate of $59.95 per month
for the wireless service from American Mobile or Skytel. The pager
gives you access to a variety of e-mail accounts, as well as Web
access. There is also the $399 RIM Blackberry, which is more like a
handheld organizer. The Blackberry gives you access to e-mail and
the Web and provides flat-rate air time for $39.95 per month.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Buffalo (No. 1) and Indianapolis (2), and a
larger difference between Seattle (5) and St. Louis (6).
</P>
<P>
   (x) The cumulative records and margin of victory of each team's
opponents do not include games against the ranked team.

   EGYPT-CRASH _ CAIRO _ As the probe into what caused the crash of
EgyptAir Flight 990 focuses more on co-pilot Gamil Hamid
el-Batouty, this Islamic nation is responding with incredulous
anger at what people here are calling a knee-jerk reaction based on
Muslim stereotypes. Egyptians here are rallying around Batouty, a
respected pilot who came from a well-known wealthy family, and seem
to be taking the suicide-based conspiracy theories surrounding the
fatal crash personally. That's because suicide is looked upon with
shame in Islam. Meanwhile, Batouty's family continues to believe he
is being used as a scapegoat (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   WACO-INQUEST _ An inquest will be held six years late into the
death of Michael Schroeder, who died on the day of the ATF raid on
Mount Carmel. After the resurgence of interest in the Branch
Davidians, Justice of the Peace David Pareya of West discovered the
oversight while recently looking through documents. Pareya went out
to view the body in 1993 and got information on Schroeder's death,
but FBI officials, despite
</P>
<P>
   repeated requests, never turned over the ballistic
</P>
<P>
   tests done on Schroeder's body. He also could
</P>
<P>
   never get an answer from ATF on who actually shot Schroeder.
Schroeder was shot when he attempted to reenter the compound Sunday

morning raid took place. (England, Waco Tribune-Herald)

   STRIPCLUB-INDICTMENTS _ ATLANTA _ Federal prosecutors have
charged the Gold Club, an Atlanta adult entertainment
establishment, and its owners in a racketeering indictment that
includes prostitution for customers, bribes to Atlanta police
officers and ties to organized crime. The 97-page indictment,
unsealed today, accuses two Atlanta police officers of accepting
bribes, two Delta Air Lines employees of providing illegal favors
to club officials and two dancers of participating in prostitution
with unnamed professional basketball players. (Rankin, Atlanta

Naval Medical Center, where congressmen, the president and other

refusing to carry out an order to allow nurses to administer
anesthesia without physician supervision. Dr. Alvin Manalaysay said
he was told that when VIPs are treated, they will continue to be

will go to sleep under the unsupervised care of nurse anesthetists.

   SCHOOL-CHOICE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Congress have
quietly agreed to a ``school choice'' deal that could enrage
teachers unions, annoy school boards and please many poor parents.
The provision would give parents of children in failing schools
that receive federal Title I anti-poverty aid the right to transfer
their child to any other public or charter school within their
district that had enough room. The agreement adds the provision to
the education spending bill and gives school districts $135 million

FOR PARENTS, A LIBRARY TO THE RESCUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.) (For release Nov. 25)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was predicting a long week with my two children. My husband
was leaving for a business trip to Dallas. The weather was getting
too chilly for much outside play. The kids were growing restless
from short days and long nights.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering early Christmas presents from amazon.com and eToys.com
had depleted my budget, so I couldn't even bribe myself out of the
situation with a movie and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   These are the times I love the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any requests?'' I asked my 8-year-old as I dropped him off at
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something that tells you about `Star Wars.' You know, all the
detail stuff. David knows all these FACTS about `Star Wars,' and I
never know them,'' came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   I thought every 8-year-old had an encyclopedic knowledge of
``Star Wars,'' but apparently someone had trumped Adam, and he was
determined to brush up on his trilogy trivia.
</P>
<P>
   I knew my 3-year-old's requests. She has some favorite library
books and CDs that she firmly believes are hers because we check
them out so often. She'd be disappointed if she ever discovered
they were actually community property.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, I loved any library. There was the one at
my elementary school, with its complete Bobbsey Twins series and a
large selection of horse adventure books with titles like ``Blaze
and the Forest Fire.'' At the public library, I learned about
preteen angst and first love through Judy Blume novels.
</P>
<P>
   Since my children were born, I've been lucky enough to live in
two towns _ Plant City and Mountain Park, Ga. _ with new, fully
stocked libraries. Both are wonderfully designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when I have a serious library trip planned, I go alone. I
am my family's personal librarian.
</P>
<P>
   I always make a few safe selections, popular books I know the
kids will like. But I always take a few chances as well. Adam
really enjoyed ``Sarah Plain and Tall'' and ``Baby,'' both by
Patricia MacLachlan, although I was afraid he might think they were
``girl'' books.'' And ``The Wave'' by Pearl Buck enthralled both of
us for a week at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   This trip was high-stakes. For my own self-preservation, I
needed a good selection in just 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 15 minutes, I had made my choices.
</P>
<P>
   For Sarah: the latest issue of ``Ladybug,'' Disney's ``Under the
Sea'' video, ``Moonbear's Friend'' by Frank Asch, ``We're Going on
a Bear Hunt'' by Michael Rosen, and ``We Were Tired of Living in a
House'' by Liesel Moak Scorpen.
</P>
<P>
   For Adam: ``The Ghost in Tent 19,'' Disney's original ``Treasure
Island'' video, the ``Making of the Phantom Menace'' and the ``Star
Wars Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right!'' Adam crowed, as I handed him the stack of ``Star
Wars'' research material and he disappeared into the basement.
</P>
<P>
   I even found a few books for Jim to read on the plane: ``The
Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess'' and James Brady's ``The House
that Ate the Hamptons.''
</P>
<P>
   That should keep everyone happy for a while. Maybe even happy
enough that I can get a good start on my thick library copy of
Wally Lamb's ``I Know This Much is True.''

with the advent of households with two or more computers,

   CAR-MARTIN _ ATLANTA _ It has been another disappointing top-5
finish for Mark Martin. Martin, who battled Jeff Gordon start to
finish in 1998, finally got Gordon out of the way long enough for
Dale Jarrett to step in. Seems like Martin never will get his
points title, but there are more concerns on the horizon.

   CAR-MARTIN _ ATLANTA _ It has been another disappointing top-5
finish for Mark Martin. Martin, who battled Jeff Gordon start to
finish in 1998, finally got Gordon out of the way long enough for
Dale Jarrett to step in. Seems like Martin never will get his
points title, but there are more concerns on the horizon.
Immediately after the Atlanta race, he will undergo back surgery
that could take him out of racing. (Carvell, Atlanta

BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ, 82: HARVARD PROFESSOR, CHINA EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benjamin Schwartz, an expert on China who taught history and
political science at Harvard University for many years, died of
cancer Monday in his home in Cambridge. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   According to Elizabeth Perry, a professor of government at
Harvard, Mr. Schwartz had an ``enormous impact'' on the field of
Chinese studies because he was ``equally at home in ancient and
contemporary history.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he was one of the first scholars to demonstrate that
Chinese communism was not simply a carbon copy of Soviet communism,
but had its own historical roots and contemporary practices.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schwartz was born in Boston. He graduated from Harvard in
1934, earned a master's degree at the school in 1941 and a
doctorate in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He was a secondary school teacher before serving in the Army
during World War II. He first served as as a cryptoanalyst on
breaking Japanese communications codes, then as a censor during the
occupation of the defeated country.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his time in Japan that he became fascinated with
what he called the ``mysterious Orient'' in the 25th anniversary
report of his class at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he returned to Harvard, where he earned his
doctorate in East Asia studies.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Harvard faculty in 1950, and remained at the
school until his retirement in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The author of several books including ``Chinese Communism and
the Rise of Mao,'' and ``The World of Thought in Ancient China,''
he was an adviser to US governmental agencies and testified before
congressional panels several times.
</P>
<P>
   In the 50th anniversary report of his class at Harvard, he wrote
that ``past experience of mankind (both its wisdom and folly)
remains of burning relevance to our present concerns'' and added
that his work ``provided an exciting opportunity for a Westerner to
explore the cultural-historical experience of a non-Western
civilization from a comparative point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Bernice; a son, Jonathan; a daughter,
Sara-Ann Erichson; and four grandchildren.

CONSUMER GROUPS ASK FEDS FOR STRONGER ALCOHOL LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 100 health groups urged the federal
government Wednesday to require that warning labels on
alcoholic-beverage containers be clear and conspicuous and that
they appear on the front of the can or bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cursory review of bottles and cans of beer, wine and liquor
reveals that too many warning label messages are carefully designed
to go unnoticed and ignored,'' said George Hacker, director of the
alcohol policies project at the Center for Science and the Public
Interest.
</P>
<P>
   The CSPI and the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence, which are both advocacy groups, are spearheading a
campaign to persuade the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to
require more forceful warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Hacker showed labels with a clear
background and type that blended into the color of the alcohol in
the bottle, making them difficult to read. In some cases warning
labels were printed vertically on the side of the bottle or on the
small label that is wrapped around the neck of many alcohol
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago a coalition similar to the current 121-member
group, which includes the American Medical Association and Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, successfully petitioned the government to
mandate that warning labels be applied to every bottle or can of
beer, wine and liquor sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The warning label reads: ``GOVERNMENT WARNING:(1) According to
the surgeon general, women should not drink alcoholic beverages
during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.(2)
Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a
car or operate machinery and may cause health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Current regulations also require that the label be ``readily
legible'' and ``located in a conspicuous and prominent place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacker noted that many alcoholic-beverage manufacturers do place
legible labels on their products, but he said federal standards
need to be strengthened to require that all such beverage makers
display their labels in a standard manner.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's petition that went to the BATF Wednesday asks
the agency to require that labels:
</P>
<P>
   _Be printed in black or red type on a white background
surrounded by a lined border.
</P>
<P>
   _Be placed horizontally on the front of the bottle or can.
</P>
<P>
   _Contain a red pictorial device, such as a triangle with an
exclamation point in the middle, to draw attention to the notice.
</P>
<P>
   _Use the words ``government warning'' in type that is 15 percent
larger than the rest of the words in the notice.
</P>
<P>
   _Be printed in upper and lower case, making it easier to read
than the all upper-case labels that many manufacturers use.
</P>
<P>
   The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which
represents liquor producers, said the proposed changes are
``unnecessary and unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Council President Peter H. Casey said the current regulations
allow for a reminder of the health risks of alcohol ``while still
providing the industry the flexibility needed to meet those

<P>
   The approaching Christmas season is a time of celebration, hope
and joy in the birth of the Messiah. But some biblical critics
don't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, they have offered many theories challenging
gospel accounts and the events described in the New Testament. But
now, out of the catacombs of history, comes new information that
will startle skeptics and make the hearts of believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not
Hebrew, that the four gospels were originally written in Greek and
that Mark's gospel was the first of them.
</P>
<P>
   This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew,
an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus' ministry, was
indeed the author of the first gospel and verifies both the
Jewishness and early date of the first gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was
written in Hebrew -- not Greek or Aramaic, as widely thought -- and
was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   In his ground-breaking book, ``A History of Christianity in
Asia,'' Moffett reveals that Pantaenus, a church historian and
missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D., discovered the copy
of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reported,'' wrote Eusebius, a fourth-century bishop and
church historian, ``that among persons there who knew Christ,
(Pantaenus) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew (which had
arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century). For
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached to them and left
them (in India) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which
they had preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shock hidden in that rather matter-of-fact
statement. ... The surprise, of course, is the mention of
Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East,'' Moffett says.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever
going to India, and some even doubt that Thomas himself went.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett ponders, ``What was Bartholomew ... doing in India with
a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew?''
</P>
<P>
   Why India?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish colonies are known to have existed in India from very
early times,'' Moffett writes, ``If there were, as tradition
asserts, Hebrew or Aramaic copies of the Gospel in circulation as
early as that, it is not unreasonable to imagine a Jewish
missionary using one in his evangelistic work, for it was the
apostolic missionary tradition to preach first to the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two historical records -- the New Testament's
Book of Acts and the writings of the Church Fathers -- confirm some
of Moffett's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gospels were so thoroughly Jewish, there was no
concept among Jewish believers of preaching to gentiles. According
to Acts, Jewish believers in Israel were horrified to learn that
Peter entered a gentile home and preached to gentiles. Jews did not
preach to gentiles until the Jewish believers fled from persecution
to the Greek city of Antioch in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   While the Book of Acts lists the 11 apostles -- Judas having
hanged himself -- it doesn't say how they were paired. But what is
known is that Jesus instructed his disciples to work and travel by
twos.
</P>
<P>
   So, it would be natural for Thomas to travel with a companion to
India and for Bartholomew to have taken along a freshly copied text
of Matthew's gospel, especially if it were the first and only
gospel written at the time. Jews customarily took their sacred
texts with them, as we see from the New Testament accounts of
Paul's travels, and it was this Gospel of Matthew that Pantaenus
found a century and a half later in India.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Jews of the early centuries, Pantaenus became a
follower of Jesus. But it is not only Pantaenus' academic
background as philosopher, his founding of the great theological
school in Alexandria and his two renowned disciples, Clement and
Origen, that make him so important here.
</P>
<P>
   As Moffett writes, ``The fact that Pantaenus was ... Jewish ...
explains his particular attention to the Hebrew copy of the Gospel
of Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he returned to Alexandria with the same gospel
adds enormous validity to its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries about Bartholomew going to India, the
existence of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that was probably
written before 50 AD and the same text being returned to the West
add ``another piece of evidence of once again very early dating of
the New Testament,'' said Douglas Cecil, associate professor of
pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we now know where some of the apostles traveled but
also that Hebrew was far from a dead language at the time of
Christ, as many scholars espouse, and it evidently was used by Jews
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In search of what language was used during the time of Christ,
we find some interesting clues. Scholar George Howard, in his book,
``The Gospel of Matthew According to a Primitive Hebrew Text,''
quotes an early second-century writing by Papias (ca. 60-130 CE),
bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, as stating that ``Matthew
collected the oracles in the Hebrew language.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard goes on to say, ``It has become commonplace (for the past
century and a half) to suppose that by 'Hebrew,' Papias meant
'Aramaic.' The subsequent discovery of many ... Hebrew documents
from Palestine from the general time period of Jesus now show
Hebrew to have been alive and well in the first century.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of a ``remarkable Hebrew text of the Gospel of
Matthew'' that appears in a 14th-century rabbinical text by
Shem-Tob, which Howard says is written ``in a kind of Hebrew one
would expect for a document composed in the first century.'' That
is, before 100 AD. He suggests that this Hebrew text, going back to
the time of Christ, may have ``served as a model for the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scholarly assumption that the original language
of the gospels was Greek. Yet the Church Fathers tell us otherwise.
Irenaeus, in the second century AD., tells us that Matthew was not
the only gospel writer who wrote to the Hebrews ``in their own
dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Epiphanius and Eusebius, both from the fourth century
AD, tell us that ``Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew'' and that
he wrote his Gospel ``in his native language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Theological Seminary professor of New Testament,
Darrell Bock, said that according to the tradition of the early
church, the language Jesus originally spoke ``was a Semitic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   William Farmer, a New Testament professor at University of
Dallas and author of the just-published book, ``Anti-Judaism and
the Gospels,'' sees a concerted effort by modern scholars to
divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unconscious attempt to remove Judaism from
Christianity by making Mark the first gospel instead of Matthew,
which is more Jewish. By making Mark the first gospel, it
discredits Matthew as only a Jewish makeover of Mark and thus
offers an excuse to disregard Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some Biblical critics denied the use of Hebrew
and promoted the theory that the gospel writers used Aramaic and
Greek in an effort to dilute the Jewishness of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in the language of the Gospels and of Jewry that
biblical critics take issue with the facts of history, but in the
historical truth and validity of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   With a subtle anti-Semitic agenda behind liberal scholarly
theories about the Old and New Testaments, biblical critics have
developed, according to Ben Levi's book ``Revelation,'' a ``dogma
that nothing original came from the Jews'' and that ``the existence
of miracle, prophecy, and revelation (without which no
understanding of the Bible is possible) were denied in a dogmatic
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   These anti-supernaturalists theorized that Matthew and Luke
``borrowed'' the language, style and, most importantly of all, the
viewpoint of Mark's condensed version of Jesus' life, and they
expanded upon Mark's account.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Synoptic (i.e. similar viewpoint) theory was
developed and exploited by liberal scholars who did not accept the
possibility that four different men who knew Jesus and were his
disciples could be divinely inspired to write similar accounts from
what they witnessed from their own personal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the anti-supernaturalist theory is that the
gospels were written long after the fact. There are still many
diehards among biblical critics who accept their own dating of the
gospels and say they were not written by eyewitnesses. It is
precisely here, in the clash between unbelief and belief, that
liberals and believers cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the testimony of the early church reminds us that the
gospels have as much historical as ethical value and that apostles
such as Bartholomew and Thomas, eyewitnesses to the ministry of
Jesus, did not give their lives for a mere myth.

   Online shopping may be a good way to avoid the shopping-mall
parking lot, but it does not guarantee that you will avoid the
homogeneity of the shopping-mall experience. In fact, the
likelihood that you will give or receive The Gap's latest V-neck
sweater style (boiled lamb's wool with a ribbed trim at the cuffs)
is sure to increase this year, as online shoppers from even the
most remote places click on trusted brands.
</P>
<P>
   But although Web portals channel shoppers to the same
high-profile stores, the Web itself offers an antidote to the herd
mentality. Tiny, family-run stores abound _ many of which suggest
gifts that you would never find at J.C. Penney or the retail shops
that surround it. Online niche shops allow you to buy monthly
deliveries of caviar for your friends, for example. There is at
least one shop where you can order aerial photographs of your
grandparents' favorite national park.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also makes it easy to personalize gifts. Fill in a
Web form about your child to order a custom-printed book or a song
sung in your child's honor. Pick your favorite tunes from an online
database and have them put on a custom CD.
</P>
<P>
   If you know what you are looking for, you can find these shops
by plugging key words into search engines. If you are starved for
ideas, here are some sites to try:
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALIZED CHILDREN'S BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   www.booksforme.com/ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BooksForMe creates books with heroes whose names are the same as
those of the children who are reading the stories. To order,
parents must fill out a form, entering the child's name, age,
birthday, town and other details related to the story. ``My Space
Adventure,'' one title, will put your child in command of a
backyard spaceship on its way to the planet Love. BooksForMe will
also insert your child as a character in more traditional books
like ``Bambi'' and ``Mother Goose.'' Each book costs $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   w3ent.com/abcpersonalized.htm &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like BooksForMe, ABC Storybooks obtains its books from a single
publisher, Create-a-Book, in Gulf Breeze, Fla., and acts as
distributor. ABC Storybooks' custom books feature holiday themes,
including Christmas and Kwanzaa. Some, like ``The Magic Little
Christmas Tree,'' are pop-ups to boot (though these are
personalized with stickers inserted on each page instead of
integrated text). Prices run from $12.95 to $19.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   www.kidcartoons.com/  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KidCartoons takes the custom concept to another level. The
artists at KidCartoons will create comic-book covers, comic books
and cartoon videos based on a child's photograph. The site is
operated by K Design, a computer graphics company in Brentwood,
N.Y. Prices are $9.95 for the comic-book covers, $14.95 for the
comic books and $19.95 for the cartoon video.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALIZED CHILDREN'S SONGS
</P>
<P>
   www.kidtraxsongs.com/ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If print is not enough, several companies will put a child's
name into song. At the Kid Trax Creations site parents can order a
17-minute tape containing five songs that mention their child's
name more than 30 times. A cassette and song-book set costs $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   www.cakencandle.com/  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the site for Cake and Candle Cassettes parents may order a
personalized lullaby, a birthday song or Christmas carols that
mention the child's name 18 times. The tapes cost $8.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALIZED SONGS FOR ADULTS

   Someday, traditional photograph albums _ full of static

small company called Edier Developer produces multimedia CD-ROM's
of events in a person's life, based on videotapes, audio recordings
and still photographs that are sent to the company's studio. (In
most cases, music used for the CD-ROM's has to come from Edier's
own collection so that the company steers clear of copyright
violations and royalty payments.) Edier Chiong, the founder, said
that he decided to make a business of personalizing CD-ROM's after
Hurricane Andrew swept through Miami, where Edier Developer is
based, in 1993. ``It wiped out most of the pictures we had,''
Chiong said. But if they had been saved on a CD-ROM, he said, ``We
wouldn't have lost those pictures.''

`MANSFIELD PARK': SPICING AUSTEN'S 1806 WITH DASHES OF 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My God, this is 1806, for heaven's sake!'' a character
exclaims in ``Mansfield Park,'' Patricia Rozema's smart,
politically pointed screen adaptation of Jane Austen's third novel.
This reminder of how every age foolishly fancies itself the most
progressive and enlightened in the history of the world is drenched
in irony. And it speaks to the heart of a film that is determined
to invest Austen with as many prickly contemporary resonances as it
can shoehorn in without appearing wildly anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' takes special pains to remind us that the
glory of the British empire and the comfortable life of the novel's
landed gentry were the products of colonial exploitation. Where the
novel alludes to the slave trading business of Sir Thomas Bertram
(Harold Pinter), the pompous authoritarian who owns the estate
called Mansfield Park, the movie rubs our faces in his dirty
business.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's rather meek central character, Fanny Price (Frances
O'Connor), has been retooled and pumped up for the film into a
spunky Jane Austen stand-in who recites directly to the camera
fragments from Austen's letters and diaries. The movie's Fanny is
an ambitious, willful writer from a poor background whose
unstoppable intellectual drive is synonymous with her integrity.
Her categorical rejection of Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), a
wealthy aristocratic dreamboat whom Sir Thomas insists she marry,
marks her as a proto-feminist heroine who risks losing everything
by standing up to male authority.
</P>
<P>
   Other modern touches include blatant drug addiction and hints of
lesbianism. Sir Thomas' wife, Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan), is a
bleary-eyed, nodding-out junkie in the thrall of the opiate
laudanum. Fanny's friendship with Henry's sophisticated, scheming
sister, Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who looks so much like Fanny she
could almost be her twin, has a strong lesbian undercurrent, and in
one scene the two women narrowly avoid falling into a passionate
kiss. In another scene (not in the novel), Fanny discovers Henry in
bed with someone else's wife. Fanny, although suitably appalled,
appears to know enough about the birds and the bees not to require
smelling salts after barging in on the pair in full sexual gallop.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of a less talented filmmaker, this extensive
tinkering and modernizing might seem irritating and pretentious.
But in peering beneath Austen's genteel surfaces and scraping away
the Hollywood gloss that traditionally accrues to screen
adaptations of Austen, Ms. Rozema has made a film whose satiric
bite is sharper than that of the usual high-toned romantic costume
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Accentuating the aspects of ``Mansfield Park'' that lend it the
aura of a feminist fable about women, power and money, Ms. Rozema
turns it into the story of a clever, willful woman who grits her
teeth and, in a reckless gamble, evades the dictates of an
oppressive patriarchal society. One of the chief obstacles to
Fanny's self-fulfillment is her poverty. Sent by her poor family in
Portsmouth to live with wealthy relatives in Mansfield Park, she is
treated like a servant and told that her lack of means has made her
an unlikely candidate for a good marriage. The autocratic Sir
Thomas, who rules the palace, ignores Fanny until she matures into
a pretty young thing, at which point he can barely keep his hands
off her.
</P>
<P>
   One element of the story Ms. Rozema hasn't updated is Fanny's
abiding love for Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller), Sir Thomas' goody-goody
bookworm of a younger son, who forgoes the family business to
become a clergyman. In keeping with 19th-century romantic
convention, it isn't until the very end that Edmund comes to his
senses and realizes that Fanny (and not Mary, who in one startling
scene reveals herself to be a kind of period Joan Collins
character) is the love of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The film's portrayal of early-19th-century affluence is notably
more austere than in other film adaptations of Austen, which
surround the characters in ruffles and flourishes. Mansfield Park
is an imposing but sparsely accommodated palace whose overall
grimness mirrors the constricting puritanical morality of English
society and Fanny's prisonlike confinement within social
convention. Casting Ms. Duncan in the dual roles of Fanny's
impoverished mother (who married for love and ended up in desperate
straits) and her well-to-do but drug-addicted aunt, Lady Bertram,
suggests the harsh choices forced on women in those days.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of frilly decor also allows the director to
concentrate on the characters. Ms. O'Connor's likable Fanny
suggests a quick-witted, wised-up '90s version of a 1940s Jennifer
Jones heroine. Biting his lips and looking alternately sheepish and
pious, Miller reins in his swashbuckling energy to make a credibly
humble Edmund. Nivola's Henry conveys the pouting narcissism
lurking just beneath a surface charm. But the movie's most imposing
performance is Pinter's thunderous Sir Bertram. A quintessential
19th-century English patriarch, he is the embodiment of an
overweening male authority, which the upstart Fanny and subsequent
generations of rebellious women feel impelled to disobey.

 `TIMELINE': IMAGINATIVE TALE OF TRAVEL TO THE 14th CENTURY  
 (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An elderly man is found wandering alone in the Arizona desert,
suffering from mysterious physical defects and babbling
incoherently about ``quantum foam.'' As he lies dying in a
hospital, it's learned that he possesses a detailed ground plan of
a 14th-century French monastery and that he works for a New
Mexico-based company that specializes in quantum technology.
</P>
<P>
   The company is run by a brilliant but supremely arrogant
physicist who has already made a fortune developing ``new new''
technology and is impatient to rush to completion a project he is
backing to reconstruct a medieval community in the Dordogne section
of France. When he pressures the team of Yale historians
researching the site, its members are astonished to learn that the
ground plan found in the possession of the babbling man in the
desert contains more information about the monastery than they have
come up with.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning how the company knows so much, the professor
who heads the Yale team is flown to New Mexico for further
briefing. A day or so later the professor's assistants dig up at
the Dordogne site some 650-year-old parchments wrapped in oilskin.
Among them is a message in the professor's hand, written in ink
that also proves to be six centuries old. It says, ``Help me'' and
is dated 4/7/1357.
</P>
<P>
   So begins ``Timeline,'' Michael Crichton's latest exercise in
exploiting technological possibility and imagining its
Frankenstein's-monster consequences, in this case the horror of
traveling back in time and getting caught in the middle of the
Hundred Years' War.
</P>
<P>
   As with Crichton's previous thrillers, like ``The Andromeda
Strain'' and ``Jurassic Park,'' the neatest thing about the plot is
the ingenious way he gets it started. According to one perfectly
plausible view of quantum reality, a character in ``Timeline''
explains, an infinite number of universes impinge on one another,
each containing a version of reality, some of them earlier versions
of ours.
</P>
<P>
   So what is thought of as time travel is actually space travel, a
sort of faxing of a human being into a universe containing a past
version of our own. Any cracks in this logic are filled by Crichton
with sentences like ``To be precise, we use quantum technology to
manipulate an orthogonal multiverse coordinate change,'' or ``We
compress it'' _ that is, the information about the human form being
sent _ ``by using a lossless fractal algorithm.'' OK, so we believe
it.
</P>
<P>
   And, as is usual with Crichton's thrillers, the story doesn't
quite live up to the idea that gets it rolling. Three of the
professor's grad students are faxed over to fish him out of the
14th century. The machinery breaks down. The Yalies have to run a
dangerous obstacle course before they can come back, featuring
warring English and French armies, jousting knights,
plague-infested rats and all the other fun things that prompted
historian Barbara Tuchman to pronounce the 14th century calamitous
in her book ``A Distant Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Timeline,'' plenty of action takes place, the pages begin
to turn themselves, but everything seems a little helter-skelter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crichton makes a number of imaginative points along the
way. When the time-space travelers first arrive in 14th-century
Dordogne, one of them is struck by the fact that he doesn't hear
anything. ``That's right,'' a more experienced character explains.
``There's no ambient noise here: no radio or TV, no airplanes, no
machinery, no passing cars. In the 20th century, we're so
accustomed to hearing sound all the time, the silence feels
creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, impressed by the fury of two knights practicing
swordplay, another character reflects that he had ``imagined a
slower fighting style'' only ``from an unconscious assumption that
men in the past were weaker or slower or less imaginative than he
was, as a modern man.'' Again and again Crichton's story makes the
point that the past doesn't think of itself as being the past.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, another character grows increasingly impressed by the
emptiness of his graduate-school debates over ``whether formalist
criteria outweighed objectivist criteria, whether derivationist
doctrine concealed normative commitment.'' This relates to the
bright side of the arrogant company president's ambitions, which is
to apply technology to the humanities and make it possible to
practice a discipline called experimental history.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his plans go awry when his probes of the past reveal that
Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in a voice that sounds
``like Betty Boop'' and Washington, crossing the Delaware, was
``huddled in the back of the boat,'' not good advertisements for
what the company is trying to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton himself ends up with a problem in advertising. In his
concluding acknowledgments, he writes of the medieval period: ``An
age that was once thought to be static, brutal and benighted is now
understood as dynamic and swiftly changing: an age where knowledge
was sought and valued; where universities were born, and learning
fostered; where technology was enthusiastically advanced; where
social relations were in flux; where trade was international; where
the general level of violence was often less deadly than it is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   This is contrary to the view of a number of books listed in his
extensive bibliography, not least among them Ms. Tuchman's
aforementioned ``Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century,''
which was written in part to reassure its readers that things in
the 20th century were not uniquely awful.
</P>
<P>
   Most emphatically is it at odds with Crichton's own cheerily
nihilistic portrait of the 14th century, where life is not only
nasty and brutish but also as short as that of a condemned man with
his head on the chopping block.

<P>
   Now here's an astonishment to both publishing and Hollywood:
this holiday season, more readers are likely to be getting their
literary fix from the movies than they are from books.
</P>
<P>
   The conjugality between Hollywood and serious novels and
nonfiction is hardly new. After all, Paramount put ``Great
Expectations'' on the screen in 1917, and Dickens has lingered
about the front lots like a ghost ever since, along with other
great writers. But for this prime period of pre-Thanksgiving
through New Year's, there seems to be an extraordinary number of
literary books that have made it to movie screens or are in
production. More than anyone seems to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, publishers are happy. Freshly redesigned paperback
editions of these books are being issued with photographs from the
movies on their covers. Sturdy back-list books that were only found
in bookstores alphabetized, two or three copies, on shelves labeled
``Literature-Fiction'' are now in heaps at the front of the stores.
So once again, it's hooray for Hollywood in the book business.
</P>
<P>
   It takes roughly two years to make a movie, and Hollywood, like
book publishing, is trend-driven. So what happened at the Academy
Awards two years ago accounts in large part for this season's high
number of literary movies: 1997 was the year of the independents.
``The English Patient,'' based on Michael Ondaatje's novel, won
nine Oscars; ``Fargo,'' ``Secrets and Lies'' and ``Shine'' also
won, and they were not studio-produced either. For Hollywood the
equation was simple: independents (EQUALS) excellence (EQUALS)
literary.
</P>
<P>
   Movie producer Lynda Obst put it this way: ``Literary material
into movies usually only happens after there's either a disaster
for the studios at Oscar night or in some mysterious way an adult
market starts to rear its head, and big-name directors used their
leverage to get studios to buy literary.'' So the next question
was, why can't the studios put that literature on the screens, win
the awards, make the money?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is they can, when they get caught in the drift, and
what followed is this year's cinema of the consequential and the
lettered, which started last week with the release of ``Anywhere
but Here,'' with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, based on Mona
Simpson's well-received novel of more than a decade ago. The list
of such books that are racing Hollywood's engine includes Jane
Austen's ``Mansfield Park,'' which opens Thursday; John Irving's
``Cider House Rules,'' Frank McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes,'' Graham
Greene's ``End of the Affair,'' David Guterson's ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' Susanna Kaysen's ``Girl, Interrupted'' and Strindberg's
``Miss Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is based on the novels of Patricia
Highsmith. And, of course, Washington Irving's ``Legend of Sleepy
Hollow'' is Tim Burton's spooky ``Sleepy Hollow.'' E.B. White's
``Stuart Little'' has popped onto the screen, and so too has
``Titus,'' which is more or less Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   What is fascinating is that not all these titles were mainstream
books, like Stephen King's ``Green Mile,'' but Hollywood's sorcery
is most certainly furiously trying to turn the literature into
mainstream movies.
</P>
<P>
   The association between publishing and movies has always been
integral, but also capricious and quixotic. (Several years ago, for
instance, it wasn't terribly uncommon for an agent to sell a
manuscript to the movies first, then use that clout to drive up the
author's advance from a book publisher. This simply put the cart
before the literary horse.) The moviemaking team of Merchant and
Ivory showed in film after film that art could make money in the
movie houses, for relatively little money invested, although many,
if not most, of the period pieces are more expensive to make than
contemporary stories. Still, Jane Austen and Washington Irving
don't have agents to bargain for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Messitte, associate publisher of Vintage, who has a handful
of paperbacks being made into literary movies, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a wealth out this season. All our books have
movie art on the covers; what we do is beneficial to the movie
companies as well. They have free advertising placed in every
bookstore in the country. In `Snow Falling on Cedars' we have about
3,000 displays in stores around the country going into the
holidays. They should sell the movies as well as the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bookman, an agent for the Creative Artists Agency, said that
for about a year, until recently, books were a hard sell to the
movies for several reasons. There was, first, a conscientious
effort to bring down budgets. ``Then the youth market returned, and
for the younger generation there really was no pre-existing
material,'' he said. ``Since there was a lot of stuff in the
pipeline, there wasn't going to be much spending on books unless
they were truly special. Very successful authors would be bought
but not the mid-level success, which also cost a fair amount.'' In
the swaying of biases of Hollywood, that is beginning to change
again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Hollywood is betting on the literary, but, even
with all the hype associated with movies, there is still
finger-crossing over whether any of these books, except perhaps
``The Green Mile,'' will really become a mainstream movie. If not,
the solution to the industry's heebie-jeebies will be swift and
rudimentary, back to basic principles: toss Tom Cruise at the
problem.

 &HT;    EUROPE SUMMIT OPENS WITH ALL EYES (AND IRE) ON RUSSIA'S YELTSIN
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With CLINTON-BARAK-1118.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Clinton leads his Western allies in
talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday, hoping to
manage one of the most difficult moments in U.S.-Russia relations
since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia are in direct conflict over three
key security issues:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Russia's air war against separatist rebels in Chechnya;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the future of nuclear arms controls;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and a U.S. plan to route huge volumes of Caspian oil out of
Russia's control for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
   Those are precisely the sorts of tensions the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, was
designed to help ease.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Clinton, Yeltsin and the other OSCE leaders gather
for a summit here Thursday, these troubles threaten to hijack
proceedings diplomats had hoped would focus on ways to strengthen
the 25-year-old organization.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton planning to use the summit to lead a chorus of
opposition against Yeltsin's campaign in Chechnya, White House
officials were struggling over how to deliver a forceful message
without making Yeltsin feel as though he'd come under siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a question of ganging up,'' White House
National Security Advisor Samuel Berger told reporters here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everybody here wants Russia to succeed in its
transformation . . . to a working democracy with a working economy,
with having shed its empire,'' Berger said. ``All of those things
are extraordinarily important.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Berger said, leaders will use Thursday's summit to press
Yeltsin to end his military campaign in Chechnya and seek a
brokered peace accord with rebels seeking independence from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of (the international community) expressing
serious concern,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months of Russian bombing has killed hundreds of civilians
near Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and left more than 200,000 others
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin blames Chechen rebels for starting the violence. He
claims they've exploded bombs and performed other acts of terror
killing civilians in Russian cities to promote their call for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The White House more or less accepts Yeltsin's characterization
but has assailed Moscow's response _ what Clinton has called
``indiscriminate'' bombing of civilian centers in pursuit of
alleged terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the level of civilian casualties and
the number of refugees that are being created,'' Berger said. ``The
means being used are causing inordinate harm to civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also spend much of Thursday highlighting agreements
to build a pair of pipelines to transport huge volumes of Caspian
Sea oil and natural gas to a Mediterranean port.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme, if it bears fruit, would give the United States and
its allies a strategic alternative to Persian Gulf oil and open the
door to deals potentially worth scores of billions of dollars to
American energy and construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   The pipelines are no victory, though, for relations between the
United States and Russia. Yeltsin has tried for years to scuttle
the pipelines, aiming to keep Moscow's hand on the spigot of the
world's last known source of large untapped crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   One part of Clinton's case, though, has been made for him.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in Chechnya has highlighted the vulnerability of
Caspian oil supplies to disruptions inside Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A pipeline running through parts of Chechnya en route to a
Russian port on the Black Sea has been shut down since last summer,
due to fighting in the war-torn region.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Clinton signed on five years ago to a policy
of building new pipelines that circumvent Russia in getting crude
oil and natural gas to markets outside of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he will sign as a witness to a pair of
multinational agreements clearing the way for commercial
construction of two new pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One would transport 1 million barrels a day of crude oil from
the Caspian port of Baku in Azerbaijan through part of the
neighboring republic of Georgia and into to the riverport town of
Ceyhan in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Financing isn't yet in place for the 1,100-mile Baku-Ceyhan
pipeline, which would cost an estimated $2.4 billion. There are
extensive engineering problems to be worked out as well, and U.S.
officials estimate it will take another five years to get the
pipeline built and running.
</P>
<P>
   A second pipeline is planned to carry natural gas from
Turkmenistan to Ceyhan. That pipeline would travel some 1,200 miles
and cost about $2.7 billion to build, U.S. officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Clinton are also slated to take up a broad nuclear
arms control agenda during a meeting between the two of them on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders are at odds over refusal by the Russian
parliament, or Duma, to ratify strategic arms reductions agreed to
during the Bush administration, as well as efforts to move forward
on two separate sets of further nuclear controls negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   With Duma elections set for December, and Russian presidential
elections slated for next June, the way forward on these talks is
anything but clear.

 &HT;    FROM GOVERNMENT TO STREET, EGYPTIANS DON'T ACCEPT SUICIDE THEORY
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    EDs: Note spelling of Batouty's full name.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Many Egyptians find it more likely that EgyptAir Flight
990 was destroyed by a secret agent than a suicidal pilot from a
respected family.
</P>
<P>
   As a stream of law enforcement leaks, but little concrete
evidence, emerged in the Western press Wednesday, Egyptians
considered and rejected the prevailing theory that a pilot may have
intentionally lead 216 people to their death.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane crashed Oct. 31, less than an hour after take off
from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. It was bound for Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators say there were no apparent mechanical or
weather-related problems. After three days analyzing a 30-minute
cockpit voice recording, officials reportedly suspect relief pilot
Gameel el-Batouty of plunging the plane into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the average Egyptian's values, which shun
suicide and suspect Western pronouncements, such an idea is
unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious crash confronts a country where ancient riddles
are accepted and reliable information is often hard to come by. The
government of 18-year President Hosni Mubarak controls much of the
press.
</P>
<P>
   While outgoing and hospitable, much of the population is
illiterate. Many feel Israel and the West have disrespected their
country and Islamic religion. It is widely accepted that Diana,
Princess of Wales, was killed by the British Royal Family because
she dated an Egyptian.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a flood of law enforcement leaks _ some contradictory
_ the famous Egyptian street-corner conspiracy mill was in full
gear Wednesday. Theories fit the local world-view better than any
suicide scenario.
</P>
<P>
   One asserted that agents from the American CIA or the Israeli
Mossad _ two agencies with actual checkered histories in Egypt _
downed the plane because 33 Egyptian army specialists were on
board. Another is that airplane manufacturer Boeing Co. was trying
to use Batouty as a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   The Batouty family was in seclusion Wednesday, with undercover
police keeping watch outside their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   A couple family representatives repeated a list of facts that
indeed made a suicide hard to imagine. Batouty owned land and
villas. His 10-year-old daughter's Lupus condition appeared to be
improving. He had plans for a New Year's and wedding anniversary
party.
</P>
<P>
   Family representatives insisted that unofficial pronouncements
from investigators should be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they would believe it if, for example, an official FBI
conclusion found Batouty responsible, cousin Sherif el-Batouty
said, ``Maybe.'' Another cousin, Dr. Galal el-Batouty said, ``No.
Not Gameel.''
</P>
<P>
   In a land where religion and status are a top priority,
Egyptians found it unthinkable that Batouty, the 59-year-old son of
a wealthy mayor in the Nile Delta would disgrace his family with
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible,'' said Abdelatif Nouri, an assistant to
Magdy Greish, a wealthy Cairo executive killed in the crash. ``We,
as Egyptians, would not do such a thing unless we were uneducated
and uncultured.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian government officials asked for a pause before anyone
drew conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping from a Cabinet meeting and making the lead in the
evening news, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat Sherif called
the reports from U.S. investigators, ``just mere speculation,
hypothesis and imaginings that don't reach the level of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Egypt sent its top civil aviation official and a
team of experts to Washington to review the cockpit voice
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Osman, director of the State Information Service, said
Egypt should be allowed to review the evidence before decisions
were made about the course of the investigation _ such as whether
transportation officials will refer the case to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a tragedy in the country's national air carrier, Osman
reiterated statements from President Mubarak that attention be paid
to possible dangers in the air space near New York rather than the
rushed conclusions of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take it day-by-day, knowing the nature of the American
media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief in the suicide theories had not, as of Wednesday,
simmered into anger toward Egypt's close ally and aid donor, the
United States. Many Egyptians said they still trusted Americans to
continue the probe.
</P>
<P>
   American officials stressed that Egyptian authorities were being
included in the crash probe, and Egyptian officials appeared to
want to avoid a diplomatic row. Some noted that more Americans died
in the crash than Egyptians.

 &HT;    Microsoft findings spark debate
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Microsoft suffered what Business Week (Nov. 22) calls
``a complete rout'' when a federal judge declared that the software
giant used its monopoly power to crush competitors. The logical
next question, the business weekly asks, is whether consumers would
be better off if the company were broken up.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion is to break the company into ``Baby Bills'' _ for
co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates _ the way AT&AMP;T was broken up
into Baby Bells, Business Week says. Another is tighter government
regulation _ ``rules of behavior'' _ to curb the company's abusive
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' says Business Week, ``is that there are no
perfect options.''
</P>
<P>
   The trustbusters did such a good job of proving their case that
they would look like wimps if they let Microsoft off too easily,
says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they insist on breakup, they could prescribe a cure
that's worse than the disease,'' says Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (Dec. 6) asks this question of the court's antitrust
findings: ``Are we crazy here, or what?''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is the company ``that for years has led the boom in
stocks and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going out of our way to burst the very bubble we've
ridden so happily and profitably for so long?'' the magazine asks.
</P>
<P>
   While the outcome of the case is still in limbo, Fortune notes
that Dell, Compaq and Gateway continue to produce desktop, laptop
and notebook computers that are running on Microsoft's Windows
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see how market forces or government intervention
will change that,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
</P>
<P>
   An editor at Forbes (Nov. 29) challenged a private investigator
to dig up dirt on him. The results, says the magazine in its cover
story, are terrifying to anybody who worries about prying eyes or
credit card scam artists.
</P>
<P>
   The private eye, using only a keyboard and a phone, discovered
Forbes Senior Editor Adam Penenberg's Social Security number, how
much was in his bank account, his salary, his rent, two unlisted
phone numbers and how much he pays his psychotherapist, among other
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes offers a laundry list of steps people can take to protect
their privacy, if there's any left. Among them: Don't write checks
in stores, inform your bank in writing not to share your records
with anyone, don't put personal information on a Web site and don't
send anything confidential by e-mail.

EACH VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY IS ONE FOR THE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Shortly into his new book, ``Passage to Juneau: A Sea
and its Meanings,'' set around his solo voyage in a 35-foot ketch
from Seattle to Alaska, Jonathan Raban makes an intriguing
admission that grows increasingly apt as the disparate strands of
this sweeping travelogue come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid of the sea,'' writes this British-born author. ``I
fear the brush-fire crackle of the breaking wave as it topples into
foam; the inward suck of the tidal whirlpool; the loom of a big
ocean swell, sinister and dark, in windless calm; the rip, the
eddy, the race; the sheer abyssal depth of the water, as one
floats, like a trustful beetle on the surface tension.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, Raban continues, ``a timid, weedy, cerebral type, never
more out of my element than when I'm at sea.'' And yet, he says,
``for the last 15 years, every spare day that I could tease from
the calendar has been spent afloat, in a state of undiminished
fascination with the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime readers of Raban (pronounced RAY-bin), who was drawn to
this water-surrounded city from London nine years ago and now makes
his home here, will recognize his attraction to water as well as
the itinerant curiosity and quest for adventure that suffuse
``Passage to Juneau'' (Pantheon). He once spent four months in a
16-foot aluminum outboard traveling down the Mississippi River for
his 1981 book ``Old Glory,'' and he sailed solo in a tubby ketch
around the British Isles for ``Coasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even writing 1,000 miles inland about Montana homesteaders for
his most acclaimed book, ``Bad Land: An American Romance,'' Raban
could not quite escape nautical images. ``Breasting the regular
swells of land, on a red dirt road as true as a line of longitude,
the car was like a boat at sea,'' begins ``Bad Land,'' which won
the 1997 National Book Critics Circle Award for general nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a Seattle restaurant recently _ as the fog rolled
over Elliott Bay, disappearing for a bit to reveal some grand
autumnal light and then sweeping right back in again to obscure it
_ Raban, 57, said he was quite comfortable with the notion of
himself as literary vagabond, whether on land or sea. A smile
breaking across his craggy face, he said he was delighted several
years ago when immigration officials presented him with the
so-called green card _ it is pink, actually, he demonstrates by
producing it _ that officially proclaims him to be a ``resident
alien'' in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of always been a resident alien,'' said Raban, who
has written 11 books in all, including several about the United
States, and served as editor for ``The Oxford Book of the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sort of the job of a writer to be a resident
alien,'' he continued. ``I was certainly a resident alien in
England. But it wasn't until I came to live in the United States
that somebody actually gave me this formal title and a card to put
inside my wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Water, he said, has mesmerized him since he was a small boy in
Norfolk exploring the first stretches of the River Wensum, just a
few hundred yards from his home. ``I think I had sort of an
addiction to water,'' he said. ``The best moment of having a bath
was pulling the plug and watching the water spin in a whirlpool''
down through the drain. ``I was transfixed by puddles.''
</P>
<P>
   The sea, of course, is a far cry from the bathtub, and Raban
really only learned to sail when he decided to write ``Coasting''
in the mid-1980s. He was afraid then, he says, and he remains
afraid now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear is part of the fascination,'' said Raban, who kept a
nervous eye on Puget Sound even on an afternoon sail out of
Bainbridge Island, the Washington state ferries passing nearby, the
Seattle skyline comfortably in view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why Conrad writes so well of the sea is, like any
professional seaman,'' he fears it, he said. ``People who love the
sea, who say they love the sea, are the real amateurs. I never
believe anybody when they say that. I think, `Well, you just don't
know much about it.' It means they've been on a cruise ship
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's had to deal firsthand with the sea and its real
dangers knows that its extraordinarily mercurial nature _ from
being the friendliest thing to the most dangerous _ is part of its
overwhelming fascination. Nothing could be more tumultuous than the
sea. It is a model of chaos, of all the things that can go
haywire.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been talking about the theme of his new book. If
the idea that ran through ``Bad Land'' was failure _ the book was
about the crushed dreams of the settlers lured to the Great Plains
by the railroads at the turn of the century _ the motif of
``Passage to Juneau'' is turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   The book explores the physical turbulence of the water itself,
as he considers the physics of waves and whirlpools in the Inside
Passage during the 1,000-mile trip. It embraces the disquieting
mythology and fantastic art and imagery that coastal Indians
employed to give their meaning to the sea. And it inquires into the
tensions and human turbulence that beset the crew of Discovery,
Capt. George Vancouver's ship, which he sailed up the Inside
Passage in 1792, to prove that the fabled Northwest passage between
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans did not indeed exist.
</P>
<P>
   As he studied the diaries of those seamen, Raban discovered that
``what began to emerge was a fascinating picture of just about the
most miserable ship that ever sailed in the 18th century, outside
possibly of the Bounty.'' The ship, he said, was laden with a
``bunch of snobbish aristos,'' ages 16 to 22, who had been packed
off on ``sort of a cheapo version of the Grand Tour,'' and they met
a stormy captain who was not at all grateful to have them as his
crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made their life miserable, and they made his life
miserable,'' said Raban, for whom the unhappy voyage amounted to
another mesmerizing strand of turbulence for the book.
</P>
<P>
   And then, finally, there is turbulence in his own life, from the
illness and death of his father, for which he has to break up his
journey and return to England, to problems that emerge in his
marriage. He is also racked by ambivalence about being out to sea
at all. Having become a father for the first time at age 50 in
1992, he finds himself consumed by longing for his daughter back in
Seattle, and part of the narrative revolves around his often
unsuccessful attempts to find any working phone along the foggy,
wind-battered shores of the Inside Passage so he can call home.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he found turbulence all around.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Seattle intrigues him. In this ``city of virtual reality,'' he
developed a curiosity about the rugged precincts of its Fishermens'
Terminal, home port for dozens of Alaska-bound fishing boats. ``It
is always a pleasure to come to this last bastion of old-fashioned
work,'' he wrote, ``with its nets, crab pots, paintbrushes and
carpentering; to its outdoor faces, seamed with experience, and to
its long-established family air, generation following generation
into the same industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this gangly, raspy-voiced author is at work on yet another
book, a novel set in Seattle in which the theme is not only water
but the city's high-tech culture as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by the talk of it, the social life of it, or
the absence of social life of it, the appearance of people in it,
the transformations that it makes of people,'' he said of the
dot-com life here. ``I mean, I know some of these people who had no
money at all three or four years ago'' and who now are
millionaires, at least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   And at New Year's he will be off for two weeks in the southwest
Indies on a 45-foot boat with friends, researching a magazine
article. ``Somebody's got to do these jobs,'' he said drily. ``What
I really want to do is write about a different color of water.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon enough he'll return to the waters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful sea to be living on the lip of, and hugely
interesting,'' he said, beckoning past his ketch and out to Puget
Sound. ``Just within the last 200 years there was a tribal sea that
compared very, very closely with the sea as described by Homer. I
mean, you couldn't go into the Mediterranean and find, as it were,
the Homeric sea alive in 1792.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, marinas were springing up already in the
Mediterranean in 1792. English yachtsmen were basing their boats
there. Whereas here, almost within living memory, you've got an
animist sea.''

<P>
   ``If I won a lot of money,'' said the contestant on ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,'' a forthright housewife with double chins,
``I'd like to lie in a bath of melted chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bath would be in England, where she was a contestant on the
original version of the quiz show. No one has said anything quite
so refreshing on the phenomenally successful ABC version, but then
sweetness and sincerity are the marks of the game's American
cousin. Despite astonishing similarities to the English original,
the ABC ``Millionaire'' also displays a connection between
wholesomeness and making money that is as bedrock American as Ben
Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   As in England, a contestant can get a phone friend or the
strangers in the audience to help. If he hears a question he
doesn't want to answer, he can pick up his money and walk away.
Competition is so soothing and benign here, it seems positively
virtuous.
</P>
<P>
   It took just one generation of copies to unveil the darker side
of this healthy competitive spirit, though. The Fox show ``Greed''
is the evil twin of ``Millionaire.'' Although in many ways it is
such a slavish imitation that it practically dares the
``Millionaire'' creators to sue, ``Greed'' offers a Darwinian
vision of ruthless competition. ``Millionaire'' reflects Americans
as we wish we were; ``Greed'' reveals what we fear (and perhaps
believe) we must be to survive. Both are close enough to reality to
hit a cultural nerve, yet exaggerated enough to be escapist fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has done more than
reinvigorate the game show genre and ABC's fortunes. (It finishes
its latest run on Wednesday, with its inevitable return date
undecided.) Its impact even goes beyond the way ``Final answer?''
has become a catch phrase, understood and overused by almost
everyone. What is most revealing is how the show's feel-good
attitude has evoked a visceral response in an exceptional range of
viewers, of all ages and classes.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC promo shrewdly pinpoints at least part of that appeal:
``They look like ordinary people; they could be your friends.'' The
contestants do look as if they might be strolling around a mall in
a white, suburban, middle-class neighborhood. They are dentists and
teachers from towns with names like Cherry Hill and Falls Church.
When asked what they would do with their winnings, they say they
would pay off their parents' mortgages or send their children to
college. And unlike Hollywood glamour-pusses, they are often in
need of diets and orthodonture.
</P>
<P>
   But the viewer's ability to identify with the person next door
is not the deepest reason for the show's resonance. On an
unconscious level, ``Millionaire'' creates an idealized vision of
America as a society of tolerant, generous, good-willed people.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the contestants have been white men _ until Tuesday,
when the show had two players, both of them women. ``It's ladies
night,'' the host, Regis Philbin, announced in anticipation on
Monday, with evident relief. Even that homogeneous group of men,
though, reflects a changing, inclusive America. With a
matter-of-factness the sitcom ``Ellen'' could only have dreamed
about a few years ago, one gay contestant brought a man introduced
as ``his partner'' to root for him. When he returned for his second
night on the show, he told Philbin how he had celebrated the night
before: with dinner from McDonald's. It is hard to imagine a more
Middle American value than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another white man brought his African-American girlfriend; the
camera went to her often, notably when he lost and she sweetly
mouthed the words, ``That's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the show's executive producer, says that
contestants are chosen on their ability to play the game, with no
questions asked about their private lives and no attempt to balance
the group by race or sex. (That must be true; surely there would
have been a greater range if they had tried.) In the quiz show
variation of ``don't ask, don't tell,'' loved ones are introduced
any way the contestants wish, with no one prodded to say ``friend''
instead of ``partner,'' or vice versa. As Davies says, each player
has a life story, and ``we tell their stories.'' Those
mini-narratives may seem like time fillers, but they give the show
its ``Our Town'' aura.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, English by birth, is in a good position to note the
differences between the original show and the American adaptation.
In England, people who want to become contestants are chosen at
random in the first round of screening, rather than qualifying
through a phone quiz as the Americans do. ``In this country,
lottery winners are not really respected because they never earned
it,'' Davies says.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the American and British shows are as similar as
two Starbucks, with a mirror-image set, the same searchlights and
clanging music, even the same phrases repeated by the host. ``It's
a good one,'' the English host says of a correct answer. (And we
thought that was a Regis line.) But where the English host
deliberately unsettles contestants, Philbin is a cheerleader. The
shows' franchised sameness may reveal the global-village unity of
the media age, but the differences in tone help explain the
American appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Part of America's diversity, of course, is the room it leaves
for opposing points of view. ``Do you feel the need for greed?''
Chuck Woolery asks his ``Greed'' contestants, waving piles of cash
under their noses, acting out the quiz show host as Mephistopheles.
Here, if contestants choose to move ahead, climbing what is called
``the Tower of Greed'' toward a jackpot of $2.2 million, they MUST
answer the question. And while a ``Millionaire'' contestant who
reaches $32,000 will leave with nothing less, on ``Greed'' a wrong
answer means losing everything _ except, that is, the $10,000 bonus
a player can get for eliminating a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   There is the essence of ``Greed.'' The show has a team of
players, but when a flashing light called ``The Terminator'' hits
one of them, that person gets to challenge a teammate to face off
on a single question. The loser leaves the game; the winner takes
his money. Behind the facade of teamwork, contestants are waiting
to stab each other. Turning a game show into a blood sport is not a
surprise, coming from the network that has given the world ``When
Good Pets Go Bad.'' And though nothing like the phenomenon of
``Millionaire,'' ``Greed,'' now in its third week, has been a
success for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   As a spectator sport, ``Greed'' is a more dramatic game than
``Millionaire.'' But it evokes uglier sentiments and brings in less
conventional contestants. In a blood sport, after all, the audience
needs villains as well as heroes. The less appealing players on
``Greed'' are not vile as in professional wrestling, but the
principle is the same. Along with wholesome types like historians
and librarians, its contestants have included an oversized
nightclub bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable contestant has been an air traffic controller
named Curtis, with a personality that veers between cocky and surly
and hair that seems a cross between Edward Scissorhands and a
porcupine. At the start of tonight's show (at 9) he and his two
teammates return to decide whether to risk the million dollars they
have won, taking a chance to double it.
</P>
<P>
   Why are there such eccentrics on ``Greed'' and not
``Millionaire''? Because on ``Greed,'' a contestant's entertainment
value counts. Bob Boden, an executive producer of the show (along
with Dick Clark), explains that in an early selection round,
potential contestants must pass a quiz as they do on
``Millionaire.'' After that, they audition by playing a test game
and are chosen not only on their skill but also on ``looks,
telegenic quality and personality,'' Boden says. ``Our goal is to
represent society with the greatest possible range.''
</P>
<P>
   These contestants are not model-gorgeous, either, but they are
not so uniformly, wholesomely Middle American as the
``Millionaire'' players. And they are not so dominated by white
men. (No one has a satisfactory explanation for that part of the
``Millionaire'' phenomenon, though the idea that men are quicker to
punch in keypad answers is high on the list of desperate guesses.)
</P>
<P>
   However contrived, ``Greed'' sends its own visceral message,
similar to the chilling one Michael Douglas delivers in Oliver
Stone's 1987 film, ``Wall Street.'' As Gordon Gekko, the snaky
financial genius, he proclaims, ``Greed is good,'' justifying
cutthroat competition as the foundation of American capitalism.
That may seem like a pure '80s vision, but it may also be ready for
a return in this healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   And game show viewers get to choose between two vicarious
experiences: they can be as happily competitive as Ben Franklin or
as savage as a Wall Street shark. One show offers an appealing
picturesque fantasy; the other may be closer to the truth.

A LONDON ZOOLOGY OF LIONS LEARS AND LOST LOVES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic of The Times of
London.  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ You want to know what has most exhilarated the London
critics this fall? No, it has not been the performance of Nigel
Hawthorne (star of the stage and screen versions of ``The Madness
of George III'') as the most celebrated of mentally challenged
monarchs in Yukio Ninagawa's revival of Shakespeare's ``King
Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not talking of the new plays by Alan Ayckbourn and Mark
Ravenhill that have recently hit the West End, or even of the
Redgrave siblings, Vanessa and Corin, though both are excellent in
Noel Coward's ``Song at Twilight'' at the Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   What has left even The Sunday Times' intellectually rigorous
John Peter crying ``wonderful, wonderful'' is Julie Taymor's
restaging of her Broadway production of Disney's ``Lion King'' at
the Lyceum Theater here: a judgment confirmed by reports that the
show is booking until next September and that some Londoners are
mortgaging their mothers to meet the prices the scalpers are asking
for seats. But more of that remarkable musical and its reception in
a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, let's just say that if you are in search of
imaginative stimulus, neither Sir Nigel with his stringy white hair
nor Ms. Redgrave in her preposterous blond wig can compete with a
giraffe that resembles a multicolored wigwam topped by a skull-like
sculpture, or those stampeding satyrs in their huge wildebeest
masks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vanessa Redgrave brings a transforming magic to a revival
first staged with Corin but without her at a north London
pub-theater last January. ``Song at Twilight'' was always worth
including in this year's celebrations of Coward's centenary because
it is the most self-revealing, even self-accusing play he ever
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be sidetracked by the fact that the dramatist based his
protagonist, Sir Hugo Latymer, on Somerset Maugham and made the
portrait as charmless as he could. Like the real-life Maugham and
the fictional Latymer, Coward was a homosexual at a time when the
law combined with prejudice to make it perilous as well as
humiliating for any man to venture out of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps because this was an awkward, touchy subject back in
1966, when ``Song at Twilight'' first appeared, the dialogue
sometimes gets cumbersome. Certainly, the play lacks the confident
elegance of ``Private Lives'' or ``Design for Living.''
</P>
<P>
   Wit remains in short supply at the Gielgud; but the arrival of
Ms. Redgrave has brought fresh punch and stylishness to the
production, which is directed by one of Coward's biographers,
Sheridan Morley. Ms. Redgrave plays Carlotta, Latymer's mistress
before he found fame as a novelist, and the owner of the passionate
letters he wrote to a male lover who has recently died destitute.
</P>
<P>
   Is the lady intent on blackmail or revenge or something subtler?
Tough yet impish, Ms. Redgrave keeps both the audience and
Redgrave's Latymer guessing. Imagine one of Ms. Taymor's big,
trundling rhinos trying to cope with her nimble cheetah and you
have the rough zoology of their combat.
</P>
<P>
   Corin Redgrave recently demonstrated his ability to play hard,
implacable men in the London-Houston-New York production of
Tennessee Williams' prison drama, ``Not About Nightingales,'' and
he does so again here, adding the snappish sophistication the role
demands. He also finds a rawness and vulnerability inside Latymer's
thick leathery defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps partly because she is so seldom seen on the stage
these days, it is Ms. Redgrave who grabs the attention, giving a
performance that ranges from sly mockery to quiet outrage. She
pricks her quarry's pomposity with skittish Beatles parodies and
unsettles him with jokily mimed kung-fu.
</P>
<P>
   She manipulates, she dominates _ and she fully explains why the
embattled Latymer ends up facing his own emotional dishonesty and
spiritual dereliction.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the Royal Shakespeare Company's ``Lear'' so
disappointing? After all, the production it has brought to the
Barbican, and is about to move to its Stratford headquarters,
begins as promisingly as any I have seen. Hardly has Nigel
Hawthorne bustled irritably onstage than we sense dangerous
tensions in his nervously bowing court: rivalry between Lear's
elder daughters for the attention of a father who does not even
bother to listen to their protestations of love, a preference for
Cordelia so overwhelming he dotingly places her on his throne,
unusually early signs of Goneril's sexual distaste for the husband
she will eventually try to have murdered. Yet the dramatic stakes
proceed to lessen, the emotional temperature to dip.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is because the production's most obvious strengths
turn out to be its prime weaknesses. Ninagawa is renowned for the
daring with which he combines Western texts with Japanese visual
effects, and, as he showed in ``The Madness of George III,'' Sir
Nigel is expert at embodying helpless anguish.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ninagawa spends the entire storm scene noisily dropping
small boulders from the flies, as if our all-too-familiar English
rain were a bizarre sort of bouncy granite, you fear for the king
in all the wrong ways. Not only may his brain end up even more
cracked than it is supposed to be: those rocks inevitably upstage a
Lear whose rants are already lacking in force and vindictiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his mildly menacing start, Sir Nigel proves too passive,
too underpowered, too kindly, too nice for Lear. After all,
Shakespeare is writing about a smug, proud tyrant who learns
through suffering what it means to be a mere man. He must travel
from A to Z, not just from M to N, generating a rare intensity of
pain and depth of anger en route. But Sir Nigel plays even the
maddest scenes for pathos and a wry humor that sometimes had the
first-night audience laughing when it might have been gulping.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the production is likely to be remembered partly for
Ninagawa's ability to rivet you with majestic parades that glide
past towering walls embossed with Oriental flowers, partly for such
supporting performances as Sian Thomas' Goneril, who bucks current
trends by refusing to suggest psychological excuses for her
beastliness and being bluntly, boldly, ferociously evil.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was offended by the violent sadomasochism in Mark
Ravenhill's ``Shopping and ... '' can be reassured that his new
play contains nothing more openly shocking than the sight of a gay
Russian hedonist trying to bring the corpse of his British lover
back to sexual life. The disturbing thing about ``Some Explicit
Polaroids,'' which has just left London for a regional tour, is its
dated obsession with the c-word, which is of course capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the younger generation of British playwrights,
Ravenhill sees contemporary urban life as empty and lawless, but,
unlike any of them, he clearly hankers for an era when Margaret
Thatcher had not fully happened, Socialist ideology still had power
over minds, hearts and events, and left-wing writers felt they
might change the world.
</P>
<P>
   All the skills of Max Stafford Clark's Out of Joint Company
cannot conceal the plot's basic unsubtlety. Imagine Rip Van Winkle
reawakening in one of the universe's black holes, and you have Nick
Dunning's infinitely glum Nick, a Marxist class-warrior who has
returned to London after a long prison sentence for maiming some
wealthy entrepreneur. All the people he encounters seem to be
selling their bodies, or dancing in sleazy nightclubs, or letting
themselves be beaten up by their partners, or refusing the drugs
that might stop AIDS from killing them, or running for parliament
on the Tony Blair ticket, or otherwise displaying what Ravenhill
sees as passivity, selfishness and loss of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatist's picture of Britain today is vivid and troubling
if not exactly balanced. But is nostalgia for the big political
battles of the past really the answer to the nation's woes?
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Alan Ayckbourn looks to the future and doesn't much
like what he sees. He has dabbled in sci-fi before, notably in
``Henceforward,'' in which robots were worryingly apt to go awry,
putting babies in microwaves and pies in cots. But in ``Comic
Potential,'' artificial intelligence wreaks only aesthetic
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The soaps of tomorrow are being performed by android actors.
Dress one of these in a long green gown, feed a plot into a
computer, press the emotion button when a child expires or vengeful
surgeons start hurling scalpels at each other _ and, lo, you have
``Son of Chicago Hope'' or its British counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   So what's new? Isn't that pretty much what's happening right
now? Well, work set in the future often satirizes the present; and
``Comic Potential'' is at its best when it involves the practice
and politics of dumbed-down television. We get a terrifying tycoon
in a wheelchair, a venomous station manager and an android doctor
who, thanks to cuts in the machine-maintenance budget, tells an
android sportsman on air that he is going to amputate his foot ``at
the uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   But the unseemly giggles of a robot nurse at this point combine
with the arrival in the studio of an idealistic young writer to
push the play in a new direction. Janie Dee's Jacey is developing
human reactions; Matthew Cottle's Adam falls in love with her; the
1970s American television star David Soul, playing a crusty
American director who yearns for the good old days of the 20th
century, gives them encouragement; and Alan Ayckbourn gets
unwontedly sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are some hilarious moments when Adam and Jacey run
off together. Perhaps you recall the scene in ``Pygmalion'' in
which Shaw's Eliza Dolittle causes consternation at a posh tea
party by saying rude things in a genteel accent? Dee's attractively
ingenuous android has a comparable impact on diners, waiters, shop
assistants and even the knife-wielding pimp she hurls to the
ground, yelling like the lesbian cop she played in yet another
soap.
</P>
<P>
   But her author's attempts to find pathos in her predicament and
poignancy in her romance _ well, how would you feel if the Tin Man
started an affair with Dorothy at the end of ``The Wizard of Oz''?
Not great, that's how.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 1999 has not been a notable year for new work in the
British theater. Revivals have filled the gap, along with the
occasional American import, such as Richard Greenberg's ``Three
Days of Rain,'' which has brought Elizabeth McGovern to the Donmar,
and Donald Margulies' ``Collected Stories,'' now with Helen Mirren
at the Haymarket.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been a long time since a Broadway musical had as much
impact in London as, say, ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Les
Miserables'' have had in New York. John Peter's acclamation of ``a
wonderful, wonderful musical, thrilling, warm-hearted, inventive
and original'' wasn't the only highbrow hosanna to ``The Lion
King.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph called the show ``dazzling,'' The
Independent declared that ``pure delight floods the Lyceum,'' and
The Daily Mail announced that ``it restores true magic to the West
End.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, I felt much the same way. The changes from the show
now running on Broadway are minimal, scarcely more than a matter of
conceding that, though wisecracking meerkats obviously originate in
Brooklyn, other African-based animals are as likely to have British
as American accents.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I was still slightly troubled by the schism between the
wonderful Zulu chants and the sometimes clunky dialogue _ but how
could anyone but a terminal curmudgeon beef about a show that,
thanks to Ms. Taymor's bravura with puppets and masks and just
about everything else, might be a ritual retelling of an exemplary
tale of death and rebirth on the Dark Continent?

SUMMIT MEMBERS TO URGE YELTSIN TO SETTLE CONFLICT WITH CHECHNYA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Russia, defending its attacks on Chechnya
citizens and battling a Western-backed oil pipeline, intends to
face its accusers Thursday as a European security summit opens with
world leaders pondering how to handle the former superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, the region's crisis management group, initially planned to
craft a blueprint for its 21st century security needs and a new
pact on conventional forces in the wake of the Soviet Union's
demise.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, an OSCE member, remains very much on the agenda. The
organization is moving to pressure Moscow to stop its military
action and negotiate with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin arrived Wednesday, telling reporters he
will change the minds of his Western critics. Yeltsin renewed
Moscow's campaign against Muslim rebels following a series of
summer bombings in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope everybody will understand that Russia is acting in
Chechnya in accordance with international, civilized rules and
norms,'' Yeltsin said in an Interfax news agency report. ``I hope
common sense will prevail with those who have not been ready for
that so far.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will meet on Thursday with Yeltsin to express
concern over Moscow's retaliatory military campaign, which has
claimed the lives of hundreds in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen representatives also arrived in Istanbul to make their
case to OSCE leaders, but Clinton had no plans to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national security
adviser, said the president will stress to Yeltsin that Russia's
current strategy will be unproductive and that Moscow should
negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Russia has a right to fight terrorism within its
borders. Clearly, this round was begun by Chechen rebels attacking
Dagestan. But our concern here is that the means being used are
causing inordinate harm to civilians,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the United States expected other world leaders
from Europe to Asia to voice similar concerns to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe virtually everybody here wants Russia to succeed in its
transformation that it's been undergoing for the last 10 years, to
a working democracy with a working economy, with having shed its
empire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OSCE officials have conducted fact-finding tours into Chechnya
and are expected to report to their members this week. OSCE also is
undergoing a charter revision that will stress its role as an
``instrument of conflict prevention in troubled regions'' before
conflict begins, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian campaign presents a delicate issue for the West.
U.S. jets pounded Yugoslavia last spring as the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization mounted a campaign to protect
independence-minded Kosovars who were under attack by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have accused the West of hypocrisy on the Chechnya
issue because of its bombing of civilian targets in Yugoslavia. Joe
Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said NATO forces took
extraordinary steps to protect civilian lives during the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason for Russia's campaign against the Islamic rebels of
Chechnya involves its oil supply. The major Caspian Sea oil
pipeline passes through the Chechen capital of Grozny from Baku,
Azerbaijan, to the Russia port city of Novorossiysk. The pipeline
has been closed because of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has accused the West of attempting to undermine its
influence in the region where oil reserves could rival those in the
North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Russia's opposition, Clinton intends to watch Thursday
as Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey sign a pact on a $2.4 billion,
1,200-mile oil pipeline from Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan. Russia last weekend sent envoys on an unsuccessful mission
to persuade Azerbaijan to scuttle the deal. The same three nations
will join Turkmenistan for a second agreement on a natural gas
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements stem from a diplomatic push by the Clinton
administration to encourage the construction of a pipeline that
would bypass Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official who spoke to reporters
Wednesday attempted to soft-peddle the impact on Moscow, noting
Russia's Lukoil is part of the 10-member oil consortium called
Azerbaijan International Operating Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are part of this package,'' the official said.
``We would welcome Russian oil into Baku-Ceyhan. So it's not
excluding them; it's just a different kind of cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal agreements being signed today will allow the
construction of the oil and gas pipelines. But not all oil
companies have signed onto the plan. A senior administration
official suggested their reluctance may be a negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price is right and the risks are in line then they're
going to have to go to Ceyhan,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official conceded the pipeline plans have a long way
to go to fruition. ``But this first step is quite historic, this
kind of cooperation, this kind of economic and political
cooperation just hasn't happened among these countries,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the advantage of the gathering of leaders to meet
privately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Negotiations
between the Israelis and Palestinians have hit a rough spot over
which portions of the West Banks the Israelis will hand over.
</P>
<P>
   Berger reported there was no breakthrough after the 35-minute
meeting, but declined to discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Israeli reporters: ``We discussed progress on all
tracks of the peace process.'' Israeli officials described the
atmosphere as ``very positive and warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the fourth day of a 10-day trip to southeastern
Europe, also played the tourist. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and daughter Chelsea joined the president on a walking tour of the
ancient city of Ephesus, a major archaeological site near the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-day OSCE summit, the president will travel to
Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Kosovo.

THE REAL YOU, NOW ON VIEW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Fla., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life just gets curiouser and curiouser.
</P>
<P>
   With more than $10 billion in sales of manufactured collectibles
last year _ a category whose best sellers include Beanie Babies,
the beanbag toys; Precious Moments, porcelain figures with
inspirational messages; and Department 56, a line of miniature
buildings _ American furniture manufacturers have figured out that
adult collectors, who now number more than 36 million, could use a
place to put it all.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the collector's cabinet, or curio, as the industry calls
it: a glass-fronted, glass-sided, glass-shelved living room
sarcophagus the size of a small-town bank vault. It lights up; it
locks. New Yorkers might be more tempted to sublet it than use it
for display.
</P>
<P>
   The curio _ or the power curio, the leading edge of the trend
(at 50 inches or wider and up to 82 inches tall, it is more R.V.
than armoire) _ is the retail-furniture business' acknowledgment of
collecting's grip on the nation's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major companies have targeted collectibles display as a growth
area,'' said Pam Danziger, the publisher of the Collectibles
Industry Report, because baby boomers, the bulk of the market for
both collecting and furniture buying, ``buy collectibles for the
purpose of decorating.'' Ms. Danziger estimated last year's sales
figure for curios and other display pieces at $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Christley, the senior vice president for sales at the
Pulaski Furniture Corp. in Pulaski, Va., which offers 175 curio
models ranging from $199 to $3,000, said: ``We came to the
realization that we weren't in the furniture industry but the
collectibles industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski, which became a licensee for Precious Moments in 1998,
advertises in magazines like Teddy Bear and Friends but not House
Beautiful. It is trying to capture buyers with cabinets specific to
popular collectibles. A curio for die-cast Nascar racers has a
carved car pediment and a mirrored racetrack background. A
golf-ball curio has tees set in glass shelves. A cabinet for dolls,
a category that with figurines like Precious Moments accounts for
57 percent of the collectibles market, employs standard light bulbs
_ not halogen, a popular new curio feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't have halogen lighting on a doll,'' Christley said. ``It
will change the color of her hair. You have to think about things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   With sales exceeding $200 million this year, curios represent
half of Pulaski's business. An optional brass plaque, which
commemorates the purchase as a gift for a special occasion, such as
a birthday or wedding, makes the cabinet itself a collectible,
Christley added.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pulaski has included curios in its line of occasional
furniture for 15 years, other manufacturers have flooded the field
in the last two years, including unlikely high-end companies like
Henredon, which now has 31 curios at prices up to $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a dust-free display that also keeps
collectibles safe from children and pets, the curio is being
promoted as a kind of show-and-tell for adults who don't collect,
to put on view prize possessions or family mementos: a pocket
museum, a three-dimensional scrapbook page or a supertitle that
says to visitors, ``These are a few of my favorite things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we're experiencing, it's becoming part of the
living room,'' said Carlos Capo, a co-owner and merchandising vice
president of El Dorado Furniture in Miami, a furniture retailer
with seven locations and $60 million in sales last year. Capo
stocks 36 models in his stores, including his newest, at $2,299,
which has a dome ``like a cathedral in Italy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we were selling 300 curios a year,'' Capo
recalled. ``Now, it's over 1,000. Many people aren't looking for
curios when they come into the store; they're shopping for the
living room or family room. They see the curios and realize it's
not just for collectors, it's for memories, nice things from trips,
instead of putting them in drawers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Moultry Howard, who bought a wrought-iron curio from
Capo for her house in Cooper City, Fla., keeps crystal figurines
and wooden elephants in it. ``It caught my eye. It was quite
unique,'' she said. For Ms. Howard, the $1,199 curio has created a
collecting problem rather than solving one. ``Before I had the
cabinet, I didn't buy all that crystal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Swift, the buyer for Kerr's Furniture Showroom in Butler,
Pa., and the store's interior designer, has watched curio sales
double in two years. They are now her strongest Christmas item.
Recliners are No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men come in on Christmas Eve and haul a $1,200 curio off the
floor for their wives,'' she said. Ms. Swift is pleased by the
trend but baffled by the phenomenon. ``I do a lot of in-home
design,'' she explained. ``I have a gentleman who collects little
motorcycles. I have a lady who collects clowns. I don't collect;
I'm amazed at how much stuff people have.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Swift was recently reminded, it all stays behind, like
the moral to a tale. She decorated the reception rooms of a local
funeral home with curio cabinets that can be used to display
touching personal effects: a sparkling afterlife of objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked exceptionally well in that situation,'' she said.

   Taking Some of the Tedium Out of Checking Footnotes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twelve scientific and scholarly publishers this week announced
an electronic reference-linking service that will allow researchers
to move easily from a citation in a journal article to the content
of that article with a click or two of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The new service will eliminate the multiple, often cumbersome
steps now required to look up a reference or footnote, said Susan
Spilka, a spokeswoman for John Wiley &AMP; Sons, one of the members of
the new partnership.
</P>
<P>
   At first, approximately 3 million articles from 3,000 journals
will be linked through the service, and more than half a million
more articles will be linked each year thereafter, Ms. Spilka said.
Among the other partners are the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, Elsevier Science, Kluwer Academic
Publishers and Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Spilka said the partnership was not limited. She called
the collaboration an ``open initiative'' and said that other
journal publishers were invited to join at any time. ``More are
being added as we go forward,'' she said. The service is expected
to begin early next year.

   The Same Old Old Faithful, With a Newfangled Twist
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the only way to see the country's most famous
geyser, Old Faithful, in action was to trek to Yellowstone National
Park in northwestern Wyoming and wait in long lines or freezing
temperatures to see it spout steam high into the air.
</P>
<P>
   But now it can be seen in real time from the comfort of home or
office. The National Park Service has set up the Old Faithful
WebCam, (www.nps.gov/yell/oldfaithfulcam.htm), to offer a still
image of the geyser that is updated every 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Park naturalists are usually available to post predictions for
eruptions, which occur every 80 to 90 minutes (predictions will
resume Dec. 15 when the Old Faithful Visitor Center reopens.) The
eruptions are dramatic, but the geyser is hardly inactive between
them, with small white and gray plumes that can have a hypnotic
effect on the viewer.

   Calendars Made for Sharing, For the Online and Handheld Set
</P>
<P>
   The Internet calendar craze has moved to handheld devices.
WeSync.com not only lets you create an online calendar but lets you
share it with family and friends by synching it to a Palm Pilot or
any other device running the Palm Operating System. Companies have
been using shared online calendars for several years, but the
concept is just now moving to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it will be valuable to have family members share
data about their activities,'' said WeSync.com president Pete
Grillo. . ``The service takes on the aspect of an electronic
bulletin board because each person who has permission can update
the shared calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   The WeSync software also lets you view multiple calendars on a
Palm device. You could create a business calendar, one for the
family and one for golfing buddies, listing tee times.
</P>
<P>
   The software, available on the company's Web site
(www.wesync.com), is free, but it runs advertisements on your PC
during synchronization. No ads are loaded on the handheld device.
``We don't want to do anything to adversely affect the Palm user's
experience,'' Grillo said.

   The Band Plays On: The Nonstop MP3
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get enough of MP3.com's free musical downloads,
well, now maybe you can. A new MP3 player, Personal JukeBox, can
carry 81 hours of high-quality digital music _ that equals about
1,200 songs, estimates the manufacturer, HanGo Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which was designed by Compaq, is about 6 inches by 3
inches by 1 inch, weighs about 10 ounces and incorporates a
miniature hard drive that stores the tunes. Other MP3 players on
the market store music in memory chips and are limited to storing
about two hours or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Personal JukeBox's rechargable lithium ion battery is
estimated to allow 10 hours of play after a full 3-hour charge. A
10-minute memory buffer reduces the chance the music will skip,
even if the box is jolted. The unit attaches to a desktop computer
with a USB cable and comes with management software that lets
listeners organize music by category, like jazz or pop, which is
displayed along with band name, song name, volume and time
indicator.
</P>
<P>
   Although well suited for MP3 downloads, some computer CD-ROM
drives aren't compatible with the player, which means you can't
always capture from CDs. The device, which will be available in
stores next month, will cost $750 to $850.
</P>
<P>
   If 81 hours of music still isn't enough, don't worry. The
specification sheet indicates that a newer drive might hold 140
hours of music _ almost a week's worth of tunes.

   An Easy Way to Expand A Laptop's Hard Drive  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microtech International wants to make it easy to add gigabytes
of additional hard drive space to the often skimpy capacity of
portable computers. Its new PortableDrive 25 is a slim box that
contains a 2.5-inch IDE hard drive with connectors that plug into a
laptop's USB port or PCMCIA card slot.
</P>
<P>
   This external device comes in a range of hard drive sizes, from
4.3 to 10 gigabytes. While data transfer rates are slower than
internal drives, a Microtech spokesman said the
four-megabyte-per-second transfer rate (using a PCMCIA connection)
was fast enough to run applications from the PortableDrive 25
``adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Balce, director of sales and marketing for Microtech's
portable storage division, said the device was a dependable method
for backing up data as well as for storing sensitive data in
corporate environments in which laptops and notebooks were shared.
The PortableDrive 25 is available in a do-it-yourself version
($99), essentially a box in which you install your own hard drive.
Balce said that was an excellent way to regain the use of a drive
that had been swapped out of a laptop for a larger one.
</P>
<P>
   The PortableDrive 25 is only sold online, at sites that include
Microtech's, www.microtech-pc.com. Prices for the device, with a
drive installed, range from $399 for 4.3 gigabtyes to $939 for 10.
It requires Windows 95 or 98. &QL;

   New TV Software Allows Instant Language Translations
</P>
<P>
   Just when the French have started rioting against the
encroachment of American culture, new technology has arrived to
enable the latest episode of ``Dawson's Creek'' to be broadcast
with French subtitles in France _ at the same time it appears in
the United States in English.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, GlobalTV, was created by Multilingual Media, a
new company based in Natick, Mass. It is based upon proprietary
translation software that takes the words typed for closed captions
and almost instantaneously translates them into different
languages. English captions can be converted into Spanish,
Portuguese, Italian, German and French. French, German and Spanish
captions can be translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the creators of GlobalTV will tell you, the
technology was not designed to multiply the audience for ``Dawson's
Creek'' or other popular soap operas, at least not primarily. Its
purpose is to enable people worldwide to watch news programs in
their own language as soon as the news breaks.
</P>
<P>
   For television to be a global medium, said Multilingual Media
president and chief executive Larry Silverman, ``you have to be
able to access it in your own language.'' Until more people have
access to the same news programs that English-speaking people enjoy
daily, he added, it is as if ``the rest of the world really is made
up of second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman said Multilingual Media was marketing its product to
international cable companies and to networks like CNN and the
International Channel. Someday, he predicted, people will be able
to buy television sets that are already equipped with the software.

   Entrusting Medical Data To an Internet Site  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of privacy, few things are as sacrosanct as
personal medical records. So when PersonalMD.com, a Web site that
began operating this summer, offered to store records on line so
that in emergencies doctors anywhere could retrieve them, skeptics
doubted there would be many takers.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's representatives say that so far more than
60,000 people have become members of its Web site
(www.personalmd.com) and that more of them are uploading their
medical histories.
</P>
<P>
   PersonalMD.com chief executive Suresh Challa said lives could be
saved by having medical records sent quickly to emergency rooms. By
putting information like a person's blood type and EKG and other
medical data online, it can be made available almost
instantaneously for doctors and other medical workers.
</P>
<P>
   The information can also be sent by fax to the many emergency
rooms that do not have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Challa said that the medical information on the site was
encrypted for security and that someone could gain access only with
a password and PIN code.
</P>
<P>
   PersonalMD.com is not alone. MedicalRecords.com is also parking
medical records in cyberspace for rapid delivery to doctors and
hospitals around the world in cases of emergencies. The records are
also available if doctors need to treat people who are traveling
far from home.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who suffered a serious allergic reaction while traveling
in Mongolia said she had been able to get the proper medication
when doctors there quickly got her medical history at
www.medicalrecords.com.

   Techie Sneakers That Measure A Child's Personal Best
</P>
<P>
   Starting in December, there may be a new sound at recess:
electronic beeps emanating from a new line of children's sneakers
by Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Called Traxtars, the shoes attempt to go one better than the
ever-popular sneakers with flashing lights in the soles. They can
measure, record and signal a child's running or jumping ability.
</P>
<P>
   A microcomputer encased in what Reebok calls a pod is attached
to the tongue of the left shoe. This pod includes three buttons
represented by symbols for a sprint, long jump and high jump. Press
the button for the long jump, and a series of beeps, accompanied by
flashing lights, provides an electronic countdown of ready, set,
go. That's when the shoe tells its wearer to, well, take a running
leap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the child lands or stops running, sensors embedded in
the pod take note. The child then receives a score of one to six,
again in a series of beeps. By checking that score against an
information card that comes with the shoes, children can find out
approximate measurements for how fast they ran or how high and far
they jumped. The shoes can also remember previous scores and will
signal when a new level of athletic skill has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much in the spirit of getting kids off the couch,
not playing video games,'' said Matt Feiner, director of children's
products for Reebok. The shoes, which go on sale in selected
markets listed on the Traxtar.com Web site, will sell for $55 and
$65, depending on the shoe size.
</P>
<P>
   Feiner said the shoes were just the first in a line of Reebok
footwear and accessories (like sunglasses) that would be endowed
with intelligence. No word, though, on when or if smarty pants may
make it to market.

WILL GIFT LISTS CLICK?

 (ATTN: Texas, Kan.)  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who agonize over what to give far-flung nieces and nephews
for the holidays or what to buy the friend who is a compulsive
gift-returner can now instruct the would-be recipients to simplify
the shopping process by setting up an online gift registry.
</P>
<P>
   Gift registries are usually associated with weddings and with
the question ``Is the gravy boat still available?'' On the
Internet, gift registries, including Wish.com (www.wish.com),
WishClick.com (www.wishclick.com) and Wish-List.com
(www.wishlist.com), to name a few, have sprouted in the last year,
all with the goal of being the single online destination for gift
recipients, gift givers and the online retailers who can satisfy
the needs of both.
</P>
<P>
   Except for slight variations in selection and processing, the
sites all work in essentially the same way. A shopper registers at
the site, chooses a category like clothing or consumer electronics,
peruses products from a variety of retailers and creates a wish
list. In most cases, the registry site sends the person to the
retailer's site to view the product, then links the shopper back to
the registry when a product has been selected for inclusion on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   The wish list is stored at the site, and the list creator alerts
friends and family members. The gift giver can then go to the site,
enter the person's name or e-mail address and view the wish list.
Each time someone buys an item on a list, the registry site
receives a 5 percent to 15 percent commission from the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Wish.com and NetGift.com (www.netgift.com), two sites focusing
on strong retail partnerships, have agreements with more than 300
retailers. ``Instead of trying to drive people to our site, we're
driving them to other well-known sites,'' said Randall Greg, a
spokesman for NetGift, whose goal, he added, is to register 2
million users by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like IveBeenGood.com (www.ivebeengood.com) and
eWish.com (www.ewish.com), list retail partners but also encourage
shoppers to wish for products anywhere on the Internet. It is
usually up to the list maker, however, to cut and paste the URL of
the desired item into a box at the wish-list site.
</P>
<P>
   Della.com, the expansion of the Della &AMP; James online bridal
registry into an all-occasion gift site, is taking a slightly
different approach. In addition to partnering with name retailers
like The Gap and Neiman-Marcus, Della showcases products from many
stores and processes the purchase transactions at the Della site
(www.della.com), instead of having the consumer go to the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers, including Amazon (www.amazon.com), CDNow
(www.cdnow.com) and eToys (www.etoys.com), have their own gift
registries, which gift buyers can view by going to the site and
typing in either the recipient's name or e-mail address. Customers
who buy from the eToys registry can get 10 percent discounts over
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   But while making a list of must-have toys might be fun for
children, it remains to be seen whether adults will warm to the
idea. Even consumers who have grown accustomed to shopping online
are squeamish about making wish lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those people who feel comfortable asking
someone for a gift,'' said Lyle Rutschman, a toy collector in
Wichita, Kan., who regularly buys Star Wars figurines at online
retailers. ``It just feels a little like begging.'' Rutschman
instead uses wish lists at eToys and Toytime.com (www.toytime.com)
as a way of reminding himself of what he plans to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of weddings, it's going to be difficult to make it fly
for adults,'' said Ken Cassar, a digital commerce analyst at
Jupiter Communications. ``There's no gratification for the buyer,
who is essentially an order fulfiller.''
</P>
<P>
   For the recipient, of course, gift registries CAN just about
obliterate any sense of surprise. Because many registries notify
the list maker once a product has been purchased, a child with
access to a registry can perform the electronic equivalent of
peeking through the wrapping paper. To avoid this, parents should
set up the wish lists and have any e-mail notifications about gift
purchases sent directly to them.
</P>
<P>
   Families that are already accustomed to list-making are most
likely to benefit the most. ``Our family writes up wish lists on
paper every year anyway,'' said Kathy Truesdell, of Austin, Texas,
who plans to register at eWish.com this year. ``It's always very
painstaking work, so this seems like it might make it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Mincer, of Dallas, also plans to use an online registry
this year, and to tell her family about it. ``Swinging steaks may
be a delicacy where my brother's from, but I don't want any more,''
she said, referring to a regional dish also known as Rocky Mountain
oysters _ deep-fried calf, lamb or buffalo testicles. ``This is a
way of giving him other ideas.''

FOR AN EAMES, THE LEGACY IS CHILD'S PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TOM VANDERBILT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 38, Eames Demetrios, grandson of the influential
designers Charles and Ray Eames, recalls visits to his
grandparents' house with a child's sense of adventure. Who wouldn't
relish rummaging through the vast storehouse at 901 Washington
Blvd. in Venice, Calif. _ the trolley factory turned Eameses'
studio _ with its countless totems and toys, musical contraptions,
models and banks of drawers stuffed with objects from around the
world?
</P>
<P>
   Young Eames even managed to get his pudgy fingers onto the
screen in his grandparents' film ``Tops,'' a sublime seven-minute
homage to the toy. Years later, that film and those fingers are on
the wall of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, where adults
(and children) are savoring ``Charles and Ray Eames: A Legacy of
Invention,'' an exhibition midway through its tour of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Demetrios has applied his now more slender fingers to shooting
hours of films, hundreds of stills and helping to create a CD-ROM
in an attempt to understand his grandparents' storied legacy and
pass it on to others.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing a visitor notices at the exhibition are
children: sitting on the floor, watching with fascination as an
Eames plywood chair takes a beating (but keeps on seating) inside a
rotating chamber that Charles Eames created to demonstrate its
durability; or spinning gleefully in the designers' classic black
leather lounge chair.
</P>
<P>
   The work has a kind of youthful optimism, and touring the
exhibition with Demetrios, it is easy to sense his enchantment.
Memory inhabits every turn. He eagerly shows a visitor the rebus
letter Charles Eames sent to his grandchildren from Russia. (It was
signed with ``L's'' in a fire _ charred ``L's,'' of course,
standing for Charles.)
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last 10 years, Demetrios and his mother, Lucia
Eames Demetrios, have been working and living with these memories.
As director of the Eames Office, with a dozen employees, Demetrios
preserves and markets the designers' legacy, sometimes at the
expense of creating his own. It is, he admits, ``a balancing act,
but it's one that I'm enjoying right now.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard University, Demetrios gained
attention with ``901: After 45 Years of Working,'' an elegiac
half-hour 1989 film documenting the closing of the Eameses' office
in Venice, Calif., after Ray's death in 1988. With Demetrios'
sparse narration and hurdy-gurdy in the background (the sound is
Charles' beloved hand-cranked organ), the film explores every last
corner of the office. ``Even empty,'' Demetrios said at the film's
conclusion, ``there was a way the space was carved that was still
Charles' and Ray's.''
</P>
<P>
   As curator of the film and media components of the exhibition,
Demetrios is also trying to reassert the importance of the Eameses'
own photography and films. They made more than 100 short features;
many had no narration, others avoided pedanticism. The couple's
films aim to instill wonder and curiosity in viewers. At the
museum, visitors _ especially children _ crane to decipher the
shimmering patterns projected on the floor in their short
``Blacktop.'' It was created by hosing soapy water over asphalt but
looks more like an extraterrestrial ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Demetrios' interviews with friends and associates of the
designers, ranging from employees to other family members to the
composer Elmer Bernstein, form the opening segment of the
exhibition, and a number of them have been collected on a CD-ROM.
The CD-ROM, called ``Powers of 10,'' after the Eameses' 1968 film,
which might be their best-known effort other than a chair, takes a
look at scale. Unfortunately, while the idea of an interactive
version is certainly in the spirit of the Eameses' work, the CD-ROM
lacks their simplicity and directness.
</P>
<P>
   In a kind of electronic corollary to the retranscribing of
medieval texts, Demetrios also spent a year rephotographing images
in ``Glimpses of the USA,'' the pair's seven-screen presentation of
clover-leaf highways, freshly minted suburbs and other icons of
postwar America that dazzled Muscovites at the 1959 American
National Exhibition in Moscow but was never seen in the United
States. With the original negatives lost, the images were reshot,
one by one, with a still camera, and color corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Ray Eames' exhaustive photographs account for nearly
5 percent of the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of
Congress, the largest photo archive in the world. Theirs was not
just a penchant for snapshots, but a process that informed their
work and organized their thoughts. ``Charles didn't feel he
understood a piece of furniture until he had photographed it,''
Demetrios said. ``It allowed him to have a fresh look.'' Like a
dominant trait, that need to make a visual record has passed down
to Demetrios and the four other Eames grandchildren, all with
design or artistic backgrounds.

</P>
<P>
   Demetrios shuttles between the Eames Office in Santa Monica,
where activities range from issuing textile patterns for the Eames
sofa, and England, where he is finishing work on an oral history of
the century as told by people born in 1900. He is also shooting a
documentary on the Emeco anodized aluminum chairs commissioned by
the Navy (and built in conjunction with Alcoa) in 1944. The chairs,
which relate only to the Eameses in their simplicity, have evolved
into a design staple, and he admires their ability to seem at home
in a number of settings. ``If you went to a diner on the Eastern
Shore, it would not look out of place,'' he said. Yet it's at the
Paramount Hotel in Manhattan, ``and that's fine too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He shares a house minutes away from the new Eames Office in
Santa Monica with his wife, Shelley Mills, a fellow filmmaker (they
met on a shoot) who helps run the Eames Office, and their sons,
Xander, 11, and Guthrie, 8. And it's furnished how? ``There's a lot
of Eames furniture,'' he said, almost sheepishly. But it is no
postwar paragon; Demetrios, like most people, moved into a house
designed and built by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is simply to make it a place where he and his wife can
live and work and his children can play with their Legos. ``One of
the major impressions Charles and Ray made on me was that design
should address the needs,'' he said. ``We're just trying to make
the house work; one of the lessons of the exhibition is that design
is not about making a statement for the sake of making a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his grandfather's lasting lessons is that good design
comes without pretension. He recalls the Eameses being asked to
redesign the logo for Budweiser beer. They turned down the job,
saying the logo was fine as it was.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 14 and working at the Steinhart Aquarium in San
Francisco, Demetrios was given the chance to travel to the South
Pacific to swim with a 30-foot whale shark for an aquarium
documentary. His grandfather gave him an inexpensive camera to
record the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that if I borrowed my parents' Nikon, I would be so
petrified of dropping it in the water I would just leave it in the
room,'' Demetrios said. As it turns out, Demtrios' first published
pictures were taken with that camera, and inexpensive as it was, it
contained some priceless lessons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur Miller may be his own worst publicist. Even
his mildest cautionary pronouncements on the state of the American
theater tend to have the moral force of something lifted from the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 84, still tall, lean and ramrod-straight, he has
both the silhouette and the rectitude of a patriarch. There he
stands, ever vigilant, watching over a society that, in his
lifetime, has shown an increasing affection for the flawed, the
trivial, the sentimental and, in particular, anything new that is
instantly disposable.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the past, he insists, the past. The past is the
present, and if there is no past, the present is without form or
meaning, a murky gray chaos.
</P>
<P>
   It makes no difference that Miller is right most of the time,
but his public image intimidates. It gets in the way of his work,
suggesting that his plays must somehow be good for you: heavy,
weighty, stern and a bit of a slog. Which is why, I suspect, that
whenever we come back to one of the great plays we can be dazzled
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   We discover, as if for the first time, that he is not only a
master of the complex mechanics of the theatrical idiom, but also a
writer of spontaneous grace, compassion, humor and delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   When well served, a great Miller play can soar, leaving you
light-headed with a joy that illuminates all of the other
contradictory emotions you have just experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with James Naughton's fine, sturdy revival of
``The Price'' at the Royale Theater. It must now be apparent (as it
wasn't to a number of critics when it first opened on Broadway in
1968) that ``The Price'' is one of the great Miller works. It ranks
alongside ``Death of a Salesman'' and, in its sheer playwriting
craft, it may even be the superior of that classic.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a four-character drama, unfolding in the real time
shared with the audience (2 hours and 25 minutes), in which Miller
manages to explore the American experience over much of this
century. No flashbacks, no fantasies, no scrims, no gimmicks.
Instead, ``The Price'' moves forward with the gathering momentum of
a primal whodunit as it reveals, betrayal by betrayal, the history
of one American family.
</P>
<P>
   Simply from the technical point of view, this is an astonishing
piece of work. In the context of the Miller canon, it's a more
mature, more introspective, less tricky play than ``Salesman.''
Hidden malignancies in fraternal and marital relationships are
exposed without breaking the skin. It's a play of anger,
melancholy, love, frustration and regret, also of moments of great,
robust laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The time is 1966, the setting the attic of a brownstone on the
West Side of Manhattan. At the center is a small, cleared area,
surrounded by stacked-up furniture, appliances, clothes, musical
instruments, athletic equipment and other objects defining the
family that once lived below. This is no ordinary attic, though.
It's a battleground for Victor Franz, a New York City policeman who
is nearing 50 and retirement from the force; his trim, pretty,
steadfast but no longer patient wife, Esther, and his older
brother, Walter, a successful surgeon, a star in his field, whom
Victor and Esther have not seen or spoken to in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The de facto referee for the tumultuous confrontations is
Gregory Solomon, the furniture dealer called in by Victor to
appraise and, he hopes, to buy the attic's contents. Old (almost
90), stiff in the joints, with a Yiddish accent and locutions that
are pure poetry, Solomon is not idly named. He is tough, shrewd and
beyond perfunctory answers _ he has lived too long to rely on them.
Like the goods he has been asked to examine, he is a link to the
past. He is also one of the richest characters the playwright has
ever written.
</P>
<P>
   If you have read ``Time Bends,'' Miller's autobiography, a
memoir of Dostoyevskian scope, you know that virtually everything
that has happened in this American century has its origins in _ or
was radically changed by _ the Great Depression. So it is with
Victor and Walter Franz.
</P>
<P>
   When their millionaire father was wiped out in the 1929 market
crash, he never recovered. He simply gave up. Their mother, in
mourning for the musical career she never had, retreated into her
own private world. Victor, who planned to become a scientist,
dropped out of college to take a job to support his parents,
eventually joining the force. When his mother died, he moved up to
the attic, which he shared with his father until marrying Esther.
Walter, however, continued his medical studies, working on the side
and sending home $5 a month. He never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Victor thus embraced a martyrdom that Walter recognized, but
only half-heartedly tried to talk him out of. In the course of the
accusations and justifications that mark their reunion in the
attic, each man successively tops _ and is topped by _ the
revelations of the other. Walter, it seems, very early realized
that love had never been what held their family together, which is
why their father shamelessly used Victor while saving his
admiration for Walter, the son who had abandoned him.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly exposed are secrets that cut deep. Tentative
reconciliations are accepted one minute, only to be scorned the
next. By the end, the brothers are no closer to coming to terms
than they were at the start, which is not to suggest, as some of
the play's initial critics did, that they are just where they were
when the play began. Not true. Each has a new comprehension of the
past, which makes possible a new beginning. Things change.
</P>
<P>
   Though I saw the original production of ``The Price'' with Pat
Hingle and Arthur Kennedy as the brothers, I have no memory of
being as moved and as peculiarly cheered by it as I was by the
current production.
</P>
<P>
   As staged by Naughton (whose most recent Tony Award was for his
grand performance as Billy Flynn in ``Chicago''), this ``Price,''
like Michael Mayer's Roundabout Theater Company production of ``A
View From the Bridge,'' realizes all of the text's dangerous
tensile strength. It is both immensely satisfying and, in a way
that straight plays are not often cited for, entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the performances by Harris Yulin (Walter Franz),
Jeffrey DeMunn (Victor Franz), Lizbeth Mackay (Esther) and Bob
Dishy (Solomon). Note also two other prominent team members:
Michael Brown, who designed the atmospheric set, and Rui Rita,
whose lighting design helps to create a claustrophobic purgatory in
a space as wide and deep as any conventional Broadway stage.

</P>
<P>
   There is an awful lot of painfully jocular exposition to be
waded through before Woody Harrelson makes his entrance in ``The
Rainmaker,'' the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of N. Richard
Nash's 1954 rustic fable at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. Yet he's
worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson brings with him a dynamic if still evolving stage
presence, as well as the same actorly intelligence that informed,
without condescension, both the sweetly out-of-it bartender he
played on ``Cheers'' and the sly grotesqueries of Larry Flynt in
``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' His role in ``The Rainmaker'' is
well chosen, that of the self-styled Bill Starbuck, a charming con
man who masquerades as a miracle worker and succeeds in spite of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Starbuck possesses an impressive provenance, being a variation
on a quintessential character identified with 19th-century American
folk literature. He is the rootless, larger-than-life rascal, often
a teller of tall tales, who roamed the frontier, sometimes fighting
bears as big as mountains and not always being politically correct
in his treatment of widows, American Indians and others equally
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   As conceived by Nash, Starbuck has been cleaned up and whittled
down to fit the needs of his sentimental comedy, about how the
smooth-talking Starbuck, hired by the Curry family to end a
ferocious drought, saves Lizzie Curry, a plain farm maiden, from
lifelong spinsterhood. The time is 1936 and the setting is the same
parched, depressed American landscape that sent the Joad family on
their epic journey from Oklahoma to California.
</P>
<P>
   The Starbuck character still has its appeal, but ``The
Rainmaker,'' first done as a television show in 1953, doesn't wear
well. It's a faux-naif comedy that has to be played with the sort
of consistent idiosyncratic style that distracts attention from the
fundamental stickiness of the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Darren McGavin and Geraldine Page headed the original Broadway
cast, and Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn were the stars of
the 1956 film adaptation. The 1963 musical adaptation, ``110 in the
Shade,'' had an even longer Broadway run than the play, possibly
because the Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt score supplied a sense of
romantic wonder that is absent from this revival.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, a good one, includes Jayne Atkinson (memorable in
``How I Learned to Drive''), who plays Lizzie, and David Aaron
Baker and John Bedford Lloyd as her brothers. Yet the production,
directed by Scott Ellis, is both fancified (by superfluous
directorial touches) and, when Harrelson isn't front and center,
dull.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Atkinson's Lizzie seems almost self-satisfied, even
matronly. Her performance is legitimate, without mannerisms or
tricks, but she and Harrelson never convincingly connect.
</P>
<P>
   The script doesn't help. It is the playwright's idea that Lizzie
is persuaded of her own worth and beauty by Starbuck's insistence
that she ``dream'' that she is ``somebody.'' We are in that generic
Disney land where wishing makes anything so. He also tells her that
every woman is pretty in her own way. Of such epiphanies was much
of the Golden Age of television composed.
</P>
<P>
   Even James Noone's unit set, which looks pretty when you first
take your seat in the theater, begins to seem misconceived the
longer you stare at it. In a comedy of this sort, there is no need
to overdo the Dust Bowl aspect, but the copper-colored hills we see
surrounding the Curry homestead suggest Montana mining country, not
the broad, pancake-flat plains of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is all that straw-colored grass that surrounds
the farmhouse and the little town nearby. How did it grow to be as
high as an elephant's eye without rain, and why did no one harvest
it before it dried up? Do the male members of the Curry family ever
do any chores, or are they simply obsessed with finding Lizzie a
husband?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rainmaker'' raises a lot of questions, all of them
irrelevant to good theater. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If ``Fuddy Meers,'' the surreal, cockeyed comedy now on Stage 2
at the Manhattan Theater Club, is to be believed (and I think it
should be), then David Lindsay-Abaire is a smart new playwright to
be watched.
</P>
<P>
   The title? It's the way that an unfortunate woman named Gertie,
the mother of Claire, the play's central character, pronounces
``funny mirrors.'' They are found at carnivals, being the things
you stand in front of that make your feet and head look as if they
had been pumped full of helium. Gertie, having had a major seizure,
talks ``stroke-talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire, played by the delectable J. Smith-Cameron, is a serenely
unflappable, big-eyed Kewpie doll, who also has suffered a trauma,
as a result of which she forgets who and where she is every time
she goes to sleep. Each morning she has the opportunity to start
all over. God gives her 365 clean slates a year. Make of this what
you will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuddy Meers'' is about one crucial day in Claire's ever-new
life. While her husband is out of the house, she is abducted to
Gertie's by a worried, low-browed fellow identified in the program
as Limping Man, an escaped con. Also involved in the confusion that
ensues: a foul-mouthed hand puppet, another escaped con, a tough
young woman masquerading as a policewoman and Claire's pot-smoking
teenage son.
</P>
<P>
   The play is a real-life cartoon of a comedy that, like Gertie's
speech, makes far more sense than you might think at first. For
much of the time, it is also uproarious. Think Christopher Durang,
though Lindsay-Abaire is, possibly, an original. He also can write
lines that haunt as they amuse.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a childhood memory about her father that suddenly
returns to Claire: ``And Daddy would walk all these dogs at once.
Seven or eight at a time. All these leashes pulling in different
directions. And he'd come over that hill looking like a map of the
universe. Yeah, Daddy's yellow hat was the sun and he had all these
dog planets revolving around him.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a mind at work here.
</P>
<P>
   David Petrarca is the director who keeps everyone on the same
benignly crazed wavelength. By the final blackout, you adore them
all.

AUSTIN CONNER SHOFNER, 83; LED ESCAPE AT POW CAMP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Austin Conner Shofner, the Marine who got word to the
outside world of the infamous Bataan Death March of 1942 after he
engineered the first and only successful American team escape from
a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, died on Sunday at his home in
Shelbyville, Tenn. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate plight of the prisoners, as reported by Shofner's
10-man group, led to changes in Allied strategy and tactics in the
Pacific that were credited with saving the lives of thousands of
servicemen. For his exploits then and as a guerrilla leader
afterward, he was decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross by
Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine Corps captain and company commander, he was captured at
Corregidor and spent 11 months in several camps. He surreptitiously
managed to chronicle those experiences and the subsequent escape in
a diary that is kept in the Tennessee State Library and Archives.
</P>
<P>
   Shofner was born in Chattanooga and raised at an ancestral home
in Bedford County, Tenn. He graduated in 1937 from the University
of Tennessee, where he lettered in wrestling and football.
</P>
<P>
   In prison camp he remembered the axioms of football that had
been drilled into him at Tennessee. One seemed especially made for
his situation: Play for the breaks, and when they come your way,
score.
</P>
<P>
   He did so by recruiting an escape party of soldiers, sailors,
airmen and Marines who awaited an opportunity for their break. It
came on a work detail outside the Philippine prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   The men took their chances and made it to safety by chopping
their way through miles of Mindanao jungle. They brought the first
news of the death march and the brutal conditions that by war's end
had killed thousands of Filipino, American and other Allied
prisoners, the victims of torture, starvation and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Shofner stayed in the Philippines for six more months, leading
Filipino guerrillas who rescued 500 prisoners slated for death in
one camp. He later led Marine assault battalions ashore on Peleliu
and Okinawa, where he earned the Silver Star and the Legion of
Merit. He retired from military service in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Bedford County and worked as an executive in
insurance and finance. He also was active in local Republican
politics, the Sons of the American Revolution and the 1st Marine
Division Association, among other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Shofner is survived by four sons, William E., Martin K. and Dr.
R. Stewart, all of Nashville, and Michael M., of Shelbyville, and
seven grandchildren. His wife, Kathleen King Shofner, to whom he
was married for 49 years, died in 1996.

BUSH VOWS TO DEFEND TAIWAN AGAINST MILITARY ATTACK FROM CHINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Saber-rattling before making what he bills as a
major foreign policy speech Friday, George W. Bush says as
president he would defend Taiwan against military attack from
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would help Taiwan defend itself, you bet,'' Bush told ABC
newsman Sam Donaldson as part of an interview broadcast Wednesday
on ``20/20'' and released the same day on ABC's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that a promise that the United States will back Taiwan
against China will make it clear to both sides that they will have
to work out their dispute between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose is to promote the peace,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the governor made similar remarks in August, People's
Republic of China Ambassador Li Zhaoxing criticized unspecified
``American politicians'' who talk about defending Taiwan against
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a very dangerous statement,'' Li said at
the time. ``Taiwan is a part of China. Taiwan is not Florida,
Hawaii or Guam. The issue of Taiwan is entirely China's internal
matter, brooking no foreign intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Iowa on Wednesday, Bush dealt with another area
of foreign policy by urging the Clinton administration to move
quickly on an $800 million program designed to send surplus farm
commodities to hungry nations.
</P>
<P>
   Such a step would aid nations in need and be welcomed by farmers
who are almost done gathering this year's crops. A heavy harvest
again this year has left the country awash in surplus grain and
driven commodity prices to historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to deliver his first major foreign policy speech
Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The speech is expected to be closely watched because of the
growing concern about Bush's ability to handle foreign affairs. He
has made several small mistakes in the names of the natives of
several countries, and recently failed a reporter's pop quiz on the
names of the heads of state in four international hot spots. In
that same interview, he described the Pakistani military coup as
``good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Bush does not plan to plow new ground with his
address. He is less interested in producing headlines, they said,
than he is in showing he is capable of dealing with substantial
foreign policy issues in broad themes.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of this year Bush has been studying foreign policy
under a team of advisers who helped develop his policy speech,
including former Secretary of State George Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy had been a strength of Bush's father, former
President Bush. The elder Bush had been ambassador to China and CIA
director in the 1970s. Clinton, in his successful 1992 bid to
unseat Bush as president, made an issue of Bush's cooperation with
the communist Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa on Wednesday, Bush continued voicing his support for
China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, a move that is
supported by only one other Republican presidential candidate, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for Iowa. I think it's good for Texas to
open up those vast new markets,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deal has been opposed by conservative congressional
Republicans as well as presidential rivals Steve Forbes and Gary
Bauer, who declared last week there will be ``more heated debate''
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   China could serve as more evidence, along with Bush's reluctance
to discuss abortion and other hot-button, right-wing issues, to
conservative Republicans that Bush is aligning himself with
centrists of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that opening China to trade will create a Chinese
middle class, an ``entrepreneurial class.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also has been critical of the Clinton administration for
calling China a ``strategic partner.'' Bush said China should be
considered an economic competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also criticized the Clinton administration in May for
taking inadequate action after accusations arose that the Chinese
were stealing U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal,
Bush said he believes the prospects for good relations with China
at this point are better than with Russia. He said in Russia ``the
concept of a rule of law and the basic accounting principles ...
are murky and weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told The Associated Press in another interview that he
would be willing to share technology to help Russia develop an
anti-ballistic missile system if Moscow pledged to stop the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he would seek to cut off international aid to
Russia if the bloodshed in Chechnya continues. The two-term Texas
governor said Russia, China, the Middle East, and Central and South
America would be his top priorities as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to talk about optimism and keeping the peace,
keeping the peace not only for this generation but to keep the
peace for a lengthy period of time,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to
talk about the need for America to seize the moment, to set a tone
for a new American internationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to achieve our objective will be through a strong
military, through economic policy based upon fair trade and through
strong alliances,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the GOP field, Bush wants Russia to amend the
1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to allow the United States to
develop a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to signal that the move would be defensive, Bush
said he would offer to share technology to help Russia develop its
own missile-defense system. Russia must first pledge to stop
spreading nuclear weapons technology to other nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the steps would persuade Russia to amend the
treaty. ``If they don't, we have the option to exit the treaty,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest threats facing the nation is Russia's
ability to provide nuclear weapons technology to rogue nations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to persuade them that we need to change ABM. We would
be willing to share the technology so long as they make a pledge
against the spread of weapons technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed helping Russia develop
radar technology in hopes that Russia amends the treaty. Condoleeza
Rice, Bush's top foreign policy adviser, said that while the
administration is discussing a narrow incentive to Russia, Bush is
talking about a broader _ but not yet specific _ approach to
sharing technology ``that might have any number of elements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-ballistic missile technology is good for all peace-loving
nations,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   The Israeli replied that he expects to reach agreement with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat on the newest
land-for-peace dispute ``soon,'' said White House National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is it gets resolved,'' Berger told
reporters after Clinton's half-hour meeting with Barak. ``I hope it
will be resolved quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak also discussed ideas for invigorating
long-sidelined peace talks between Israel and Syria, Berger said,
though he provided no details and offered no evidence of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a harder threshold to get over to get the
parties engaged with one another in negotiations, and that is
something that we are working on very hard,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is here on the second leg of a 10-day swing through
southeast Europe. He heads to Greece on Friday before continuing on
to Florence over the weekend, and then Bulgaria and Kosovo before
returning to Washington late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak asked for Wednesday's meeting, White House aides said, to
take advantage of Clinton's presence in the region at a difficult
time in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Working against a self-imposed deadline, Barak and Arafat have
pledged to complete a basic framework by February 15 laying out the
requirements for ending decades of conflict and enmity. Their goal,
shared by Clinton, is to complete so-called final status talks _
which would include the deeply divisive issues of Palestinian
statehood and the future of Jerusalem _ by next September.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Barak to stick to the timetable, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed the view that February 15 is not that far away
and we should continue to work at a brisk pace,'' to meet that
deadline, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, though, a fresh dispute erupted over Israeli promises
to withdraw from parts of the occupied West Bank and turn over
territory to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has committed to handing over an additional 5 percent of
the West Bank, and authorities were preparing to turn over some
land on Monday when Arafat rejected parts of the Israeli withdrawal
formula.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said Barak was proposing to give up sparsely populated
land of relatively little value.
</P>
<P>
   Barak countered that Israel was obligated to withdraw from a
certain amount of territory but was not required to clear specific
withdrawal maps with the Palestinians. To do so, Barak said, would
hand Arafat effective veto power over Israeli withdrawal schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton weighed in on the matter, but he declined to
characterize the president's position.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton did raise the issue and Barak expressed some
hope for a quick resolution, but added, ``I don't think that
anything I would say about that publicly ... would be helpful.''

 &HT;    TOP NAVY HOSPITAL REMOVES ANESTHESIA CHIEF OVER NURSES' ROLE
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief anesthesiologist at the National Naval
Medical Center was relieved of his command last week for refusing
to place specially trained nurses in charge of administering
anesthesia to some patients.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's policy of administering sleep-inducing drugs only
under the supervision of an anesthesiologist will remain in effect
for VIP patients, staff members were told. Members of Congress and
other high-ranking government officials, including the president,
receive medical care at the Bethesda, Md., hospital.
</P>
<P>
   However, other active duty personnel, retirees and their
dependents will receive the drugs from nurse-anesthetists without
the supervision of physicians specializing in anesthesiology.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and other professional staff members at the hospital
were told in a meeting Nov. 11 that Dr. Alvin Manalaysay, a Navy
captain, was being relieved of his command.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Society of Anesthesiologists said the
staff was told the action was being taken because Manalaysay
refused to carry out a command that he institute the change.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy will apply only to treatment of healthy or mildly
ill patients, physicians were told at the staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Manalaysay declined comment late Wednesday, saying that
questions about his being relieved of his command must be addressed
to the hospital's public affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital did not respond to questions about the policy
change Wednesday. A spokesman said that the hospital commander,
Rear Adm. Bonnie Potter, was in a meeting and was not available to
answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Beauregard, a civilian anesthesiologist in Washington
who left the Navy two years ago, said he was told by hospital staff
members that Potter was specifically asked at a staff meeting what
the policy would be when dignitaries are treated, and she replied
that their care would continue to be supervised by an
anesthesiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told by current active-duty anesthesiologists that
that's what the policy will be for high government officials,
high-ranking officers and physicians who are treated at Bethesda,''
Beauregard said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he left the Navy two years ago without accepting
promotion to commander, partly out of frustration at being
constantly pressured to expand the role of nurse-anesthetists. He
was chief cardiac anesthesiologist at Bethesda when he left the
Navy and remains in close contact with his former colleagues there,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This that means that Bethesda has a lower standard of care
than any other hospital in the Washington area,'' he said. ``It's
unethical and immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauregard said he was told the hospital command was attempting
to ``save money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have decided they can't justify spending the money on
anesthesiologists just to avoid a few complications,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   In denouncing the change as ``something that could not legally
happen in 49 of the 50 states,'' Dr. Ronald Mackenzie, president of
the American Society of Anesthesiologists, warned that problems
involving the use of anesthesia can happen to healthy patients
``right out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jan Stewart, president of the American
Association of Nurse-Anesthetists, said members of her profession
``are highly qualified and educated people'' who have been
delivering anesthesia on battlefields for decades without a
doctor's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   One of the findings of a 1997 Dayton Daily News investigation of
problems in military hospitals was that in some cases, nurses and
physician's assistants provide medical care that Defense Department
regulations require a doctor to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Among these were the administration of anesthesia by
unsupervised nurse-anesthetists and even student nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda, which stands across the street from the campus of
National Institutes of Health, has been called the ``crown jewel''
of Navy medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no expansion of the scope of practice here,'' said
Stewart. Certified registered nurse-anesthetists (CRNAs) handle all
phases of administration of anesthesia in 75 percent of the cases
in rural civilian hospitals in America, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``CRNAs plan what kind of anesthesia to deliver, administer the
drug, maintain the patient during surgery and oversee the
recovery,'' said Stewart, a Chicago nurse-anesthetist.
</P>
<P>
   She added that CRNAs administered anesthesia on battlefields in
Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf war and in Bosnia, ``and there's
no demonstrable difference in outcome between their care and that
of anesthesiologists.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackenzie said the change ``means that the finest young men and
women in the United States, the ones who are serving their country
in the Navy, are going to receive substandard care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a careful survey of state laws governing medical and
nursing practice, and in only one state, New Hampshire, would this
be legal,'' said Mackenzie, an anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``there is no scientific data that this (change)
is safe.''

POINTED QUESTIONS BREEZE BY BLEDSOE, CARROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Foxboro Stadium should have been called a
hard-hat area Wednesday, not so much for the planned construction
of a new stadium but rather to protect the Patriots from a supposed
falling sky after Monday night's loss 24-17 loss to the New York
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who wore only a cap on his head at his
weekly press conference, had rallied the Patriots from a 21-point
deficit to a touchdown with just under six minutes left when he
couldn't produce the equalizer in three subsequent possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was calling his own plays down the stretch, and many
wondered why he was trying to throw deep into a stiff wind rather
than stick to a short-to-intermediate range passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I've been playing, unless I'm throwing it way down
field, the wind usually doesn't effect my ball too much,'' said
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a game where I don't play to my expectations, I
look at it and see why I didn't play well, then I put it out of my
mind,'' he added. ``I have extremely high standards, so it's
disheartening when I don't play to my standards. There were some
plays that were there for us that I didn't make for us. Our defense
gave us good field position after we'd put up two scores, and to
not convert that into points was a turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll was bombarded with questions about throwing
into the teeth of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not bar his players from speaking to the media, as
did coach Jimmy Johnson following the Dolphins' loss to the Bills
last Sunday, Carroll did interrupt an interview with offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese to ask whether the media was bringing up
the ``wind thing'' again.
</P>
<P>
   He was more content to move on, while many still wanted to
rehash what could not be brought back. He was dodging not only the
sky but bullets from the Pete Carroll hate brigade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my life (after a loss like that),'' said Carroll.
``It's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There are always things to talk about after a defeat. According
to Bledsoe, the wind affected only two of his throws, one of them
an interception as he was trying to hit Shawn Jefferson down the
right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   In calling his own plays, Bledsoe was merely doing what he
likes. Winging the ball down field is part of the Zampese offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Drew is in those situations, he takes bits and pieces
from the things we feature in our offense,'' said Zampese.
``Looking deep is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the challenge now is to muster an offense against the
Dolphins, who beat the Patriots, 31-30, Oct. 17, when the Patriots
knocked out quarterback Dan Marino but could not solve the
scrambling Damon Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed under 50 percent of his passes in that game,
supported by virtually no running game, and Terry Glenn was shut
out by intermittent double coverage, with Sam Madison in particular
a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he studied films to see how he could free himself
from that double-teaming, Glenn responded: ``I don't have to watch
the films. I know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he sees a lot of merit in trying to get Glenn
involved in the offense right off the bat this week. He also agreed
that a shorter passing attack could be wise with his receiving
corps because Glenn, Shawn Jefferson, Troy Brown, Tony Simmons, and
Vincent Brisby all have the ability to elude their coverage and
make extra yards with their speed after the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get Terry involved,'' said Carroll. ``Now if
they're doing everything to stop him and it opens things up for
someone else, I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said: ``I just want us to get back to playing offense like
we were earlier in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   But back then, the Sam Madisons of the world weren't covering
him like a blanket. Add to that the fact the Dolphins' defense is
not so simple to crack, though the Bills did it last week with
their running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was nice to see someone able to do something
against them,'' said Carroll. ``It was tribute to Buffalo's
persistence and commitment to the running game. They ran it 48
times and averaged only 3.7 yards, but you could see they were able
to create some creases by the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the game in Miami, Patriots will be playing in
progressively colder weather and thus will need to be able to run
and shorten their passing game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were also concerned about springing Ben Coates for
more intermediate pass plays, though the last the Patriots and
Dolphins met, time linebacker Zach Thomas did a great job shadowing
the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   The short week will benefit the Patriots, according to offensive
tackle Bruce Armstrong, since they won't have time to dwell on the
loss to the Jets and instead will focus on the task at hand. He
also stood before the team after the loss to the Jets and addressed
the defeat, as he has been wont to do in other low points in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong even sounded the first shot against the Dolphins:
``They're getting as little mouthier. It's getting easier to
dislike them. They're leading the league in talkative
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll himself said the team moved forward to Miami Wednesday
as they took the practice field under a cold gray, still-standing
sky.

WAR IN CHECHNYA OVERSHADOWS CASPIAN PIPELINE SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After months of intense diplomatic activity, the United
States and its allies are poised to score a major victory in the
race to control the flow of billions of dollars of oil from the
Caspian Sea as a summit of 50 world leaders opens Thursday in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the war in Chechnya threatens to dominate the agenda for the
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), and cast a shadow over the expected announcement of a new
deal on building new pipelines to take oil and gas from the Caspian
basin to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions escalated Wednesday when the chief of Russia's air
force, angered by Western criticism of the Chechnya offensive, said
that nuclear-armed Russia was not a country the West could push
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to remind them _ Russia is not Iraq, nor is it
Yugoslavia. There you have it. We will deal decisively with any
interference. Let them not think we are totally impotent,'' Colonel
General Anatoly Kornukov told reporters in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   To ram home the point, Russia has in recent days tested a new
submarine-launched missile and threatened to send nuclear bombers
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That dims the celebration of an expected agreement on building a
multibillion-dollar pipeline across Turkey from the oil fields of
the Caspian Sea. The 1,240-mile pipeline would travel from the
Azerbaijani capital, Baku, through Georgia to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would kill the possibility of a pipeline passing
through Iran, and would defeat an alternative Russian proposal to
send Caspian oil past Chechnya across Russia's embattled North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Winning approval for the Baku-Ceyhan route has long been a
priority of the Clinton administration, which sees the pipeline as
a way to help diminish Russia's influence over the landlocked
former Soviet states of Central Asia and the Transcaucasus. If the
most optimistic projections of the amount of Caspian oil pan out,
the pipeline could also possibly diminish US dependence on oil from
the Middle East in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with losing the race for control of oil and gas routes in
the Caucasus, Russia has turned up the heat in other areas,
threatening to block pacts on European Security and conventional
arms limitations _ two issues that will be affected by a large
Russian military presence in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia, also responding to the Western criticism of the way
its military is bombarding what it calls ``Islamic terrorists'' in
Chechnya, has lashed out with bellicose statements accusing
Washington of trying to muscle Moscow out of the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya will also take precedence over planned discussions of
other regional conflicts that threaten stability in the regions to
be traversed by the planned pipeline, such as the separatist
Georgian region of Abkhazia, and the ethnic-Armenian enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for a US-backed peace deal between Armenia and
Azerbaijan were dimmed by the assassination last month of eight
leading Armenian politicians. It was a grim reminder of the
inherent instability of the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, US officials see a reduced role for Moscow as an
ingredient for greater stability, although in public remarks the
Clinton administration says it encourages Russian involvement in
Caspian oil pipeline deals.
</P>
<P>
   Oil exports from the region have traditionally moved by pipeline
across the Caucasus and through Chechnya to Russian ports on the
Black Sea, a setup that ensured Russian control over the region.
But since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the newly
independent Caspian states have sought export routes as a way of
solidifying their freedom from Moscow, a process the United States
and its NATO ally Turkey have actively backed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion in Chechnya has badly weakened Russia's designs
for the region _ many observers saw the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya
as motivated by the race for control over oil routes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Western governments and relief organizations accuse
Russia of indiscriminate violence against civilians and causing a
humanitarian catastrophe in its latest campaign in Chechnya, Moscow
leaders retaliate by accusing the West of conspiring to keep Russia
out of the contest for Caspian riches.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev accused
Washington of trying to oust Moscow from ``strategically important
regions of the world, above all the Caspian region, the
Transcaucasus and Central Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it will not stop its campaign in Chechnya until it
wipes out separatist militants it blames for attacks on neighboring
Russian regions and for a series of deadly apartment blasts that
killed 300 people in Russia last summer. The rebels deny
involvement in the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia and Azerbaijan, former Soviet republics in the
Transcaucasus, are worried the fighting in Chechnya will spread
south into their territories. Wednesday, Georgia's military accused
Russia of sending three helicopters to mine its border with
Chechnya. This came after the Russian military recently sought and
was refused permission to open a new front against Chechnya from
Georgian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is still putting pressure on Azerbaijan to reject the
Baku-Ceyhan route in favor of a new pipeline that would travel
across Russian territory north of Chechnya. But the plan carries
little favor in Baku.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, Russia's brutal carnage in Chechnya and clear
desire to dominate the Caucasus have reinforced the urgency of
developing a route independent from Russia,'' an Azeri diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still the question of whether the Caspian holds the 200
billion barrels of oil predicted after the fall of the Soviet Union
_ second only to the Persian Gulf _ or the more modest 20 billion
barrels specialists estimate these days.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, with oil prices at 25-year lows, the pipeline looked
like a bad deal. But with crude prices more than doubling in the
past 10 months, the project is alive again, with the backing of
British Petroleum-Amoco and a promise by Turkey to pick up the
extra cost if building the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline exceeds the planned
$2.4 billion.

POPE PLANNING TO VISIT MIDDLE EAST IN MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to fulfill Pope John Paul II's longstanding
desire to visit biblical sites during a Holy Year, the Vatican
announced Wednesday that he will visit the Middle East next March.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope has long expressed a desire to visit the
Holy Land in the year 2,000, which is both the start of a new
millennium and a jubilee year for the Roman Catholic Church. He has
received invitations from both Israeli and Palestinian authorities,
but papal planning has been roiled by disagreements between local
Catholic clergy and Israeli and Palestinian officials, most notably
in Nazareth, where the Israeli government recently gave permission
to Muslim leaders to build a mosque next to the city's main
Catholic shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials described that decision as an affront to
Christian pilgrims and unacceptable. The major churches in the Holy
Land have said they will shut for two days in November to protest
the proposed mosque. It is still not clear how the pope's
representatives will finesse that impasse.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the Vatican Wednesday, Archbishop
Crescenzio Sepe, who is in charge of the church's millennium
celebrations, stayed clear of firm details, saying that the trip is
expected to take place during the last 10 days of March, and will
probably include stops in Jerusalem and Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   The stooped and frail Pope, who suffers the symptoms of
Parkinson's Disease, has often prayed publicly for the strength to
guide the church into the third millennium. But the Vatican,
apparently concerned about how his grueling millennium plans could
affect his health, has quietly scaled back the number of public
appearances in Rome during the jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vatican officials had said the pope would be seen every
day. But in Wednesday's news conference, the Vatican issued a new,
definitive calendar of 80 official appearances during the Holy
Year, which the church begins on Dec. 24, 1999, and ends on Jan. 6,
2001, the day of the Epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once and a while, there will be a greeting by the pope
but it won't be every day,'' Sepe explained. ``There will be a
papal blessing but that doesn't mean that the pope will appear
every night.'' He added that if people expected the pope to make an
appearance every day, ``it would mean we don't love the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other political difficulties still thwarting the
pope's dream. To usher in the third millennium, the pope had hoped
to visit holy sites from both the Old and New Testaments. A top
Vatican official recently explained that the pope has a ``mystical,
almost romantic'' attachment to the Holy Land pilgrimage, and was
determined to respect chronological order.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul had hoped to begin his spiritual journey with a stop
at Ur, the city in Iraq that is believed to be the birthplace of
the patriarch Abraham. But that trip, tentatively planned for
December, remains uncertain as Vatican officials negotiate
conditions for the visit with the government of Saddam Hussein. The
State Department, which fears that a papal visit could lend
legitimacy to the Iraqi leader, asked Vatican officials to
reconsider the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican rejected Washington's arguments, insisting that the
pope's only interest was in making a religious pilgrimage. But that
has been held up by Iraqi officials, who have their own
reservations about the impact of a visit from a pope who has rarely
visited a country without preaching on the importance of respecting
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican advance team is expected to fly to Baghdad soon to
determine whether the Iraq visit can take place. The pope would
also like to visit Mount Sinai in Egypt, where Moses, according to
tradition, received the Ten Commandments.The pope then planned on
visiting Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Jerusalem, the cities associated
with the birth, childhood and crucifixion of Jesus. Bethlehem is
under Palestinian self-rule, Nazareth is the largest Arab city in
Israel, and Jerusalem is under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Paul VI visited the Holy Land in 1964, when the Old City of
Jerusalem was still under the control of Jordan. Like most states,
the Vatican has not recognized the Israeli claim to all of
Jerusalem, which is among the issues now being negotiated between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry welcomed the Vatican's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hope that this visit is going to reinvigorate and
support the spirit of peace and reconciliation between religions
and the peoples of the Middle East,'' said Effie Ben-Matityahu, a
ministry spokesman.

THALIDOMIDE, ONCE PARIAH DRUG, A BOON IN CANCER THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drug thalidomide, which was banned in the United States
after it caused serious birth defects in 10,000 babies worldwide
four decades ago, can produce dramatic improvements in people with
a cancer of the bone marrow, according to a study being published
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study is a ``significant advance'' in treatment for myeloma,
Dr. Kenneth Anderson, a myeloma specialist at Boston's Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Myeloma, a cancer that arises in the bone marrow and that crowds
out normal tissue so that the marrow can no longer make healthy
blood cells, is diagnosed in almost 14,000 Americans a year. It is
``notoriously difficult'' to treat, Anderson said in an editorial
accompanying the report in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Typically, only 29 percent of people diagnosed with it survive for
five years, despite treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, done at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences, involved 84 patients who had relapsed despite aggressive
treatment, including marrow transplants and high-dose chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   When given thalidomide in doses of up to 800 milligrams a day,
32 percent of patients improved at least somewhat, as gauged by
lower levels of a myeloma-related protein in blood or urine tests.
Two patients had complete remissions, meaning that their cancer was
undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   One year after starting treatment, about 22 percent of patients
were alive without relapse; a total of 58 percent were alive,
although some had progression of cancer. It is not clear how long
the responses had lasted, although in some cases, the responses
appeared to be ``durable,'' Anderson and his co-author, Dr. Noopur
Raje, said in the editorial.
</P>
<P>
   The lead researcher, Dr. Seema Singhal, formerly in Arkansas and
now codirector of the myeloma and lymphoma program at the South
Carolina Cancer Center at the University of South Carolina, said in
a telephone interview that ``the results are extremely
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``You kind of like to believe in magic, and once in a
while it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic might be a description of thalidomide, because, at least
in myeloma, scientists are less sure now about how it might work
than they were when the study began.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Singhal and her colleagues decided to try thalidomide
because it is an angiogenesis inhibitor, meaning it can block the
chemical signals that trigger formation of blood vessels around
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   But in this study, many patients who responded to thalidomide
did not show a reduction in the density of blood vessels that
nourish tumors in the bone marrow. That could merely be a sampling
problem: Every time a doctor conducts a biopsy on a small piece of
bone marrow to study, there is a chance that the section sampled
has more, or fewer, cancer cells and blood vessels than the rest of
the marrow.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, said Anderson of Dana-Farber, it may also be
that thalidomide is acting in other ways. For instance, it may
directly attack myeloma cells, or the so-called stromal cells of
the marrow on which they grow. It might work by keeping myeloma
cells from attaching to stroma cells. It might block chemical
signals that help myeloma cells grow. Or it might nudge T-cells to
attack myeloma cells.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that thalidomide not only seems to work in advanced
myeloma but that it also may have several ways of acting is part of
the excitement, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   After it was banned by the US Food and Drug Administration in
the 1960s because it caused birth defects in the babies of pregnant
women, who took it for morning sickness, thalidomide was approved
last year for a type of leprosy.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug, made by Celgene, was approved with severe
restrictions, including the stipulation that every person, male or
female, who uses it must be enrolled in a government-monitored
registry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only doctors who have received training may
prescribe it. Because it can cause birth defects, women must
undergo pregnancy tests before using the drug, and both men and
women must agree to use contraception.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, once a drug is approved for one use, it may
legally be prescribed for others as well. In addition to its
promise in myeloma, thalidomide is also being studied as a
treatment for AIDS-related ulcers and a virulent type of brain
tumor called a glioblastoma.

STILL SAVORING THE OVERTHROW OF CZECHOSLOVAK COMMUNISM 10 YEARS
LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALISON SMALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ This was a day for the has-beens, the
have-nots, the still-haves and the never-have-hads to come together
and remember the good times. And for people here, what times those
were!
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Wednesday Czechoslovakia was giddy with righteous
resistance and rose up to overthrow communism so swiftly and
smoothly that the people called it the Velvet Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming that ``truth and love must prevail over lies and
hatred,'' the playwright Vaclav Havel emerged from the oppression
and obscurity of dissent to run the revolution from the stage of
the Magic Lantern theater, and then, in a fairy-tale ending to a
magical month, moved into Prague's Castle as president.
</P>
<P>
   If the magic has since dissolved, its power could still be felt
Wednesday, as Czechs and Slovaks _ now citizens of different
nations _ savored anew their heady revolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was once in a lifetime,'' said Jan Bubenik, one of the
leaders of the Prague students, whose confrontation with Communist
riot policemen on Nov. 17, 1989, began the uprising, bringing to
Czechoslovakia the changes that had then already swept Poland and
Hungary and broke down the Berlin wall. ``Once in my life, I had a
moment when I knew exactly what was good and what was evil. It will
never come again, because now everything is sort of gray. But back
then I really felt like the knight on his white charger.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bubenik was speaking Wednesday at one of the many commemorations
organized by students, the revolution's leaders and their foreign
friends to commemorate the end of communism. Margaret Thatcher
unveiled a statue of Winston Churchill. President Bush, who
celebrated the first anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in
Prague, received an honorary doctorate at Charles University and
lauded what he called the transformed world that has emerged from
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In the improbably grand surroundings of the vast Prague Castle,
Havel joined Bush; Mrs. Thatcher; Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former
Soviet president; Germany's former Chancellor Helmut Kohl; his
fellow dissident and ex-President Lech Walesa of Poland; and
Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of former French President Francois
Mitterrand, in a reminiscence about the revolt and the
circumstances that forged it. Then he awarded them his country's
highest honor, the Order of the White Lion.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the Cafe Slavia, haunt of Czech men and women of words since
the last century, Havel joined a handful of reporters who covered
the revolution 10 years ago, and reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution went so fast, he said, that he cannot define his
favorite moment. Three events stood out, however: the resignation
on Nov. 24, 1989, of the ruling Politburo; a protest the following
day of some half a million people on Letna field, long the
Communists' preserve and favorite parade ground; and then the
announcement that the Communist Party had simply abandoned the
leading role it had written into the Constitution for 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the mass demonstration, Havel said, ``that I felt in
my mind that this really was the breaking point, because we had
always had to consider the possibility of a confrontation _ and
there I got the clear impression that there was not going to be
one.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was none: the neo-Stalinists who had expelled half
a million Communists from the party after the Soviet Union led an
invasion in 1968 to crush the Prague Spring reforms of Alexander
Dubcek gave up this time with barely a whimper. When the Politburo
stepped down that Friday night, Nov. 24, the shouting was left to
the tens of thousands who danced and drank beer on Wenceslas
Square, and to Havel and Dubcek on stage at the Magic Lantern,
toasting the Reds' departure with pink champagne.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mood has soured in the decade since: the country has split,
the economic surge that came with capitalism has petered out into
stagnation. Czech unemployment, at 6 percent, is low but rising.
Much remains unfinished and imperfect, and the pall cast by high
hopes unrealized permeated even Wednesday's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communist regime got into our pores, and it's very hard to
get rid of that,'' concluded Pavel Zacek, another leader of
Prague's students in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vaclav Maly, who introduced Havel and the other speakers who
electrified the crowds of November 1989, is now the Roman Catholic
bishop of Prague. He recalled the raw energy that came a decade ago
from those masses, but reflected that the revolution was actually
``too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like to hear that,'' he said, still _ like Havel
_ possessed of an almost boyish grin and engaging passion. ``People
don't want to change. They expect always a messiah, a savior. But
the savior won't come.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, if things are not quite what many hoped they would be,
very few Czechs _ even the 18 percent who now say they would vote
Communist _ say they would turn the clock right back to the days
when they had to fill out dozens of forms simply to get a paltry
amount of hard currency, or to make a coveted trip next door to
West Germany or Austria, or watched their own lives ruined and
their children denied study and other opportunities if they dared
to dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution ``is the best thing that could have happened to
us,'' said Eva Hadkova, 29. ``When I look at my parents, basically,
their lives were almost wasted, much different than they could have
had. But I have no problem _ even though I know a lot of people are
complaining _ I can get a very good job, I can travel.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vladimir Valenta, 45, a janitor, said he lived better before the
revolution but still wouldn't turn back the clock. ``We keep
forgetting that things I now see on the street every day _ a good
car, a decent piece of clothing _ we could see only perhaps once
every half a year,'' he said. He said that standing on Wenceslas
Square 10 years ago was a drunken high without alcohol, ``better
than a rock concert,'' giving an unreal sensation of power, both
for the crowds and the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in one of the most tangible signs of the change the
revolution wrought, its makers are scattered in many different
careers and fields, and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One who was absent Wednesday from Prague was Jiri Dienstbier,
who shared jail terms with Havel and emerged from the revolution as
his foreign minister. Now a lecturer in the United States and the
U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the former Yugoslavia,
Dienstbier acknowledged that many expectations were dashed in the
past decade, but rejoiced that his people are now part of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people started coming to me after 1989, asking me `What
can I do for you?' I always told them to take as many young people
as possible to your universities, to give them a different
perspective, because everything was closed here.'' Even the
dissidents had to learn, taking high office in their 50s, ``things
we should have learned at 25,'' Dienstbier said. ``Even if a lot of
things were spoiled in these 10 years, these young people will be a
totally different generation. This is a fantastic basic change. If
that was the only success of all we did, it made it worthwhile to
do it.''

 &HT;    BUDGET DEAL OFFERS PUBLIC-SCHOOL CHOICE
 &HT;    FIGURES FOR COX STATES START AFTER GRAF 6
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tens of thousands of parents would win the right to
transfer their children from failing public schools to a better
public or charter school under the budget deal negotiated between
President Clinton and leaders of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators set aside $134 million in new federal funds to
help schools that perform badly despite help from Title I funds,
which go to about 46,000 schools with low-income students. But, in
return, the school districts would be required to offer transfers
to all students in any Title I school graded as low-performing for
two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders and administration Democrats
defended the new policy against an attack Wednesday by 20 national
associations of local and state educators and education officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mandate is inconsistent with the current effort to
provide more state and local flexibility in use of federal
education funds,'' said the letter from the 20 groups. Their
members include state school superintendents, big-city school
superintendents, elementary and secondary school principals and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department spokeswoman Erica Lepping responded that
the administration agreed to the deal because ``we had some
frustration with low-performing schools that have failed
continuously and are not improving.''
</P>

   ``School choice is finally poised to become a reality for
thousands of students stuck in substandard learning environments,''
said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce. ``Republicans in Congress have been
looking forward to this day for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some districts offer transfers, but others rely on
different school-improvement techniques, such as retraining or
replacing the staff of a low-performing school.
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials fear that transportation costs for
students transferring to schools far from their homes would use up
most or all of the new money, leaving nothing for improvement of
the failing schools. Others envision a flurry of lawsuits from
parents whose children aren't transferred if crowding at the better
schools forces a limit on the number of transfers.
</P>
<P>
   School officials and teachers were not reassured by Goodling's
statement that, since the plan specifies that required transfers
must conform with state law, it ``is not a mandate.'' They fear
that the federal law would prevail over state laws whenever the two
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very unhappy, but at this point it would take a nuclear

director for the Council of Great City Schools.

   In their letter, the 20 groups asked Congress to reject the deal
and strip the provision from the $35.7 billion education spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The administration opposes that, Lepping said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $134 million wouldn't be distributed until July 1 of next
year, which will give us plenty of time to work with schools,
school districts and states to figure out ways to address their
concerns,'' she said.

`DIFFERENCES' COMPLICATE EFFORT TO EXTEND IRAQI OIL FOR FOOD
PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ What the United States hoped would be a quick
and painless renewal of the program under which Iraq sells limited
amounts of oil to pay for goods to relieve civilian hardships
turned into complicated negotiations when Russia proposed changes
favorable to Iraq on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The extension of the ``oil for food'' program for another six
months requires Security Council action by the end of the week.
American diplomats hoped that approval would be more or less
automatic, so that the council could concentrate on the larger
issue of agreeing on a new arms inspection system for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Until Iraq meets disarmament obligations by proving that its
prohibited biological, chemical, nuclear and missile systems have
been destroyed, international sanctions remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   That larger agreement has no deadline, and the council is now in
its sixth month of debating how to replace the U.N. Special
Commission with another inspection system that all five permanent
members can force Iraq to accept. The government of President
Saddam Hussein has already rejected a draft version.
</P>
<P>
   The five permanent council members _ Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States _ have been meeting daily to narrow
differences, but an accord is still weeks away, if not longer,
diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't there yet,'' Peter Burleigh, the American
representative working on the Iraq issue, told reporters Wednesday.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative, said there were
``significant differences'' among the five.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands, which now holds a rotating council seat, and
Britain are co-sponsors of the resolution being discussed. It
proposes a suspension, not removal, of sanctions when Iraq
demonstrates its compliance with disarmament requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the five permanent members are far apart on issues including
how to decide when Iraq is in compliance, and for how long
sanctions may be suspended before the situation is reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat who has followed the largely secret talks
said that the real challenge now is to convince Iraq that the
Security Council can find a consensus that will hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise Iraq will say: `The council is divided; we are not
interested,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Arab diplomat said that the old inspection system could lead
to a removal of sanctions. They look at the new proposal, this
diplomat added, and see only a suspension after meeting the same
goals.
</P>
<P>
   On the extension of the oil for food program, under which Iraq
earned more than $7 billion in oil sales in the six-month period
now ending, Russia is trying to introduce changes. They would relax
restrictions on air travel, double the amount of money allowed for
spending to upgrade the Iraqi oil industry and generally allow Iraq
more flexibility with available funds.
</P>
<P>
   American officials would like to keep all discussion about
substantive changes out of the debate on the oil for food
extension.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Security Council heard a report Wednesday from Benon Sevan,
who coordinates and directs the Iraqi oil for food program at U.N.
headquarters. Sevan again told the council of concerns about the
number of contracts for Iraq purchases put on hold in the sanctions
committee, where the United States frequently raises questions
about items Iraq wants to buy abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent the council a report this week
that was largely positive in assessing the progress of the program,
which has now delivered 12 million tons of food to Iraq over three
years, $729 million in medicines and medical equipment, as well as
agricultural supplies and material needed to repair basic services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the enormous humanitarian difficulties faced
by the Iraqi people,'' Annan said in the report, ``the program
continues to have a positive impact.'' He noted that Iraq had
reduced some of the stockpiles of medicines and other goods stored
in warehouses. Special food supplements for new mothers and young
children are beginning to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also says said that Iraq has been slow in
ordering long-term essential goods such as materials necessary for
water and sanitation improvements and is still not providing a high
enough daily caloric intake in rations distributed through the
program. Because of high world oil prices, Iraq now has more money
than at any time since the program began.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was critical of the Iraqis for curtailing the freedom of
the United Nations to monitor the distribution of imported civilian
goods by not making Iraqi escorts available.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. staff members cannot travel around freely or alone in areas
of Iraq controlled by the government in Baghdad. There is more
freedom of movement in Kurdish areas, where U.N. agencies
distribute goods and conduct regular surveys.

YELTSIN SAYS HE'LL SIGN ARMS PACT US SENATE REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ Trumping President Clinton on the eve of a summit
with 54 heads of state, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin
Wednesday declared he would sign a global arms control treaty the
US Senate rejected last month.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was the latest in a series of Russian moves that
could blunt expected widespread criticism Thursday of Yeltsin and
his nation's indiscriminate bombing campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It also embarrasses Clinton before his European allies. Clinton
desperately wanted US approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
but the US Senate rejected the pact last month, depriving him of a
foreign policy highlight as president.
</P>
<P>
   European and other world leaders vehemently denounced the Senate
rejection of the treaty, which would ban nuclear weapons testing
worldwide. The United States has been operating under a voluntary
ban on testing, and will continue to do so, White House officials
insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly welcome ratification by the Duma _ or the
Congress _ of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' National
Security Advisor Sandy Berger told reporters after Yeltsin's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement changes the tone of the meeting of the
Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the region's
primary trouble-shooter on non-military issues.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's bombing of Chechnya has made it the bad boy of the
OSCE. President Clinton, set to meet one-on-one with Yeltsin, has
been prepared to chide Russia for what Clinton describes as an
unwarranted killing of civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders are expected to express their dismay also with
Russia's behavior in Chechnya. One European leader, Estonian
President Lennart Meri, is boycotting the OSCE meeting because he
is frustrated with the organization's inability so far to solve the
Chechnya issue.
</P>
<P>
   Russia may also be asked about its apparent breach of the treaty
on Conventional Forces in Europe, which limits military force
levels. Russia has already notified OSCE that it has exceeded its
approved levels with its operation in the northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The breach comes at a time when the OSCE is planning to update
the document to reflect a post-Cold War world. The treaty is now
arranged to maintain a balance of forces between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact. Since the Warsaw Pact no longer exists, and three
former Soviet-sphere countries _ Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic _ are now in NATO, the treaty must be changed, Berger
said. The new document, if approved, would set limits on a
country-by-country basis, instead of a territorial basis.
</P>
<P>
   The three items together put Russia in the hot seat at the
summit. But Berger said the group was not ``ganging up'' on Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think virtually everybody here wants Russia to succeed in
its transition'' to a democratic, economically stable,
post-communist nation, Berger said. ``I don't think it's a question
of ganging up. It's a question of expressing some concern. The
international community has a right to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, making a rare foreign trip, arrived in Turkey Wednesday
on the defensive, saying Russia was well within its rights to fight
against what Yeltsin describes as terrorist forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope everybody will understand that Russia is acting in
Chechnya in accord with international civilian rules and norms,''
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechnya crisis is as bureaucratically difficult for the
OSCE as it is diplomatically sensitive. Since the group operates on
a consensus basis, Russia must approve any resolution for it to
take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the OSCE does is aimed at countries like Russia.
The organization mediates internal conflicts and promotes
democracy, free speech and human rights _ all issues Russia has
tangled with in its transition from communism to a market economy
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is struggling to finesse the issue with Yeltsin,
making its anger over Chechnya clear while not isolating Russia
from the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tricky,'' said a senior Clinton administration official.
There are worries that Yeltsin might clam up under verbal siege,
and the bilateral meeting between Yeltsin and Clinton would produce
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope not,'' said David Johnson, the American ambassador to
OSCE. ``But it has the potential to.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior administration official said he could not speculate
on what, if anything, might come out of the bilateral meeting
between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing,'' the official said, ``as a predictable
meeting with Yeltsin.''

TREASURY PRICES FALL FOR A SECOND SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices fell for the second consecutive
session Wednesday after the Labor Department reported that the rise
in consumer prices in October met expectations. And for market
participants, it left the door open for another increase in
short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve should inflation
accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1, to 99 29/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to
6.13 percent from 6.06 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The economic statistics released Wednesday were somewhat
anticlimactic, some market participants said, because the data came
on the heels of the Fed's decision on Tuesday to raise the Federal
funds rate for the third time since June.
</P>
<P>
   October's Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent, the smallest
rise in the last four months, which kept the year-over-year
increase to 2.6 percent, economists said. While the rate of
increase in consumer prices did not accelerate, it is still higher
than the 1.6 percent pace seen last year.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
noted that the 2.1 percent year-over-year increase in the core rate
was a touch higher than the 2 percent rise seen in September, which
in turn rose from the 1.9 percent August reading, all of which
suggests that the core rate of consumer price inflation may have
already hit its low point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Housing starts in October rose a barely perceptible 0.1
percent and seem to have plateaued since April,'' he noted. ``But
there is virtually no evidence to date that would indicate housing
activity has begun a cyclical decline, and it's instructive to note
that slowdowns in aggregate economic decline are invariably
preceded by cyclical fall-offs in housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said the housing starts data confirmed that the housing sector had
peaked from the highs recorded earlier this year. ``Nevertheless,
single-family starts remained strong, pointing to continued strong
spending on housing items,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The housing sector is clearly not dead yet,'' said Sherry
Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities. ``The recent
dip in mortgage rates has rekindled housing activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings analysts back to the interest rate increase by the
Federal Open Market Committee. ``The Fed's tightening move was
accompanied by both a shift to a neutral bias and a market
expectation that the FOMC will keep policy on hold for quite some
time,'' Fine said. ``But the prudent bond market assumption is that
the next Fed move will be another tightening unless economic data
suggest otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The realization that the Fed is acutely aware of, and ready to
act against, potential inflationary consequences of excessive
economic growth has brought the recent bond market rally to a
screeching halt,'' Fine said, ``and together with an overbought
situation and looming corporate supply has produced today's
negative tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate deals are coming to market for investors seeking
to add yield offered by nongovernment debt because they think gains
in Treasury securities are limited. Among them are Lockheed Martin
Corp., the giant aerospace company, which is planning to price $2.5
billion of debt Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, managed through Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and J.P. Morgan
Securities, will be in three parts: $750 million of six-year notes
that are expected to offer a yield 190 to 195 basis points over a
comparable Treasury; $750 million of 10-year notes, with yields
about 215 to 220 basis points over a comparable Treasury, and $1
billion of 30-year bonds yielding about 225 basis points over a
comparable Treasury. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.

AMWEST (Phoenix) - America West, the worst on-time of the 10 major
airlines, continues to be plauged by operations problems with a
rash of cancellations delaying thousands passengers. That's bad
news for travelers heading into the Thanksgiving holiday travel
period, busiest of the year. Reports indicated that the FAA has
cracked down on the airline and is no longer granting extensions on
scheduled maintenance, which has forced planes to be taken out of
service. As a result, hundreds of flights have been canceled over

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The managers at Vivid Studios, a Web site
consulting firm here, are accustomed to calls from employment
recruiters trying to poach their technical staff. But the day a
suitor telephoned looking for Nevil was a new low.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid's receptionist assured the recruiter that it would be
difficult to put Nevil on the line. And with good reason. Nevil is
a black Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the booming technology-based economy, companies'
long-standing scramble for qualified technical workers has taken on
an air of desperation lately. A severe shortage of engineers who
design hardware and software and create Web pages has led companies
and their recruiters to try all sorts of tricks, like the
Nevil-seeking entrepreneur who called each name listed on Vivid
Studio's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters are known to send e-mail to all the engineers at a
company, offering to better their existing salaries. At dawn,
recruiters scour Internet job-placement services to plumb the most
recently posted resumes before a competitor makes contact. At
restaurants, they pull business cards from fish bowls where
engineers had placed the cards hoping to get a free lunch, not a
job offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to a funeral recently, and a friend said, `Don't
recruit,' and I said, `Yeah, I won't do it,''' said Noelle Tardieu,
a recruiter who works under contract for Silicon Valley companies.
Weddings are another matter: Ms. Tardieu says she reads the
marriage announcements in the newspaper to find names and titles of
prospective recruits.
</P>
<P>
   So it follows that the heavily courted engineers and other
technology-savvy employees are cashing in. Salaries in specific,
high-demand areas, like Web site programming and development, have
gone up 18 to 20 percent in the last year, said Eric Campbell, vice
president for human relations at Docent Inc. of Mountain View,
Calif., which makes software for corporate training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wind up, six months after we hire an engineer, having to
fight off offers for that same engineer for more money,'' he said.
``It's become a very predatory environment.''
</P>
<P>
   One big change in recent years is the extent to which stock
options have become part of the package. Fifty percent of junior
technical employees now have stock options, up from 35 percent
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To seal deals, recruiters offer candidates overseas airline
tickets, ramp up vacation time to four or five weeks from the usual
two weeks for starting employees or toss in 11th-hour signing
bonuses that can range from $5,000 to $20,000. Other perquisites
now seem commonplace: Employees can redesign offices or cubicles,
bring pets to work, work at home and dress casually _ even at
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time recruiters and compensation experts say the scramble
for talent is the most intense they have ever experienced. ``It's a
free agent market and the folks out there know it,'' said Mark
Edwards, president of iQuantic, a compensation consulting firm in
San Francisco. ``I haven't ever seen companies be more flexible in
how they attract and retain folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The fervent demand for technology employees often funnels down
to the recruiters, where it comes out in a spigot of offers,
cajoling, creativity, relationship building and, occasionally,
ambulance chasing. Indeed, when the rare layoffs do occur at a
company involved in a merger or suffering a downturn, recruiters
wait in the parking lot to scoop up the discards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bag 'em and tag 'em,'' said Sandra C. Chroman, a recruiter
in Silicon Valley who says recruiters are ``fighting over junior
techs in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I joke that I keep engineers bound and gagged in my trunk and
just drive around the high-tech companies and drop them off on the
lawn,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If only it was that easy. Ms. Chroman said she had heard all the
tricks of the trade and used a few of them herself. One tactic, she
said, is to walk into high-technology companies, make friends with
the receptionist through small talk, explain she wants to send
everyone in the company a mailer and then ``walk out with a company
phone list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Receptionists will give you people's home phone numbers,'' Ms.
Chroman said. ``It's amazing what some people will give you.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately Ms. Chroman, like many other recruiters, is looking
outside northern California for talent, notably at companies and
universities in Canada and Mexico, where engineering candidates are
not in such demand as they are here. In addition, thanks to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, their citizens are not
required to obtain visas.
</P>
<P>
   Another place increasingly visited by recruiters is cyberspace.
A technology-savvy lot, engineers looking for better offers post
their resumes on a growing number of Internet job services, like
monster.com, where recruiters in turn look for the latest talent
that may be willing to switch employers. ``I check it every morning
at 6,'' said Mara Flores, a contract recruiter for Fujitsu
Software, who said she also used a program called a ``Web crawler''
to search the Internet for newly posted resumes from engineers.
</P>
<P>
   But if demand for engineers has been tough on companies, it has
been good for the recruiting business. Well over 1,000 recruiters
operate in Silicon Valley, Ms. Tardieu estimated, a number that
includes freelance recruiters, recruiters who work for agencies and
contractors who sign on with specific companies. Ms. Flores said it
was not uncommon for an aggressive recruiter, even with only a few
years of experience, to earn $100,000 to $200,000 a year.

   The leeway given to recruiters by their client companies varies.
Some companies conduct the financial discussions themselves; in
other cases, they provide some flexibility, or recruiters insist
upon it _ in working out signing bonuses, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   And despite some seeming cutthroat tactics, the recruiters
appear to treat one another cordially, even with a sense of
brotherhood. There are few stories of back-stabbing. Recruiters say
they rarely hear of competitors bad mouthing one another or using
dirty tricks to steal a candidate. More often, the battle simply
comes down to who can best marry a willing candidate with a job
opening and enticing benefit package.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is not confined to Silicon Valley, with at least
350,000 openings nationwide for programmers, systems analysts and
computer scientists and engineers, according to a 1998 study by
Virginia Tech University and the Information Technology Association
of America, a trade group. Today, the association reports, one of
every 10 information technology jobs remains unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same trouble in Boston, New York, Dallas and
Chicago,'' said Campbell of Docent Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent job fair in Mountain View, in the heart of Silicon
Valley, Hewlett Packard said it had hundreds of jobs available in
the Bay Area and thousands worldwide. The story echoed at booth
after booth of prospective employers; easels and binders full of
jobs, from administrative assistant to patent attorney, but mostly
engineers. A sign at the booth of Kaiser Electronics, a military
contractor, sought to lure candidates with the promise of ``Every
Other Friday Off.''
</P>
<P>
   For the candidates, the experience can be both flattering and
overwhelming. Samir A. Batla, 29, worked as an engineer at Ernst &AMP;
Young in San Francisco until he decided four months ago that he
wanted a new job. He posted his resume on monster.com and within
days had heard from 11 recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Various sales pitches ensued, and the price tag escalated. Batla
expected to earn a salary in the range of $70,000 to $80,000, but
he found his sticker price soon soared to $85,000 to $100,000. He
said he was offered stock option packages that could have made him
a millionaire if the company went public and its stock continued to
climb.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The recruiters sought to sell him on intangibles, too. Some
tried to sell him on the value of working at a smaller company,
others at a larger, more established office. They talked to him
about the culture of the prospective workplace, and this turned out
to be an important hook for Batla, who said money was only one
criterion. Another was attire.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I wouldn't work at any company if I had to dress up
for the interview,'' Batla said. Ultimately, he settled on Vivid
Studios, the Web design company. ``To the interview, I wore blue
jeans and a collared shirt _ what do you call those, polo shirts?''
he said. The people interviewing him, he said, ``were wearing
shorts, T-shirts and sandals _ I felt overdressed.'' He took the
job with the title of senior engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid Studios, onetime home of Nevil, the Labrador retriever,
also knows what it is like to lose employees. The dog's owner, Dan
Lederer, 40, quit Vivid recently to pursue a quieter life with his
family in Plainfield, Mass., population 550.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer, a Web site designer who said he was hounded by
recruiters while working at Vivid, is now free-lancing and says he
seems to have found a recruiter-free zone in the Berkshires. ``If
you don't want to be called, it's nice to be out here,'' he said.
Still, Lederer said he wouldn't mind hearing from a recruiter who
could offer him a job with money, benefits and one other
perquisite: permission to work remotely from his home on 13
secluded acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the pay, and the whole scenario working out, yeah,
sure,'' he would entertain offers, he said. These days, it might
not seem too much to demand; he and Nevil may be getting more
offers than they can handle.

MINISTER EXONERATED IN CHILD SPANKING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' highest court has ruled that a minister
did not abuse his handicapped son when he spanked him with a belt
and that the state Department of Social Services was wrong to label
him a child abuser.
</P>
<P>
   In a case closely watched by advocates and opponents of corporal
punishment, the Supreme Judicial Court ordered the Rev. Donald R.
Cobble Jr. of Woburn removed from a state registry of child
abusers. However, the court sidestepped the thorny legal issue
underlying Cobble's case: His claim that he had a constitutionally
protected right to discipline his child according to his religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The court criticized DSS for finding that Cobble had abused his
then-9-year-old son, Judah, by striking him on his clothed buttocks
with the soft end of a belt, saying the determination violated the
department's definition of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The child, the court noted, suffered only temporary ``pink
marks,'' not the sort of severe physical injuries that DSS labels
as abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not judge this present case to be a close one,'' Justice
Neil L. Lynch wrote in the judicial equivalent of a harsh scolding.
``The effects of'' Cobble's ``physical discipline did not satisfy
the department's own regulatory definitions of physical injury or
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the court stressed it was not giving blanket approval to
corporal punishment, pointing out that using a belt on a child in
other circumstances might clearly be abusive.
</P>
<P>
   The court admonished the DSS to do a better job of determining
when a parent has veered over the line from ``permissible physical
discipline'' to child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Cobble's attorney, Chester A. Darling, said he was disappointed
that the court did not address the underlying constitutional issues
dealing with parents' religious and privacy rights. ``That broke my
heart,'' he said. ``I had hoped they would decide that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobble, an associate pastor at the Christian Teaching and
Worship Center in Woburn, said he was pleased to shed the stigma of
child abuser after two years. The case began in 1997 when Judah's
teacher reported to the DSS that there was a possibility the boy
was being abused by his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is an agency that overstepped its bounds,''
he said. ``I just hope that people will wake up now and speak out
and say we need to change some things here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobble as well as the SJC noted that the DSS closed its file on
Judah after they substantiated the abuse report. If the DSS
believed Judah was being abused, his father asked, why did the
agency walk away after pegging Cobble as a child abuser?
</P>
<P>
   But DSS Commissioner Jeffrey A. Locke said he remained convinced
that Cobble's actions justified the agency's reaction. ``I think
when you wrap a belt around your hand and strike a child on the
back, it sounds more like a beating to me,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the SJC ruling will not stop DSS from investigating
abuse claims linked to corporal punishment. ``No one should be
surprised, because we will be at their doorstep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recognition in the case that corporal punishment
can be severe enough to warrant departmental action,'' Locke added.
``That's the position we have maintained from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and child welfare specialists, meanwhile, said the
court misunderstood the emotional damage a child may suffer from
corporal punishment. They also stressed that parents can still face
criminal charges in such cases. Cobble was never charged
criminally.
</P>
<P>
   David Deakin, head of the child abuse unit in the Suffolk
District Attorney's office, pointed to the case involving a Roxbury
woman who struck her 10-year-old son on his bare legs with a belt,
leaving raised welts that persisted for three days. Her boyfriend
held the child while the belt was used.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Frazier was convicted of assault and battery in August,
sentenced to two years of probation, and ordered to attend
parenting classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't prosecute people merely for spanking,'' said Deakin.
``People need to understand whether you injure a child in the name
of discipline, or for any other reason, they are at risk for
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Strom, president and chief executive officer of the
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
was furious that the court gave even limited approval to a practice
that specialists have concluded is always harmful to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it only make a difference when we break something?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Strom said research has shown that spanking turns children into
bullies, as well as abusers of their own children and their
spouses, and is outlawed in other industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it domestic violence when you do it to your husband
that you love,'' said Strom. ``It's not discipline. It's not
teaching, and it isn't loving to physically hurt someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Strom also said the case was particularly disturbing because
Cobble will become a role model. ``What is the message here?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Cobble remained adamant he acted with God's blessing and in
the best interest of his son, who has a congenital disease that
requires him to use leg braces. He said other researchers disagree
with Strom's belief that corporal punishment is harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``God says corporal punishment is a necessary part to raising
your child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he does not believe his case will change people's
minds. ``All this has done is just fuel people's opinions. It
hasn't really changed anything.''

ACCUSED INDONESIAN BANKER BELIEVES HE IS FALL GUY IN FAR-REACHING
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Rudy Ramli has become the most celebrated
banker in Indonesian history, though for reasons he could scarcely
have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old former president of Bank Bali is at the heart of
a financial scandal that has shaken Jakarta _ even contributing to
the downfall of a president, B.J. Habibie, who withdrew from
October's election in Parliament rather than face the likelihood of
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Ramli admitted paying $80 million to a company with
ties to Habibie's Golkar party. The money was a commission to help
him recover loans owed to Bank Bali by other banks. This week, he
is going on trial here for violating banking laws by concealing
that payment from Indonesia's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his trial, Ramli granted his first interview since
the scandal overwhelmed him. Sitting in a drab, barely furnished
rental apartment in central Jakarta _ with eight bodyguards
listening in the adjoining apartment _ Ramli said he now regretted
making the payment. But he insisted that he had no choice if he was
to save the family-owned bank he had taken over from his father in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trapped; I needed to get the money,'' Ramli said. ``The
bank would have been in so much trouble without the money.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Bank Bali landed in far worse trouble after
Ramli's ill-fated deal. The bank was taken over by the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency, which ousted him and turned over
management to Standard Chartered PLC of London. And Ramli became
the central point of a vast investigation that later involved two
cabinet ministers, the central bank governor and a top adviser to
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   None of those officials has been charged with wrongdoing, which
nourishes Ramli's belief that he is the fall guy in a scandal that
reaches far beyond him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police started an investigation; the bank authority
started an investigation,'' he said, ``But the police only
identified me and three other Bank Bali directors as targets. After
trying to charge us with corruption and embezzlement, they're now
only charging us with concealing a transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramli said he did not report the deal in the accounts because he
later asked the bank restructuring agency to cancel it. And he
insists that he informed Standard Chartered about the arrangement
from the beginning. Standard Chartered agreed in April to buy 20
percent of Bank Bali, subject to an examination of the bank's
accounts. It was during this inquiry that it said it discovered the
$80 million shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the validity of Ramli's claims, he has kept the loyalty
of his former employees. In what has turned a scandal into a
spectacle, Bank Bali staff members demonstrate almost daily in
Jakarta's business district to support their old boss and to vilify
their new ones. On Monday, more than 1,000 employees marched to the
British Embassy, carrying signs that read, ``We want Rudy'' and
``SCB Is a Robber.''
</P>
<P>
   The employees have not stopped with rallies. Last week, they
barred the expatriate managers appointed by Standard Chartered from
entering the headquarters, after the managers dismissed a Bank Bali
employee and suspended 47 others for refusing to cooperate with the
new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I am not behind the things they are doing,'' Ramli
said, responding to accusations that he was stirring up trouble for
Standard Chartered.
</P>
<P>
   ((The campaign by Bank Bali employees has had an effect. On
Wednesday, the bank restructuring agency said it would remove the
managers appointed by Standard Chartered because they could no
longer function. A spokesman said the agency would also review its
contract with the bank.))
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warned that if Standard Chartered's overture to Bank
Bali fails, it could scare away other foreign banks who are
considering investing in Indonesia. The government is eager to lure
foreigners to help defray the cost of overhauling the debt-ridden
banking system.
</P>
<P>
   For Ramli, these broader concerns count for little next to the
anguish he said he has endured. The publicity from the scandal was
so intense that Ramli abandoned his house and moved from hotel to
hotel for months because he feared for his safety. He is pale and
gaunt from a mild stroke earlier this year, spent 38 days in a
Jakarta prison in September after his police interrogation, and
faces up to 15 years' imprisonment if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ramli said he was guardedly optimistic. With
Habibie's departure and the emergence of Abdurrahman Wahid as the
country's first democratically elected president, Ramli said he
thinks that the Bank Bali scandal will be relegated to the past,
along with Indonesia's culture of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world has changed,'' he said. ``I hope it has. We
never had a new president like this before.''

BURTON AND `SLEEPY HOLLOW' A PERFECT MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Not for use before Friday, Nov. 19)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; There are a number of reasons why it makes sense that Tim
Burton would direct a horror movie based on ``The Legend of Sleepy
Hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   The best one, though? He doesn't like horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a horse person, y'know?'' says the 39-year-old,
Burbank-bred filmmaker. ``And they don't like show business, I
don't think. I've never dealt with them before and they are
amazing; these big, Spanish animals on enclosed stage sets, going
full-speed, was completely surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am kind of afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine any other director of Burton's stature
confronting his fears by making a movie about a headless horseman.
But nobody has ever accused the goateed, beret-wearing auteur of
doing the expected thing. A surprise member of the film industry's
elite personal-artists-who-make-big-box-office-bucks contingent,
Burton balances being one of Hollywood's biggest box-office helmers
(``Beetlejuice,'' ``Edward Scissorhands,'' the first two ``Batman''
movies) with being one of its most idiosyncratic (the
aforementioned plus ``Mars Attacks!'' and ``Ed Wood,'' among
others) filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those two most recent films, ``Wood,'' the story of the most
inept moviemaker in recorded history, earned widespread critical
acclaim and supporting actor Martin Landau an Academy Award. The
antic ``Mars'' had its critical champions _ it was considered a
subversive if childish goof on the popular but idiotic
``Independence Day'' _ but was mostly considered an artistic
fizzle. Both movies were rare Burton box-office duds, and looked at
in some Hollywood circles as perverse attempts on his part to
establish a zonky artistic integrity over his reputation for
commercial acumen.
</P>
<P>
   But if the horse thing represents a different kind of creative
perversity, much of the impetus for Burton's ``Sleepy Hollow'' was
of a much more affectionate nature.
</P>
<P>
   A great fan of the cheesy-but-zippy horror films made by
England's Hammer Studios from the '50s through the '70s, Burton
wanted to recapture their lurid charms with a very nice '90s budget
of $80 million. He wanted to work again with his favorite actor,
Johnny Depp (the star of ``Eds'' _ both ``Wood'' and
``Scissorhands'') and work with such old Hammer standbys as Michael
Gough (who plays Alfred in the Batfilms) and Christopher Lee.
</P>
<P>
   And the story, set in a Hudson River Valley hamlet 200 years
ago, offered a perfect chance to craft a relatively straightforward
supernatural mystery accented by Burton touches, not designed as a
showcase for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I made this is because it's just, like, a
monster movie,'' says Burton between cycles of nervous chuckles.
``It was the kind of movie that gave me a lot when I was a kid. Of
course, you try to put thematic things into it, but at the root of
the project you just want to make a strong, visceral, fun monster
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow's'' script, conceived by the disturbing
``Seven's'' Andrew Kevin Walker and polished by British playwright
(and ``Shakespeare in Love'' Oscar winner) Tom Stoppard, takes
extensive liberties with Washington Irving's classic,
early-American story. It's more of a supernatural detective yarn in
which Ichabod Crane has been changed from a tremulous teacher into
a ``scientific'' detective from New York City, sent upstate to
discover the source of some ghastly decapitation murders.
</P>
<P>
   He finds the village of Sleepy Hollow rife with conspiracies and
closeted skeletons. The beguiling Katrina Van Tassel (Christina
Ricci) turns out to be a bit of a witch (and hardly the witchiest
one thereabouts). The local superstitions Crane initially
dismisses, he soon discovers, are terrifyingly real _ so real, in
fact, that our supposedly rationalist, supposed hero finds himself
constantly fainting dead away.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach was to take the Ichabod that existed and
elasticize him a little,'' says Depp. ``I thought of Ichabod as
being too in touch with his feminine side, maybe like a 9-year-old
girl trapped in a grown man's body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I like about Johnny is that he's so open to
trying things,'' Burton explains. ``It's great to deal with an
actor who's not vain or concerned about how they look _ in fact, he
probably wanted Ichabod to look worse. There's just a freedom to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   This was crucial to achieving Burton's goal of a mildly comical
but deeply human Crane that could anchor the fantasy in some kind
of emotional reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that the character thinks too much, that he pretends
he knows what he's talking about when he doesn't and that he wants
to be brave and isn't, necessarily,'' Burton says. ``You're not
everything that you think you are or want to be sometimes, and I
just find that to be charming and very human.''
</P>
<P>
   If Depp's performance brings some degree of believability to the
phantasmagoric proceedings, little else does. Everything about the
film is stylized to the nth degree, and by extensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   The film's nightmare/fairy tale look was achieved to a great
extent on English soundstages; the village of Sleepy Hollow itself
was entirely constructed on an estate north of London.
</P>
<P>
   An entire forest, including a gnarled, blood-spurting tree where
the Horseman stores his ever-growing collection of freshly severed
heads, was built indoors. Those horrifically convincing loose
noggins were created by co-writer Kevin Yagher, a special-effects
master whose mayhem resume includes the likes of ``Starship
Troopers'' and ``Face/Off.'' And yes, there was even a mechanical
horse used in certain shots; it was constructed over the shell used
in the 1944 Elizabeth Taylor movie ``National Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every shot was manufactured; you couldn't, like, quickly shoot
lots of stuff because everything had smoke, fog, some kind of
effect,'' Burton notes. ``But we tried to shoot as much as we could
live. We relied on post effects, but the reason why we built all
the sets was to make sure that no actor was working against a blank
blue screen, that there was some physical reality in every scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Such control over every aspect of a large filmmaking machine was
deeply satisfying for Burton. Especially after coming off a
frustrating year of developing a new Superman movie, only to see
the project _ which boasted the controversial choice of Nicolas
Cage to play the Man of Steel _ canceled by Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it happens to people all the time; it's just the first
time that it's happened to me,'' Burton concedes. ``But it's not a
good thing. Nobody wants to spend a year working on something and
then not have it come to pass. This is too harsh of a business to
be doing that kind of stuff. For everybody concerned, it's just
kind of a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Was ``Sleepy Hollow'' an attempt to
make a more accessible film than his last couple of projects, and
thus renew Burton's shaken clout?
</P>
<P>
   There's that nervous laugh again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always easy to look back on things, but from the
beginning, I was always surprised if something was a success or a
failure,'' says Burton, who went from cartoonist to animator to
short filmmaker before making his feature directing debut with the
surprise hit ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure.'' ``You just don't really
think that way, though you kind of have to because it's a business.
At the same time, though, if everybody knew what a hit movie was
then there would be only hit movies, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of why I like Ichabod so much; I just sort of
relate to that pretending-like-you-know-what-you're-talking-about
syndrome,'' Burton admits. ``It's very Hollywood.'' &UR;

   ``Things happen. Things take a turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words of Mr. Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, one of the
sweetest monsters you'll ever see on the big screen. In Atom
Egoyan's powerfully disturbing new movie, ``Felicia's Journey,''
Hilditch uses those words as a kind of comfort whenever things take
a turn for the worse. And that's often the case in Hilditch's
world, although the outside observer would never know it by looking
at his small, nondescript life.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan has given us devastating portraits of hidden worlds and
self-delusional people before, most notably in ``The Sweet
Hereafter'' and ``Exotica.'' Here, he has taken William Trevor's
award-winning novel and adapted it to suit his preoccupation with
memory, fate and time. It's basically a two-character study of the
ways people deceive themselves and the often tragic consequences of
such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The meticulous Mr. Hilditch (Bob Hoskins) works as a catering
manager at a large factory, where he prepares the workers' meals
with exacting pride and precision. After work, he goes home and
cooks elaborate formal dinners for himself, working from kitschy
1950s videotapes of a cooking show hosted by a gaudily glamorous
French woman (Egoyan's wife, Arsinee Khanjian).
</P>
<P>
   Into Hilditch's lonely life comes another solitary figure, a
naive Irish girl, Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), who travels to the
English Midlands looking for her lover. In addition to her youthful
gullibility, Felicia has two problems: She's pregnant, and she has
no real idea where her would-be boyfriend is. In fact, she doesn't
know anybody in England _ until she meets Hilditch.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan has always been adept at constructing cinematic jigsaw
puzzles, and ``Felicia's Journey'' is no exception. He has
essentially turned Trevor's novel into a Grimm's fairy tale, with
Felicia acting as Little Red Riding Hood and Hilditch as the
seemingly benign grandmother. The difference here is that Hilditch
never actually acknowledges his carnivorous appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, Egoyan inserts scenes from his characters'
formative years _ and not always to the film's benefit. Felicia's
modest Irish roots are rendered in a much too simplistic manner,
with the cliches stopping just short of leprechaun territory. More
effective are the scenes that explore Hilditch's unloving childhood
and the hold it has on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins gives a remarkably measured performance, full of
chilling restraint and surprising compassion. The subtlety at work
here is nothing short of amazing, as Hoskins burrows inside the
mind of this tremendously complex man and shows us the depths of
his self-deceit. Newcomer Cassidy can't help but be dwarfed but
manages to achieve a tender delicacy that is heart-wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   The movie builds to an unforgettable climax in which the fates
come together and enable both Felicia and Hilditch to wash the
scales from their eyes and see the world as it really exists. It's
a conclusion that's simultaneously beautiful and horrible, which is
to say, par for the course in the dark, dreamlike world of Atom
Egoyan.

COMMENTARY: CUOMO'S QUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was thought to be dangerous terrain, and the advice of some
high-powered political advisers was blunt. Don't go there.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty was a merciless quagmire for a politician. Even Bill
Clinton had said that the era of big government was over.
Politicians exhibiting an unnatural interest in the poor could
expect to be viewed as weirdos or, far worse, liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over the department, I talked to one of the sharp
political guys in town,'' said Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of
Housing and Urban Development. ``He said, `Look, never say poverty.
It's political suicide for you. The impression is going to be that
you're an old-time liberal. You're the son of Mario. You're the
politics of yesterday.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo filed the advice. He set about remaking HUD, which for
awhile had been targeted for demolition by the Republicans.
President Clinton seemed to like the work he was doing. HUD's
budget grew.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cuomo started traveling the country, visiting places that
were _ despite the booming economy, despite the creation of
millions of new jobs _ still poor. He went to the tough
neighborhoods like Harlem and South Central Los Angeles, but also
to places far removed from the consciousness of most Americans _
scenes of economic devastation like Guadalupe, Ariz., and Kasigluk,
Alaska, and chronically depressed areas like Appalachia and the
Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Administrations generally expect drum rolls and sustained
applause from their cabinet secretaries, at least in public. But
Cuomo would come back to Washington and write reports with titles
like ``Now is the Time: Places Left Behind in the New Economy.'' He
would show slides of people living in squalor on Indian
reservations and give speeches in which he would declare that now _
when the economy is surging and the budget surplus is huge _ is the
time to invest in those parts of the country that are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not now,'' said Cuomo, ``when?''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as six or seven months ago that kind of behavior was
considered politically problematic. Some White House aides made it
clear they were not happy with the HUD secretary's insistence that
the economy had not cured all ills.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened to Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get struck by lightning. The president didn't suggest
that he zip it. And the media coverage he got was positive.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the secretary went out of his way, often, to tout
the administration's economic successes _ the balanced budget,
creation of 18 million jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in
decades, decreases in poverty among blacks and Hispanics, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But he would also say, as he did in a speech to the National
Press Club in April, ``I can tell you that the poverty rate, the
despair, is just as bad in some places as it has ever been.'' And
he characterized the conditions on some of the Indian reservations
as ``a scar on this nation's soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, it turns out, was onto something. Within a few months
America's most perceptive political observer, Bill Clinton, was
making his own tour of the nation's poorest venues, and reaping
rave reviews throughout. On July 5, in Hazard, Ky., with the
national press corps looking on, Clinton stood in the searing heat
and told a crowd:
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all
Americans have been blessed by it. This is a time to bring more
jobs and investment and hope to the areas of our country that have
not fully participated in this economic recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty was back on the political/policy map.
</P>
<P>
   In their campaigns to succeed Clinton, Al Gore and Bill Bradley
are arguing all over the country about who would do best by the
poor, and even the Republicans are lip-synching the lyrics of
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Will any of this translate into real help for real people?
Perhaps. If the economy holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different story when the people are worried or anxious
about their own circumstances,'' said Cuomo. ``Then they turn
inward. But if they're OK with their mortgage, and they're OK with
the tuition, then they can start to look at things beyond their own
circumstances. Another way of saying it is, all things being equal,
the better angels will win.''

COMMENTARY: PRE-SELLING A SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``If the Russian government attacks innocent women
and children in Chechnya,'' George W. Bush will say in his foreign
policy speech Friday, ``it cannot expect international aid.
Period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican front-runner himself vouchsafed it to me _ along
with The AP, Reuters and anybody else who would pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians must understand that they've overstepped the
bounds of human decency,'' he continued. ``They will discover that
barbaric treatment of women and children will be self-defeating. If
you overstep the bounds, there will be consequences. The
consequence is international aid. The consequence is international
opinion, and the president ought to lead the chorus when it comes
to international opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee. Such an excoriation of Moscow's savagery in Chechnya
sounded like just what I hoped for. ``Somebody said that you wrote
a column questioning whether or not that was going to be in the
speech,'' George W. said, switching easily from a tough to a
bantering tone. ``It's in there. Actually, it was in there before
you wrote it, but I'm going to play like you asked it and I put it
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's manipulating whom? Welcome to the world of symbiotic
drumbeating in the media echo chamber. First I let him get his
pre-speech teaser across:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say that America has got to reject isolationism
and seize the moment, to not only foster free markets but to build
strong alliances; to remember we can't go it alone in the world;
that we can set a tone; that a president can set priorities. But
we're going to have to rely on our friends to help us achieve the
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In one swell foop, that blunts President Clinton's attack on the
GOP by joining it (``reject isolationism''), evokes Nixon (``seize
the moment'') and Reagan (``set a tone'') while pleasing business
(``foster free markets'') and the multilateral establishment
(``rely on our friends'').
</P>
<P>
   In return for this teaser, he lets me have six minutes of
questioning:
</P>
<P>
   Should we bring the Baltic states into NATO? ``It's important
for us to absorb the countries in NATO as they now are, and wait.
Open the door to possibilities but wait.''
</P>
<P>
   That's disappointing to hawks; after the condemnatory rhetoric
about Chechnya, Bush shies away from diplomatic action that would
really worry the Russians. (I hope Tim Russert asks him on ``Meet
the Press'' about aid to Eduard Shevardnadze's Georgia, on
Chechnya's border, which would drive Moscow batty.)
</P>
<P>
   When to deploy a missile defense? ``I think we ought to give
Russia a reasonable period of time ... if not, we ought to abrogate
the ABM treaty.'' How long is reasonable _ years? ``Months.''
</P>
<P>
   When we spoke in April, you had not decided if we should sell
anti-missile missiles to Taiwan. Any decision yet? ``You mean _
when we deploy the Aegis cruiser system, for example, will we sell
the technology to Taiwan? Depends on how the Chinese behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Invite China into the WTO, despite its brutal repression of the
Falun Gong? ``I think that China should be admitted into the World
Trade Organization.'' Use that as a lever to admit Taiwan also? ``I
think we should. In China's case, trade with the entrepreneur class
will help freedom.'' He notes that ``in this speech I do mention
India as an emerging power that the United States must open up a
bit more trade with.'' (Is that supposed to trouble China?)
</P>
<P>
   What quality do you want in a secretary of state _ a hands-on
negotiator like James Baker, or a conceptualizer with a world view
like Henry Kissinger?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fascinating question. I'll say hands-on negotiator, if I had
to pick right this minute.'' (On second thought, he preferred a
George Shultz type, who could be both.)
</P>
<P>
   Should using the CIA in covert action be a weapon in our foreign
policy? ``It's important to have a strong, viable CIA that not only
knows how to collect intelligence but can help on missions, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you willing to debate foreign policy with John McCain
one-on-one? ``To exclude all other candidates? We're going to have
to have all the candidates until the field narrows down, and that's
just a practical reality. I've got to go. Seriously, I've got some
people waiting.''

 &HT;    Mideast peace accord in sight, expert says
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Heroic diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kenneth Stein sees as he reflects on the Middle East
peace process during the years 1973-77, the period leading up to
the Camp David Accords of 1978. And that's what he chose to call
his recent book on the topic: ``Heroic Diplomacy: Sadat, Kissinger,
Carter, Begin and the Quest for Arab-Israeli Peace'' (Routledge).
</P>
<P>
   While Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former President
Jimmy Carter used the power of the Oval Office, Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin made historic
compromises, Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their collective heroic diplomacy altered the direction and
changed the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' he concludes in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Stein is the William E. Schatten Professor of Contemporary
Middle Eastern History and Israeli Studies at Emory University.
He's also a Middle East fellow at the Carter Center and co-author
of a book with the former president. During the 1980s, he sat in on
conversations between Carter and almost every key player in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   His immersion in the history of the region makes him an able
commentator on the long and arduous peace process that continues
today. Now, as then, Stein says courage and commitment are needed
to make lasting peace a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from a conversation with Stein:
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you compare the involvement of the Clinton
administration in the Middle East process today to that of the
Carter administration in the late 1970s?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be fair, you have to compare it in terms of what was going
on in the world at the time and what did each administration have
in terms of leaders of the region with whom to work. If you look at
the personalities in the region, Sadat was certainly more
impetuous, more pragmatic, less ideological than (previous Egyptian
President Gamal Abd al) Nasser. (Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat
in 1977 was certainly the quintessential ideologue; he's not the
Arafat of 1993. It was relatively easy for both Kissinger and
Carter to accept Sadat because Sadat threw himself into our arms.
He said I'm turning from Moscow. I want Washington. I like U.S.
technology. I want American foreign aid. Sadat's turn to
Washington, I think, was the single greatest success of the United
States during the Cold War. And both Kissinger and Carter
understood that Sadat had to be nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   This was after Nasser's 20 years of anti-Israeli sentiment
building up enormous street opposition to Israel's very existence,
helping to organize the PLO. So when Sadat went toward the
Americans, the Israelis had to be persuaded that this guy was
sincere. And it's to Carter's credit that he ran with Sadat. I
think the fact that he did caused consternation amongst Israelis
because, what, an American president befriending an Arab president
_ this is a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to today, it's very easy for Clinton to be warm with
(current Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak because you have a
relationship with Egypt that's gone on now for 20 years at a
minimum. There's a deep financial, economic commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you compare the Israeli leaders of the two eras?
</P>
<P>
   A: As far as Begin and (current Israeli Prime Minister Ehud)
Barak are concerned, Begin was an ideologue, Barak the
quintessential military man. Begin made a major compromise about
giving up settlements in the Sinai. He decided that if he returned
Sinai to Egypt, then he wouldn't have to make any compromises on
the West Bank. He wouldn't have to give up Judea and Samaria. He
could give the Palestinians autonomy, functional self-rule, but
never, never consider the possibility of returning any of the land
of Judea, Samaria, the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak on the other hand, like his predecessor (Yitzhak) Rabin
believed that a portion of this land should be provided to the
Palestinians so that they could have a place of their own,
self-government, self-rule, a state, self-determination, whatever
it's called. Barak feels he needs to sustain his relationship with
Egypt but at the same time the Palestinians need a place of their
own. He wants to separate the populations. Now whether that's
political as well as economic separation remains to be seen. Both
Begin and Barak believed in self-rule for the Palestinians or
self-government for the Palestinians. Barak takes it a bit further.
He said if they want to have a state, that's their business. The
last point is Begin would never have talked to Arafat. The PLO and
Arafat were like saying pork for an Orthodox Jew or someone who
keeps kosher. Barak sees a change. There's now six years when
Arafat has been negotiating with Israelis. So Arafat has changed,
and Arafat's political ideology has been circumscribed, narrowed or
reduced, which makes it much easier for Barak to continue what
Rabin started. And this is most important. The Israeli public has
internalized the reality of a Palestinian state. The concept in
1977, '78, '79 was about as far as Pluto.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does Barak bring to this process that his immediate
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, could not?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of it is a sense of trust, a willingness to fulfill
obligations previously signed. Netanyahu ran for office in 1996 on
a platform opposing (the 1993) Oslo (agreement, outlining a plan
for Israel to withdraw from Arab lands conquered in 1967 in
exchange for assurances of peace), opposing the provision to the
Palestinians of any land. Netanyahu did whatever he could to keep
this negotiating process in first gear. Barak on the other hand has
cranked this thing up to fourth. It has to do with ideology. I also
think it has to do with Netanyahu barely squeezing by in the '96
elections and Barak winning a smashing victory in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Israeli and Palestinian negotiators now have less than a
hundred days to reach their goal of creating a framework by
February for a final peace agreement. Will they succeed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Deadlines have historically been missed in these
negotiations. It's a target date and it should be seen as a target
date. You know they also figure they're going to get finished with
final status (the last phase of the talks) by September 2000. These
things get complicated, and that just won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   An outline for an agreement between the respective sides is
pretty well out there: a unified Jerusalem under Israeli
sovereignty. Palestinians have some self-rule and presence in East
Jerusalem but not a divided city. There will be no foreign army in
the West Bank and Gaza, no foreign army west of the Jordan River.
So the Palestinian state, if it's created, is going to have
circumscribed rights. Its privileges, its prerogatives will be
pretty well defined. The number of refugees that will be able to be
returned _ it won't be '48 refugees, it will be '67. It won't be
hundreds of thousands of them; there may be 50- or 60,000, over a
period of time maybe a hundred thousand. Israelis and Palestinians
will figure out ... how they're going to use water, because it's
the really scarcest commodity.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis aren't going to give up their control of Jerusalem.
The Palestinians aren't going to give up their desire for a
presence in Jerusalem. Then it becomes a discussion of what is that
presence, how does it manifest itself, how political is it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That makes it sound like agreement is fairly close.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I don't know if it's close. I think the respective
sides wouldn't be sitting down to talk about a framework if they
didn't have a general idea that a framework could come into being.
I think there are differences about how it comes into being, the
details on final status issues, but I think there's a common will,
and I think there's probably even political courage on the
respective sides to make the necessary compromises that are
required. Without either side being really happy at what the
outcome is going to be, I think they both realized they've got to
nail this one, and sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   The big question now becomes how does Barak define separation.
Does he really mean that one-third of the Palestinian work force
will not be able to work inside pre-'67 Israel? What does that do
to the potential Palestinian economy, earning power, stability?
Barak is very concerned about the outcome and its impact on Jordan.
What will this do to the Jordanian regime, to Palestinians in
Jordan, to the Jordanian economy? Israel is very interested in a
stable Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Americans are more likely to support Palestinian
rights now than in the past?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think Americans, and I think the press in general, are
tired. I think they're weary. I think people have internalized the
reality that this thing is going to be hammered out between the
respective sides. I think there's trepidation on people's part
about violence and terrorism and folks trying to throw wrenches
into this wheel. I'm not sure the American people are as tuned into
foreign affairs in general, let alone the Middle East and the
Arab-Israeli conflict in particular, as maybe they once were 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you seen a shift in American Jews' views?
</P>
<P>
   A: American Jews probably by and large still remain more anxious
about Palestinian and Arab intentions than do Israelis. I think
Israelis, those who live there, are a bit more pragmatic. Second, I
think American Jews, many of them, still wonder why Israel has to
trade land for peace. They won this in a war. Why shouldn't they be
able to keep it? Then when it's explained, well, what do you do,
are you going to absorb two million Palestinians or are you going
to ship them off in yellow school buses across the Jordan River?
The international community is not going to accept that. I think
there's a very rapid maturation in the American Jewish community
about what is the art of the possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Looking globally, where does this conflict rank in terms of
ones that need to be resolved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the process toward resolution reduces tension in the
region, which is in the interest of the United States. I think Arab
states in general, forget the Palestinian state that may come into
being, have severe domestic problems. And the Palestinian issue is
not No. 1 on their agenda. It's important. But all of these states
have infrastructure problems _ sewer, water, garbage collection.
They have over-urbanization. They have under-employment. They have
unemployment. They have an Islamic factor to contend with. They
have difficulties between the governed and the ruler. Can these
societies inculcate human rights, civil rights? These are issues
that are there separate and apart from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, even if we have a final agreement between Palestinians
and Israelis next year, there's a lot of work to be done?
</P>
<P>
   A: The day after an agreement, the day after the Palestinians
come home from being happy and jubilant and firing firecrackers and
roman candles, and they now have passports and they have a flag,
but the bottom line is: ``So what does it do to change my life? How
does it affect me on a day-to-day basis?'' And then the tough
questions still have to be answered.

FAMILY, FRIENDS DEFEND EGYPTAIR PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT AND NADIA ABOU EL-MAGD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ With investigators focusing on a copilot they suspect of
seizing the controls and forcing EgyptAir Flight 990 into a fatal
dive, the pilot's colleagues and family Wednesday lashed out at the
accusations and painted a portait of one of the carrier's best
pilots and a loving father.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who knew him, Gamil El Batouty, 59, was a
devoted husband and father of five who was nearing retirement after
flying for EgyptAir for more than 30 years and serving as a flight
instructor for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was wealthy, he was healthy, and he had everything to live
for, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that he did not do this. The whole world must know
he is not capable of this,'' said his wife, Omayama Fahmi, 50,
dressed in black as she sat in the family home in Heliopolis, a
wealthy enclave of the sprawling city of Cairo near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go and ask EgyptAir, ask his friends, ask the neighbors. He
could never do something like this,'' she added, her voice hoarse
from crying and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This day is harder than the day he died,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An extended family of children, cousins, and in-laws clustered
around a television in the living room. A framed picture of
Batouty, a smiling, robust man with thick black hair, hung on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   CNN was broadcasting reports that Batouty was at the controls
and that investigators believed he may have intentionally sent the
Boeing 767 into a nose-dive, perhaps as a means of suicide, killing
all 217 people on board. The network was reporting that Batouty
murmured a prayer as the plane plummeted at near super-sonic speed
into the waters off Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty's brother-in-law, Yehia Hegazi, screamed at the
television and turned away in anger, saying, ``They are searching
for a scapegoat!''
</P>
<P>
   Anger at the allegations being reported in Western media were
felt not only by the family, but by Egyptians on the streets of
Cairo and throughout the Egyptian media.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's editions of Al-Wafd, a liberal newspaper published in
Arabic and English, headlined: ``Egypt rejects American Allegations
on Plane Disaster.'' The article said a phrase being attributed to
Batouty on the plane's cockpit voice recorder _ ``I made my
decision now. I put my faith in God's hands'' _ ``is a phrase
commonly used by Muslims facing a serious crisis and would have
nothing to do with suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling for explanations for the crash, some American news
organizations reported that Batouty may have been distraught over
the failing health of a 10-year-old daughter who suffers from lupus
erythematosus, a degenerative disease that attacks the joints and
immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But Fahmi said her daughter's health had been improving, that
she had only one treatment left, and that they were all hopeful she
would be cured. She said Batouty had taken the girl to UCLA Medical
Center several times for examinations and had planned to take her
back there in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Walid Batouty, a nephew of the copilot, dismissed any connection
between the accident and the daughter's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never do this for the simple reason he would never
put his family through what they are going through right now,'' he
said. ``He loved his children. He worshiped them.''
</P>
<P>
   The young girl, whose name is Aya, looked on from another room,
smiling shyly. Her face and eyes were swollen from tears or perhaps
her treatments. But she had no apparent physical difficulty in
walking and playing.
</P>
<P>
   Before Batouty left on the New York to Cairo leg of the flight,
he had spoken with his wife and family on the phone, Fahmi said. It
was a typical conversation. He talked to his son about buying a
black jacket for him and wanted to know if it was the right style.
He also discussed buying two new tires for a sports car the son
owns, because they are cheaper in the US, and he asked his son to
pick him up at the airport to help him carry them home.
</P>
<P>
   His wife said he had also bought his youngest daughter a Barbie
Doll as a surprise because she had been wanting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am bringing a beautiful gift for you,'' he told the girl by
phone, said his wife, who recounted the conversation in a voice
cracking with emotion and tears.
</P>
<P>
   His family said Batouty had much to live for. He was set to
retire in two months and he was considering working for another
carrier in the Arab world while also collecting his pension from
EgyptAir. But he wanted to work less, feeling that his family had
suffered from a schedule that had him traveling most of the time.
Just before leaving on the first leg of the ill-fated flight, he
had hosted a party for his son, Mohammed, 21, after his graduation
from police academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very proud of his children,'' said his wife, offering
to show a video of Batouty dancing and enjoying the evening of his
son's party.
</P>
<P>
   He was also planning a family party for New Year's Day to
celebrate the millennium and 35 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His wife said that he often told her, ``This house is our
garden, and you are the most beautiful flower of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatouty's family called him a religious man, but not a fanatic.
They said he read the Koran and prayed five times a day, as is the
custom for devout Muslims. He attended a nearby mosque but not
faithfully, because he was so often away on flights. He was also
occasionally drank a beer or a glass of wine, which is forbidden in
Islam, said his landlord, Shafik el Banna.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was religious but not overly religious,'' El Banna added.
</P>
<P>
   Many family members said they were furious at the media for
suggesting that a man who prays as he faces imminent death is
somehow strange or perhaps a fanatic. Egyptian culture is very
traditional and prayers are part of the customs of everyday life,
they noted, and pointed out that suicide is an unacceptable sin for
a Sunni Muslim, as Batouty was.
</P>
<P>
   The family had no obvious financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   They have two vacation villas, a weekend home in a suburb of
Cairo and another on the Mediterranean coast near Alexandria.
Batouty hailed from a well-known Egyptian family, and his father
was the mayor of the city Kafr el Bousy in the Nile Delta.
</P>
<P>
   He earned $48,000 a year, an excellent salary in Egypt. And he
had a side business of leasing family-owned land for farming.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir provided $75,000 of life insurance to all employees,
said EgyptAir Captain Roshdy Zakaria, who knew and worked with
Batouty. Recently, he added, pilots had negotiated to get an
additional $75,000 in insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty did not take out any additional insurance beyond that,
according to both Zakaria and Batouty's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not have insurance. He believed this was a bad omen,''
his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   He had flown the Boeing 767 on the overseas route to New York
and Los Angeles for nearly 10 years. He had also been an occasional
flight instructor for the Egyptian military.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had a dangerous profession, he would comfort his
wife by telling her it is ``more dangerous to drive a car than to
fly a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   His health was apparently excellent. His family said he often
joked that his younger friends envied his good health.
</P>
<P>
   If he had a fault, it was perhaps that he worked too hard,
family members said. They could remember Batouty taking only two
holidays in his career, once on a pilgrimage to Mecca _ the duty of
every devout Muslim who can afford it _ and once for a medical
checkup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man would hang on to life until the last second. He had a
family that he adored. And he loved his wife so much,'' said Walid.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she thinks happened on board the flight, his wife
answered, ``God only knows.''

<P>
   &LR; Overkill is a proud American tradition, but its downside is
that incessant media noise surrounding any one topic just makes us
ignore it after a while. Parents might fret and scratch their
heads, but it's just a matter of time before Pokemon goes the way
of the Power Rangers and some other equally odd, and probably
dumber, fad emerges to consume our kids' attention spans and spare
change.
</P>
<P>
   Adults are no better. Here we are, 40 days from the year 2000,
and already everyone's had it up to here with Y2K hysteria and
anything to do with the millennium _ have you bothered to read a
Top-anything list lately? We're told that most systems should work
just fine when our clocks' second hands make that fateful tick into
the unknown _ the years that don't begin with a ``1.'' But no one
knows for sure and everyone's attitude seems to have become a blase
``we'll cross that bridge or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of books on how to prepare or panic _ ``The
End Times for Dummies,'' anyone? _ but television has been
suspiciously mum on the subject. Until now. NBC posits a
humdrummest-case-scenario teleflick, while PBS' ``Frontline'' news
series explains in depth why the few who are still carrying on
insist on doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K: The Movie'' _ as opposed to, presumably, ``Y2K: The
Game,'' which shuts down your computer and forces you to go read a
book _ probably has the shortest shelf life of any popular
entertainment in history. It stars Ken Olin as a crackerjack
computer expert who has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure
that our world is safe on Jan. 1. Alas; for a genius, he fails
miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Power grids collapse globally, thrusting the planet into a new,
if temporary, dark age; nuclear power plants threaten to go postal.
Things really take a grim turn, however, when Olin's petulant
daughter sneaks out to a rave without permission. Though the power
goes out in Times Square, that doesn't prevent a newly engaged
couple from locating a bar lit by candles _ and, of course, a
working TV. (The filmmakers don't quite commit to their premise,
and despite widespread power outages, everyone seems to have easy
access to television.)
</P>
<P>
   Problems are solved by someone running around or tapping on a
keyboard _ you'll be on the edge of your seats! _ or, more
cinematically but just as indifferently, blowing something up. The
film opens with a disclaimer: ``This program does not suggest or
imply that any of these events could actually occur.'' Not to worry
_ anyone who would buy the military transport-size plot holes
presented in this film probably hasn't figured out how to turn on a
computer in the first place. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Frontline: Apocalypse!' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ``Frontline'' takes a far more thoughtful and
fascinating look at potential impending mayhem as foretold, albeit
nowadays though contemporary filters, in the Bible. ``Apocalypse!''
filmmakers William Cran and Ben Loeterman point out a lot of stuff
that was overlooked in Sunday School. For example, the authors of
the Bible cribbed the concept of Hell from Greek mythology. And the
words ``anti-Christ'' and ``rapture'' don't even appear in the Book
of Revelation, the last book in the Bible and the one that has
foretold a presumably imminent cataclysm since its authorship at
the end of the first century A.D. There was, in fact, much debate
over whether Revelation belonged in the New Testament _ the Greek
Orthodox church omits it from its Bible to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apocalypse!'' shows how Revelation's iconography has been
adapted for each new era hoping to usher in Christ's return. The
seven-headed Beast, originally a symbol of Rome, the cradle of
oppression for both Jews and Christians, has variously been
transformed into an emblem espousing everything from socialism to
anti-Semitism. Still, some religious leaders today insist that
based on Bible prophecy, our generation is living in the End Times.
Of course, that's what they've been saying for 1,900 years now _
they're bound to be right sooner or later. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Winter's End' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Sarah Plain and Tall'' movie is not, scripturally
speaking, a sign of the end of days, but likewise, it's not cause
to party. The first two films, ``Sarah Plain and Tall'' and
``Skylark,'' are among the most watched TV movies of the decade.
Tonight's entry, ``Sarah Plain and Tall: Winter's End,'' will
likewise draw viewers, but it's mildly disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's 1918, and Jacob (a subdued Christopher Walken)
and his mail-order bride, Sarah (a beatific, noble Glenn Close),
have had the child promised in ``Skylark,'' and she's a sassy if
well-meaning handful (nicely played by Emily Osment, sister of
``The Sixth Sense's'' Haley Joel Osment). There's another addition
to the family, too _ Jacob's long-lost father John (Jack Palance)
has returned to Kansas, only to find Jacob still bitter that Pop
walked out on him and his mother all those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable healing eventually occurs, and Sarah gets to drop
a lot of familial homilies along the way _ ``Love looks through the
heart, not the eyes,'' she observes at one point. Subplots
involving a flu epidemic, Jacob's oldest daughter pining for a
boyfriend overseas and the world's wimpiest blizzard buffeting
Sarah about scarcely ratchet up the drama a smidgen. ``Winter's
End'' is unfailingly pleasant, but never particularly compelling. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
` &UR; S &LR; hooting the Past' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Masterpiece Theatre'' tonight and next Sunday presents
``Shooting the Past,'' which asks the intriguing question, how much
of our past is worth saving? Writer/director Stephen Poliakoff
introduces us to the quietly eccentric but insubstantial employees
of a photo archive boasting 10 million pictures in its library.
Alas, the stately manor housing their warehouse has been taken over
by an American company, which has no interest in the library's
resources _ its developer, Christopher Anderson (Liam Cunningham),
thinks he's being gracious by giving the employees a week to get
themselves and their photos off the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald Bates (Timothy Spall), the curator with photographic
recall of virtually every snapshot in the collection, is too much
of a buffoon to impress Anderson, so it's up to Marilyn Truman
(Lindsay Duncan), who manages the library, to summon up some
backbone and stand up to Anderson. Duncan and Spall give realistic
and sympathetic performances _ Cunningham's a bit undone by his
cheesy American accent _ and Poliakoff, with the assist of an
evocative score by Adrian Johnston, evokes a melancholy and
sometimes cheeky tone. His photographic cornucopia of random images
underscores, simply and with breathtaking economy, the wealth and
breadth of human experience and emotion still photos convey.
</P>
<P>
   Poliakoff's denouement _ airing next week _ stretches
credibility a bit. But he's onto something somber and deeply felt.
As old books, photos and documents are bulldozed over in the
onslaught of today's flash-in-the-pan media concoctions, what we
lose most of all is the time and the chance to appreciate the sheer
scale of what we're losing.

ANTI-AMERICAN PROTESTERS MARCH AS GREECE PREPARES FOR CLINTON
VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ Giving a sample of the kind of resentment
President Clinton can expect on Friday, more than 10,000 Greek
protesters marched in front of the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday, many
carrying banners branding Clinton a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The noisy demonstration, which began at the Polytechnic
University to commemorate the brutal crackdown on student
protesters there by the U.S.-supported military dictatorship on
Nov. 17, 1973, is an annual ritual. But this year's march was lent
new vigor by the imminent arrival of a U.S. president who is
sardonically referred to by Greeks as the ``Planitarchis,'' the
ruler of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to come, so I can express my feelings,'' said
Dimitris Vagas, a 26-year-old dentistry student who attended the
embassy protest, and who listed the division of Cyprus, the
military dictatorship, the Greek civil war and the bombing of
Kosovo among the reasons he passionately opposed U.S. foreign
policy. ``He is the Planitarchis, so of course he should visit
Greece. It's a province of his empire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was demonstrations like this, as well as bomb explosions and
even a mock trial and public lynching of Clinton earlier this
month, that caused the White House to postpone and scale down a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government, embarrassed by the postponement, now plans
to prohibit any demonstrations in central Athens on Friday and
Saturday, the broadest such ban since the days of the junta.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government initially promised U.S. officials that it would
prohibit protesters from holding demonstrations at presidential
stops during the visit originally planned for Nov. 13 to 15, then
backed down when left-wing parties and even opposition leaders
complained. That about-face, in turn, angered the White House,
which had viewed the first presidential visit to Greece in eight
years as a reward, not a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrives on Friday for a pared-down 24-hour visit,
he will stay at the Intercontinental Hotel, far from the
fortress-like U.S. Embassy and the ambassador's nearby residence,
under tight security.
</P>
<P>
   Egg-throwing protesters are likely to be kept out well out of
range, but the commotion surrounding the visit will nevertheless
give Clinton a taste of how some Greeks perceive the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of left-wing anti-American sentiment that was rampant
throughout Europe and Latin America during most of the Cold War
still thrives in Greece. It is a small, insecure country of 11
million people that still nurses grievances over U.S. support of
the military junta that ruled the country from 1967 and 1974, and
blames the U.S. for not preventing the Turkish invasion of Cyprus
in 1974. Most Greeks believe that the United States favors Turkey,
its historic enemy and the country where Clinton is spending
several days before coming here.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American protests and riots are a mainstay of Greek public
life, but they gained renewed fervor during the war in Kosovo.
Greece is a member of NATO, and the socialist government of Prime
Minister Costas Simitis felt it had no choice but to give NATO
planes access to two air bases and allow NATO supplies to be
transported through Greece to neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 90 percent of Greeks opposed the NATO bombing
campaign, siding with Serbs, historic allies who share their
Eastern Orthodox faith. There were other grievances, as well.
Greeks complain that the United States has a double standard,
punishing human rights violations against Kosovo Albanians but
turning a blind eye to assaults on Turkey's Kurd minority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were 52 protest marches in front of the U.S. Embassy
during the war, some organized by hardline Communists and
anarchists wielding rocks and molotov cocktails, others led by
nurses unions and retirees chanting slogans. A Greek bystander was
killed when a bomb went off near the Intercontinental Hotel, where
Clinton will stay. Greek television helped fuel public outrage,
giving far more coverage to the plight of Serb bombing victims than
to the forced exodus of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   That war is over, but in Greece, the Clinton visit appears to
have unleashed pent-up rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if we are having some kind of break-down, an
accumulated frustration that is spilling over,'' said Alexis
Papahelas, a foreign policy columnist for Vima, Greece's largest
morning newspaper. Papahelas said the anti-Clinton emotion had
roots in a national ``identity crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that Greeks are torn between allegiance to Western
security and lifestyle, on one hand, and deep resentment of a
superpower that still has an overwhelming say in Greek affairs.
``Greeks feel the benefits of globalization,'' he said. ``Our stock
market is booming, we are incredibly consumerist, we rely on the
protection of the U.S. and Europe, yet we enjoy telling America to
go home and get lost. Somehow we feel we have the right to do both
at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The handling of Clinton's visit has been deeply embarrassing for
Simitis, whose government faces an election next March. A stolid
and pragmatic figure who has largely avoided the colorful
anti-American rhetoric practised by his best-known predecessor,
Andreas Papandreou, Simitis is frequently criticized for being too
accommodating towards the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis' last-minute decision to ban protests has enraged many
Greeks, who fiercely defend their right to demonstrate in central
Athens. ``This is a democracy, the government cannot ban people's
feelings,'' Vasilis Constantinou, the manager of ``Ginger'' a chic
Athens bar and restaurant, explained. He said he was personally
pleased that Clinton is coming to Greece but was angry with the
government for seeking to silence those who disagreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to justify the ban, Simitis explained that it would not
be in the country's interest ``to blacken Greece's image'' with
violent demonstrations. ``President Clinton's visit is well
understood to be important for our country and it gives us the
opportunity to promote peace and cooperation in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   But terrorism is another issue that causes tension between
Washington and Athens. November 17, a shadowy left-wing terrorist
group that has claimed responsibility for dozens of assassinations,
including those of five U.S. embassy officials, has operated for 23
years without a single arrest. The White House is pressing the
Greek government to sign a bilateral cooperation treaty during the
visit that would legitimize existing ties between the FBI and Greek
anti-terrorist police, but even that issue is complicated by
prickly national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight of terrorism on American perceptions is another
issue that meets with Greek incomprehension,'' Thanos Veremis, a
professor of political science who runs a foreign policy think tank
in Athens, wrote in a recent newspaper editorial. Noting that the
Oklahoma bomber ``scored 10 times more victims in one operation
than all the grim harvest of 17 November put together,'' Veremis
urged the U.S. president to view the world with more ``humility.''

CRITICS CITE DEFICIENCIES IN HANCOCK DEMUTUALIZATION SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. is finding
consumer advocates in unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco on-line investment bank Wednesday criticized
Hancock's refusal to let millions of policyholders participate in
the giant insurer's highly-anticipated initial public offering. The
bank, W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., said Hancock's plan shortchanges
policyholders, privileges Wall Street professionals over ordinary
investors, and downplays the true value of the giant insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht, part of a new breed of upstarts seeking to reshape
Wall Street's traditional culture, said it wanted to enlighten
consumers and industry regulators, not make a grab for Hancock's
business. But in the Web world's latest challenge to Wall Street, a
Hambrecht executive did not rule out a last-minute pitch to
distribute some of Hancock's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Hancock, in a watershed transformation from a
mutual company owned by policyholders to a stock company owned by
investors, will issue around $2 billion in stock on January 28.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2.8 million policyholders are eligible for shares, cash, or
heftier policies as compensation for their ownership stakes in the
old company. (They also retain their policies.) Policyholders
opting for shares cannot acquire them at the IPO and will instead
be mailed stock certificates in March, leaving them with stock
worth whatever the new company is then worth.
</P>
<P>
   In most IPOs, including Hancock's, only institutional investors
_ pension funds, mutual funds, and insurers _ can buy shares at the
offering price, which is set by investment banks. In all, Hancock
estimates professional investors will own 30 percent of the new
company, while about one in three policyholders, generally those
with large policies, will own the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of who can buy into an IPO is hot at mutual insurers,
whose owners are the policyholders. Given that IPOs can rise
astronomically when issued, excluding policyholders from buying in
isn't fair, said Jonathan T. Fayman, a vice president and financial
analyst at Hambrecht. Indeed, he said, locking out Hancock
policyholders could hand up to $240 million in first-day gains to
institutional investors. ``That $240 million should not be a gift
to Wall Street,'' Furman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's plan upsets some policyholders, too. ``Make it
playable for us little guys to get in on the IPO process,''
Massachusetts policyowner Jim Thivierge told the state's Division
of Insurance, which must approve Hancock's transformation.
</P>
<P>
   At a packed public hearing Wednesday in Boston designed to air
complaints about Hancock's imminent change, Fayman urged regulators
and company officials to consider using an Internet auction system
in which ordinary investors bid side-by-side with the
professionals. The top bidders win, paying the price offered by the
lowest bidder in a group whose participants are collectively the
highest bidders for the available stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to democratize the process, and lets the market,
not an investment bank, set the price,'' Fayman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's decision not to grant subscription rights, as the
right to buy into an IPO is known, is more deleterious to
policyholders who opt for cash or heftier policies, Furman said.
That is because IPOs typically undervalue a company by offering
shares below a company's true market value, he said. Furman looked
at six mutual insurers that converted to stock companies this
decade and found an average first-day share price appreciation of
12 percent _ meaning that each insurer was priced around 12 percent
below its market value. Six months after going public, stock in the
six insurers had risen an average 40 percent. Two of the six rose
over 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual step designed to counter consumer perceptions that
its process is unfair, Hancock will cash out policyowners who opt
for money or policy credits at up to 120 percent of the IPO price.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has tentatively priced its stock at $20 a share, though
in a standard procedure, that price will rise or fall the night
before the IPO to reflect market conditions. Dallas lawyer Michael
F. Pezzulli said Hancock was worth at least $36 per share on
opening day, based on the company's book value.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht is the second on-line financial firm to challenge
Hancock's IPO, for which the insurer is using blue-chip investment
bank Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. as lead distributor. Wit Capital Corp.,
also of New York, made a clumsy proposal last week to distribute
Hancock's stock on line and to sell additional shares to
policyholders. Wit retracted its plan a day later, calling it
ill-advised and poorly thought out.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, which wants to cash out its smallest policyholders to
eliminate costly administration, said it wasn't practical to offer
subscription rights. The nation's 13th largest life insurer would
have to mail out 2.8 million IPO packets on the eve of the offering
_ a major and expensive hurdle. The procedure would push back the
IPO by weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   The delays could be dangerous, Hancock lawyer Bruce Skrine said,
because two other mutual giants, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
and Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, plan IPOs around April.
``It's better for us to be at the front of the line, not the
back,'' added Stephen L. Brown, Hancock's chairman and outgoing
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock defended its plan to offer top executives first-time
stock incentives one year after the IPO. ``Stockholders these days
definitely prefer to have management incented by stock,'' Brown
said. The insurer originally wanted to dole out goodies only six
months later but was rebuffed by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also assailed Hancock's plan to set aside $150 million
in IPO proceeds to pay shareholder dividends. Under law the money
should go to policyholders, not shareholders, according to consumer
advocate and Boston lawyer Jason Adkins.
</P>
<P>
   Pezzulli, the Dallas lawyer, who is suing Hancock on behalf of a
disgruntled policyholder, attacked Hancock's plan to establish a
``closed block'' of assets to protect policyholder dividends. The
block, he said, was underfunded and assumed too high a return _ a
matter that could pit policyholders against shareholders in a scrum
for limited dividends.

JUPITER PROBE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW PLANETS FORMED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES GLANZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A probe that plummeted into Jupiter's atmosphere late in 1995,
sampling its composition for the first time, found more than twice
the concentration of volatile elements like argon and nitrogen than
expected, raising questions about standard theories of how the
planets formed.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which a team of scientists led by Dr. Tobias Owen
of the University of Hawaii is reporting in Thursday's issue of
Nature, suggest that at least some of the rocky, icy bits of dust
and ice that crashed together to form Jupiter _ cometlike bodies
called planetesimals _ must have originated under cooler conditions
than prevail in the region of the solar system where the planet
orbits now. Otherwise the planetesimals would not have been cold
enough to trap the volatile gases, which would have been dispersed
among the other tenuous matter in interplanetary space.
</P>
<P>
   The observations, some researchers said, could mean that some
planetesimals rained down on the forming planet from the colder,
outer reaches of the solar system that are farther from the warmth
of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Other planetary scientists suggested that the results imply that
the whirling disk of dust, gas and rock in the young solar system,
called the solar nebula, simply shaded the sun's light more than
expected in standard theories.
</P>
<P>
   There is even the bizarre possibility that Jupiter formed as
much as 10 times farther from the sun than it is now, and somehow
lumbered inward to its present position. Most scientists dismissed
that possibility as extremely unlikely, but said the results
nevertheless posed a challenge for theories of planet formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specific pattern they find is puzzling,'' said Dr.
Jonathan I. Lunine, a professor of planetary science at the
University of Arizona, ``and it seems to require that the
planetesimals that carried these materials into Jupiter came from
very, very cold regions.''
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion could mean that the planetesimals came from near
where the more distant planets Uranus and Neptune are now, or from
still farther out, said Dr. Alan P. Boss, an astrophysicist at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, he said, is that the strong gravity of the forming
planet pulled in objects from slightly outside its present orbit,
and that the nebula was shaded more completely than earlier
estimates had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a new constraint saying, `Well, it had to be
cooler yet,''' Boss said.
</P>
<P>
   The data was collected in December 1995 when a probe set loose
from the Galileo spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, plunged into
the planet's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A device in the probe sorted the gases by mass and transmitted
data that, after extensive analysis, yielded concentrations of
carbon, sulfur, argon, xenon and krypton as compared to that of
hydrogen, the most common element in the cosmos, said Dr. Sushil
Atreya, a planetary scientist at the University of Michigan and
another collaborator on the work. A different technique determined
the nitrogen content, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the concentrations were two or three times as high as
those observed on the sun, Atreya said. Since the solar
concentration should reflect the composition of the warm, inner
portion of the solar nebula he said, the overall results were
unexpected.

 &HT;    Hopes rising on Holocaust claims
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No amount of money can buy justice.
</P>
<P>
   And, certainly, not when you are talking about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   That was the reminder Wednesday from a member of the Jewish
Claims Committee trying to help survivors from the Nazi era as he
spoke to the General Assembly of United Jewish Communities in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Topic A of late has been the effort to provide some
reimbursement for Jews who were forced into slave labor during that
period, and German companies _ under pressure from class-action
lawsuits _ now are offering up to $5.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That betters a previous $3.2 billion offer _ two-thirds from
industry, one-third from the government. But lawyers representing
victims have been demanding more than $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No survivor will get rich,'' Gregory Schneider, assistant
executive vice president of the Jewish Claims Conference, told
delegates to the assembly, which continues through Sunday. ``Most
survivors will receive a token for the destruction of their entire
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said negotiations over the issue in Bonn, Germany,
started disastrously Tuesday, but ``the sides began to bridge a
little bit'' Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate negotiated result, Schneider said,
``Justice, morality, will never be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's workshop _ attended by delegates from Tel Aviv,
North Carolina and Virginia, among other places _ was one of
several at the gathering that tackled weighty world topics
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sharing together all kinds of things and ideas,'' said
Gaby Blauer of Jerusalem, a project coordinator for Jewish
Healthcare International, which provides volunteer health care to
Jews in Eastern Europe. The group was established in part by the
Jewish Federation of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This General Assembly is the first of the annual sessions to
include a presentation by the Society for Humanistic Judaism, a
controversial movement that embraces Jewish culture but promotes a
philosophy relying on human solutions, not the belief in an
all-knowing God.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Sherwin Wine, founder of the Secular Humanistic Jewish
movement, said his organization is critical to the survival of the
Jewish community because it provides an outlet for those
``searching for their Jewish identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what made his view uniquely Jewish if his advice drew from
human experience, panel member and Rabbinic student Adam Chalom
said, ``My title. Maybe the jokes I tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalom said his school's Torah _ the religious law of the Jewish
faith _ is kept in the library instead of in a more exalted ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a book among other Jewish books,'' Chalom said. ``We're
dealing with it as Jewish literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Some objected to the workshop's title _ ``Humanistic Judaism: A
Powerful Alternative for Cultural Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Julius Berman, board member of the United Jewish Appeal
Federation of New York, told the Jewish paper Forward last week
that he is ``disturbed about the way this was escalated and
isolated as something unique and special.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wine was hosting about 40 people at his workshop, nearly
400 other delegates attended a meeting of the Jewish Agency for
Israel. That group focused on rescuing Jews facing crises
worldwide, in places like Kosovo, Chechnya and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   More people attended the forum than expected, exhausting the
supply of tuna and turkey sandwiches and delaying the presentation
while more chairs were brought in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews,'' the agency's Robert Goldberg announced as delegates
shuffled about the Marquis IV ballroom, ``are accustomed to
problems. But there is no problem here having more in attendance
than we expected.''

PAKISTAN'S NEW LEADER AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF AND HIS COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARRY BEARAK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan _ Gen. Pervez Musharraf was running behind
schedule again Wednesday, with top posts still to fill, hundreds of
the corrupt yet to arrest, back taxes to collect and policies to
reconsider. His post-coup government is only five weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he splits his time between the capital, Islamabad,
and nearby Rawalpindi, home of the army headquarters. Since he
ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Oct. 12, Musharraf has had
both the military and the government to run, though the government
is now the work he considers the more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is the bigger task that has been given to me by
destiny,'' he said in an interview, sitting ramrod straight in his
unwrinkled khaki uniform.
</P>
<P>
   His style is becoming familiar. His manner is forceful, his
voice calm, his grin triumphant. He admires candor, especially in
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a realist,'' he said several times. ``I am not a
diplomat.''
</P>
<P>
   When Musharraf speaks, the words seem to flow directly from the
heart, though the logic of what he says often veers into some odd
twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   Most assuredly, he said, Sharif, who has been detained and kept
away from his family and lawyers since the coup, will be given ``an
absolutely fair and transparent trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The new governing structure is ``entirely civilian,'' the
general said, except that the military will monitor everything to
correct problems that it sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody monitors the military,'' the general said, somewhat
perplexed by a follow-up question. ``The military has its own
monitoring system.''
</P>
<P>
   These are strange days in this nation of 150 million people
divided among those who have lost most of their faith in government
and those who have lost it all.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy has enjoyed only a sporadic life here, and it has
almost always been a disappointment. The last four elected
governments _ two under Sharif and two under Benazir Bhutto _ have
failed to complete their terms as allegations of gross corruption
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which has ruled for more than half the nation's
52-year history, has been a less unstable, if not always a less
uninspiring, institution.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the general's takeover has been welcomed with
enthusiasm by most Pakistanis, even those who champion democracy.
Many leading civilians have joined the government, agreeing that
corruption and cronyism have to be weeded out of by a stern
military hand before the political landscape is again ready for
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, 56, frequently uses the language of a populist. He
has declared war on fat cats who have willfully defaulted on bank
loans, and indeed the arrests of some of the debt-laden elite began
Wednesday. He seeks a ``devolution of power'' to the grass-roots,
and he said he wanted to make war on poverty and ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the general said, he has no idea when the
nation will again be ready for democracy. His tenure as army chief
is scheduled to end in October 2001. But he said he had given no
thought to whether that date should be honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fulfill this task to the best of my ability,''
Musharraf said. ``And in fulfilling this task, I will look into
this aspect of whether I should retire in the year 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is the newest nuclear power. It also has $32 billion in
foreign debt and is nearly bankrupt. International lenders have
frequently suggested reducing military spending, an idea that
Musharraf is quick to dismiss. On the other hand, he said, he has
no intention of competing with India, the archrival, in a nuclear
arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on a strategy of minimum deterrence,'' he said,
adding that Pakistani intelligence agencies were well versed in
India's more ambitious plans for a nuclear arsenal. ``We are not
concerned with a mathematical ratio and proportion. We understand
and we have quantified our own minimum deterrence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He was sitting in the conference room of the army secretariat.
On one wall was an enormous painting of the Battle of Chawinda,
with Pakistani soldiers firing on Indian tanks in 1965. On another
wall was a set of photographs of artillery placements in the
Siachen Glacier area, where the Pakistanis have been fighting the
Indians for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf said he wanted peace with India, but he had no kind
words for that nation's leaders. He said they refused to negotiate
in good faith when it came to Kashmir. ``They want to sidetrack it,
sideline it,'' he said. ``That is their strategy. Let me very
clearly say that I am not playing that game.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Delhi, Musharraf is widely viewed as the architect of
``the Kargil operation,'' a military foray this year into the stark
mountains on the Indian side of Kashmir. Heavy combat almost led to
a fourth all-out war between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   The general does not disavow his role, but he said the
government and military were in agreement on Kargil. Two briefings
were given to Sharif in November or December last year, he said,
and there was another meeting in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a much more aggressive man than I was,'' said
Musharraf, adding that the prime minister would sometimes jest
about making a formidable attack on Srinigar, the summer capital of
the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The two men more or less got along back then. He was troubled by
Sharif's ineffective governance, the general said. But rather than
consider a coup, the general tried to think of ways that the
military could help.
</P>
<P>
   A breach began to open when the prime minister started a
``whispering campaign'' among the top army leaders, trying to
divide the officer corps, Musharraf said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, while the general was returning from Sri Lanka, the
prime minister dismissed him. Musharraf said he had no inkling of
being shoved aside until his flight back from Sri Lanka, on a
commercial jet with 198 passengers aboard, was denied permission to
land in Karachi. The crew alerted him to the problem. Air-traffic
control had directed the pilot to leave Pakistan. The plane had
only enough fuel to make it to India.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them we'd do that only over my dead body,'' Musharraf
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the general's reckoning, the prime minister was plotting
treason, kidnapping and murder, commanding the control tower in
such a way that the plane and all its passengers would die.
Vehicles blocked the landing strips in Karachi. Runway lights had
been switched off.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, as the general recounted, his officers realized
what was happening and took over the tower, letting the plane land
safely, with seven minutes of fuel remaining. The coup, then, was
``a very disciplined and spontaneous reaction'' by the military,
``showing their concern and their sincerity and loyalty to the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few seconds, the general seemed to reflect on that fine
memory. It made him grin in that now familiar way of his _
triumphantly.

CONCERN ABOUT CHECHNYA, EARTHQUAKES, HANGS OVER SUMMIT MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Two specters hang over the summit meeting
that is bringing more than 50 world leaders to Istanbul this week.
</P>
<P>
   One is the war raging in Chechnya, where Russia's campaign to
crush a separatist rebellion has prompted sharp Western criticism
of the devastating impact on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict hangs like a dark cloud over the summit meeting of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
starts Thursday. The organization aims to be a guarantor against
such conflicts and a strong advocate of human rights. Its
credibility may be damaged if it can do nothing to stop the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting an exchange of harsh words, but not much more,''
said an American delegate. ``It reminds me of our summit in
Budapest five years ago. We had a big party while Sarajevo was
being bombed 100 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   Many European leaders have criticized Russia's tactics in
Chechnya, and one of them, President Lennart Meri of Estonia, has
announced that he would boycott the Istanbul conference to protest
the ``tragic events'' there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The OSCE prefers to hold a celebration,'' he said, ``but it
should come to act.''
</P>
<P>
   While political instability in Chechnya is the issue that the
summit meeting cannot avoid, geological instability beneath
Turkey's soil is on the minds of more than a few delegates. This
part of the world has been shaken by a series of earthquakes over
the last three months, including one in August that killed more
than 17,000 people and another last Friday that killed more than
500. And seismologists agree that a major quake is likely to hit
Istanbul. They say it can come tomorrow or several decades from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to calm fears that the big quake may be imminent, the
country's most prominent seismologist, Ahmet Mete Isikara, urged
Turks and delegates to the meeting: ``Don't believe ill-intentioned
rumors. Listen only to scientists. We will not hesitate to inform
you if we detect unusual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from the 54 countries that are members of the security
organization have been in Istanbul for more than a week preparing
for the two-day meeting of presidents and prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, some of the diplomats were speculating that President
Boris Yeltsin of Russia may stay home rather than come to Istanbul
to face what is certain to be severe criticism of Russia's military
operation in Chechnya. But he arrived Wednesday after saying that
he would tell other leaders that they have ``no right to blame
Russia for destroying bandits and terrorists on its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   That view puts Yeltsin on a collision course with nearly every
other leader who will be here, including President Clinton. Clinton
told the Turkish Parliament on Monday that Russia's ``use of
indiscriminate force against civilians is wrong'' and that it would
``exacerbate the very tensions Russia wants to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the security organization is primarily European,
Clinton became the dominant presence at this week's meeting even
before arriving. ``He's the reason everyone else is coming,'' said
one European diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is accomplished here will likely be achieved on the
margin of the summit talks rather than in formal discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already won one victory by exerting
behind-the-scenes pressure that led leaders of the Turks and Greeks
on the divided island of Cyprus to agree to indirect talks in New
York next month.
</P>
<P>
   While in Istanbul, he is scheduled to hold separate meetings
with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. He hopes to prod
them toward settling their bitter dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh
region, which the world recognizes as part of Azerbaijan but which
is occupied by ethnic Armenian fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to urge European leaders to support
Turkey's effort to become an official candidate for membership in
the European Union. They are to make a decision at a meeting in
Helsinki next month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many other sessions that will be held around Istanbul
will be one between Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece and his
Turkish counterpart, Bulent Ecevit. Both have said they are eager
to end the hostility that has divided their countries for
generations.

IRA'S GESTURE; UNIONISTS' CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To reassure Ulster Unionists that it is serious about making
peace, the Irish Republican Army has to give up, or
``decommission,'' a significant number of its weapons. The Unionist
refusal to enter a government with the IRA's political agent, Sinn
Fein, has not produced the desired decommissioning. Now former
senator George Mitchell has masterfully negotiated a compromise
that brings the IRA closer to providing proof that its war is over.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has persuaded the Unionists' David Trimble, Sinn Fein's
Gerry Adams, and the IRA leadership to issue a series of linked
statements expressing a Unionist commitment to join Sein Fein in
the Northern Irish government, a Sinn Fein renunciation of
violence, and an IRA willingness to begin the decommissioning
process.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA did not, however, explicitly promise to give up weapons.
This is an important sticking point for Unionists and explains why
a majority of Trimble's party in the Northern Ireland Assembly
refused to endorse the compromise. He will have another chance to
win Unionist support when the 860-person party executive meets on
Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, the IRA said it is ``willing to
further enhance the peace process'' and will appoint an
intermediary to begin talks with the decommissioning panel as soon
as the Northern Ireland government envisioned in the Good Friday
agreement is up and running. Unionists ought to endorse the
Mitchell compromise to test the IRA's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 18-month impasse following the referendum on the
Good Friday agreement, British troops are off the streets, and
Unionists are cooperating with Sinn Fein in some local governments.
But there are enough pockets of the old antagonisms to raise
legitimate fears that if the peace process does not take its next
logical step _ the formation of a provincial government _ violence
will inevitably escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble understands this prospect, which is why he has braved
dissent within his party to negotiate the compromise. Unionists who
want to get the guns out of the politics of Northern Ireland need
to follow his lead.

DEFENDING CHECHNYA IN ISTANBUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The specter of Russia's savage assault on Chechnya hovers over
the meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe that begins Thursday in Istanbul. Russia's President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have warned that they
will not tolerate sermons from Western leaders about the bombing
and shelling of Chechen towns and villages or the suffering of more
than 200,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing of Belgrade lessened the West's moral
authority. But when he meets with Yeltsin and Putin, President
Clinton can hardly pretend that their hands are not covered in
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton must worry about continued cooperation in the
dismantling of Russian missiles and the prevention of nuclear
proliferation, he needs to weigh these US interests against other
considerations. The Kremlin's war aims and tactics are creating an
ominous precedent. Russian generals are bent on punishing the
Chechen population for having won its 1994-96 war for independence
and on recapturing the lost territory of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In an offensive justified by exaggerated charges of Chechen
terrorism and infused with racist contempt for all Chechens, the
Kremlin is putting the peoples of the Caucasus on notice that
Russia intends to retrieve a dominant position in that
resource-rich region. Russia's defense minister, Igor Sergeyev,
revived old patterns last Friday when he told a gathering of
generals: ``The United States' national interests require that the
military conflict in the North Caucasus, fanned from the outside,
keeps constantly smoldering.''
</P>
<P>
   The political danger from this sort of propaganda is obvious.
Nationalist pride and paranoia may supplant a rational debate about
Russia's true difficulties in upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should press hard for a cease-fire in Chechnya and offer
international mediation to address Russian concerns about terrorism
and criminal gangs. He should also make it plain that Russia has no
chance at its goal of becoming a ``normal'' country as long as
Yeltsin emulates the aggressive behavior of his predecessors.

   MODERN-MUSEUM-ART (New York) _ ``Modern Starts: People, Places

Museum of Modern Art is fanning the siecle, as it were, while also
examining its unparalleled collection and the way it has
historically been shaped and presented. (``Places'' and ``Things''
are on view through March 14, ``People'' through Feb. 1.) With some
additions fore and aft, ``Modern Starts,'' concentrates on
1880-1920 (the second part, opening in March, looks at 1920-1960;
the third, which arrives next fall, at 1960-2000.) Its organizing
team, headed by John Elderfield, chief curator-at-large, and Peter
Reed, the curator of the department of design and architecture,

fast, and there's no new Skeet Ulrich with a film about to pop out
of the pipeline, and being the last anything of the century is
quite a matter of chance. But it is true that Hoffman is going to
end the year in sensational style, appearing in three
buzz-generating movies _ along with ``Flawless,'' in which he
appears opposite Robert De Niro, he is in Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' and Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''

peculiarly cheered by it as I was by the current production. As
staged at the Royal Theater by James Naughton (a Tony winner for
his grand performance as Billy Flynn in ``Chicago'', this
``Price,'' like Michael Mayer's recent production of ``A View From
the Bridge,'' realizes all of the text's dangerous tensile
strength. It is both immensely satisfying and, in a way that
straight plays are not often cited for, entertaining. By Vincent

   LION-KING-THEATER (London) _ Of all the current theater plays in
London, what has left even The Sunday Times's intellectually
rigorous John Peter crying ``wonderful, wonderful'' is Julie
Taymor's restaging of her Broadway production of Disney's ``Lion
King'' at the Lyceum Theater: a judgment confirmed by reports that
the show is booking until next September and that some Londoners
are mortgaging their mothers to meet the prices the scalpers are
asking for seats. By Benedict Nightingale. (Moved).

   BALLET-HISPANICO (New York) _ When Tina Ramirez established the
Ballet Hispanico school and company in 1970, it was a revolutionary
act. Hispanics not only had few dance schools, they also had
trouble getting into dance companies, an almost unimaginable
situation now with the dazzling Hispanic dancers in mainstream
ballet and modern companies. This fall Ms. Ramirez and her
groundbreaking enterprise won two major honors. In September, she
received the Hispanic Heritage Award for Education at the Kennedy
Center in Washington. Since its founding, almost 10,000 children
have studied at the Ballet Hispanico School, which now enrolls 600
students yearly for classes in Spanish, modern and jazz dance and
ballet. By Valerie Gladstone. (Moved).

   AMERICAN-DANCE (Undated) _ There could be little argument that
``A Celebration of 100 Years of American Dance on Film'' was one of

and in the relationship between dance and the electronic media. By

Feldman wrote few works for orchestra, yet in the three works here
_ ``Coptic Light,'' ``Piano and Orchestra'' and ``Cello and
Orchestra'' (Argo 448 513-2; CD) _ the more varied palette provides
an ideal entry point into his unique sound world, less daunting and
ascetic than the composer's chamber music. By Lawrence A. Johnson.

response to most of the songs on Beck Hansen's fifth album,
``Midnite Vultures'' _ so much so that it could be called a comedy
record. But it's a comedy record in the sense that intelligent
directors make comedy films: it's one big aesthetic disposition,

   MILLENNIAL-ART (Undated) _ Millennial thinking resonates through
American politics, from Manifest Destiny to the ``vision thing''
any presidential hopeful is still required to spin out. It has
always been there in high art: in the nationalist allegories of
Hudson River School landscape painting, in Social Realism with its
demand for a new order, in Abstract Expressionism with its
commitment to the sublime. And nowhere is millennialism more
consistently explored than in vernacular culture. This fact makes
``Millennial Dreams: Vision and Prophecy in American Folk Art,''

   MUFFLER-MEN-ART (Los Angeles) _ Produced by mechanics in the
shops where they work, muffler men are being made as advertising
art, proliferating as roadside attractions outside the shops
throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Their makers _ most
are Hispanic _ repaint them frequently to keep them looking shiny
new. But they weather fast, lasting for no more than a couple of
years. So far, very few figures appear to have survived long enough
to show up in flea markets and art shows, and that may explain why
most people have no idea what muffler men are. Now muffler men are
moving into the world of art. In an exhibition at the Fowler Museum
of Cultural History at the University of California at Los Angeles,
``Muffler Men, Munecos and Other Welded Wonders,'' is the first
museum exhibition devoted entirely to these figures. On display

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Clinton's state visit to Turkey has
featured plenty of official meetings, dinners and speeches. But it
has not been all work and no play.
</P>
<P>
   With time to spare before a European security meeting with the
leaders of more than 50 nations here on Thursday, the president has
taken in many of Turkey's cultural gems. Earlier in the week, he
removed his black cowboy boots and walked in stocking feet across
the carpet of the spectacular Blue Mosque, a high point in Ottoman
architecture built on the orders of the Sultan Ahmet I in the early
1700s. ``I'm so honored to be here,'' Clinton said softly to Imam
Emrullah Hatipoglu, the imam of the mosque, who welcomed the
president, his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their daughter,
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The president descended into the Underground Palace, a dimly lit
cistern that was featured in the James Bond movie ``From Russia
With Love'' more than a century after the Byzantines constructed it
to store the city's water supply. There, he walked past dozens of
stone columns as the soft rhythmic tones of an ancient Turkish
flute created a haunting atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday he strolled through the marble ruins of Ephesus,
where one of the Seven Wonders of the World _ the Temple of Artemis
_ was erected in 550 B.C. With security officials perched in the
surrounding hills, the president paused to admire the grassy Upper
Agora, once a marketplace and public square, and Trajan's Fountain,
which dates to 102 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton is an engaged tourist, gazing intently at
artifacts and offering observations to his tour guides, he also has
shown that he has his limits.
</P>
<P>
   In the old city of Istanbul on Tuesday, Clinton signed the guest
book at the Haghia Sophia, a cavernous museum that was built as a
Christian cathedral in 360 A.D. In 1453, it was converted into a
mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the Byzantine
name for Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, dressed in dark slacks and a black leather flight
jacket, took a pass on a ritual practiced by many visitors to the
dimly lit museum, widely considered one of the grandest religious
structures anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it, according to local guides, that if one presses
one's thumb into a special spot on a towering stone column, the
restorative powers of St. Gregory the Miracle Worker go into
effect. Clinton walked on with a dry thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling Lighter
</P>
<P>
   One of the officials who has been frequently at Clinton's side
during his state visit to Turkey is Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser. Make that a new slimmed-down version of
Berger. Thanks to a special diet that he did not want to go into,
Berger has lost 35 pounds in recent months. So svelte is he now
that he and his wife had run out to Saks Fifth Avenue a few days
before the trip to have his suits altered.
</P>
<P>
   There was a foreign policy connection to Berger's weight loss.
During the recent confrontation with the Senate over the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the presidential aide joked to Trent
Lott, the Senate majority leader, that he would fast until the
Senate approved the landmark agreement. Lott, a Mississippi
Republican, told Berger he would likely not eat again _ and the
Senate went on to defeat the pact soundly last month.
</P>
<P>
   Affection is Mutual &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to Turkey, longer than previous visits by George
Bush and Dwight Eisenhower, has given him gushing coverage in the
local media, and some interesting momentos. He received handmade
clay sculptures from some young earthquake victims, a prestigious
state award from President Suleyman Demirel, a Bible verse on
parchment from Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and a watercolor
scene of boats along the Bosporus from the American-Turkish
Business Council. Clinton said he would treasure them all, and
would hang the painting in his new home in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Just as heart warming have been the banner headlines praising
Clinton for his efforts to strengthen ties between the United
States and Turkey and advocate Turkey's admission to the European
Union. ``Politicians, academicians, labor unions and the public
were very happy to hear from the U.S. president how vital Turkey
will be for the whole world in the next century,'' said an article
in the English-language Turkish Daily News. In Sabah, one of the
country's largest dailies, a screaming headline over a story on
Clinton's speech to the National Assembly called the president:
``LIKE A TURK.''
</P>
<P>
   Further down on the front page, however, was a related story
that left one member of the White House press corps red faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``LIKE AN AMERICAN,'' said the headline, which was coupled with
two photographs of a female reporter with her legs extended over
the seats in front of her during the National Assembly session. The
photo captain called her a ``mini-skirted journalist'' and poked
fun at her relaxed posture during the official proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   What the paper left out is that a delay in Clinton's speech
meant that American reporters were treated to well over an hour of
parliamentary debate on some rather contentious topic, all in
Turkish, of course. And a closer inspection would have shown other
correspondents in the pack with their legs down but their eyes
shut.

 &HT;    `Timeline' his latest mix of science, letters
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you watch Michael Crichton _ author of ``Jurassic Park,''
creator of TV's ``ER'' _ striding toward you across a hotel lobby,
it gives new meaning to the term ``high-concept writer.'' Crichton
is 6-foot-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing about being so tall,'' says the world's
wealthiest novelist, who earned $65 million last year, ``aside from
transportation, is that cocktail parties are a horror. You can't
hear a thing that's being said.'' Pause. ``Or maybe that's a
blessing,'' he adds with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   With Crichton, 57, the pauses are refreshing. And puzzling. This
is one careful, thoughtful _ wary, perhaps? _ scribe. After
grousing that the morning talk-show appearances for his newest
novel, ``Timeline,'' wear him down, he begins, ``The trouble with
television ... '' and then lapses into a pause long enough for some
celebrities to thank all their their closest friends and members of
the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he continues: `` ... is that it's so hard to say
anything meaningful in that amount of time, and yet it's so easy to
look like an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much chance of that, with his intellect. ``Timeline'' is a
tale _ due to be a Paramount film by Richard Donner (``Superman'')
_ of young scientists using quantum physics to travel to a parallel
universe. They become embroiled with the power struggles and
romantic intrigues of a 14th-century France coexisting in the same
moment with contemporary America.
</P>
<P>
   In brief: another, typically high Crichton concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is America's H.G. Wells,'' says author John Gregory
Dunne, a friend for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Knopf novel, for which Crichton (pronounced CRY-tun) is
believed to have been paid about $10 million, is rich with
cutting-edge technology and taut storytelling, in keeping with his
unusual resume of science and letters. Raised on Long Island, he
studied anthropology at Harvard, taught the subject at Cambridge,
put himself through Harvard Medical School by writing suspense
novels under various ali-
</P>
<P>
   ases. Just for a laugh, he lifted one of his noms de plume from
a real-life 17th-century dwarf. Crichton kept his voracious hunger
for science but switched his career to writer.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 30, the lean, handsome Crichton had published
two best sellers under his own name (``The Andromeda Strain,''
``Terminal Man''), had directed and written the screenplay for
``Westworld,'' established himself as a busy Hollywood bachelor
after divorcing the first of four wives. (Steve Martin once
famously asked him, ``Don't you believe in premarital sex?'')
</P>
<P>
   With all these accomplishments and no clear goal, Crichton was
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   So for the first time in his life, he took some serious time
off.
</P>
<P>
   But with Crichton, even leisure is intense. As he relates in
1988's ``Travels,'' a book of nonfiction that gushes with the
self-revelation absent from his novels, the writer tried to go just
about everywhere and do just about everything. Dodging a raging
elephant in Africa. Scuba diving within arm's reach of sharks in
the South Pacific. Touring a brothel of school-age girls in Bangkok
(Crichton waited outside while his friend partook). Having a demon,
or ``dark entity,'' exorcised from his spirit. Bringing himself to
forgive his late father, an Advertising Age editor whom he called
``a mean son of a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The journeys of self-discovery, Crichton writes, raised his
energy level even higher when he returned to serious work in the
mid-80s. His 1987 marriage to screenwriter Anne-Marie Martin (they
collaborated on the ``Twister'' script) and the birth of their
daughter the following year brought long-belated peace.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, his rigorous exercise _ scuba diving, 14-mile hikes
_ is part of keeping himself in emotional balance. When it's
mentioned that ``Harry Potter'' author J.K. Rowling had to wear a
wrist brace from signing so many books, Crichton _ who signed at
Chapter 11 Discount Bookstore at Ansley Mall Wednesday (after
viewing the Norman Rockwell exhibit at the High Museum) _ cracked,
``I'm toughened up; I'm in shape.'' He seems almost abashed to
admit that he no longer runs 10Ks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical activity,'' Crichton says, ``has the nice quality of
stopping mental activity.'' He reaches up, still looking a bit
groggy, and massages his forehead with a rueful smile. ``Stopping
the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about as close to ``opening up'' as this seemingly
impervious, flaw-free man will get in an interview. Even old crony
Dunne keeps finding out things he never suspected about his fellow
writer. Once they were walking along the Malibu beach with Dunne's
wife, Joan Didion, and she described to the ex-doctor some
neurological symptoms that had her physicians baffled. Crichton
guessed multiple sclerosis, and the diagnosis proved correct. When
Dunne asked Crichton how he knew, he answered, ``Because I have it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the wondrously tall, sinewy Crichton looks healthy enough
to run Bill Bradley, a contemporary, off a basketball court. But
his deep emotional reserve is still palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is so strict about keeping his private life from
getting entwined with his work,'' says Lynn Nesbit, his longtime
agent, ``that some people don't know about his generosity of
spirit. I've seen him organize these wonderful overseas adventures
for his friends and siblings, so I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Crichton and his family have homes in suburban New York, Hawaii
and Los Angeles, but the last rarely gets used these days. Cutting
back on his writing and screenwriting duties in Hollywood _ ``A
place where you can't learn about much except treachery, where
people act all the time,'' he declares _ Crichton settled down in
the '90s to write ``Jurassic Park,'' ``The Lost World,''
``Airframe.'' ``Disclosure'' revolved around a man being sexually
harassed, then being accused of the same, by a female exec;
``Rising Sun'' around the business practices of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton's still smarting from being labeled the cranky
reactionary. He got a feminist earful from Elizabeth Wurtzel in her
book, ``Bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were whole rooms of people furiously debating books they
had obviously not read,'' he growls. ``It taught me that our
culture will reduce any serious argument to its most simplistic
sound bite.''
</P>
<P>
   And now comes ``Timeline.'' Which raises the question: Are there
indeed parallel universes, and will people visit them, and travel
through time, during our lifetime?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is serious debate on this, which means you can't rule it
out,'' observes Crichton, whose science fiction is often right on
the cusp of real scientific discovery. ``The instantaneous
teleportation of information has actually taken place, in three
experiments. `Beam me up, Scotty' is not such a far-fetched idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Jurassic' came out, people said cloning of mammals was
20 years away, but Dolly (the cloned ewe) came along in four. Now,
If I had to plunk down a quarter and make a bet, I'd say none of us
will live long enough to see an actual time machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another patented Crichton pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' he adds, grinning, ``I'm a conservative guy.''

GARBER ABOLISHES SHOOTOUTS IN MLS MATCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Garber has moved quickly to make his mark on soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Garber, who replaced Doug Logan as MLS commissioner in August,
announced Wednesday the abolishment of the postmatch shootout,
indicating that the league will promote substance over gimmicks.
Further, the game clock will count up to 45 minutes for each half
and will be controlled directly by the referee, who will signal the
amount of injury time, in accordance with FIFA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shootout will survive as a tie-breaker for the MLS
Cup final between Los Angeles and D.C. United at Foxboro Stadium
Sunday, the change in the clock will be unveiled in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an assumption that the American soccer fan is
different than soccer fans from outside the US,'' Garber said
Wednesday. ``But there are millions of players, from 5-year-olds to
amateurs to professionals in this country who play the game
(according to FIFA rules) on a regular basis, and the league has
bypassed this market and underestimated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, we based our marketing on future fans. We have to go
back and shore up our existence with the core soccer fan and build
the model with the core fans, and it took the league a couple of
years to realize this. There was a negativity buzzing among the
hardest-core fans that reached a momentum that we had to address.
We do know from our research that there are approximately 60
million people in this country that consider themselves soccer
fans. We don't have 60 million people going to our games.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the MLS competition committee to shoot down the
shootout was unanimous, Garber said. But that is only because of
Garber's ability to not only build consensus, but unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Garber, 41, certainly knows about a tough sell, having made his
reputation by promoting the NFL in Europe. And though Garber had
only minimal knowledge of soccer, he gained ``an enormous respect''
for the game by closely observing it England, Germany, and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But Garber appears to understand that simple, subtle changes can
have profound effects and are preferable to drastic,
smoke-and-mirrors alterations, especially in a sport with such a
long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   MLS regular-season ties will progress to a 10-minute
sudden-death overtime. And the point system will be 3-1-0
(win-tie-loss), as in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Garber also has made progress behind the scenes, apparently
helping to reassure sponsors, three of whom renewed commitments
through 2003 this week, and stabilizing relations with
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more consistency in the ABC/ESPN telecasts in an
attempt to capture ``destination viewing.'' Next season will start
in mid-March, and 28 games will be shown on 19 consecutive
Saturdays from June to September. Also, a 60-minute highlights show
will air on Monday, likely starting at 11 p.m. on the East Coast.
The regular season will end in mid-September and the MLS Cup final
will be in early October, likely in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that three of the four sponsors have decided
to continue their commitment,'' ESPN vice president Steve Risser
said, ``and that there will be a shorter, more concise schedule.
The MLS is young; it is still in a growth pattern. When we started
in 1996 we did not set high expectations for the league. Our job is
to build ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Risser said MLS ratings are similar to NHL regular-season
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MLS will have three divisions _ West (Colorado, Kansas City,
Los Angeles, San Jose), Central (Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Tampa
Bay), and East (D.C. United, Miami, MetroStars, Revolution) . . .
More than 35,000 tickets have been sold for Sunday's game, and
Revolution CEO Brian O'Donovan said a crowd of more than 40,000 is
expected . . . The Univision programming announcement is expected
Friday . . . Jay Heaps of the Miami Fusion was named MLS Rookie of
the Year. Heaps played 32 games during the regular season and
playoffs, displaying his athleticism and speed at right back after
spending most of amateur career as an attacking player. ``That is
the best position for me, but it took a few games for me to get
settled,'' Heaps said during a presentation Boston Common
Wednesday. ``Right now, I'm taking 2 1/2 weeks off. After my season
at Duke, I went right into basketball, then trained at Feyenoord in
Holland and went right to the college All-Star game in Fort
Lauderdale. I've had six days off in the last year.''

   ATLANTA _ Breathing in the rich, earthy scent of Georgia clay, a
group of Orthodox Jews in central DeKalb County, Ga., bury their
worn holy books in an ancient tradition. In her Roswell home, Paula
Shapiro, a Reform Jew, lights Shabbat candles with her children.
And, at Marietta's Etz Chaim, a Conservative synagogue, Irwin Weitz
begins the day with prayer, then schmoozes with fellow congregants
over bagels at a nearby eatery.
</P>
<P>
   This is Judaism as it is practiced in the largest metropolis of
the deep South and, increasingly, around the world. Far from a
monolithic belief system and culture, modern Jewishness ranges from
ultra-orthodox to secular with many variations in between.
</P>
<P>
   As 4,000 Jews gather in Atlanta this week for their 68th General
Assembly, the underlying theme of many of their workshops and
seminars is what it means to be a Jew today. The freedom for Jews
to define their own Jewishness is both a blessing and a bane, say
the Jewish leaders who will address the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important thing about Jewish identity today,
if you look across the span of people who identify themselves as
Jews, is that it's incredibly diverse,'' said Jonathan Woocher,
executive vice president of the Jewish Education Service of North
America, a New York-based agency that promotes Jewish education.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity is the result of changes in society, both among
Jews and among non-Jews, he said. Once Jews had little choice but
to be identified as Jews. Anti-Semitism and life in ghettos or
ethnic enclaves ensured that they were seen as set apart from other
people. In recent decades, those invisible walls no longer hold.
Jews have the freedom to be as fully Jewish as they desire, or to
dispense altogether with their ethnic and religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   As Jews have blended into every aspect of American life, they
have intermingled and intermarried with other religious and ethnic
groups. Those who care deeply about the continuity of the Jewish
people see this widespread acceptance as a serious threat to the
preservation of their thousands-of-years-old heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their fears were confirmed by a 1990 National Jewish
Population Survey published by the Council of Jewish Federations.
The study showed that while 68 percent of all married born Jews
were also married to someone born Jewish, the choice of marriage
partners changed dramatically in the latter half of the century. By
1985, twice as many Jews married Gentiles as married other Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling to Jewish leaders, only 28 percent of the
children of mixed households were being raised Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, American Jews, once focused on the survival of
Israel, turned their attention to the survival of their own
community, said Kenneth Stein, professor of contemporary Middle
Eastern history and Israeli studies at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about how will Jews survive in the
assimilationist environment in America,'' said Stein. ``How do you
sustain Jewishness? How do you be sure that your kids don't
intermarry? How do you keep traditions and customs going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is that we want people to have the freedom to
leave,'' said Arnold Eisen, chair of the department of religious
studies at Stanford University. ``We want them to voluntarily
choose to come. You want to always give them reasons to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers age and the millennium winds down, many Jews are
experiencing a spiritual awakening that is evident in other
segments of American society, said Barry Shrage, president of the
Combinied Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But helping individual Jews find a personal faith is not enough,
said Eisen. Jews must also build strong connections to other Jews.
``We've discovered that what American Jews are after from their
Jewishness is a combination of meaning and community,'' he said.
``When the Jewish world reaches out to people and gives them this
meaning to live for and the feeling that they're part of something
larger than themselves, they respond positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to strengthen Jewish community are centering on three
areas _ serious Jewish learning, caring for Jews in Israel and
throughout the diaspora, and a commitment to social justice, said
Shrage.
</P>
<P>
   Shrage, Eisen and Woocher are all taking part in a session of
the General Assembly on ``Jewish Renaissance and Renewal.'' All say
they see evidence that many Jews, no longer part of ethnic
neighborhoods, are seeking communities through Jewish
organizations. They point to growth in the number of synagogues,
Jewish schools and adult education programs across America as
evidence that people are choosing to connect with their Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, home to an estimated 100,000 Jews, a series of
lay classes for adults in everything from Yiddish to Jewish
spirituality quickly fills to capacity every year. The metro area
now has about two dozen synagogues, from Hassidic to humanistic,
many with current or recently completed building programs. And, the
Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta launched a $50 million
campaign two years ago to expand and spruce up local Jewish schools
and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, the institutions reach a minority of Jews. Only
four in 10 metro Atlanta Jews belong to any Jewish organization,
according to a 1996 study by the Atlanta Jewish Federation, and
fewer than one in five attend synagogue at least monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews go back and forth, being more or less Jewish
religiously and culturally during different times in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Weitz, 45, of Marietta was raised in an Orthodox synagogue and a
``semi-observant'' home by parents who survived the Holocaust, kept
kosher and did not travel on Saturday. But as an adult, his
involvement in Judaism was largely limited to attending synagogue
services during the High Holidays of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he and his family _ a wife and four children _
have ``reconnected.'' He joined Etz Chaim to make certain he could
get tickets to holiday services, and eventually began attending
Shabbat services and even participating in a daily minyan, or
morning prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is a set of values that helps me live my life,'' he
said. ``It is a history of my family and my people. It is important
for my wife and myself to carry forward the traditions and values
that we learned from our parents and that we feel are important and
pass them on to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Benyomin Friedman, 42, believes part of his responsibility
is to help Jews discover the meaning of their Jewishness. While
many people will drift away from their heritage, others will claim
it with renewed vigor precisely because they must consciously
embrace it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community is talking about continuity and wondering
if there will be continuity,'' said Friedman, rabbi of the Orthodox
synagogue Congregation Ariel in Dunwoody. ``This is what I
envision: The number of Jews will drop off greatly but the core
will get stronger. A vibrant core, it will far surpass previous
generations.''

 &HT;    Where to get hard to find items
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to
help you locate it. But due to the volume of mail, we cannot track
down every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the
column will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag.
Write us at Buyer's Edge Find It, Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at
buyersedge(at)ajc.com (please include your name, the city you live
in and daytime phone number); or call 404-582-7642.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you please find Vicks inhaler stick for me? I can't use
the liquid inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharon Dolensek, Lilburn, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can exhale. We found your Vicks Vapor Inhaler at Eckerds,
2480 Briarcliff Road N.E. (404-321-4250) One tube is $3.99.
According to a spokesman, there had been production problems with
the inhaler and it temporarily disappeared from store shelves. But
these problems have been straightened out. The inhaler, according
to the manufacturer, provides relief from nasal congestion due to
colds, hay fever, allergies and sinusitis by shrinking swollen
membranes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand it might be possible to purchase clothing for
women who have physical conditions relating to osteoporosis, for
example, a curving of the back. I feel a lot of people might want
to know about these specially constructed garments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Janet F. Miller, Douglasville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: For an answer, we went right to the source, the National
Osteoporosis Foundation in Washington. Spokeswoman Molly
Natchipolsky says that, so far, no manufacturer makes clothes
specifically for those who suffer from the disease, which causes
compression fractures of the spine. These fractures can cause body
changes: a loss of height, curving of the shoulders and back, a
thickening waistline.
</P>
<P>
   However, the foundation has a booklet, ``Style Wise: A Fashion
Guide for Women With Osteoporosis'' ($2.75 including shipping),
that gives fashion and design tips. The booklet, done in
partnership with the New York's Fashion Institute of Technology,
offers advice on silhouettes, colors and accessories. Sometimes a
simple fix, such as inserting shoulder pads in tops or dresses,
will give immediate balance to sloping shoulders and provide the
illusion of a straighter back and smaller waist. To get the
booklet, send check or money order to: STYL 99, P.O. Box 96616,
Washington, DC 20077-7456.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Aussie Unscented Sprunch Spray. I was last
able to buy it at Target in Lawrenceville. When I went last week,
it was gone and was told the store would probably not have it
anymore. I am almost out. Help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monica
</P>
<P>
   S. Keller, Winder, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Like many companies, Aussie has repackaged and reformulated
some of its products. The bottles are now the color of eggplant
with a magenta logo and might have been off shelves for a short
time while this was done. We found Aussie Unscented Sprunch Spray
(12-ounce bottle, $4.29) at CVS, 2910 Buford Highway N.E.
(404-325-2735). The spray, which provides hold without stickiness
or flaking, now contains Australian Paw Flower, to add shine and
softness to the hair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you help me find Gillette Regular Lather Shave Cream
for my husband Irving who's used it for years? He'd be very
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helena Schussheim, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Brusha, brusha, brusha. According to a company spokeswoman,
few stores stock this product because very few men still use
shaving brushes. However, this lather shave cream, for men who
still use a brush when they shave, is available at Drug Emporium,
2625 Piedmont Road N.E. (404-233-1201). A 4.5-ounce tube is $2.29.
And Gillette's brushless shave cream is also $2.29, at the same
location.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About six weeks ago, I moved to Atlanta from Columbus, Ohio.
After eating most meals in restaurants, my favorite item on any
menu is anything with applewood smoked bacon. It's delicious!
However, I went to Publix, Kroger and Harry's Farmers Market and
didn't see any. Can you tell me where to get it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mari Lappin, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon, you will be able to bring home the bacon. Literally. We
found a 1-pound package of Applewood Smoked Bacon ($6.49) at
eatZi's, 3221 Peachtree Road N.E. (404-237-2266). North Country
Smokehouse in Claremont, N.H., smokes its thick-sliced bacon with
applewood and cures it with maple syrup, says fourth generation
owner/butcher Mike Satzow. Visit the company's Web site at
www.ncsmokehouse.com. Or call 1-800-258-4304.
</P>
<P>
   Another company in Wisconsin, Nueske's Hillcrest Farm, also
smokes it bacon with applewood but cures it with brown sugar and
honey for a sweet smoky flavor. Look for it on the Web at
www.nueske.com. Or call 1-800-392-2266.

CHINA'S FACTORY WORKERS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO ECONOMIC ERAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The middle-aged workers outside the aging Beijing No.
2 textile factory Wednesday said that they already knew their days
of employment were numbered _ that they knew it even before China
signed a landmark agreement this week to open its doors wider to
global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest worry, they said, is not the impact of China's
probable admission to the World Trade Organization. They agree that
it is essential for China's future, and they know that it should
eventually expand the country's exports of textiles, like the
cotton cloth their factory makes.
</P>
<P>
   What worries them now, said the two workers, who stopped for a
discreet conversation, is how well the government will support them
after they get the inevitable notice from their factory, which
sheds more workers every month. Will they get a livable allowance?
What if they need expensive surgery? Will they have any help
finding new jobs in a fast-changing economy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they won't just throw us out into the society,'' said
one of the workers, Wu. Now in his late 40s, he said he doubted
that he could ever find another job, because his health had been
damaged by 28 years of loud noise and cotton dust in the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Wu and a fellow worker, Tang, in his early 50s, spoke candidly
about their fears _ and their surprisingly bitter feelings toward
their factory managers _ on condition that their full names be
concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Workers like these two toiled for a pittance for decades, with
the lifetime promise of a communist state's ``iron rice bowl.''
Now, caught between two economic eras, they feel betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Tang pulled his last pay slip from his pocket and pounded on a
table, his voice quivering. ``Look at this!'' he said. ``Eighty
dollars a month, after 35 years of work!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a pay raise in seven years, but during that
time the wallets of the managers have grown fatter and fatter,''
Tang said. ``In this country the workers have the lowest status.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fears and angers, shared by millions across the country,
add up to one of China's greatest challenges. And it will be even
greater if China fulfills the market-opening commitments it made
Monday to the United States in return for U.S. endorsement of its
application to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge is the creation of a better safety net for the
tens of millions of workers who are being displaced in this
wrenching transition.
</P>
<P>
   Even more daunting than the problem of urban workers, and
receiving far less official attention, is the task of creating new
jobs and lives for millions of inefficient farmers who are expected
to lose out to global trade and may join the country's vast
floating population of migrants who compete for bottom-rung jobs in
the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's social security system is far from ready for the
structural change in employment that would be brought about by WTO
accession,'' concluded a recent report by the China International
Capital Corp., an investment bank in Beijing that is a joint
venture of the Chinese government and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   China has only begun to create Western-style unemployment,
welfare, pension and health insurance systems _ all vital to
smoothing the transition from the old government-run economy to a
modern market one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable that older state enterprises and economic
sectors here are going to lose out,'' said Hu Angang, an economist
at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ``I think it's crucial that
government aid should not go to the losing enterprises to prop them
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the aid should go directly to the laid-off workers.
That's the key to a successful transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been acutely aware of the problem in the last
two years as laid-off workers and retirees in dozens of cities have
held protests when promised subsistence allowances were not paid.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, state enterprises had lifelong obligations to their
workers, including living allowances and medical care for those
laid off. But in the 1990s many ailing or moribund enterprises have
simply had no money to give out.
</P>
<P>
   To stave off spreading unrest, last year the government mandated
the creation of thousands of ``re-employment centers'' in every
city and required local governments to share the costs of living
stipends with laid-off workers' former companies.
</P>
<P>
   Workers enrolled at the centers are supposed to get training and
job referrals, and in the meantime are supposed to receive monthly
subsistence payments of about $20 to $35, depending on the
location.
</P>
<P>
   But the coverage is spotty, and many failing companies still pay
little or nothing to their former employees, leaving them to fend
for themselves. And under current policy, the re-employment centers
are supposed to be phased out at the end of 2001.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The No. 2 textile mill on the east side of Beijing, where Wu and
Tang work, employed about 7,000 workers in the early 1990s. Since
then it has laid off 3,000, with more sent packing every month. The
nearby No. 3 textile factory, which employed 6,000, shut down
entirely in June.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from those plants have no re-employment center, the men
said, and have had to search for new jobs on their own. They are
receiving monthly stipends of $28. A few former co-workers have
found jobs mopping floors at new shopping centers, the men said,
while some sell items in street markets.
</P>
<P>
   For laid-off workers and for those who, like Wu and Tang, still
have jobs because of their seniority, one of the greatest worries
is health care.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they use the company clinic and hospital, workers are
expected to pay for many services and drugs, to be reimbursed later
for most of the cost. But because their company is so short of
money, the two men said, workers are kept waiting a year before
they are repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Class divisions in the company's medical system are another
source of bitterness. ``Workers have to go to one clinic while the
managers go to another one, on the third floor of the hospital,''
Tang said. ``The workers can't even get herbal medicines for a
common cold, but the managers get whatever they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers get a free health checkup every two years, but
the workers don't get any checkups.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men have heard that the textile industry should boom
some time after China enters the World Trade Organization, since
the United States would be required over five years to end the
quotas that limit U.S. imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   But they know that this brighter future may be beyond their own
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when a textile factory can get better machinery, and
better-educated and more skilled workers, can it compete,'' Wu
said. ``So the immediate effect of converging with the world
economy is that even more workers will be laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, and perhaps remarkably, both men seemed to offer sincere
and unqualified support for Chinese membership in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without more global competition, China will be hopeless,''
said Tang, who knows at first hand about bad management and shabby
equipment. ``China can get rich only by competing with capitalist
societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that this factory will no longer exist in the next few
years. We all hope it will be transformed into a new factory in a
capitalist system.''

 &HT;    Winning Jewish voters a key test for Democrats
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia is not destined to be decisive in the battle
between Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, so
Wednesday afforded a rare opportunity to see both Democratic
presidential candidates in town on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Although they gave different sorts of presentations, both Gore
and Bradley spoke to the United Jewish Communities' first General
Assembly in the United States _ an interesting setting in which to
consider how the Democratic rivals stand.
</P>
<P>
   While Jewish voters may not play quite as central a role for
Democratic strategists as they have in the past, they are still
important to the party, not least because their sentiments are one
barometer of a much larger demographic. Many people in the
electorate, like these Jewish voters, are traditionally Democratic
but increasingly independent, more suburban and affluent than their
parents but more nervous about their identity. Winning over these
voters will be decisive in the struggle for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the Jewish group may be unfamiliar, because it is
itself the product of an identity crisis over the past few years.
The UJC is a combination of three older organizations, brought
together under the leadership of Canadian businessman Charles
Bronfman. It may not have been entirely accidental that the Maple
Leaf was displayed between the flags of the United States and
Israel at Wednesday's convocation.
</P>
<P>
   On matters such as relations with Israel and hate crimes
legislation the two candidates can make competitive claims, but the
campaign for these voters' affections revolves at this stage around
broad matters of style _ not only personal style but what that says
about where each candidate wants to lead the party.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of the kinds of changes that have been necessary
within their religious and charitable community, these Democrats
may be looking at the two contenders with an eye to which can take
on a similar task in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   As a former hero of the Knicks and senator from New Jersey,
Bradley has a natural appeal for many Jews from the Northeast, but
Gore has had the vice presidency in which to prove himself a
``strong and unyielding supporter,'' as he put it Wednesday, of the
country's ``unshakable'' relationship with Israel. The Tennessee
native even had a list of supposed Jewish country song hits,
including ``I've Got My Foot on the Glass, Now Where Are You,'' and
``The Second Time She Said Shalom I Knew She Meant Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience he had ``so many friends in this group,''
he could walk up one aisle and down the other saying hello to them.
He went to some lengths to make a personal connection, taking
microphone in hand _ which created temporary havoc with the sound
system _ and walking in front of the podium to tell the inspiring
story of his mother, an early feminist, and his father, a crusader
for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   It was much the same schtick he would have done with retirees in
New Hampshire, but it was striking to see so open a courtship in
front of the larger group Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Bradley was across town at Morehouse
Medical School, responding to Gore's criticisms of his health care
proposals. Theirs has been an amiable competition up to now, but it
is likely to get sharper in the days ahead.

`TANGO ARGENTINO': IT MOVES IN CHARMING FITS AND STARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes follow review.)

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When nine dancing pairs take to the stage of the
Gershwin Theater for the finale of the sultry ``Tango Argentino,''
it is as if we are eavesdropping on nine intimate dialogues, each
with its own subtle inflections. Severe-looking couples in formal
attire with slicked-back hair and masses of jewelry entwine and
unlock like lengths of magnetic rope. They create, in effect, a
sultanate of suaveness.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which opened Thursday night, is essentially a
reprise of a hit Broadway show from 1985 that accomplished for the
tango in New York circles something akin to what Chubby Checker did
for the twist. With the proliferation of tango shows over the
years, the stylish South American dance has shed some of its
mystique. But as the stars of ``Tango Argentino'' demonstrate, it
still moves in charming fits and starts to the rhythms of amorous
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Though the evening passes in a comfortable haze, it does at
times have a Lawrence Welk feel; knowledgeable fans, of course,
will be excited by the participation of tango legends like Juan
Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves, Hector and Elsa Maria Mayoral and
Nelida and Nelson. There is no set to speak of, simply a screen
that rises and falls between sequences, and a generic Broadway
backdrop with twinkling stars. As performed by a 13-piece orchestra
of strings, accordions and piano, the musical interludes are
pleasant, but some of the numbers by powerful, veteran Argentine
singers like Raul Lavie and Jovita Luna, who do everything but
wring handkerchiefs as they pour out their souls in song after
tormented song, do cross the line into kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoint between the overheated songs and the cool,
liquid dances may be a calculation by Claudio Segovia and Hector
Orezzoli, the show's creators and directors, who want to reveal to
us two distinct chambers of the Argentine heart. Or maybe their
desire is to give ``Tango Argentino'' a variety-show veneer; that
it must vacate the Gershwin early next year to make way for
``Riverdance'' is entirely fitting. In either event, it is the
dancers who do the most startling turns and deservedly receive the
loudest ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging in age from their 20s to 70s, the tangueros are a
portrait of aging gracefully in poignant tableaux. The younger
dancers use the entire stage for their immaculate footwork and
acrobatic twists; think of Torville and Dean without the skates.
This athleticism is on display in a number called ``Tanguera,''
danced by Pablo Veron and Guillermina Quiroga. Their collaboration
owes as much to the gym as to the dance floor, and their
contribution here has a playful element of competition. This is the
tango as martial art.
</P>
<P>
   Their older counterparts are like black belts of the form who
move with urgency and pride but with no apparent need to show off.
(Well, actually, in their backless gowns, the mature women do want
you to admire their musculature.) In ``Patetico,'' for instance,
Copes and Ms. Nieves are affecting in their precision and genteel
physical accommodation of each other; in ``Milonguero Viejo,''
Mayoral, who gave President Clinton a tango lesson on a visit to
Buenos Aires, Argentina, incorporates a courtly sense of honor into
his partnering of Ms. Mayoral.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dances, which do become repetitive, are duets. An
exception is ``Milonguita,'' a tango ballet. It employs much of the
company, and it is the only piece that tries to tell a real story.
The theme is jealousy; the protagonist is a young woman (Vanina
Bilous) who is the object of fascination for a circle of covetous
men and women. The tango is ideally applied to the tale, as it is a
dance of encounter on the brink of violence, and Ms. Bilous is
appealing as a Siren whose exotic charms are her downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango Argentino,'' though, is not in the business of breaking
new ground. It wants instead to show you the enduring vitality and
intensity, the passion under control, of dancing cheek to cheek.
That it does terrifically well. Watching the nine couples together
on a stage, each making the tango their own, you're reminded of the
many restless patterns in which romance can flower.

MUSLIM SCHOLARS URGE CAUTION IN INTERPRETING TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it happened like this: Just before the plane went down,
the Egyptian co-pilot said, ``I made my decision now. I put my
faith in God's hands,'' knowing he was going to sabotage the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it happened like this: Just before the plane went down,
the Egyptian co-pilot said, ``I made my decision now. I put my
faith in God's hands,'' realizing he was powerless to stop the
crash, and reaching out to God in the last moments of his life.
</P>
<P>
   As federal investigators struggle to translate the Arabic voices
on the EgyptAir Flight 990 cockpit voice recorder, Muslim scholars
caution that translation is an imprecise art. Language can be
vague, they say. Words carry different meanings in different
cultures. Officials want to be certain when exactly the co-pilot
uttered his words: before the plane went down, or after it started
to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   But with each news conference or leak about the cockpit tapes,
Muslim scholars note, comes more speculation and more stereotypes.
If a Muslim makes reference to God, Americans unschooled in Islam
assume, he must be talking about death.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this one, you really can use the phrase, `the rush to
judgment,' '' said John L. Esposito, director of the Center for
Christian-Muslim Understanding at Georgetown University. ``If you
don't handle it well, you create a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   America has been through this before. In the first days after
the Oklahoma City bombing, observers were quick to suggest that
Middle Eastern terrorists were responsible. Esposito was invited on
TV talk shows, to muse about connections that didn't exist. His
Muslim friends told him they got funny looks from people they had
known for years.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, Muslim leaders say, that prejudice stems from
ignorance. There are six million Muslims in America, and Islam will
soon become the nation's second-largest religion, said Ibrahim
Hooper, communications director at Council on American-Islamic
Relations in Washington. But the Muslim-American community is still
relatively new _ most immigrants arrived in the last three decades
_ and relatively unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many Americans have learned about Islam from the news,
in stories about the Iranian revolution of the 1970s, the US
hostages in Iran, and other hijackings and terrorist campaigns,
Esposito said. And many have been slow to realize that a few
fundamentalists don't reflect an entire religion, he said. It's as
if someone associated Christianity solely with abortion clinic
bombers who cited the Bible to justify their acts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators analyze the cockpit tapes, he said, they need
to be aware of their ignorance, and cautious of making assumptions.
If the co-pilot were Christian and said, ``God forgive me,'' he
could have been admitting wrongdoing, Esposito said. Or he could
have been uttering a shorthand of the final Christian Act of
Contrition, clearing his conscience before death.
</P>
<P>
   And if EgyptAir co-pilot Gamil El Batouty were strictly
following his Muslim faith, he never would have sabotaged the
plane, Hooper said. The Koran _ which Muslims take to be the sacred
word of God _ explicitly commands against murder and suicide. God
alone has the power to say who lives and who dies, the Koran says.
</P>
<P>
   What Islam does preach is a constant closeness to God, as a way
to ward off temptations to evil, said Javid Malek, a Lexington,
Mass. consulting engineer who is active in the Islamic Center of
New England. That's why Muslims pray to Allah five times daily, he
said, and pepper even their most mundane conversations with tiny
prayers and references to God.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the words El Batouty uttered on the tape appear to be
the basic Arabic statement of faith, said Ihsan Bagby, professor of
international studies at Shaw University in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims are ``amazed that they would think this is a death
wish,'' Bagby said. In the context of surprise, amazement, or
horror, he said, ``it is totally understandable and it is a normal
reaction. It's like saying, `Oh my God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Malek warns, Muslims can't dismiss investigators'
concerns outright. Islam might forbid suicide or killing, he said,
but individuals can go astray. The Koran warns about that
possibility, in passages about Shaitan, the devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``His job is to mislead you from the straight path,'' Malek
said. ``And perhaps sometimes he succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may still turn out that Gamil El Batouty was
responsible for the crash, Hooper concedes. It may be that his
final prayer was a vital clue, a statement of intent. But if so, he
should be viewed as a deranged individual, not a deranged Muslim,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone else of any other faith was mentally unbalanced,''
Hooper said, ``no one would hold that against that person's
religion.''

ARABIC SPEAKERS URGE CAUTION IN INTERPRETING PILOT'S WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Tenn., N.C.)  (With AIRCRASH-RDP) 
(th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I put my trust in God,'' the voice repeated on the recorder
that was recently recovered from the underwater wreckage of
EgyptAir's fatal Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic prayer uttered in Arabic, ``Tawakilt ala Allah,''
has prompted some investigators to suspect that a crew member may
have caused the Boeing 767 jetliner to crash into the Atlantic
Ocean near Nantucket on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Islamic scholars and other Arabic speakers caution that the
phrase is so common in the Middle East that it carries no
particularly ominous overtones. The Arabic spoken by Egyptians and
others, they say, is peppered with prayerful affirmations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere utterance of this kind of phrase would in no way
indicate criminal behavior or criminal intent,'' said Ibrahim
Hooper, the national communications director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group in Washington.
Someone bent on destruction, Hooper said, would have far stronger
Arabic phrases to draw upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an information gap when it comes to Islam and Muslims,
and this gap is easily filled with ignorance,'' Hooper said. ``If
the inference was by a Christian pilot who said, `God help me,' we
wouldn't even have this conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Rabbat, a professor of Islamic architecture at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained, ``Religious
Muslims usually say it even for the slightest of beginnings, such
as turning the ignition in a car or putting the key in a keyhole to
open a door.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions are used often in Egypt today, said Rabbat, who
was born in Syria but visits Egypt often.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is involved in practically every single decision,'' Rabbat
said, ``and if a person was religious, he would say this even if he
was entering the cockpit'' of the fated jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud el-Azzazzay, a travel agent in New York City who
formerly worked for EgyptAir, called such a prayer commonplace.
``We say it probably 200 or more times a day,'' Azzazzay said.
``This is what God recommended us to do. It means all my future is
in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the meaning of the phrase, which is
transliterated into various English spellings, lies at the heart of
EgyptAir's request that the American investigators step back and
let the Egyptians interpret the reference to God themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And confusion about the phrase and its meaning has only been
deepened by the fact that it has been reported differently by
different newspapers and television networks, each of which has
been relying on sources involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my decision now. I put my faith in God's hands,'' was
the translation of the phrase offered by USA Today and several
television networks. And other daily newspapers variously reported
``Tawakilt ala Allah'' or ``La Allahu lil Allah wa Mohammed rasul
Allah,'' which means ``There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is
Allah's messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Gwynne, an associate professor of Islamic and Arabic
studies at the University of Tennessee, said that the bumper
sticker on her car bears the phrase, which she transliterated as
``tawakkalt ala Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may indicate that the pilot had taken drastic
action,'' she said, ``it might also indicate that he had done the
last thing he could to save the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent J. Cornell, an associate professor of religion at Duke
University who has worked in North Africa, said that the Arabic
declaration has some significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically used to initiate something, if you're embarking
on a situation where you don't know the outcome,'' Cornell said.
The meaning of the phrase, he emphasized, would depend upon the
context in which it was used.
</P>
<P>
   Haka Arafa, a native Egyptian who works in Washington for the
Voice of America's Arabic branch, said that the Arabic language is
full of prayerful expressions that tend to get cited out of habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say it as soon as I get into my car to pick my daughter up
from school,'' Ms. Arafa said. ``I also say it when I start cooking
in the kitchen and when I arrive at work and start my
assignments.''

 &HT;    As Jews gather in Atlanta, movement grows to strengthen
community amid assimilation
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Breathing in the rich, earthy scent of Georgia clay, a
group of Orthodox Jews in central DeKalb County, Ga., bury their
worn holy books in an ancient tradition. In her Roswell home, Paula
Shapiro, a Reform Jew, lights Shabbat candles with her children.
And, at Marietta's Etz Chaim, a Conservative synagogue, Irwin Weitz
begins the day with prayer, then schmoozes with fellow congregants
over bagels at a nearby eatery.
</P>
<P>
   This is Judaism as it is practiced in the largest metropolis of
the deep South and, increasingly, around the world. Far from a
monolithic belief system and culture, modern Jewishness ranges from
ultra-orthodox to secular with many variations in between.
</P>
<P>
   As 4,000 Jews gather in Atlanta this week for their 68th General
Assembly, the underlying theme of many of their workshops and
seminars is what it means to be a Jew today. The freedom for Jews
to define their own Jewishness is both a blessing and a bane, say
the Jewish leaders who will address the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important thing about Jewish identity today,
if you look across the span of people who identify themselves as
Jews, is that it's incredibly diverse,'' said Jonathan Woocher,
executive vice president of the Jewish Education Service of North
America, a New York-based agency that promotes Jewish education.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity is the result of changes in society, both among
Jews and among non-Jews, he said. Once Jews had little choice but
to be identified as Jews. Anti-Semitism and life in ghettos or
ethnic enclaves ensured that they were seen as set apart from other
people. In recent decades, those invisible walls no longer hold.
Jews have the freedom to be as fully Jewish as they desire, or to
dispense altogether with their ethnic and religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   As Jews have blended into every aspect of American life, they
have intermingled and intermarried with other religious and ethnic
groups. Those who care deeply about the continuity of the Jewish
people see this widespread acceptance as a serious threat to the
preservation of their thousands-of-years-old heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their fears were confirmed by a 1990 National Jewish
Population Survey published by the Council of Jewish Federations.
The study showed that while 68 percent of all married born Jews
were also married to someone born Jewish, the choice of marriage
partners changed dramatically in the latter half of the century. By
1985, twice as many Jews married Gentiles as married other Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling to Jewish leaders, only 28 percent of the
children of mixed households were being raised Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, American Jews, once focused on the survival of
Israel, turned their attention to the survival of their own
community, said Kenneth Stein, professor of contemporary Middle
Eastern history and Israeli studies at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about how will Jews survive in the
assimilationist environment in America,'' said Stein. ``How do you
sustain Jewishness? How do you be sure that your kids don't
intermarry? How do you keep traditions and customs going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is that we want people to have the freedom to
leave,'' said Arnold Eisen, chair of the department of religious
studies at Stanford University. ``We want them to voluntarily
choose to come. You want to always give them reasons to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers age and the millennium winds down, many Jews are
experiencing a spiritual awakening that is evident in other
segments of American society, said Barry Shrage, president of the
Combinied Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But helping individual Jews find a personal faith is not enough,
said Eisen. Jews must also build strong connections to other Jews.
``We've discovered that what American Jews are after from their
Jewishness is a combination of meaning and community,'' he said.
``When the Jewish world reaches out to people and gives them this
meaning to live for and the feeling that they're part of something
larger than themselves, they respond positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to strengthen Jewish community are centering on three
areas _ serious Jewish learning, caring for Jews in Israel and
throughout the diaspora, and a commitment to social justice, said
Shrage.
</P>
<P>
   Shrage, Eisen and Woocher are all taking part in a session of
the General Assembly on ``Jewish Renaissance and Renewal.'' All say
they see evidence that many Jews, no longer part of ethnic
neighborhoods, are seeking communities through Jewish
organizations. They point to growth in the number of synagogues,
Jewish schools and adult education programs across America as
evidence that people are choosing to connect with their Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, home to an estimated 100,000 Jews, a series of
lay classes for adults in everything from Yiddish to Jewish
spirituality quickly fills to capacity every year. The metro area
now has about two dozen synagogues, from Hassidic to humanistic,
many with current or recently completed building programs. And, the
Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta launched a $50 million
campaign two years ago to expand and spruce up local Jewish schools
and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, the institutions reach a minority of Jews. Only
four in 10 metro Atlanta Jews belong to any Jewish organization,
according to a 1996 study by the Atlanta Jewish Federation, and
fewer than one in five attend synagogue at least monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews go back and forth, being more or less Jewish
religiously and culturally during different times in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Weitz, 45, of Marietta was raised in an Orthodox synagogue and a
``semi-observant'' home by parents who survived the Holocaust, kept
kosher and did not travel on Saturday. But as an adult, his
involvement in Judaism was largely limited to attending synagogue
services during the High Holidays of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he and his family _ a wife and four children _
have ``reconnected.'' He joined Etz Chaim to make certain he could
get tickets to holiday services, and eventually began attending
Shabbat services and even participating in a daily minyan, or
morning prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is a set of values that helps me live my life,'' he
said. ``It is a history of my family and my people. It is important
for my wife and myself to carry forward the traditions and values
that we learned from our parents and that we feel are important and
pass them on to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Benyomin Friedman, 42, believes part of his responsibility
is to help Jews discover the meaning of their Jewishness. While
many people will drift away from their heritage, others will claim
it with renewed vigor precisely because they must consciously
embrace it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community is talking about continuity and wondering
if there will be continuity,'' said Friedman, rabbi of the Orthodox
synagogue Congregation Ariel in Dunwoody. ``This is what I
envision: The number of Jews will drop off greatly but the core
will get stronger. A vibrant core, it will far surpass previous
generations.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In October last year, deep in the midst of
Indonesia's financial breakdown, the French food retailer Carrefour
set up one of its sprawling hypermarkets on the edge of Jakarta. If
opening a fancy modern grocery in a shrinking Third World economy
seemed risky then, it seemed foolhardy a month later, when rioting
mobs came to the new Carrefour and looted it.
</P>
<P>
   In the year that followed, though, the supermarket has been
visited by a different sort of mob, one bent on buying as much as
it can.
</P>
<P>
   Carrefour and another French chain, Promodes, have been so
successful in Indonesia despite the country's severe economic
downturn that they now have a total of five stores in Jakarta and
plan to build more.
</P>
<P>
   The two global companies, which in August agreed to a $16.6
billion merger, are revolutionizing Indonesia's retail industry by
offering shoppers a greater variety of products at prices lower
than those at traditional markets, with no haggling and no pesky
flies. Besides illustrating the potential that exists for patient
foreign investors, the success of the French retailers illuminates
one of the most baffling aspects of Asia's financial crisis. The
phenomenon helps explain how Asia's cities managed to maintain a
surprising air of normality _ even a sober prosperity _ thanks to a
vast cushion of middle-class savings that helped sustain consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say this reservoir of personal wealth is one of the
keys to Asia's unexpectedly rapid bounce-back from the financial
crisis touched off in Thailand in mid-1997. Even in Indonesia,
where the economy shrank 13 percent last year, cities seized by
riots over rising prices and official corruption quickly regained
their bustle. Now, calmed by a new democratically elected
government, the country is joining an economic recovery across the
region in which affluent households hold a vital role. Driven thus
far by low interest rates and government spending, economists say,
the recovery will increasingly depend on the bourgeoisie's ample
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovery has to be carried by households,'' said David
Fernandez, an economist with J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the crisis should have been a great leveler,
devastating the affluent by destroying the value of their property
and their shareholdings while eliminating jobs in such modern
industries as manufacturing and construction that were suffering
from excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Indonesia's middle- and upper-classes have survived the
crisis largely intact, thanks to traditional values of thrift and
mutual family support, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   It was this growing class of affluent Indonesians that lured
big-name foreign retailers to Indonesia in the first place. Though
the average annual income in Indonesia is just $600, the gulf
between haves and have-nots is tremendous. In a nation of 207
million people, the world's fourth most populous country, there are
roughly 20 million people in households that spend at least $1,200
a year on routine expenses like rent and food, according to A.C.
Nielsen, the market research firm. They represent a market of color
TV-owning consumers larger than the entire population of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge country with huge markets,'' said Percival
Manglano, a consultant with the Castle Group here, a consulting
company for foreign investors.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carrefour set its sights on Indonesia in the mid-1990s as part
of an expansion that led it into Taiwan, Malaysia, China and
Singapore. J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart Stores also set up shop in the
country. Because Indonesian laws prohibited direct foreign
investment in retailing, each had to find a local partner.
Carrefour teamed up with a powerful ethnic-Chinese family that owns
a distribution company, Tigaraksa Satria.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis that started in Thailand in mid-1997 and
soon spread to Indonesia changed everything. Wal-Mart and J.C.
Penney cleared out. Though the International Monetary Fund, as a
condition of its $43 billion economic aid package, compelled
Indonesia to lift its restriction on foreign retail investment,
Carrefour and Promodes delayed plans to open as riots shook
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   While the violence and demonstrations were bringing down
Indonesia's corrupt regime, the crisis was seemingly devastating
Carrefour's potential customers. The nation's currency, the rupiah,
plummeted more than 75 percent against the dollar, real wages fell
35 percent and the number of Indonesians the World Bank estimated
were living in poverty doubled, to 40 million.
</P>
<P>
   In outer islands, poor subsistence communities felt little
impact. Those that were growing cash crops that could be exported
even enjoyed a local boom as a result of the rupiah's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   It was the urban poor and villagers on overcrowded Java that
bore the brunt. ``The amount of money you need to live in squalor
has gone up tremendously,'' said Farquhar Stirling, managing
director at A.C. Nielsen's office in Jakarta. Some families had to
stop sending their children to school for a time and some Javanese
were forced to skip meals. For many though, strong family ties
provided a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were laid off went back to their villages, and
their mothers and fathers took care of them,'' said Sri Adiningsih,
an economist at Indonesia's Gadjah Mada University. The middle
class also had its own insurance. Indonesians, like most Asians,
are prodigious savers, stashing away on average roughly a quarter
of their income. During the crisis, inflation eroded the real value
of these savings, but sky-high interest rates of more than 35
percent on deposits helped soften the blow.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious consumers cut back on spending, but with their bank
balances rocketing higher, many middle class and affluent city
dwellers felt wealthy enough to maintain a comfortable existence.
An indeterminate amount of spending money, economists say, came
from a sizeable ``informal'' economy: untaxed, traditional cottage
and service industries, mattress money and gold.
</P>
<P>
   So, while by official measures spending has not yet recovered,
many retailers and wholesalers say it has. That is in part because
money that has not been spent on airline tickets or automobiles has
entered the retail sector in ways that do not always show up in the
consumer-spending figures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Determined entrepreneurs opened up roadside food stalls, serving
everything from humble noodles to steak and cappuccino, eventually
becoming a sort of trendy alfresco Bohemia. Flea markets
proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   And even during the worst of the Indonesian crisis, when orders
to manufacturers dried up, merchandise was still selling on the
street. Now orders are skyrocketing, said Wolfgang Piroth,
president-director of the Indonesian subsidiary of Bayer A.G., as
distributors scramble to rebuild their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the scene at the glitzy Plaza Senayan shopping mall
in Jakarta, Indonesia's top savers never lost their appetite for
the finer things. Instead of flying to nearby Singapore to buy
their Cartier watches, they are buying them at home, said Victor
Sassoon, whose Rubina Watch is Cartier's sole distributor in
Indonesia. ``The country is very rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Plaza Senayan's Louis Vuitton outlet, employees say they were
never at a loss for customers. ``All the time, they're buying,
buying, buying,'' said Sadaeli, the shop manager. Across the way, a
new Bulgari outlet is opening.
</P>
<P>
   All of which helps explain why retailers with razor-thin margins
like Carrefour and Promodes are able to generate the kind of
volumes they need to flourish here. Indonesians with savings are
willing to spend on products they find attractive _ especially if
the merchandise is also perceived as a good value.
</P>
<P>
   To an American visitor, a Carrefour appears little different
from an overstocked Wal-Mart with groceries. But in Jakarta, it is
a novelty: brightly lit, with wide aisles and spotless linoleum
floors. Employees will clean and filet fish, and on a recent day
rap music was playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional market nearby presents a stark contrast. Hot and
dank, the narrow alleys are littered with garbage. A cat wanders
through carrying a fish head in its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood market has its advantages. A five-kilogram bag
of rice that goes for 17,000 rupiah ($2.45) at Carrefour costs just
14,000 rupiah in the market. And at the market, where she has been
shopping for more than 30 years, ``you can bargain,'' said Isa
Salim. Sure, the hypermarkets take credit cards, but at the market,
``if I forget my purse, I can borrow money from the shopkeepers,''
Mrs. Salim added.
</P>
<P>
   On a no-haggle basis, however, a bag of sugar costs about the
same at Carrefour and eggs are cheaper there. Meat is neatly
wrapped in cellophane; at the market it is covered in flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are realizing that hygiene is important, and wet
markets are not hygienic,'' said Manglano of the Castle Group. Even
his live-in maid has switched from the market to Carrefour in
search of cleaner meat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Jakartans long ago moved on to modern local grocers
like Hero Supermarket. But Carrefour and Promodes offer greater
selections and lower prices. Analysts say the two companies
benefited from their partners' wider and more efficient
distribution networks, which has allowed them to survive with
profit margins as low as 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors say the foreign grocers have no profit margin at
all, and some accuse them of selling below cost. ``They can't make
any profit if they continue selling that cheaply,'' said Steven
Sondakh, chairman of the Indonesia Retailers Association and a
director at Hero.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Carrefour nor Promodes responded to numerous requests
for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Sondakh says as the hypermarkets encroach, they are driving
small mom-and-pop stores out of business. He is leading an effort
to get Indonesia's Parliament to pass zoning laws that will keep
superstores like Carrefour and Continent out of downtown Jakarta,
where he says they will worsen the city's traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   The hypermarkets, which convey how the globalization of
Indonesia is continuing, are undeterred. Continent has opened three
stores and is planning a fourth; Carrefour has two and wants to
open two more, one in Jakarta and another in the nearby Javanese
city Bandung. At some point after the companies merge _ in a deal
that would create the world's second-biggest retailer after
Wal-Mart _ the two brands will become one.
</P>
<P>
   And as consumer spending revives, there will undoubtedly still
be room in the cities for traditional retailers, too, thanks to
loyal bargain-hunters like Mrs. Salim. ``For people with smaller
budgets,'' she said as she headed for the market butcher, ``this
will last.''

<P>
   BERLIN _ A mood of exasperation gripped German industry
Wednesday after an additional offer to compensate Nazi-era slave
laborers failed to settle a negotiation that began with lofty moral
sentiments but has descended into ugly haggling.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said the two days of
talks in Bonn constituted the most constructive of six rounds of
negotiations and had brought the two sides within range of each
other around a sum of 10 billion marks, or $5.55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief financial officer of DaimlerChrysler, Manfred
Gentz, said the talks were undermined by ``lawyers for the victims,
who continue to talk about sums that nobody else finds
constructive,'' adding that the new proposal was 8 billion marks,
or $4.44 billion, and could ``not be raised any higher.''
</P>
<P>
   That sum, made up of 5 billion marks from German companies and 3
billion from the government, represents an increase of 1 billion
marks, or $555 million, with the extra money coming from the
country's leading corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion over figures stemmed from the fact that although
U.S. officials and plaintiffs' lawyers characterized the new
proposal as in a range from $3.3 billion to $5.55 billion, German
officials and industrialists insisted that $4.44 billion was the
amount proposed, and not a cent more.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to reach an agreement arose despite a letter that
President Clinton sent Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday
that urged flexibility. The letter, the president's second such
communication, reflected the importance of the talks to relations
between Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said he would meet German mediators in the United
States at the end of next week. A further session may be held in
Washington in the middle of next month. But German industry has
made it clear that it will attend only if the clear outline of a
settlement already exists.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the German government has paid $80 billion
in war reparations, mostly to Jews who survived concentration camps
or fled Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But no significant compensation has previously been offered to
forced laborers, generally non-Jews deported to Germany from
Central European countries, or to slave laborers, who were put to
work in concentration camps and were mainly Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Those two groups would be covered by the German fund, which
would be distributed to survivors, who are now elderly. Germans
estimate the number of people in both categories at 800,000. But
plaintiffs' lawyers have suggested much higher numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Leading German companies fear a backlash against their
businesses in the United States if the talks break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight billion marks is the offer, 5 billion of which will come
from German industry on the condition that no other lawsuits be
filed against German firms,'' the chief German mediator, Otto
Lambsdorff, said. ``We are not dealing with small sums of money
here. The 10 billion to 15 billion marks proposed by United States
lawyers is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said he had to battle long and hard to persuade
plaintiffs' lawyers, including Edward Fagan, to lower their
proposals from ``well above'' the range of 10 billion to 15 billion
marks. The higher demands, Eizenstat added, might have led to a
complete breakdown in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat added that ``a negotiated settlement now seems
attainable.'' But he conceded that bridging the remaining
differences would be extremely difficult and that the mood of
German industry was now one of ``real exasperation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Schroeder is trying to push through unpopular
budget cuts of 30 billion marks, the government offer of 3 billion
marks appears to be an extraordinary expression of its desire to
enter the next century with the last major Holocaust-related
negotiation behind it.

 &HT;    Case could influence Georgia electrocutions
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia soon may be forced to adopt another method of
capital punishment, legislators and attorneys on both sides of the
death penalty debate said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, Georgia lawmakers have considered, and
quickly dismissed, legislation to authorize lethal injection _
either as an alternative to or as a replacement for electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Supreme Court last month agreed to hear a Florida
case in which a condemned man argued that electrocution violated
his right of protection from cruel and unusual punishment,
following several recent mishaps during executions in Florida's
electric chair. In two electrocutions, flames shot from the body of
the condemned men when the switches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be a bill,'' said state Rep. Jim Martin,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who called Wednesday's
committee meeting to hear from the state's death penalty defense
lawyers and others opposed to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, with 121 inmates on death row, is one of only four
states that rely solely on electrocution. Seven other states use
the electric chair or another method, usually lethal injection.
While Florida uses only the electric chair, it has a ``backup''
statute that would automatically switch to lethal injection if
electrocution was found to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Thurbert Baker would like to see the
Georgia Legislature do as Florida has, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking a position on what the alternative (method of
execution) would be, but we think it would be wise to have the
fallback position only if told by a court of competent jurisdiction
that we cannot use the electric chair,'' said Jeff DiSantis of the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe Georgia would be better off if the court
rules that electrocution is constitutional. There would be greater
implications for this state if the court simply issued a limited
ruling that Florida's electric chair was unconstitutional, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it applies only to Florida, there will be a flood of
litigation about the differences between Georgia's and Florida's
chairs,'' said defense attorney Jack Martin, the committee
chairman's brother. ``Lethal injection is the less horrible of the
alternatives. It's unethical for a veterinarian to kill an animal
by electrocution, (yet) we're doing it to human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Martin said he opposes the death penalty, but if there has
to be capital punishment in Georgia at the very least the method
should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Another death penalty opponent said the Legislature should wait
until the high court rules before making changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law is changed midstream ... lawyers are going to have
legitimate grounds for appeal,'' said Mike Mears of the
Multi-County Public Defender Office, explaining that those already
sentenced to die by electrocution could argue that their sentences
would be voided if the method was changed to lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do anything until the Supreme Court tells us what the
law is,'' Mears said. ``If we start anticipating what the court is
going to do, inevitably we're going to get it wrong.''

SUSPICION MOVES TOWARD COPILOT IN FLIGHT 990 PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Egyptian officials prepared to review and
examine the evidence, federal aviation investigators have
identified the key words and movements of a backup copilot who they
suspect deliberately pushed EgyptAir Flight 990 into a suicide
dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my decision now. I put my faith in God's hands,'' the
copilot, Gamil El Batouty, said before the jet's auto-pilot
disconnected and the aircraft began a steep dive that reached
near-supersonic speed, according to a federal law enforcement
source with knowledge of the airliner's cockpit recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Television reported Wednesday night that the copilot is
heard on the tape saying in Arabic: ``Tawakalna ala Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase, used commonly in Egypt, is the rough equivalent of,
``God help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments attributed to Batouty, a veteran airline pilot
who was not assigned to fly that early in the 11-hour trip, has
strengthened suspicions that the Boeing 767's 217 passengers and
crew died from a deliberate act _ and that Batouty was at the
controls when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials dispatched here by their government are
expected to begin scrutinizing the cockpit recordings as well as
information from the flight data recorder, considered key pieces of
evidence that the Atlantic Ocean crash site 60 miles south of
Nantucket will soon be considered a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   But other authorities criticized news reports that the
investigation has shifted to Batouty and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Egyptian government did not receive until (Wednesday) the
American authorities' reports of the current investigation
concerning the EgyptAir crash,'' Egypt Information Minister Safawad
el Sherif said in a statement. ``What is being reported in the
foreign media is mere speculation, hypothesis, and imagination that
does not reach the level of documented fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is not expected to turn
the case over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation until Egyptian
officials have had a chance to fully examine the current evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of showing them the evidence and laying it out
to get whatever their input might be,'' said one NTSB official.
``Before we move forward on a decision like this, we want to be
very careful, to make certain we are being thorough and methodical
and correct in our decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said they hope the Egyptian officials will help fully
interpret the conversations, listening for nuances and voice
inflections as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still trying to figure out what this guy was doing,
what his thoughts were, when he was saying his prayer,'' said a US
official who has talked with Egyptian security authorities in
Cairo. ``I don't think anyone for sure knows for sure what was
going on with that person. (They) keep saying that this prayer this
fellow was saying was not unusual, that it wasn't unusual for him
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Egyptians aren't convinced the jet was doomed by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to hear all the evidence and hear everything before
turning it over to a criminal investigation,'' the FBI official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the jet's flight data recorder, which monitors scores of
the plane's mechanical functions, and its cockpit voice recorder,
which captures conversations and other sounds on the flight deck,
authorities are piecing together the final, terrifying moments of
the Cairo-bound jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour after an early-morning liftoff from John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York on Oct. 31, the Boeing
767-300ER began a steep but controlled descent from 33,000 feet.
Within moments, it had reached extraordinary speed, and power had
been cut to the twin jet engines. The speed brake, used to slow the
aircraft in flight, had been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The plane struggled back up to several thousand feet before it
pitched over in a final dive, breaking up just before it smashed
into the ocean about 60 miles off the coast of Nantucket in depths
that reach 270 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder _ one of two ``black boxes'' _ was
retrieved from the ocean floor by a submersible robot last week.
The information on it has helped unravel some of the puzzling final
moments of Flight 990, and authorities will work through the
weekend to produce a transcript.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the recordings, sources said, investigators
believe the crash was deliberate because one pilot left the
cockpit, and the remaining pilot at the helm _ Batouty _ talked of
``going into death,'' according to some reports.
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated audio equipment, authorities are hoping to
electronically enhance the cockpit recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was not scheduled to fly until much later in the
flight to Egypt, Batouty had asked for and was given permission to
take over the plane's controls.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty, 59, was nearing retirement, sources said and his
daughter was critically ill with lupus. The Los Angeles Times said
he was worried about paying her medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that EgyptAir representatives
familiar with Batouty's voice identified it on the cockpit
recording, but officials cautioned that they had no other
verification of the backup copilot's voice. Four pilots were
assigned to the flight, including one other relief pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian officials will try to confirm the identification
and carefully assess the tone and intention of the words he
uttered. They will also try to pinpoint when the prayer is said in
the sequence of events that sent the plane plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   About the time the pilot is heard invoking God's name, the jet's
autopilot is turned off, and it plunged into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   The tape detects the cockpit's door opening as authorities
believe the pilot, Captain Ahmed El Habashi, returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' he asks. Authorities believe Habashi then
tried to regain control of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull with me. Help me. Pull with me,'' Habashi is heard saying
as the plane's elevators on either side of the jet's tail move in
opposition directions: the one controlled from the captain's chair
moved up while the other moved down.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation specialists say that indicated a struggle for control
of the airplane in the twin-yoke cockpit: as one pilot pulled up on
one yoke to make the plane climb, the other pushed the second yoke
forward to make it dive.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators continued their work here, NTSB Chairman James
E. Hall said the Navy will turn over responsibility for retrieving
more of the plane's wreckage to a Navy salvage team.
</P>
<P>
   A large salvage ship, now in Europe, is due at the crash site by
Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy's supervisor of salvage has been directed to contract
for a large ship with heavy lift capability that can operate in
heavy seas, and send it to the accident site as soon as possible
for the retrieval of human remains and aircraft wreckage,'' Hall
said in a statement.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS VOTE STRICTER CONTROL OF COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bucking warnings that it would create disaster for
the church and dissent on campuses, the nation's Catholic bishops
overwhelmingly approved a landmark document Wednesday tightening
their authority over the 236 Catholic colleges in the US.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the document had been a decade in
the making, and was revised several times up until minutes before
the final vote, as the bishops tried to respond to an outcry from
college presidents and colleagues who said the provisions are so
stringent schools might to abandon their Catholic identity.
</P>
<P>
   The document's mostly hotly debated ordinance gives the bishops
the powerful authority to decide who is fit to teach Catholic
theology, and who isn't. In voting for it Wednesday, the bishops
were reacting to vigorous pressure from the Vatican, which had
rejected an earlier version of the document as not strong enough.
But after a year of intense controversy between the church and the
schools, the bishops tried Wednesday to recast themselves as kindly
friends, rather than overbearing parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say to the Catholic colleges, you have nothing to fear
from us as bishops, you have nothing to fear from the church, you
have nothing to fear from the implementation of Ex Corde
Ecclesiae,'' said Roger Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles. ``On the
contrary, this is a new moment of collaboration, this is an
exciting new moment for the future common goal: to bring the
presence and the power of Jesus Christ to a new generation of
students, to help all of us to be an influence on the culture, the
society we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some bishops and academics worried aloud in impassioned
speeches that the new rules would embolden right-wing groups to
target unconventional professors, bishops, and schools in a
``destructive vigilantism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous unrest in my heart passing this,'' said
Rembert G. Weakland, the Archbishop of Milwaukee. ``Passing this
document now will create a tremendous pastoral disaster in the
United States. To move ahead now and say (to the Catholic colleges
and universities) `you've got to collaborate,' they'll be extremely
defensive, they'll be divided among themselves...there's so much
distrust of us, I feel this is the wrong moment to pass this, it
will only lead to a lot of public bickering, public disputes, where
the church can only be harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is expected to approve the new provisions within the
next six months, and they could take effect a year from that date.
</P>
<P>
   The document came primarily out of concern about the more
well-known Catholic schools that have grown over the past few
decades from small colleges run by religious orders into more
national universities: Georgetown, Boston College, Notre Dame. As
they have done so, they have raised more money and attracted a far
more diverse faculty and student body _ and, the Vatican and many
bishops feared, diluted their Catholic identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot ignore the history of institutions of higher
learning that were founded in the Protestant faith that are now
secular,'' said Cardinal Bernard Law, the Archbishop of Boston.
``We are at a new moment in Catholic higher education, a moment
molded by the challenges posed by a culture that is aggressively
secular. Ex Corde is a great gift to the Catholic colleges and to
bishops as we come to live our relationship, a relationship I, as a
bishop, and perhaps others, have not fully appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishops and college presidents who opposed the document are most
worried about its requirement that Catholic theology professors
seek a mandate from the local bishop, a sort of seal of approval
that what they are teaching is approved Catholic doctrine. This,
they said, contradicts the essential nature of institutions founded
on the bedrock of academic inquiry and free thought. Other
controversial provisions ask a majority of the colleges' trustees
and faculty to be faithful Catholics, and require the presidents of
Catholic schools to not only be Catholic, but take an oath of
fidelity to the church.
</P>
<P>
   The document approved Wednesday was instantly praised by
Catholics United for Faith and other conservative groups. But
critics noted that the document was passed with more dissent than
other votes taken at the bishops annual conference here -- 233
bishops supporting it, and 31 rejecting it, compared with fewer
than 10 dissents on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Observers who opposed the new rules said the Church was wrongly
blaming the universities for the number of young Catholics straying
from their faith. The new strictness, they said, will only alienate
young people even more.
</P>
<P>
   While many college presidents agree that they don't want to go
the route of once-Protestant colleges and universities, they have
said the rules are too specific, and some bishops Wednesday agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The angst I've heard in letters which I continue to get today,
is are we going to be Big Brother? Are we going to have solutions
to everything?'' said Elden Curtiss, the Archbishop of Omaha. ``We
don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishops who opposed the changes said schools had already begun
considering ways to strengthen their religious identity -- if
anything, their Catholic identity has become more and more a way to
distinguish themselves in a competitive sea of other colleges. The
new rules, they said, are a vote of no-confidence, and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we can use the Protestant universities as a wake up
call, we have the wisdom tradition, we have great resiliency in the
Catholic church,'' said John D'Arcy, the Bishop of Fort Wayne-South
Bend, whose diocese includes Notre Dame. ``We're not afraid of
modernity, we can handle it, with faith seeking understanding. We
don't have to go down that road.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex Corde Ecclesiae _ translated, ``from the heart of the
church,'' was originally issued out of the Vatican in 1990. The
bishops' conferences were asked to adapt it to the tradition of
higher education in their regions of the world. But with most of
the world's Catholic colleges in the United States, bishops
elsewhere have been waiting for the conference here to vote on its
norms before they decide how theirs will look. The US conference
approved its first document by a vote of 226-4 in 1996, but the
Vatican sent back the document, asking for stricter, more legal,
language safeguarding Catholic identity and outlining the bishop's
supervision over the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The document approved Wednesday had been softened somewhat. The
provision on trustees and faculty had been qualified to say they
should be faithful catholics ``to the extent possible.'' The
bishops also added language aimed at assuring people who are
nervous about the separation of church and state that the
institutions are academic, not proselytizing, institutions.
</P>
<P>
   And Bishop John Leibrecht, the head of the committee that wrote
the document, insisted that while the bishops could authorize
professors to teach theology, decisions about hiring and firing
would be up to the university, with only input from the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bishops really are not interested in discipline,'' he
said. ``Are there dangers? Sure there are. Can we work it out? I'm
confident we can.''

<P>
   CAIRO _ With investigators focusing on a copilot they suspect of
seizing the controls and forcing EgyptAir Flight 990 into a fatal
dive, the pilot's colleagues and family Wednesday lashed out at the
accusations and painted a portait of one of the carrier's best
pilots and a loving father.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who knew him, Gamil El Batouty, 59, was a
devoted husband and father of five who was nearing retirement after
flying for EgyptAir for more than 30 years and serving as a flight
instructor for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was wealthy, he was healthy, and he had everything to live
for, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that he did not do this. The whole world must know
he is not capable of this,'' said his wife, Omayama Fahmi, 50,
dressed in black as she sat in the family home in Heliopolis, a
wealthy enclave of the sprawling city of Cairo near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go and ask EgyptAir, ask his friends, ask the neighbors. He
could never do something like this,'' she added, her voice hoarse
from crying and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This day is harder than the day he died,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An extended family of children, cousins, and in-laws clustered
around a television in the living room. A framed picture of
Batouty, a smiling, robust man with thick black hair, hung on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   CNN was broadcasting reports that Batouty was at the controls
and that investigators believed he may have intentionally sent the
Boeing 767 into a nose-dive, perhaps as a means of suicide, killing
all 217 people on board. The network was reporting that Batouty
murmured a prayer as the plane plummeted at near super-sonic speed
into the waters off Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty's brother-in-law, Yehia Hegazi, screamed at the
television and turned away in anger, saying, ``They are searching
for a scapegoat!''
</P>
<P>
   Anger at the allegations being reported in Western media were
felt not only by the family, but by Egyptians on the streets of
Cairo and throughout the Egyptian media.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's editions of Al-Wafd, a liberal newspaper published in
Arabic and English, headlined: ``Egypt rejects American Allegations
on Plane Disaster.'' The article said a phrase being attributed to
Batouty on the plane's cockpit voice recorder _ ``I made my
decision now. I put my faith in God's hands'' _ ``is a phrase
commonly used by Muslims facing a serious crisis and would have
nothing to do with suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling for explanations for the crash, some American news
organizations reported that Batouty may have been distraught over
the failing health of a 10-year-old daughter who suffers from lupus
erythematosus, a degenerative disease that attacks the joints and
immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But Fahmi said her daughter's health had been improving, that
she had only one treatment left, and that they were all hopeful she
would be cured. She said Batouty had taken the girl to UCLA Medical
Center several times for examinations and had planned to take her
back there in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Walid Batouty, a nephew of the copilot, dismissed any connection
between the accident and the daughter's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never do this for the simple reason he would never
put his family through what they are going through right now,'' he
said. ``He loved his children. He worshiped them.''
</P>
<P>
   The young girl, whose name is Aya, looked on from another room,
smiling shyly. Her face and eyes were swollen from tears or perhaps
her treatments. But she had no apparent physical difficulty in
walking and playing.
</P>
<P>
   Before Batouty left on the New York to Cairo leg of the flight,
he had spoken with his wife and family on the phone, Fahmi said. It
was a typical conversation. He talked to his son about buying a
black jacket for him and wanted to know if it was the right style.
He also discussed buying two new tires for a sports car the son
owns, because they are cheaper in the US, and he asked his son to
pick him up at the airport to help him carry them home.
</P>
<P>
   His wife said he had also bought his youngest daughter a Barbie
Doll as a surprise because she had been wanting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am bringing a beautiful gift for you,'' he told the girl by
phone, said his wife, who recounted the conversation in a voice
cracking with emotion and tears.
</P>
<P>
   His family said Batouty had much to live for. He was set to
retire in two months and he was considering working for another
carrier in the Arab world while also collecting his pension from
EgyptAir. But he wanted to work less, feeling that his family had
suffered from a schedule that had him traveling most of the time.
Just before leaving on the first leg of the ill-fated flight, he
had hosted a party for his son, Mohammed, 21, after his graduation
from police academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very proud of his children,'' said his wife, offering
to show a video of Batouty dancing and enjoying the evening of his
son's party.
</P>
<P>
   He was also planning a family party for New Year's Day to
celebrate the millennium and 35 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His wife said that he often told her, ``This house is our
garden, and you are the most beautiful flower of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatouty's family called him a religious man, but not a fanatic.
They said he read the Koran and prayed five times a day, as is the
custom for devout Muslims. He attended a nearby mosque but not
faithfully, because he was so often away on flights. He was also
occasionally drank a beer or a glass of wine, which is forbidden in
Islam, said his landlord, Shafik el Banna.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was religious but not overly religious,'' El Banna added.
</P>
<P>
   Many family members said they were furious at the media for
suggesting that a man who prays as he faces imminent death is
somehow strange or perhaps a fanatic. Egyptian culture is very
traditional and prayers are part of the customs of everyday life,
they noted, and pointed out that suicide is an unacceptable sin for
a Sunni Muslim, as Batouty was.
</P>
<P>
   The family had no obvious financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   They have two vacation villas, a weekend home in a suburb of
Cairo and another on the Mediterranean coast near Alexandria.
Batouty hailed from a well-known Egyptian family, and his father
was the mayor of the city Kafr el Bousy in the Nile Delta.
</P>
<P>
   He earned $48,000 a year, an excellent salary in Egypt. And he
had a side business of leasing family-owned land for farming.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir provided $75,000 of life insurance to all employees,
said EgyptAir Captain Roshdy Zakaria, who knew and worked with
Batouty. Recently, he added, pilots had negotiated to get an
additional $75,000 in insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty did not take out any additional insurance beyond that,
according to both Zakaria and Batouty's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not have insurance. He believed this was a bad omen,''
his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   He had flown the Boeing 767 on the overseas route to New York
and Los Angeles for nearly 10 years. He had also been an occasional
flight instructor for the Egyptian military.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had a dangerous profession, he would comfort his
wife by telling her it is ``more dangerous to drive a car than to
fly a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   His health was apparently excellent. His family said he often
joked that his younger friends envied his good health.
</P>
<P>
   If he had a fault, it was perhaps that he worked too hard,
family members said. They could remember Batouty taking only two
holidays in his career, once on a pilgrimage to Mecca _ the duty of
every devout Muslim who can afford it _ and once for a medical
checkup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man would hang on to life until the last second. He had a
family that he adored. And he loved his wife so much,'' said Walid.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she thinks happened on board the flight, his wife
answered, ``God only knows.''

IRS INVESTIGATORS CONCERNED AS THEY BECOME TARGETS OF
INVESTIGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Urged by Congress to get tough on abuse of taxpayers, a new team
of Treasury agents plans a sharp increase in investigations of
Internal Revenue Service employees for misconduct _ anything from
harassing taxpayers to theft. Indeed, the number of cases expected
to be opened against IRS employees will soon nearly equal the
number of cases against Americans suspected of tax crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new Treasury inspector general for tax affairs has set a
goal for the fiscal year that began last month that would increase
by half the number of IRS workers who will be investigated, and he
plans to increase the goal by at least 25 percent more the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS goal has stirred worries even within the inspector
general's own staff that investigators are being forced to search
for far more misdeeds than may exist, will waste time on trivia and
will be pressured to trump up cases.
</P>
<P>
   IRS managers and union leaders say the intensified scrutiny will
distract many IRS agents as they defend themselves, making the
agency less potent in pursuing tax cheats. Such distractions,
following years of cuts by Congress in the ranks of auditors and
tax collectors, are one reason the IRS plans to slash audit rates
by a third next year.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts are coming even as a growing number of Americans are
using aggressive tactics to avoid paying taxes. Some are taking
advantage of new rules intended to protect taxpayers from
overzealous IRS workers and others are betting that with a shortage
of auditors and collectors, no one will pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the stepped-up efforts say they are important
to prevent abuses by IRS agents. ``The intention of the new office
and the new law is not a witch hunt, but to ensure that IRS
employees and taxpayers are treated civilly and that problems are
reviewed by an independent oversight entity,'' said Sen. William
Roth Jr., R-Del., who sponsored legislation that created the
inspector general's office last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the goals are met, nearly one in 28 IRS employees will be
investigated in the next fiscal year for suspected misconduct _
anything from harassing taxpayers to theft.
</P>
<P>
   Among front-line tax workers, like auditors and tax collectors,
the numbers are even more stark. As many as 1 in 9 will be
investigated. By comparison, inspectors general will investigate
fewer than 1 in 2,000 workers at the Agriculture Department and the
Health and Human Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 235 misconduct investigations have been completed, of
which 161, or about 68 percent, were found to lack merit. In 33
cases, or 14 percent, some form of misconduct was found; in most
cases employees failed to pay their own taxes or threatened a
taxpayer with an audit. In 20 cases, misconduct was found that did
not involve taxpayers; the remaining 21 cases involved non-IRS
employees, such as people impersonating tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The misconduct investigations are only one issue vexing the IRS.
Senior IRS executives, meeting in Washington last month, expressed
their own worries that the agency barely had the minimum resources
to maintain compliance.
</P>
<P>
   These officials attributed this to fallout from the IRS Reform
and Restructuring Act of 1998, which created the inspector
general's office as a unit of the Treasury Department with the
understanding that it would aggressively pursue complaints of
wrongdoing against IRS employees at all levels. That law mandates
the firing of IRS workers who commit any of 10 acts, some of which
employees say are part of their routine duties. For example, the
law mandates firing any tax worker who harasses a taxpayer, and tax
collectors say the standard is so broad that they can be discharged
if they go to a store to collect taxes owed by the owner and
customers witness the effort.
</P>
<P>
   IRS employees are ``walking on eggshells'' out of fear they will
be investigated, disciplined or even fired just for doing their
jobs, the official summary of the meetings said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of Internal Revenue, Charles Rossotti, said he
does not share the concern of many of his executives about the
degree of scrutiny. ``It is critical that every allegation of
misconduct be investigated,'' he said in a statement, ``and in the
relatively small percentage of cases where misconduct has actually
occurred, employees should be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   David C. Williams, the inspector general, said his goals of
4,000 new cases this year and 5,000 next year are not quotas,
although he acknowledged that many of his own special agents were
skeptical, partly because one regional office did assign specific
numbers of cases to individual inspectors. Williams reversed that
directive.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the cases involve IRS workers. About 1,600 cases a year
involve people who have, for example, threatened or attacked IRS
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But in separate interviews, nine special agents in the inspector
general's office said they were told to press misconduct cases
after they had concluded they lacked merit and that managers seemed
fearful of dropping any investigation for fear of missing some
wrongdoing, however minor. But one special agent said inspections
were not aggressive enough. None of the 10 would speak without
being assured anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Quigley, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers
Association unit representing the Treasury inspector general's 445
special agents, praised Williams for his leadership, but said the
goals trouble investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numerical goals may allow the possibility of abuse, by
overzealous agents and by overzealous managers,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators also think they are wasting time pursuing
harassment complaints that clearly lack merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already seen spurious allegations made that, in the
opinion of the investigators, were designed to thwart the
administration of the tax laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Williams, in e-mail to his staff, emphasized ``major cases and
high impact work,'' which is ``the most important element in
expressing our value to our stakeholders in Congress and the
Treasury.''
</P>
<P>
   That language has alarmed the National Treasury Employees Union,
which represents most IRS workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between a goal and a quota?'' asked
Colleen Kelley, the union's president.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Frank Heffler, head of the union's New York chapter, said
anonymous accusations of minor misconduct, like leaving work early,
are treated as major cases. ``Your neighbors are asked if you are a
drug user or an alcoholic and your tax return is pulled,'' he said,
``so instead of finding people who aren't paying their taxes, you
are defending yourself from a charge that could have been proven
false in a minute by just looking at your time report.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Paul C. Light, who has studied inspectors general and is
director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington research organization, said the goal of 4,000 cases
``seems to me investigation run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Light said he found it ``ironic that the very thing that sparked
creation of the IRS' inspector generalship, the setting of
arbitrary quotas on property seizures and the like, is now being
applied to the IRS itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the ``chance of someone filing a false allegation
to cause trouble is present and can be substantial from time to
time, and we do our best to find those and to make sure that no
harm comes to the person who is falsely accused.'' He added, ``We
now are receiving large numbers of allegations that are untrue and
we do factor that in and we understand that we have to be there for
the ones that are true.''

MUSLIM SCHOLARS URGE CAUTION IN INTERPRETING TAPE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Maybe it happened like this: Just before the plane went down,
the Egyptian co-pilot said, ``I made my decision now. I put my
faith in God's hands,'' knowing he was going to sabotage the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it happened like this: Just before the plane went down,
the Egyptian co-pilot said, ``I made my decision now. I put my
faith in God's hands,'' realizing he was powerless to stop the
crash, and reaching out to God in the last moments of his life.
</P>
<P>
   As federal investigators struggle to translate the Arabic voices
on the EgyptAir Flight 990 cockpit voice recorder, Muslim scholars
caution that translation is an imprecise art. Language can be
vague, they say. Words carry different meanings in different
cultures. Officials want to be certain when exactly the co-pilot
uttered his words: before the plane went down, or after it started
to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   But with each news conference or leak about the cockpit tapes,
Muslim scholars note, comes more speculation and more stereotypes.
If a Muslim makes reference to God, Americans unschooled in Islam
assume, he must be talking about death.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this one, you really can use the phrase, `the rush to
judgment,' '' said John L. Esposito, director of the Center for
Christian-Muslim Understanding at Georgetown University. ``If you
don't handle it well, you create a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   America has been through this before. In the first days after
the Oklahoma City bombing, observers were quick to suggest that
Middle Eastern terrorists were responsible. Esposito was invited on
TV talk shows, to muse about connections that didn't exist. His
Muslim friends told him they got funny looks from people they had
known for years.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, Muslim leaders say, that prejudice stems from
ignorance. There are six million Muslims in America, and Islam will
soon become the nation's second-largest religion, said Ibrahim
Hooper, communications director at Council on American-Islamic
Relations in Washington. But the Muslim-American community is still
relatively new _ most immigrants arrived in the last three decades
_ and relatively unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many Americans have learned about Islam from the news,
in stories about the Iranian revolution of the 1970s, the US
hostages in Iran, and other hijackings and terrorist campaigns,
Esposito said. And many have been slow to realize that a few
fundamentalists don't reflect an entire religion, he said. It's as
if someone associated Christianity solely with abortion clinic
bombers who cited the Bible to justify their acts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators analyze the cockpit tapes, he said, they need
to be aware of their ignorance, and cautious of making assumptions.
If the co-pilot were Christian and said, ``God forgive me,'' he
could have been admitting wrongdoing, Esposito said. Or he could
have been uttering a shorthand of the final Christian Act of
Contrition, clearing his conscience before death.
</P>
<P>
   And if EgyptAir co-pilot Gamil El Batouty were strictly
following his Muslim faith, he never would have sabotaged the
plane, Hooper said. The Koran _ which Muslims take to be the sacred
word of God _ explicitly commands against murder and suicide. God
alone has the power to say who lives and who dies, the Koran says.
</P>
<P>
   What Islam does preach is a constant closeness to God, as a way
to ward off temptations to evil, said Javid Malek, a Lexington,
Mass. consulting engineer who is active in the Islamic Center of
New England. That's why Muslims pray to Allah five times daily, he
said, and pepper even their most mundane conversations with tiny
prayers and references to God.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the words El Batouty uttered on the tape appear to be
the basic Arabic statement of faith, said Ihsan Bagby, professor of
international studies at Shaw University in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims are ``amazed that they would think this is a death
wish,'' Bagby said. In the context of surprise, amazement, or
horror, he said, ``it is totally understandable and it is a normal
reaction. It's like saying, `Oh my God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Malek warns, Muslims can't dismiss investigators'
concerns outright. Islam might forbid suicide or killing, he said,
but individuals can go astray. The Koran warns about that
possibility, in passages about Shaitan, the devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``His job is to mislead you from the straight path,'' Malek
said. ``And perhaps sometimes he succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may still turn out that Gamil El Batouty was
responsible for the crash, Hooper concedes. It may be that his
final prayer was a vital clue, a statement of intent. But if so, he
should be viewed as a deranged individual, not a deranged Muslim,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone else of any other faith was mentally unbalanced,''
Hooper said, ``no one would hold that against that person's
religion.''

SUSPICION MOVES TOWARD COPILOT IN FLIGHT 990 PLUNGE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Egyptian officials prepared to review and
examine the evidence, federal aviation investigators have
identified the key words and movements of a backup copilot who they
suspect deliberately pushed EgyptAir Flight 990 into a suicide
dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my decision now. I put my faith in God's hands,'' the
copilot, Gamil El Batouty, said before the jet's auto-pilot
disconnected and the aircraft began a steep dive that reached
near-supersonic speed, according to a federal law enforcement
source with knowledge of the airliner's cockpit recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Television reported Wednesday night that the copilot is
heard on the tape saying in Arabic: ``Tawakalna ala Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase, used commonly in Egypt, is the rough equivalent of,
``God help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments attributed to Batouty, a veteran airline pilot
who was not assigned to fly that early in the 11-hour trip, has
strengthened suspicions that the Boeing 767's 217 passengers and
crew died from a deliberate act _ and that Batouty was at the
controls when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials dispatched here by their government are
expected to begin scrutinizing the cockpit recordings as well as
information from the flight data recorder, considered key pieces of
evidence that the Atlantic Ocean crash site 60 miles south of
Nantucket will soon be considered a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   But other authorities criticized news reports that the
investigation has shifted to Batouty and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Egyptian government did not receive until (Wednesday) the
American authorities' reports of the current investigation
concerning the EgyptAir crash,'' Egypt Information Minister Safawad
el Sherif said in a statement. ``What is being reported in the
foreign media is mere speculation, hypothesis, and imagination that
does not reach the level of documented fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is not expected to turn
the case over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation until Egyptian
officials have had a chance to fully examine the current evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of showing them the evidence and laying it out
to get whatever their input might be,'' said one NTSB official.
``Before we move forward on a decision like this, we want to be
very careful, to make certain we are being thorough and methodical
and correct in our decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said they hope the Egyptian officials will help fully
interpret the conversations, listening for nuances and voice
inflections as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still trying to figure out what this guy was doing,
what his thoughts were, when he was saying his prayer,'' said a US
official who has talked with Egyptian security authorities in
Cairo. ``I don't think anyone for sure knows for sure what was
going on with that person. (They) keep saying that this prayer this
fellow was saying was not unusual, that it wasn't unusual for him
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Egyptians aren't convinced the jet was doomed by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to hear all the evidence and hear everything before
turning it over to a criminal investigation,'' the FBI official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the jet's flight data recorder, which monitors scores of
the plane's mechanical functions, and its cockpit voice recorder,
which captures conversations and other sounds on the flight deck,
authorities are piecing together the final, terrifying moments of
the Cairo-bound jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour after an early-morning liftoff from John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York on Oct. 31, the Boeing
767-300ER began a steep but controlled descent from 33,000 feet.
Within moments, it had reached extraordinary speed, and power had
been cut to the twin jet engines. The speed brake, used to slow the
aircraft in flight, had been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The plane struggled back up to several thousand feet before it
pitched over in a final dive, breaking up just before it smashed
into the ocean about 60 miles off the coast of Nantucket in depths
that reach 270 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder _ one of two ``black boxes'' _ was
retrieved from the ocean floor by a submersible robot last week.
The information on it has helped unravel some of the puzzling final
moments of Flight 990, and authorities will work through the
weekend to produce a transcript.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the recordings, sources said, investigators
believe the crash was deliberate because one pilot left the
cockpit, and the remaining pilot at the helm _ Batouty _ talked of
``going into death,'' according to some reports.
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated audio equipment, authorities are hoping to
electronically enhance the cockpit recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was not scheduled to fly until much later in the
flight to Egypt, Batouty had asked for and was given permission to
take over the plane's controls.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty, 59, was nearing retirement, sources said and his
daughter was critically ill with lupus. The Los Angeles Times said
he was worried about paying her medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that EgyptAir representatives
familiar with Batouty's voice identified it on the cockpit
recording, but officials cautioned that they had no other
verification of the backup copilot's voice. Four pilots were
assigned to the flight, including one other relief pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian officials will try to confirm the identification
and carefully assess the tone and intention of the words he
uttered. They will also try to pinpoint when the prayer is said in
the sequence of events that sent the plane plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   About the time the pilot is heard invoking God's name, the jet's
autopilot is turned off, and it plunged into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   The tape detects the cockpit's door opening as authorities
believe the pilot, Captain Ahmed El Habashi, returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' he asks. Authorities believe Habashi then
tried to regain control of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull with me. Help me. Pull with me,'' Habashi is heard saying
as the plane's elevators on either side of the jet's tail move in
opposition directions: the one controlled from the captain's chair
moved up while the other moved down.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation specialists say that indicated a struggle for control
of the airplane in the twin-yoke cockpit: as one pilot pulled up on
one yoke to make the plane climb, the other pushed the second yoke
forward to make it dive.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators continued their work here, NTSB Chairman James
E. Hall said the Navy will turn over responsibility for retrieving
more of the plane's wreckage to a Navy salvage team.
</P>
<P>
   A large salvage ship, now in Europe, is due at the crash site by
Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy's supervisor of salvage has been directed to contract
for a large ship with heavy lift capability that can operate in
heavy seas, and send it to the accident site as soon as possible
for the retrieval of human remains and aircraft wreckage,'' Hall
said in a statement.

 &HT;    Plaintiffs say Coke withholds papers
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The plaintiffs in a racial discrimination suit against
Coca-Cola Co. said Wednesday the company has repeatedly violated
court orders requiring it to hand over relevant documents in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the court should set a ``date certain'' requiring
the Atlanta-based beverage giant to comply with its obligations,
the plaintiffs' attorneys said. In addition, they said, severe
punishments should be set for continued noncompliance with court
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch declined to comment on the
plaintiffs' motion Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer to present our arguments to the court on Friday,''
Deutsch said, referring to a scheduled hearing before U.S.
Magistrate Judge E. Clayton Scofield.
</P>
<P>
   When the plaintiffs previously raised the withholding of
documents issue, the company said it had provided them with about
40,000 pages of documents and had offered another million pages for
their review.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has accused plaintiffs' attorneys of filing
such motions to unjustifiably attract media attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in addition to the withholding of documents issue,
the magistrate is scheduled to deal with several other matters,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether the company has shredded documents.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that affidavits and pre-trial depositions
showed that employees asked that shredders be placed in a special
room that was set up by the company to collect documents and
employment data for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys also alleged that an eyewitness saw
shredders in the room.
</P>
<P>
   But the company said it has never put shredders in its data
collection room, that it has never shredded any relevant documents
and that the plaintiffs are making irresponsible statements in an
effort to mislead the court and manipulate public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The company said employees once discussed the idea of using
shredders in that room to discard miscopies or extra copies of
confidential documents the plaintiffs would not be entitled to.
But, the company said, that idea was ``immediately vetoed'' in
favor of using two confidential refuse bins.
</P>
<P>
   A company attorney did purchase a shredder for his office. But
he said he did that to discard confidential information that
plaintiffs' attorneys would not be entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether the company has to turn over 93 disputed documents to
the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs contend the company is selectively
turning over favorable employment information, while keeping
unfavorable material from them that they have a right to see.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it has the legal right to withhold these
specific documents for several reasons, including its right to keep
confidential the communications it has with its own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether certain documents turned over to the plaintiffs and
filed with the court can be kept from public view.
</P>
<P>
   The company has stamped ``confidential'' on some documents,
meaning both sides are required to keep them secret, although they
can be used in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs want the court to unseal a handful of
documents that relate to the U.S. Department of Labor's 1997-98
audit of the company's compliance with affirmative action
requirements governing federal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the specifics of that audit are not available to
the public, the company was found to have violated some
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the audit said the company did not adequately
disseminate its equal opportunity policy. Specifically, the audit
said, all managers were not clear about the company's affirmative
action program.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also said the company did not adequately develop
action-oriented programs to eliminate problems and attain
established goals.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch, the company spokesman, said the audit found no evidence
of discrimination by the company against any individuals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the company agreed to alter some record
keeping and reporting practices to better conform to government
guidelines.

&HT;        THORNBERRY, GOP SAY DEFENSE GOALS MET
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.17 - Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Amarillo, joined GOP
leaders Wednesday in celebrating this year's heavy spending on
defense programs and the formation of a new nuclear weapons agency.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress finishes up budget negotiations, GOP members of the
House Armed Forces and Intelligence committees held up the defense
$267.8 billion spending bill - which boosts defense spending by $13
billion over last year as a GOP victory. Republican lawmakers also
touted a new panel devoted to managing nuclear weapons as a win for
their party.
</P>
<P>
   For Thornberry, who authored the provisions to form the National
Nuclear Security Administration within the Department of Energy,
the creation of the new agency was one of the ``significant
accomplishments'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For twenty years, reports inside and outside the Department of
Energy have criticized the management structure over the nuclear
weapons complex,'' Thornberry said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency will be completely insulated from the Department
of Energy, except that its head will report to the Secretary of
Energy, Bill Richardson. In the past, the nuclear weapons division
had taken orders from the secretary, as well as from several
assistant secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposing splitting the agency from the DOE oversight,
the president approved the defense spending bill, and signed into
law in early October.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Reps. Tom DeLay, R-Texas and Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.,
commended their own party for boosting defense this year, despite
Democrats' resistance, and bitterly refused crediting the
president.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said beefing up defense spending was one of Congress' top
three goals achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget makes sure that America can meet tommorow's
challenges abroad with confidence,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said the budget's high defense spending levels corrects a
``misimpression'' that the U.S. gave the world by under-funding the
military in recent years. ``This year, we have corrected that
deficiency by raising military spending in appropriations by $13
over last year's level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry said the new agency will improve nuclear weapons
oversight at Amarillo's Pantex plant and other sites because it is
semi-autonomous from the department, which Thornberry said puts
``accountability into the system.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new system has a clearer chain of command: ``If you
give an order you know it's going to be followed, and if it's not
followed, you know who to hold responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry said this would clarify decision-making at nuclear
weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for the mission that [the facilities] have to
follow; there is accountability as well as some greater focus
because it's an autonomous agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to form the panel was made amidst heightened
tension in Washington in February over security leaks from DOE
computers to China.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Thornberry's plan included Richardson, who worried
that giving the DOE less authority could create a less secure
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new agency will name its own person to handle
intelligence and counter-intelligence. Critics say this would
duplicate the job of the security czar - FBI veteran Eugene Habiger
- who currently oversees intelligence for the whole department.
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry said of the doubling-up: ``It's not the way I would
have preferred it, but it's one of the compromises we made with the
administration when writing the final language of the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   One DOE official, who wished to remain anonymous, said the
department is panicked about the new agency. ``It basically has
split up and fractured things that we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions over the new agency are expected to flare next March,
when the law takes effect.

THALIDOMIDE CAN HELP FIGHT  A  BONE CANCER, STUDY INDICATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Minn., N.J., Mass., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a serendipitous discovery that grew out of the
pleas of a New York woman whose young husband was dying of cancer,
scientists will report Thursday that thalidomide, the notorious
sedative that caused the deformation of thousands of babies in the
1960s, can slow the course of a deadly bone cancer. Some experts
say it may become the most effective new drug for the disease in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 84 patients with advanced forms of the disease,
multiple myeloma, Dr. Bart Barlogie, an oncologist at the
University of Arizona, and his colleagues found that one-third were
helped by thalidomide, and two went into complete remission. While
the numbers are not high, experts say the results are startling
because the patients had not responded to other therapies and the
disease is notoriously difficult to treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very significant,'' said Dr. Philip Griepp, a myeloma
expert at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. In an editorial in The
New England Journal of Medicine, which is publishing Barlogie's
findings Thursday, two experts at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
in Boston wrote that, given the condition of the patients, ``the
effect of thalidomide is indeed remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide was banned from pharmacy shelves worldwide in the
early 1960s, after the birth of thousands of deformed babies,
mostly in Europe, Canada and Japan, whose mothers took it for
morning sickness. In recent years, it has been experiencing a
revival, however, and scientists are studying it for everything
from AIDS to breast cancer. Last year, the Food and Drug
Administration approved it in the United States for the first time,
for treatment of leprosy.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is being marketed by Celgene Corp. of Warren, N.J.,
which provided the medicine for Barlogie's study and helped analyze
the data, but did not otherwise contribute to the research. One of
the 12 co-authors of the article is a Celgene employee and two
others said they owned stock in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Celgene spokesman Bruce Williams said Wednesday that the company
intended seek approval to market the drug for myloma.
</P>
<P>
   No one was investigating thalidomide for multiple myeloma until
Barlogie was pushed into it by Beth Wolmer, a Manhattan lawyer
whose husband, Ira, had received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma in
1995, at the age of 35. Dr. Ira Wolmer, a cardiologist, underwent
three bone marrow transplants and tried an experimental vaccine,
his wife said, but nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always looking for something new,'' said Mrs. Wolmer in
a telephone interview Wednesday. ``I would routinely call
scientists in their labs to find out what they were working on.''
But they had nothing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, however, told Mrs. Wolmer about Dr. Judah Folkman,
a researcher at Harvard Medical School who has theorized that
cancer may be treated by retarding angiogenesis, the growth of
blood vessels that feed tumors. One of the substances under study
in Folkman's laboratory was thalidomide.
</P>
<P>
   A researcher there, Dr. Robert D'Amato, said Wednesday that he
has been pursuing the idea that drugs that caused severe side
effects, like birth defects, would also inhibit blood vessel
growth. He said his experiments show that the drug inhibits tumors
in rabbits and mice.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Folkman could not be reached Wednesday because he was traveling.
He referred questions to D'Amato. But Mrs. Wolmer said that when
she called him, late one Saturday night in his laboratory, and
asked him if he thought thalidomide might work against multiple
myeloma, ``it was like a light bulb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wolmer told Barlogie to call Folkman.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1997, Barlogie said, he had obtained permission
to test thalidomide in Wolmer. The drug did not work for Wolmer; he
died in March 1998. But when Barlogie tested it on a second
patient, he said, the man ``went into almost a complete
remission.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Folkman's theory about angiogenesis, the researchers who
conducted the myeloma study are not certain precisely how
thalidomide works against the disease. Inhibiting the growth of
blood vessels is only one possibility; the drug may also work by
stimulating the immune system's reaction against myeloma cells, or
it might limit the growth of the cells, either directly or by
restricting other factors in the bone marrow that enable them to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   The study measured the success of thalidomide by looking at the
level of a certain protein produced by the cancer causing cells. In
analyzing the patient's urine, they found that the protein levels
were reduced by at least 90 percent in eight patients, including
the two who went into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The levels dropped at least 75 percent in six patients; at least
50 percent in seven patients; and at least 25 percent in six
patients; in all, 32 percent of the 84 patients were helped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the patients experienced the known side effects of the
sedative, including constipation, weakness, sleepiness and tingling
or numbness in their extremities. But because the side effects are
different from those of standard chemotherapy, experts said they
were encouraged that thalidomide might be used in conjunction with
other drugs to treat myeloma and offer relief to patients in
earlier stages of the disease.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society estimates that 13,700 people in the
United States will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma this year;
11,400 patients with the disease will die. Griepp of the Mayo
Clinic said the median survival time of those with the disease is
three and a half years. Experts say new treatments are urgently
needed; the five-year survival rate for patients treated with
chemotherapy has remained unchanged, at 29 percent, for more than
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Michaeli, a myeloma expert at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said it would be
especially important for researchers to learn how thalidomide
worked, particularly because some patients responded while others
did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a clue,'' Michaeli said. ``Once we figure out why some
patients show sensitivity to thalidomide while others do not, I
think we will gain some valuable insight into the biology of
myeloma.'' He said Barlogie's work provides ``an important
lesson,'' adding, ``Here is someone who apparently had no rationale
to use this drug on these particular patients, but he did go this
extra mile, and he sort of hit the jackpot, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Wolmer, she is credited at the end of the New
England Journal for her persistence. ``I didn't save the person I
was doing this for,'' she said. ``But I'm glad it helped everyone
else.''

CONSUMER PRICES RISE 0.2 PERCENT IN OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index went up just enough in October to
sustain concern about rising inflation without showing much
evidence of a rise.
</P>
<P>
   The price index, the nation's most popular inflation measure,
rose just 0.2 percent last month, the Labor Department reported
Wednesday. Higher prices for apparel, airline fares, electric power
and a few other items contributed to the increase, which was the
smallest since June. But the prices of most of the goods and
services that Americans buy held steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation has some moderate upward creep to it, but it is
contained; there is no upward breakout yet,'' said Chris Varvares,
a partner at Macroecomomic Advisers Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has been mild for most of this decade, but the booming
economy, labor shortages, a weakening dollar and rising import
prices all suggest to some forecasters that inflation might finally
begin to rise more quickly. And they saw in the October report some
evidence to support their concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this consistent pattern of a steady acceleration in
inflation and I do not see any sign that it will cease,'' said John
Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. He noted
that when the index is measured over a 12-month period, it rose 2.6
percent in both September and October. That compared with a
year-over-year rise of 2 percent or less in the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices made most of the difference. Remove energy and
food, and the so-called core inflation rate _ the soundest measure
of inflation in the view of many economists _ is up only 2.1
percent over the previous 12 months. Core inflation has hovered at
this year-over-year level for months. In October, it rose 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock and bond markets, however, seemed to worry about
future inflation or that Federal Reserve policy makers, who raised
interest rates on Tuesday, might do so again in the not-too-distant
future. The yield on long-term Treasury bonds rose to 6.13 percent
Wednesday from 6.06 percent on Tuesday, and the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 49.24 points, to 10,883.09. Investors often
respond to a rising inflation rate or rising interest rates, or the
expectation of either, by shifting money from stocks to bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market would really respond if the year-over-year
inflation rate broke above 3 percent, Makin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuitively, people say, `If I don't see a 3 in front of the
decimal point, inflation is not a worry,''' he said. ``If we have 3
percent inflation, we will see 7 percent long-term interest rates
and that would mean the stock market is way overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum prices dipped in October, and that helped to hold down
the inflation rate. But they have rebounded in recent days,
suggesting that oil might be an inflationary factor in November.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the secondary effect of rising oil prices has not yet
found its way into the index, said Patrick Jackman, a senior
economist at the consumer price division of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics at the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, for example, is a raw material in products made with
plastics, but few of those products have risen much in price.
Prices for toys, often made with plastics, fell last month, and
trucking rates have held fairly steady, although airline fares
jumped 5.3 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline contributed to that jump, said Donald Ratajczak,
director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State
University, but it was not the biggest factor. ``Airlines enjoyed
peak business travel in October and business fares are the least
amenable to discounting,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elsewhere, prices reflected no particular trend. Apparel prices
jumped 0.6 percent in October, reflecting temporary factors like
the introduction of fall and winter clothes as well as changes in
the way the bureau calculates clothing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to movies, plays, concerts and sports events jumped in
October after falling in September. Cigarette prices, which jumped
in September, fell in October. Telephone rates rose, but prices for
other information processing fell, as did computer and software
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, inflation concerns persisted. New car prices rose just
0.1 percent, but 2000 year models represented only 37 percent of
the bureau's car price survey. As that percentage rises, so too
will car prices, economists said. That is the implication of a rise
last month in the price that vehicle manufacturers charge dealers,
who may try to pass the increase on to consumers, the Labor
Department reported last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that times are good enough so that dealers can
discount car prices a little less,'' said Richard Berner, chief
domestic economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   What really makes some forecasters brace is ``shelter,'' the
biggest component of the index. Shelter, which covers rent and a
rental equivalent reflecting the cost of owning a home, rose just
0.1 percent in October and 2.2 percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   That is far less than the average rise in home prices. The
purchase of a home is considered by the Labor Department to be an
investment, not a daily living cost. But some economists argue that
rising home prices must eventually have a spillover effect, pushing
up rents and the daily cost of owning a home. ``The housing thing
is the key to the future rate of inflation,'' Makin said.

 &HT;    Interest in buyout a boost to Lodgian
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of Lodgian (ticker symbol LOD) jumped as much
as 28 percent Wednesday after a Cayman Islands-based firm, with
offices in Fort Mitchell, Ky., expressed interest in acquiring the
hotel operator for $6.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Lodgian rose as high as $5.93 3/4 before finishing at $5.62 1/2,
up $1. More than 509,000 shares changed hands, or nearly five times
average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Casuarina Cayman Holdings disclosed in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it now holds a 9.3
percent stake in Lodgian, which operates 133 hotels under such
brands as Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, Marriott and Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   Lodgian's board of directors is expected Friday to evaluate the
unsolicited bid for the company by Casuarina Cayman Holdings, which
is controlled by William Yung Sr.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Lodgian, Robert S. Cole, said the offer
``will be on the agenda for discussion, and a response will be
forthcoming following the meeting.'' He declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   Yung, president of Casuarina Cayman Holdings, said Lodgian would
``fit perfectly with our hotel company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we can do a better job at operating the company
than the present management is doing, which is why we're able to
offer a premium over what the stock is trading,'' Yung said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his company would do differently, Yung said: ``I
don't know, that's why we would like to get a lot of details (from
Lodgian). We've asked for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Casuarina Cayman Holdings owns and operates 41 hotels, with four
more under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Lodgian was formed in 1998 after a merger between
Servico and Impac Hotel Group. The company owns and operates hotels
nationwide, including the Courtyard by Marriott in Buckhead and the
Holiday Inn Hotel &AMP; Suites in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Paul D. Puryear, an analyst with Raymond James in St.
Petersburg, Fla., said Yung is a ``pretty substantial operator''
and someone knowledgeable about the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``the issue comes down to whether he is a qualified
buyer,'' Puryear said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lodgian has $1 billion worth of debt, so anyone who steps up
to be the buyer has to be able to refinance potentially part of
that debt and pass scrutiny with the lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the $6.50 bid price may be too low, Puryear said.
He figures Lodgian could fetch $7 to $8 a share. ``An offer at this
level is inadequate. We're real pleased with what management is
doing. There's no question they've got the company on the right
track.''
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, Georgia's top two performers so far this year
reached 52-week peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Business Internet software provider Clarus (CLRS) rose to $45.62
1/2 before finishing at $45.50, up $6. Nearly 1.4 million shares
changed hands, or more than three times average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   The shares are up 312 percent since Oct. 26, when Microsoft and
Cisco Systems endorsed its products. For the year, the shares are
up 608 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications provider Powertel (PTEL), the object of
takeover speculation, climbed to $85.50 before settling at $79.62
1/2, up 62 1/2 cents. That brought its gain so far this year to 487
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues hitting highs were Home Depot (HD), which
advanced to $81.62 1/2 and closed at $79.93 3/4, up 18 3/4 cents;
and CompuCredit (CCRT), which rose to $30 and finished at $28.50,
down $1.
</P>
<P>
   Among issues hitting 52-week lows was shopping center developer
JDN Realty (JDN), which declined to $16.56 1/4, down 75 cents.

 Jamie Malanowski's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
unsentimental holiday movies.  
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must be harder than hitting a double bank shot for an actor
to play a moment in which his character is at once so repellent yet
so lovable that the audience wants both to turn away and to offer
the character a great big hug (or if not a hug, then the name of a
good therapist).
</P>
<P>
   Consider the scene in ``Happiness'' in which Allen, the
perverse, lonely, obscene phone caller, is spurned by the chilly,
controlling overachiever; she likes his dirty phone calls but not
his looks. Or the moment in ``Boogie Nights'' when Scotty J., the
amusingly awkward gay sound technician, is rejected after he plants
a kiss on the porn star Dirk Diggler at a New Year's Eve party and
ends up welcoming in the 1980s in a pit of self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Or the scene in Joel Schumacher's ``Flawless'' (opening
Wednesday) in which a drag queen, Rusty _ brash, brave, what Bette
Midler might be like if she were not so shy and retiring and
unwilling to go over the top _ shrinks into invisibility when he
puts on a shirt and tie to attend his mother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes like these are priceless, lingering in the mind long
after the rest of the movie has left it, speaking to us about how
people resist easy categories and snap assessments. It can't be a
coincidence that all three characters have been portrayed by Philip
Seymour Hoffman, 32, the stocky blond character actor from the
suburbs of Rochester, N.Y., who at the moment seems a candidate to
become the last hot actor of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, that's sort of a trick; the clock is ticking fast, and
there's no new Skeet Ulrich with a film about to pop out of the
pipeline. But it is true that Hoffman is going to end the year in
sensational style, appearing in three buzz-generating movies.
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``Flawless,'' in which he plays opposite Robert De
Niro, he is in Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Magnolia'' and Anthony
Minghella's ``The Talented Ripley.'' And in February, he will
appear on Broadway in a revival of Sam Shepard's ``True West.''
Hoffman is not likely to cop a People magazine cover in the next
couple of weeks, but soon, an awful lot of people are going to know
who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman _ bleary-eyed and sleep-deprived on a sunny autumn
morning _ seems hesitant to embrace the possibility of becoming the
next big thing. ``I don't know, we'll see,'' he says dubiously. ``I
don't want to assume anything. I don't even want to assume that
people will like what I've done.'' OK, be that way.
</P>
<P>
   The showiest of the three roles is Rusty in ``Flawless,'' the
drag queen who lives in a Manhattan tenement upstairs from Walt, a
retired security guard played by De Niro. The two have a hostile
relationship, but after the abrasive, homophobic Walt suffers a
stroke and is prescribed singing lessons as therapy, he hires Rusty
to teach him, propinquity being the big attraction.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some business about drug money and murder and taxi
dancers and gay Republicans, but the story is really about the
relationship between two men who are very tough, very vulnerable,
very different, with quite a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman disappears in the part, which may seem obvious for a
role that requires a male actor to wear wigs and dresses and
high-heeled shoes. But apart from the look, Rusty is a fully
constructed persona, a personality built not only to serve his
deepest desires, but also to rebuff the ugly treatment he receives.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman didn't have to just create a character; he also had to
create a character who has created a character _ a far more complex
proposition. The result can be seen not only in the way Rusty walks
and stands, and in the different ways he presents himself to his
fellow drag queens and to his abusive boyfriend and to De Niro's
buddy, but also in his ferocity, loyalty, desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Along with directing, Schumacher wrote the screenplay; he says
he spent a lot of time doing research. ``Phil was the only actor I
met that I thought really understood the role,'' he says. ``Rusty
is not a drag queen or a gay man, but a transgender person, someone
who thinks he has been born into the wrong body. And while gay men
and lesbian women have been ostracized, transgenders really have no
solace. A lot of them are very lonely and tortured by it and don't
have a lot of support. Phil understood that, and understood it
immediately, and he brought a lot of humanity to the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman says: ``Rusty's just a person who wants to be loved, who
wants to feel safe, who wants to be free to do what he wants. Who
can't relate to that?''
</P>
<P>
   If unlocking Rusty's character went swiftly enough, the more
physical problems of playing Rusty remained; for the scenes in
which Rusty was onstage in full regalia, Hoffman had to wear a
padded bodysuit that snapped in an uncomfortable spot. ``It was
tough wearing that bodysuit, tough, tough,'' says Hoffman, who has
a habit of coming to grips with his answers by repeating key words,
as if he was using them to brick up the thought. ``It was tough to
get around in. I had a lot of anxieties about getting it right.
Joel and Bob were really very indulgent of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, says Schumacher. ``Bob is just ferocious about detail.
He went to the Rusk Institute to study stroke victims. He designed
weights for his arm so it would hang right. He designed four
different prostheses for his mouth so it would show his progress
over time. He had a therapist on the set, and if he didn't feel
that what we were doing wasn't absolutely, totally correct, we did
it over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Phil's the same way. He worked hard on every detail
about Rusty. He'd do a great take, and when we looked at the scene
on video playback, he'd say: `I don't like the way I'm holding my
pinkie when I'm smoking that cigarette. Can I have another take?'
He's calling that indulgent, but it's a passion for perfection, and
we were all there to serve it. Which, when you're working for
scale, as we all were, is the only way to work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About 180 degrees from Rusty is Hoffman's role in ``Magnolia.''
He plays a hospice nurse named Phil, a nice guy who has been hired
to care for Jason Robards and keep him company in his dying days.
``It's not a coincidence that he's named Phil,'' Hoffman says.
``Paul Thomas Anderson wrote the part for me. That is me.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, the part calls for no moments of intense self-loathing,
no lunging out of desperate loneliness, nothing pitiful or for that
matter hysterical, odious, ludicrous or any of the other adjectives
so frequently trotted out for Hoffman performances.
</P>
<P>
   In a sprawling movie with a big ensemble of actors who are often
thrust into excruciating emotional conflicts, Hoffman has the most
modest part of the bunch. He plays a simple man whose desire to do
good brings more knotted characters _ Robards, Tom Cruise, Julianne
Moore _ face to face.
</P>
<P>
   But playing a nice guy is not as simple as it seems. Two
showpiece moments in ``Magnolia'' are long, emotionally fraught
speeches, one given by Robards, one by Cruise. Hoffman is in both
scenes, listening to these eruptions. But he also acts, offering
subtle reactions that support the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason Robards is just such an extraordinary actor,'' Hoffman
says. ``He's really got what separates the men from the boys. Here
he is, playing a character who's old, who's sick, who's dying _ and
Jason's been sick himself _ and he has to do this, like, 17-page
speech. And I have to listen. Now, listening is hard acting. Some
of the best acting I think I've done has been sitting and
pretending to listen. It's hard. I have to create stuff to listen
to, and it's hard because I'm not very interested. But with Jason
it was just so simple, because every word, every thought, every
idea was so well done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's part in ``The Talented Ripley'' is small but pivotal.
The movie takes place in the 1950s, and Hoffman plays a rich man
from the Upper East Side in Manhattan who is gallivanting around
Europe turning everything into a party but who ends up suffering
when he becomes involved with a person who seems to be a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's honest and boisterous, but he comes across as not that
great a guy,'' Hoffman says of the character. ``And that's why I
like him, because he's right, he's right, he is right, he's on it,
but he's the only one who's on it. And because of that, he's
perceived as a jerk, and gets killed. So it's like, `Who does the
audience have sympathy with?'''
</P>
<P>
   How unusual: a Philip Seymour Hoffman character that the
audience has mixed feelings about. Where does that ability to
appeal to conflicting emotions come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just not afraid to play all sides of the character, even
the really ugly creepy things that go on inside all of our heads,''
says John C. Reilly, who has appeared with Hoffman in Anderson's
three films, ``Hard Eight,'' ``Boogie Nights'' and ``Magnolia'' and
will play on Broadway opposite his friend in ``True West,'' the two
of them alternating the roles of the introverted screenwriter and
his bellicose brother.
</P>
<P>
   Both actors got their start in theater, Hoffman in several
Off-Broadway productions including ``The Skriker'' in 1996 at the
Public Theater and ``Shopping and ...'' last year at the New York
Theater Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is now in Massachusetts filming David Mamet's ``State
and Main,'' an experience he is finding challenging on a couple of
fronts. For one, the part is his first romantic lead. A lot of
people may not think of Hoffman as leading man material,
remembering him as heavyset in ``Happiness'' and ``Boogie Nights.''
But he has lost a lot of weight and is now built like a muscled
compact wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those old-fashioned romantic leads,'' Hoffman
says. ``There's always obstacles keeping this guy from getting the
girl. There's always a dog getting in the way, or a door closing
that shouldn't close.''
</P>
<P>
   The other challenge for Hoffman is working with Mamet. ``Mamet's
a powerful guy,'' Hoffman says, ``and a great writer, a great,
great, great, great writer. He's very precise. And that's fine. I'm
not _ I usually leave things a little bit open for myself. And
sometimes I'll just fall right on my behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamet just has a different agenda,'' he says. ``And so I have
a different challenge: how can I do what David is saying this is.
There is no other way but his. And he's a really smart guy. So if
you say, `Well, I disagree,'' he'll always have an answer for you,
always, always, always. And you don't have the time to debate with
him, you really don't.
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then goes on. ``I find the most conducive
environments are where everything is enriched, where everything is
supported, and taken care of, with intelligence.'' It sounds as if
he has described the perfect petrie dish in which organisms like
Rusty and Allen and Scotty J. can grow.
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``Olivier says acting on film is rehearsing, and
he's right, because no matter how many times you rehearse it before
shooting, when you do it in front of the camera, you're really
doing it for the first time. And to be on a set that is designed
with that idea in mind is a good place to be.''

IRA ISSUES STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE
AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The Irish Republican Army said on
Wednesday that it ``unequivocally'' backed the Northern Ireland
peace agreement, and agreed to appoint a go-between to the
commission charged with disarming the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   The long-sought statement made no reference to an actual
turnover of weapons, and it conditioned the naming of the middleman
on the establishment of the new power-sharing Northern Ireland
government that was called for in the April 1998 peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But in what was seen as a meaningful omission, the message did
not include the defiant claims of previous statements that the IRA
had no intention of ever disarming, and the group, an outlawed
secret paramilitary force, showed a willingness for the first time
to consider dismantling its arsenal, a taboo idea it has always
dismissed as a form of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The statement represented the most dramatic move yet in a
choreographed series of reciprocal conciliatory comments and
pledges this week from the participants in the 11-week mission to
rescue the peace plan. The talks have been mediated by a former
U.S. senator, George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has maintained a cease-fire for more than two years to
support the role of its political wing, Sinn Fein, in peace talks,
but on Wednesday it made its belief in the accord explicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view,'' the organization said, referring to the April
1998 accord, ``the Good Friday agreement is a significant
development and we believe its full implementation will contribute
to the achievement of lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Attributed to the traditional authenticating signatory, ``P.
O'Neill,'' at its end, the message expressed continuing confidence
in the leadership of Sinn Fein and pledged the IRA to ``the search
for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was immediately welcomed by supporters of the
accord as a significant step forward, and denounced by opponents
who object to moving ahead with the start of the
Protestant-Catholic coalition government without any turnover of
weapons beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The quickened sequence of events has turned what had become a
gradually flagging effort at bringing stability to this conflicted
British province into a sudden push for peace with onrushing
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Where there was growing despair just days ago among the
negotiating parties, frustrated by 19 months of delay and several
failed initiatives, there is now the prospect that in two weeks,
they could be taking up their positions in a new Northern Ireland
government with carefully crafted mechanisms dividing power between
the Protestant majority and the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 accord had become deadlocked over the refusal of the
Ulster Unionists to permit Sinn Fein to take its leadership seats
in the Northern Ireland assembly unless the dismantling of arsenals
began first. Mitchell, the chairman of the original talks, was
called in by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, after marathon talks the two prime
ministers conducted in April and again in July failed to budge the
parties from their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The hard bargaining of the Mitchell review settled on a formula
under which the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, would say he
was now willing to let Sinn Fein into a government if the IRA
stated its intention to establish formal contact with the
disarmament panel, which is headed by a retired Canadian general,
John de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble made that promise Tuesday morning, and Sinn Finn
followed with a supportive companion statement hours later. The
stage was set for Wednesday's message from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's willingness to settle for less than a real turnover of
weapons was a major concession, after months of declarations that
he would never abandon his party's ``no guns, no government''
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is to submit his final report and to return to the
United States on Thursday, and the success of the deal he brokered
now rides on Trimble's ability to persuade the many disaffected
Ulster Unionists to give up the party's prior disarmament demand
and support him in agreeing to work with their longtime Sinn Fein
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has apparently developed a working relationship with
Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, and he will be challenged
to convince party members that they can depend upon the word of
Adams, long a reviled figure in their circles. The 850-strong
Ulster Unionist party council is to gather in Belfast on Nov. 27 to
decide whether or not to back Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fresh momentum for approval, Trimble is risking his
position as the head of the party. He got a preview on Wednesday
night of what he faces from Jeffrey Donaldson, an Ulster Unionist
member of the British parliament who has his own designs on the
party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson condemned the IRA statement, saying, ``There is no
timetable, no declaration that the so-called war is over, also no
guarantee that decommissioning will ever happen.'' He concluded,
``It doesn't give anything like the commitments that unionists need
to see.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Five other Ulster Unionist members of parliament put out a
statement urging party colleagues to recognize that accepting the
guerrillas' pledge and letting Sinn Fein into the government
``effectively removes the lines between democracy and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, head of the hardline Ulster Democrats and
a fierce opponent of the entire peace accord, told the House of
Commons, ``There is no place in any government connected with the
United Kingdom for armed terrorists, no matter who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble succeeds in swaying his party, the first days of
December will see the nomination of the Cabinet members to run the
Northern Ireland assembly and the passage of legislation in the
British House of Commons to transfer home rule from London to
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   The first weapons turnover would occur the end of January, with
a goal of meeting the peace accord's May deadline for full
disarmament.

IRAQ IS BOLSTERING ITS MILITARY STRENGTH, PENTAGON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's senior intelligence officer said
Wednesday that Iraq had begun to rebuild military installations
that the United States and Britain destroyed last December and that
he could not rule out the possibility that President Saddam Hussein
had resumed building chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson, the director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, said that U.S. intelligence officials continue
to monitor Iraq closely but that it was easy to hide weapons
production inside legitimate commercial factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say authoritatively there is no work going on,'' he
said in an interview with reporters at the Pentagon Wednesday. ``In
fact, we assume that there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's assessment underscored the Clinton administration's
quandary as the U.N. Security Council struggles to reach agreement
on resuming international weapons inspections in Iraq more than 15
months after Saddam expelled inspectors, setting off a
confrontation that culminated in air strikes last December.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview by the top officer in the Pentagon's
intelligence wing, Wilson also said China had embarked on a
significant effort to modernize its military, which is the world's
largest with some 3 million soldiers, though it is considered to be
far behind the United States in technology and firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen U.S. military might prevail in the Persian Gulf War
in 1991 and during NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, China has
begun actively seeking advanced aircraft, missiles and other
weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have clearly made that an economic priority,'' he said.
And as China's economy expands, ``it will become more significant
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. officials disclosed that the administration and
the Pentagon had raised serious objections to Israel's decision to
sell China a sophisticated, $250 million radar jet similar to U.S.
Awacs, fearing that the technology would increase China's ability
to threaten Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said that in his estimate, China still lacked the ability
to make an all-out attack on Taiwan because of its weakness in
transporting significant amounts of heavy weapons long distances.
But he added, ``They are clearly on track to become a stronger
regional or greater than regional competitor in the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Iraq, he said he knew of ``no significant, precise evidence''
proving Iraq's resumption of its weapons programs, which would be a
violation of the cease-fire agreement that ended the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who visited the Persian Gulf last week, said the raids
last December had set Saddam back militarily, while regular strikes
by U.S. and British jets patrolling the ``no flight'' zones over
northern and southern Iraq since then had significantly damaged
Iraqi air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Saddam remained firmly in power, despite the
administration's declared policy of seeking his overthrow. The
administration recently announced its first, $5 million
contribution of military equipment and training to Saddam's
opponents, but Wilson sounded pessimistic about their potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any great prospects for any of the insurgent
activities being able to effectively move against Saddam right
now,'' he said. ``He appears to be relatively secure.''

 &HT;    A reunion with a cabin in the sky
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Birdie Bomar was a stewardess on the maiden voyage of
``Ship 41,'' Delta Air Lines' first DC-3 to carry passengers in
1940. The trip was from Atlanta to Fort Worth, Texas, with four
stops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   She also rode along when Delta retired the last of its fleet of
DC-3s in 1958. And she was back at Hartsfield International Airport
on Wednesday to be among the 21 people who rode along as Ship 41
carried its first passengers since a complete nose-to-tail
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just as excited as I was in 1940 _ a nervous wreck trying
to get ready to go,'' Bomar said before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen Delta mechanics, dressed in khaki uniforms like those
worn in 1940, were excited, too, snapping photos of the results of
their seven-year, 16,000-hour labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heck of an undertaking,'' said Bill Tinsley of
Senoia, Ga., who began working on the project even before the
once-dilapidated plane was brought back from the airfield in Puerto
Rico where it was found. ``I didn't know if it would ever get to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of retired Delta employees convinced then-President Ron
Allen to pursue finding and restoring one of the company's original
DC-3s, planes that once were the workhorses of the airlines. Once
it was located, Delta swapped another DC-3 and cash for Ship 41.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the restoration was done on a volunteer basis by active
and retired Delta employees. Some got paid near the end.
</P>
<P>
   Project coordinator Robert Coakley, who has worked on the
plane's sheet metal and other parts since March 1996, simply said,
``It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gerken worked on the electrical systems and cockpit
instruments. ``We've had a lot of good times,'' Gerken said. ``It's
quite a good feeling to see it fly. I'm glad it's finally over, but
I'm also sorry it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's ceremonies, Delta CEO Leo Mullin and Bomar
arrived on the tarmac in a red 1940 Ford as the Woodward Academy
band played period tunes. Mullin escorted Bomar to the plane and
watched as she cut the giant red ribbon wrapped around the
fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin described the gleaming silver plane as ``magnificent in
every way.'' He raised a toast of nonalcoholic champagne, turned to
Ship 41 and said ``Welcome home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ship 41'' comes from the last two digits in the plane's
original registration number, 28341.
</P>
<P>
   Bomar said she was relieved to learn that the pilot would be
Billy Mercure, an old family friend. In the 1940s, when DC-3s ruled
the skies, Bomar flew on Ship 41 with Mercure's father-in-law, Dana
Jones, at the controls. Jones' wife, Paige, was a Delta stewardess.
The Joneses' grandson _ Mercure's son Adam _ is Delta's first
third-generation pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm particular about who I fly with,'' Bomar said.
</P>
<P>
   Bomar, on touch-down after a one-hour flight, had nothing but
praise for the plane and its pilot. ``The plane wasn't this nice
when it was new,'' she said.

 &HT;    Nicklaus plans specialty golf course in Georgia
 &HT;    By Andrew Meadows
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus plans to develop a
``Bear's Best'' golf course in Gwinnett County that has a layout
mirroring 18 of his favorite hole designs.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' golf development company, Golden Bear International,
is partnering with Dallas-based ClubCorp Inc. on the 574-acre
development along the banks of the Chattahoochee River off Settles
Bridge Road near Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Pulte Home Corp. plans to build about 500
homes at the development, which will be called Edinburgh. The homes
will range from $250,000 to $1 million. Construction is to begin
next year with a fall 2001 completion date.
</P>
<P>
   The course will draw its holes from more than 150
Nicklaus-designed courses, including Muirfield Village, Shoal Creek
and Castle Pines. The golf course concept, called ``Bear's Best,''
is one of two being developed in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hinckley, president and chief operating officer of ClubCorp,
said the hole replications will be virtually exact, down to the
slope of the fairways and the size and shape of the sand traps.
</P>
<P>
   The development will also feature a driving range and golf
teaching academy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Smart Numbers, a home sales research firm, the
Suwanee area is one of the hottest housing markets in the Atlanta
region. Smart Numbers reported that Suwanee ZIP code experienced
the most new home sales of any metro Atlanta ZIP code outside
Interstate 285.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 1,272 new homes were sold in the 30024 ZIP code, a 12.6
percent increase. The average cost of the homes was $234,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked Atlanta because we feel it is one of the strongest
markets,'' ClubCorp's Hinckley said. ``It also has a strong
corporate presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Richey, ClubCorp's vice president for development, said the
development's housing permits already have been issued, and he
expects the golf course component to be permitted soon.
</P>
<P>
   ClubCorp is one of the world's largest owners and operators of
golf courses. The privately held company owns and operates more
than 200 golf clubs, including Pinehurst Resort and Country Club,
the site of this year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Suwanee development is the first Bear's Best design. It is
being built simultaneously with a course in Las Vegas. ClubCorp and
Golden Bear are negotiating to build two more similar-themed
courses in Washington, D.C. and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the ClubCorp inked a deal with Nicklaus to develop
several courses. The partnership is developing BirchRiver on the
Chestatee River in Dahlonega. The course is to open next year.
Nicklaus also designed the Golden Bear Golf Club at Laurel Spring
in Forsyth County.

BURTON`S `HOLLOW' A HAUNTINGLY EFFECTIVE VISION OF FEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   The sheer, creepy beauty of Tim Burton's ``Sleepy Hollow'' more
than compensates for a certain narrative thinness. Gothic and
primeval, dark and cold yet rich in earthy detail, this horror
movie vision lifts the genre to a new aesthetic high.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been done to Washington Irving's venerable ``Legend of
Sleepy Hollow'' this time around. All that's left from the original
story is its 1790s setting in upstate New York, the headless ghost
of a Hessian mercenary and a romantic triangle between prissy
newcomer Ichabod Crane, the lovely young Katrina Van Tassel and
local roughneck Brom Bones.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about it. The film's script, credited to Andrew Kevin
Walker (``Seven'') and polished without credit by ``Shakespeare in
Love's'' Tom Stoppard, traffics in murder mystery and witchcraft,
and the body count _ make that the decapitated body count _ is, as
you'd expect from a Burton horror film, off the charts. There's a
revenge theme, a burning windmill, a scrappy orphan, flashbacks to
Ichabod's magical/horrible childhood (complete with iron maiden), a
Tree of the Dead ... the changes, like the names of demons, are
legion, and prevent predictability of a certain kind. But the film
does play out in a differently rote manner, as a puzzle of
attrition common to many modern-day supernatural thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Helping move things along agreeably, though, is Johnny Depp's
funny yet fundamentally dramatic portrayal of Ichabod. The
character in this version is a police detective from New York City
who arrives at the Hudson Valley township with a case full of
painful-looking, early-American forensics equipment and a
progressive's superior attitude. The former prove useless and the
latter is tattered by encounters with the Headless Horseman that
usually leave Ichabod in an unconscious swoon and his unlucky
companions dismembered.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't the vengeful wraith slash the life out of the fey
city boy when he has numerous chances to do so? The devil knows
that most of the residents of Sleepy Hollow wouldn't mind getting
rid of the cowardly but nosey sleuth, who's unearthing an
embarrassing conspiracy among the town fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Another question: What does the luscious little Katrina
(Christina Ricci in blond curls and pushup corsets), with her
unconvincing innocence and sweet little book of spells, really have
in mind for Crane? Or, for that matter, what is her mysterious
stepmother (Miranda Richardson) actually up to?
</P>
<P>
   A fine supporting cast of mostly older, mostly British gargoyles
(Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough,
Christopher Lee, an unbilled Martin Landau) provide extra
wigged-and-powdered glower. Christopher Walken is frighteningly
effective as the headed version of the murderous Hessian, while Ray
Park (``The Phantom Menace's'' Darth Maul) lends his strong and
graceful acrobatic skill to the sword-swinging ghost.
</P>
<P>
   But the real act here was performed by production designer Rick
Heinrichs, costume designer Colleen Atwood and director of
photography Emmanuel Lubezki (with a little reshoot help from the
great Conrad Hall of ``American Beauty'' renown). They and the army
of artisans who gave their concepts shape have created a complete
universe, dank with fetid and fecund imagination.
</P>
<P>
   From an old crone's rank and cluttered keep to a grime-dusted
country morgue, from a haunted covered bridge to a stately home so
hopelessly benighted that even a lively harvest celebration there
can turn wakelike and dreary in an instant, ``Sleepy Hollow''
presents an ever-unfolding nightscape of dread. In many ways, it's
the eccentric Burton's most straightforward, least-idiosyncratic
genre exercise to date. But it may also be his most thoroughly
realized expression of bone-chilling artistry.

   WASHINGTON _ The nation's Catholic bishops voted overwhelmingly
Wednesday to require theology professors at Catholic colleges and
universities to obtain certification from their bishops declaring
that what they teach is ``authentic Catholic doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that theologians obtain a ``mandatum,'' or
mandate, emerged at the meeting of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops as the most controversial element in a broad
statement about what the relations should be between the church and
America's more than 230 Catholic institutions of higher education.
The document, which has been under discussion for nearly a decade
and has undergone two major revisions, states that Catholic
colleges and universities are fully autonomous and enjoy academic
freedom, but that their presidents should be Catholics, and,
ideally, so should a majority of the trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Although supporters of the document said they believed it would
not be unnecessarily intrusive, it appears likely to generate
tension at many Catholic universities, which enroll about 670,000
students. Indeed, Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee
warned that the document, if implemented, would be ``a pastoral
disaster for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The document now goes to Rome for approval, which is expected,
given that it was revised to incorporate a more legalistic approach
to the relationship between bishops and universities, which the
Vatican had asked for in 1996, when it sent back an earlier
version.
</P>
<P>
   In its broadest sense, the document, titled ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae'' (a Latin phrase meaning, ``From the Heart of the
Church'') represents the bishops' response to the secularizing
forces at American Catholic universities, which some conservative
critics say have moved away from their original mission.
</P>
<P>
   There have been tensions between some American bishops and some
Catholic universities in recent years. The disputes have often
arisen over the universities' decisions to host public figures
whose views diverge from essential Catholic teaching, especially on
the issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In the discussion that preceded the 233-31 vote approving the
document, some bishops pointed to the long-ago secularization of
Harvard, Yale and Princeton universities, all founded by
Protestants, as examples of the trend that they want to avoid
within their own universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps us focus more clearly on not losing our
Catholic identity,'' Bishop John J. Leibrecht, the Springfield,
Mo., prelate who headed the committee that drafted the document,
said in a press conference after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   One significant unanswered question is what criteria bishops
should use in granting (or revoking) theology professors' mandates.
And what does a bishop do if a theology professor declines to seek
a mandate, given that the document affirms that bishops have no
role in a university's internal affairs, which include hiring and
firing?
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when Ex Corde Ecclesiae will take effect. Vatican
approval could take several months. The document's provisions would
then take effect one year later.
</P>
<P>
   But it could take even longer for the provision for the mandate
to take effect, since the bishops still have to decide on the
procedures that will govern that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The document has already generated controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is redefining the relationship of Catholic
universities and colleges to the church to say that theologians
must request a mandate from the bishop which, once given, can be
withdrawn,'' said the Rev. Thomas Rausch, chair of the theological
studies department at Loyola Marymount University, in Los Angeles.
``Many Catholic educators are worried that this will compromise the
academic integrity of the institutions and the freedom of inquiry
of those teaching theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, who spoke in
favor of the document in the debate Wednesday morning, sought to
put Catholic universities at ease. ``I would say to the presidents
of our Catholic colleges and universities, you have nothing to fear
from us,'' he said. ``On the contrary, this is a new moment of
collaboration'' between the church and its institutions of higher
learning, he added.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The document was also supported by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua,
archbishop of Philadelphia; Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of
Boston, and Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York, who has
not attended the meeting, but sent a letter, which was read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Weakland of Milwaukee, long considered a moderate figure in
the church hierarchy, warned that the document, if passed, would
create distrust between theologians and bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Although he credited the bishops with having established a
``good spirit'' of dialogue with Catholic college and university
presidents, he said that a similar spirit had not been achieved
with theology professors. ``Probably the tension between hierarchy
and theologians now is the highest I have seen it,'' he said.
Catholic theologians, he said, are ``not just afraid of being at
the whims of individual bishops, but also the object of vigilante
groups.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the bishops' vote, Margaret A. Farley, a
Yale Divinity School theologian who is president of the
1,500-member Catholic Theological Society of America, said that
while some theologians would see the requirement for a mandate as
affirming theology's importance, most would worry that it would
lead to a breakdown in trust between bishops and theologians. ``As
such,'' she said, ``it may discourage young scholars from pursuing
theological degrees or from seeking teaching positions in Catholic
colleges and universities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Catholics United for the Faith, a conservative group based
in Steubenville, Ohio, voiced support for the document Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ensure that the teachings of the church are faithfully and
fruitfully taught, we need the oversight of our God-given
shepherds. Therefore, it is necessary that the role of Catholic
universities be subject to the authorities of the church,'' the
group said in a statement after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And in the press conference after the vote, Leibrecht took pains
to emphasize that the bishops did not want to take the role of
disciplinarians of Catholic theologians. ``The bishop is not
involved in the internal affairs of the institution,'' he said.
``If a particular theologian does not have a mandatum, it's up to
the university to decide what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, president
of Fordham University in New York, said much of the document's
effect depends on how it will be implemented by the bishops within
their individual dioceses. But he said the obligation to seek a
mandate lies with theologians, not with their universities. ``It's
really not a legal obligation of the institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Curran, a priest who now teaches at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas, predicted that for many Catholic colleges and
universities, the new measure will have relatively little practical
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to go into effect unless and until the
universities put this in their bylaws,'' said Curran who was
dismissed from his job as a professor of moral theology at Catholic
University in 1986 after the Vatican criticized him as being
unsuitable. ``And the vast majority will not do this because their
trustees are mostly lay people.''

WHEN RAIN DOES NOT FALL IN SPAIN, THE FARMERS MARCH TO PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ Spanish farmers often stage noisy demonstrations to
demand state subsidies, but 4,000 growers who marched in Madrid
last week behind a nervous brown camel and six men dressed as
bedouins sought something more basic: water.
</P>
<P>
   They came close enough to the prime minister's palace that
scores of riot police officers were summoned. No scuffles were
reported but the protesters derided what they termed the
government's inattention to yet another severe drought.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining of ruined crops and the burden of seeking bank loans
to cover their losses, the farmers, from Andalusia, vowed to
continue their protests if the government does not build dams and
pipelines to ensure a steady flow of water. The problem involves
southern Europe from Portugal to Greece, and arid climates and
unstable water supplies are getting more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be a plan in the European Union to transfer
water from the wet northern countries to the dry south,'' said
Antonio Torres, leader of the Guadalquivir Platform, an unlikely
coalition of conservative farmers and leftist unions that convened
the protest (which, incidentally, took place in pelting rain).
</P>
<P>
   But Torres would be satisfied if water were at least transferred
within Spain, where the rainy mountainous north provides little of
its water to the parched south.
</P>
<P>
   A devastating drought from 1992 to 1995 caused water shortages
for 12 million Spaniards, a third of the population, and farmers
suffered big losses. But the heavy rains in 1996 seemingly washed
away the subject until this year, which the National Institute of
Meteorology has listed as one of the driest this century.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it is trying to solve the problem and is
building 33 dams to add to the existing 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   In a peace-making gesture at last week's protest, an aide to
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar emerged from the palace compound to
receive a printed statement from the 26 leaders of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the end of 1995,'' the statement said, ``we have asked
for a solution to the problem of water shortages and in these four
years absolutely nothing has been invested'' by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The protest leaders said $3 billion would be needed to solve the
problem in the next few years, triple the government's proposed
budget for next year for water management.
</P>
<P>
   ``To compete in the market, we need stable production,'' said
Miguel Lopez, secretary general of the Farmers and Ranchers
Organization in Andalusia. ``We lose crops and jobs in every
drought.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said his family, which has an 86-acre cotton and sugar-beet
farm, has had to borrow $63,000, more than ever before, because of
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are particularly angry at what they see as the
government's foot-dragging, like the years of debate on the
national water plan, which has been postponed in part because many
southern growers have modernized their irrigation. Farmers pay
about $100 an acre annually for irrigation water and would be
willing, Lopez said, to help pay for dams and pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The last big water protest in Spain was in 1995, near the end of
the previous drought, when 25,000 farmers converged on the
government water board in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   The protest in Madrid last week was smaller, but it was among
the few to bring the water issue to the capital. Torres said the
Guadalquivir Platform, named for the river through Seville, would
invite farmers in other drought areas to join if more protests are
held. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a finding that may yield a sharp insight into the genetic
reasons for death, a team of Italian scientists Wednesday reported
discovery of a gene that exerts major control over the life span of
mice. The effects of the corresponding gene in humans is unknown,
but experts in aging called the findings a milestone that could
someday lead to drugs that postpone the effects of aging.
</P>
<P>
   The new gene fits into a pattern of other recent findings about
aging that highlight the role of oxygen damage to the tissues as a
major driver of the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen may be the breath of life, but in the body it creates
chemical byproducts, free radicals, that can corrode the cell's
working parts and corrupt the information in its DNA data bank. If
the damage is too severe, cells are genetically programmed to
self-destruct, a fail-safe mechanism to prevent damaged cells
turning cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   The gene studied by the Italian team makes a protein that
triggers the self-destruct process in response to oxygen damage.
Mice genetically engineered to lack the trigger protein turned out
to live 30 percent longer than normal, with no apparent harm.
</P>
<P>
   The gene's effect was discovered by Dr. Pier Giuseppe Pelicci of
the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, together with
scientists at the Institute of Pathology in Perugia, Italy, and the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Their findings
are reported in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in aging described the report as a significant step
forward, although all said the finding needed to be better
understood, and extended to different strains of mice, before it
could be considered decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fascinating start on what could prove an incredibly
exciting pathway for research,'' said Dr. Steven N. Austad of the
University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a milestone that we can alter a single gene in a
mouse and make it live longer, without any obvious side effects,''
said Dr. Leonard Guarente of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente described the Italian research as ``proof of principle
that we will be able to dissect the aging process in mammals,'' and
said that whether this or some other gene is the key to increasing
longevity, ``at least this says there is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious differences, mice are quite similar to
people at the genetic level and provide valuable insights into
their fellow mammal. The new gene's role in protecting cells from
oxygen-related damage is particularly striking because it fits in
with findings from lower laboratory organisms like fruit flies and
roundworms. Biologists who have made these animals live longer by
genetic manipulation have found that their cells are less likely to
die after oxygen-related damage.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the single known treatment that makes ordinary mice and
rats live much longer _ severe restriction of the calories in their
diet _ is one that cuts down on their cells' metabolism of glucose
and the associated oxygen-related damage.
</P>
<P>
   The gene studied by the Italian researchers makes a protein that
forces the cell to die when oxygen damage is detected. The mice
that were genetically incapable of making the trigger protein
presumably lived longer because their cells, even though suffering
some degree of oxygen damage, were no longer being zapped by the
hair-trigger self-destruct mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Pelicci said the trigger belongs to a class of proteins for
which many inhibitory drugs are known, and that it should not be
too difficult to tailor a drug to block it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, who helped
genetically engineer the mice, said that such a drug applied in the
form of a cream might reverse the aging skin's wrinkles and
blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   Other biologists said the discovery, if confirmed, offered the
hope of more important interventions. Caloric restriction seems to
impede a whole set of aging processes, and drugs that inhibit the
trigger protein might produce the same wide range of benefits as
caloric restriction but without the pain, these experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are able to maintain a diet with 30 percent fewer
calories than a normal diet. Should caloric restriction prove to
increase life span in primates as well as mice _ monkey studies are
in progress _ a drug that mimicked the effects of caloric
restriction would be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising aspect of Pelicci's work is that so far he has
found no downside in blocking the manufacture of the trigger
protein. In all other laboratory animals whose longevity has been
enhanced, there have severe penalties, usually in the form of
reduced fertility. Calorically restricted mice do not breed at all.
Surprisingly, the fertility of Pelicci's mice appears to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   There must be some deficit, however, because genes that do not
benefit their owner are soon lost. Both Pelicci and other
scientists expect he will find some adverse effect of losing the
gene, perhaps a fertility effect too mild to have shown up yet, or
some disadvantage not evident in the protected conditions of a
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The expected downside is likely for evolutionary reasons to
occur in the young. Experts on aging believe that if the gene works
the same way in humans, with luck the downside of inhibiting it
would not be a problem in treating older people.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The finding is of one a sudden recent spate of new insights into
the aging process which together have encouraged many experts in
the field to believe a way may some day be found to postpone
senescence.
</P>
<P>
   Aging involves hundreds of different things going wrong all over
the body, a multitude of ills that biologists have long assumed
could never be addressed by a single treatment. The finding that
mice can be made to live longer by altering a single gene suggests,
to the contrary, that a single mechanism trips the body into aging
and hence that drugs that jam the mechanism could postpone all or
many aspects of senescence. ``That is very hopeful,'' said Dr.
Richard Miller, an expert on animal longevity at the University of
Michigan. ``It may not be right but it's hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pelicci's finding was serendipitous in that he was not looking
for a longevity effect. A biologist who studies the genetics of
cancer, he was studying a human gene known as SHC which produces
three different proteins. Two controlled cell growth, the mechanism
that goes awry in cancer, but the third, called p66, had no obvious
role and mice that could not make the protein seemed perfectly
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of the mice's cells showed the role of p66 was to
trigger cell death in response to oxidative damage. Knowing that
resistance to stress-induced death was a hallmark of longer living
fruit flies and roundworms, the Italian researchers wondered if
their mice too would live longer, which proved to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary in Nature on the Italian team's work, Guarente
suggested that the p66 protein has a ``hair trigger setting'' that
vigilantly prevents the build-up of damaged cells during
development. But older animals start to run out of cells, even
though many of the cells destroyed by p66 are viable enough.
Evolution has not corrected the excesses of p66, Guarente surmised,
because the power of natural selection wanes sharply for genetic
effects that appear after reproductive age.

DRUG GROUPS AND U.N. OFFICES JOIN TO DEVELOP MALARIA CURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Major drug companies have joined international agencies
in an unusual approach to keep research in antimalarial drugs from
ending because of the drugs' poor commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
   Each year 300 million to 500 million people become ill from
malaria, and 1 million die, mostly in Africa. The problem is
getting worse because some established treatments are becoming less
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Although the market is vast, ``people who need these drugs can't
afford to pay,'' said Richard B. Sykes, chairman of Glaxo Wellcome,
which plans to join the World Health Organization and the World
Bank in a program called the Medicines for Malaria Venture. The
nonprofit project, with a $30 million yearly budget, plans to
develop and register a new antimalaria drug every five years.
</P>
<P>
   The sum budgeted is only a third of the estimated average $500
million cost of discovering and marketing a new drug, but industry
and public officials fear that without a new approach, no new
antimalaria drugs will come to market.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture ``has been created because the increased costs
of developing and registering pharmaceutical products, coupled with
the prospects of inadequate commercial returns, have resulted in
the withdrawal of the majority of research-based pharmaceutical
companies,'' said the WHO director general, Gro Harlem Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
   The organization aims to halve the incidence of malaria
worldwide by 2010, when the first drugs developed in the new
venture should become available.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ridley, acting head of the program, said the idea to set
up an independent group grew out of discussions by industry
officials on how to keep the drug companies interested in an
unprofitable business area. In the joint venture, the companies
will work with academic researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the cooperation will still require a
cash outlay of $150 million for each drug developed, in addition to
such in-kind contributions as access to companies' chemical
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ridley said, the industry would have to help make sure
that any newly discovered drugs were made widely available.
``You're not going to get a $1 million blockbuster drug, but you
can make it so it's not a huge money loser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 120 research projects have submitted requests for
financing and three have been selected to receive $4 million
through next year. Glaxo Wellcome will work with Bristol
University, SmithKline Beecham with the University of California
and Roche of Switzerland with the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to WHO and the World Bank, the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, the
Rockefeller Foundation, the Global Forum for Health Research and
Swiss and British government agencies are supporting the project.

EGYPTAIR PILOT BECOMES CENTER OF CRASH INVESTIGATION, BUT HE HAS
DEFENDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ His young child's illness has prompted
speculation that he may have been distraught. To some, his sending
of money and gifts home ahead of him seemed loaded with meaning. He
was also facing retirement, although it is unclear whether he was
looking forward to it or dreading it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has begun the effort to understand Gameel el-Batouty, the
Egyptian pilot who, after decades of solid work and numerous
personal successes, is now the man investigators suspect
intentionally brought down EgyptAir 990, killing himself and all
216 others on board.
</P>
<P>
   His defenders, for their part, offer their own facts and
interpretations: He was a religious man who recently had gone to
Mecca, they say, and suicide would be unthinkable. He had bought a
villa here and did not have money problems. He had celebrated his
son's graduation from the police academy over the summer, and, at
the party, had danced for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Once investigators disclosed that they believed Batouty was the
pilot who initiated the fatal actions in the cockpit of the Boeing
767, it was inevitable that every aspect of the pilot's life would
be mined for significance _ to bolster or disprove the theory.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, in a measure of the intensity of the scrutiny,
his family, besieged by reporters, had guards posted outside the
house in a bid to fend off the debate over Batouty's role in the
doomed airliner.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to examine Batouty's life will probably not soon end.
Barring an abrupt reversal by investigators, more questions will
come soon _ by the authorities, by reporters, by people in his own
country.
</P>
<P>
   All will be trying to grapple with what seems inexplicable:
what, if anything, might have driven a 59-year-old man, a veteran
commercial pilot, to seize the controls of a 767 laden with
passengers and point its nose toward the sea?
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo on Wednesday, many people were insisting that something
like this could not have happened, including two of Batouty's sons,
who spoke to a few reporters permitted inside the family's
apartment in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, one of three family
homes in the Egyptian capital. A third son's remarks were heavily
quoted Wednesday in the Arabic-language press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have anything to push him to this,'' one son, Karim,
20, told The Associated Press, portraying his father as a devoted
father and a financially secure man who would never have committed
suicide, much less taken the lives of others.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir officials have said that Batouty, a reserve pilot on
the flight, was sitting in the cockpit during takeoff, in one of
two observer's seats behind the pilot and the co-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour into the flight, American investigators have
said, Batouty apparently replaced the co-pilot and then took
control of the plane when the pilot left the cockpit. He then
apparently set in motion the chain of events that doomed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have identified Batouty as the crew member who
uttered a short Arabic expression moments before the plane's
autopilot was disconnected, and they suspect that Batouty was the
one who took that step.
</P>
<P>
   But no American official has yet offered a theory as to what
might have driven Batouty to take such a step, and the few facts
that have emerged since he became the focus of the investigation
remain ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives said Batouty had persuaded a colleague to
carry gifts and cash home to Cairo ahead of him, instead of
carrying them himself on Flight 990. But they denied reports that
he had sent home his life savings, and said that in all cases the
amounts involved were relatively insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   They also insisted that Batouty did not have any life insurance,
and they rejected any suggestion that Batouty's gift-giving was a
sign that he was not planning to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pocket money,'' Mohammed el-Batouty, 22, the police
academy graduate, said of what he described as a $300 gift from his
father. ``He always sent me money with his colleagues because I was
home only one day a week, and he didn't like to leave my pocket
money with anyone.'' Another gift, a wool sweater, was sent ahead
with a colleague so that Batouty could save space in his own
luggage, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Batouty has also said that his father had telephoned
asking that someone meet him at Cairo Airport upon his return. The
reason, Mohammed Batouty said, was that his father was carrying as
baggage a set of car tires purchased for his son in the United
States, and would need a car to get them home.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates said they saw no signs of stress or
unease in Batouty's demeanor in the days and weeks before the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledged that Batouty, who held the rank of co-pilot,
was frustrated not to have been promoted to the full rank and
higher salary of captain. But they characterized him as a man who
was comfortably preparing for a more homebound life as he
approached March and his 60th birthday, the age at which EgyptAir
pilots must retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a man like Batouty commit suicide?'' asked Walid
Murad, an EgyptAir pilot who, along with Batouty, traveled to the
Muslim holy city of Mecca last winter on a religious pilgrimage
known as the hajj.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another member of that group, Murad said, was Ahmed el-Habashy,
the veteran pilot who was the captain of EgyptAir 990 and with whom
investigators have theorized Batouty struggled for control of the
plane during its plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining EgyptAir in 1987, Batouty had spent most of his
career training Air Force and civil pilots; later, as a commercial
aviator, with the rank of co-pilot, he flew thousands of hours
carrying passengers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The records of the Egyptian pilots are honorable,'' Murad
said. ``Committing suicide is not a trait that Egyptians and
Muslims are known for.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Batouty held a party in honor of Mohammed's graduation
from a police academy. More recently, family members said, he had
thrown himself into supervising the work on a villa outside Cairo
to which the family planned to move after his retirement, according
to reports carried in the Egyptian press.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty had five children, including the youngest, a 10-year-old
daughter, Aya, who suffers from lupus, an immune disorder. On some
of his trips to the United States, associates say, he brought his
daughter with him for medical treatment at the University of
Southern California at Los Angeles Medical Center, a possible
indication of the seriousness of her condition.
</P>
<P>
   At the family apartment, reporters said, a framed photograph of
the stocky, dark-haired Batouty hung on one wall of the small
living room, opposite a photograph of the young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Though Batouty was plainly concerned about his daughter's
health, his wife, Umaima, was quoted Wednesday in the Egyptian
newspaper Al Gomurhia as saying that her husband had telephoned
from the United States during his final trip to say he had learned
that his daughter's illness could be remedied.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his colleagues, Batouty had apparently not made
plans for a new career after his mandatory retirement.
</P>
<P>
   His associates insisted that he had received several job offers,
but was simply looking forward to time off.
</P>
<P>
   The friends and associates of Batouty also said they believed
that American investigators had given too much significance to the
cryptic utterance that the pilot apparently uttered in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase, ``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' can mean ``I put my faith in
God,'' or ``I entrust myself to God,'' and is used commonly by many
Muslims even as they undertake routine tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of other religions say, `Jesus Christ' or `Oh My God,'
and that does not mean they are preparing to kill people,'' said
another EgyptAir pilot, Ali Murad, who is not related to Walid
Murad. ``Why wouldn't it be the same with us?''

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ It was not uncommon in the 1970s for the
children of celebrities to walk among the grizzled,
bourbon-swilling veterans in the newsroom of The Nashville
Tennessean, this city's once-muckraking morning newspaper. Bobby
Kennedy's son, David, and Arthur Schlesinger's son, Andrew, passed
through briefly, as did Judge John Sirica's son, Jack, and Henry
Aaron's daughter, Gaile.
</P>
<P>
   So it raised few eyebrows in September 1971 when the latest
$95-a-week greenhorn, a shaggy-haired 23-year-old named Albert A.
Gore Jr., was assigned one of the heavy metal desks in the front of
the office, where city editors kept an eye on their most
inexperienced charges. Here comes another one, the old guys
muttered. This time it was the son and namesake of Tennessee's
recently deposed U.S. senator, presumably looking to pad his resume
before following his father into politics.
</P>
<P>
   But to their surprise, Gore stayed for nearly five years and
became a skilled investigative reporter before eventually resigning
to run for Congress in 1976. If anything, Gore convinced his
colleagues that he was committed to journalism as his life's work,
and many were caught off guard when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sutherland, a reporter at the time and now The
Tennessean's editor, recalled the day that several reporters
huddled mischievously to plot Gore's political ascent, culminating
with a presidential campaign in 2008. ``When Al found out, he
chastised us very seriously, no tongue in cheek,'' Sutherland said.
``He said, `If it gets out that I'm doing this as a stepping stone
it will undermine my credibility. I'm here as a reporter.' He
wasn't kidding around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he runs for president some eight years earlier than his
colleagues had projected, Vice President Al Gore is anxious to
remind voters that he had a life before politics. In competing
against his only Democratic rival, Bill Bradley (basketball star),
and Republicans like John McCain (prisoner of war) and George W.
Bush (oil patch entrepreneur), Gore is turning to his now distant
career in journalism to provide a sheen of authenticity to an
otherwise uninterrupted political biography.
</P>
<P>
   He now regularly mentions his newspapering endeavors in campaign
speeches. ``I was a journalist for seven years,'' Gore said at a
recent forum in New Hampshire, referring collectively to his time
at The Tennessean as well as his days as an Army reporter and as a
copy boy at The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my editors not to assign me to any political stories,
but after a couple of years I was promoted to cover City Hall,''
Gore continued, ``and I saw how people became heroes in the
community by rolling up their sleeves and trying to make things
better, and I was drawn toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of Gore's nearly 400 bylined articles for The
Tennessean described an annual Hillbilly Day festival, which ``had
it all,'' he said in his lead sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gore's articles were straightforward accounts of local
crimes or Metro Council debates on matters like rezonings and water
rates. He was known more for his industriousness and his difficulty
in meeting deadlines than for the grace of his writing.
</P>
<P>
   But the serious young reporter showed a compassionate eye with
early articles about a pregnant, 13-year-old runaway and a
Christmas Day spent in juvenile detention. And many of Gore's
pieces also displayed a dry, impish wit. When writing about a rabid
fox attack at a nudist colony, he said that doctors ``declined to
say where the victims had been bitten.''
</P>
<P>
   His account of a Burger King hamburger-eating contest reported
that hopes of a record-breaking performance were dashed ``when one
of the contestants regurgitated his first three Whoppers on the
table and dampened the morale of his competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore may have been drawn to politics by the community spirit he
now remembers seeing at City Hall. But he also have seen the petty
corruption that many government reporters eventually encounter, and
his inability to stifle it with his pen seems to have played just
as significant a role in his change of careers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Gore wrote a series of articles about council members
suspected of soliciting bribes in exchange for their support on
zoning measures. To produce his most sensational article, Gore and
The Tennessean's publisher, John L. Seigenthaler, cooperated with
the district attorney in devising an undercover operation that
seemed to catch Councilman Morris B. Haddox in the act of taking a
$300 payoff. Gore and three Tennessean photographers were watching
from a nearby office as Haddox, a pharmacist, took the money on a
downtown street from a local developer who was wearing a concealed
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed an ironclad case. But at the trial, Haddox's lawyer
argued that the freshman councilman had been entrapped by the
newspaper. A first jury deadlocked, and a second trial ended in an
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Gore used the word ``surprised'' to
describe his reaction to the verdicts. But former colleagues said
he was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Warnecke Jr., who was among Gore's closest friends on
The Tennessean's staff, said Gore had been heavily invested in the
Haddox story and was so nervous about the investigation that he hid
documents at Warnecke's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took it as a failure,'' Warnecke said of the verdicts. ``He
was so down and depressed. He had everything on this guy, and yet
this guy got off. I think it destroyed his feelings about justice,
and that was one of the things he liked about being a
newspaperman.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Gore had enrolled in law school at Vanderbilt; he
said in the interview that he wanted to try to understand the legal
system that had freed Morris Haddox. Gore said his goal was to
become a legal reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He also began writing editorials for The Tennessean, moving
eagerly, according to Warnecke, into the anonymity provided by
unsigned opinion columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just wanted to get his name off the front page,''
Warnecke said. ``He didn't want to do another investigation that
would blow up in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore put it this way: ``I thought that I did my best as a
journalist, but I thought that my best as a journalist had not
achieved some of the results that I thought were best. I felt that
whatever gifts I have might better be pursued in another
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Gore could graduate from law school, Rep. Joe L. Evins
surprised voters in Tennessee's Fourth Congressional District by
announcing that he would retire after 30 years in office. Gore,
then 28, immediately announced his candidacy. It was not a move he
had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, only a month earlier he had tried
unsuccessfully to borrow enough money to buy his hometown weekly,
The Carthage Courier. Among his options, Gore said, was using the
newspaper ``to maybe build a base for a potential involvement in
politics 10 years down the road or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's journalistic career began as a Harvard undergraduate in
1967, when he spent two summer months as an ``office boy'' for The
New York Times. He received ``outstanding'' reviews for his work,
which included late-night forays to newsrooms around Manhattan to
swap the first editions of The Times for those of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Gore found himself in Vietnam, having
enlisted in the Army despite his antiwar views, at least partly to
take an issue away from his father's political opponents. Gore said
he was assigned to become an Army reporter, attached to the
headquarters company of the 20th Engineers Brigade because
induction officials noticed that he had worked at The Times and
because he scored well on the entrance tests. He said he received
no special preference as a senator's son for the non-combat post.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gore's five-month tour in Vietnam was spent writing
fill-in-the-blank news releases about soldiers' promotions and
decorations. But he also made occasional trips into the field to
write stories for Army publications about engineering feats like
the construction of new airstrips. He sent one article, a
reconstruction of a firefight near the Cambodian border, to his
wife, Tipper, a part-time photographer at The Tennessean. She, in
turn, passed it along to Seigenthaler, who printed the article and
then offered Gore a job as soon as he returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had absolutely no earthly idea what else I was going to
do,'' he said, ``and so I accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was disillusioned with politics because of Vietnam
and his father's 1970 defeat, and was wary of the potential
conflicts for someone with his name, so he avoided covering
politics for several years. When he did begin reporting on local
government, embracing the aggressive new style of post-Watergate
journalism, his subjects often chafed at seeing the byline of their
former senator's son on critical articles. Several Metro Council
members berated him after he questioned the size of their
delegation and their use of expense money on a trip to a conference
in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was offensive to have this little snot running around with
his poison pen,'' said Joe L. Crockett, a former councilman who
recalled that Gore's penchant for sandals and jeans clashed with
the council's starchy dress code. ``And it was not just that it was
Al Gore, but that it was Senator Gore's son. A lot of these people
had busted their butts for his old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gore's political career has created some awkward
moments for his former colleagues at The Tennessean. The paper has
consistently supported him on its editorial pages, and it employed
his youngest daughter, Sarah, as an intern two summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland, the editor, wrote an apologetic column last August
after it was disclosed that he had granted an interview to the Gore
campaign for use in a fund-raising videotape. And after Gore
disclosed in his 1988 presidential campaign that he had smoked
marijuana, Seigenthaler assigned two reporters to ask dozens of
Tennessean staff members if they had ever witnessed such activity.
``I wasn't happy,'' said one of the reporters, Larry Daughtrey, who
received brusque ``no comments'' from several colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore's national campaign headquarters sits only a
few miles from The Tennessean, and between the two buildings is
Morris Haddox's pharmacy. After being voted out of office after
Gore's investigation, Haddox is now back on the Metro Council, and
he has placed three blue ``Gore 2000'' placards in his storefront
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``His qualifications outweigh anything that happened between
us,'' Haddox said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's views of his former quarry seem to have changed. ``He is
an innocent man, because he was not proven guilty,'' Gore said,
adding that he believes in redemption. ``I'm really moved by the
spirit that he brings to the relationship,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Egyptian government Wednesday escalated its
condemnation of U.S. officials investigating the EgyptAir crash,
saying that, by focusing suspicion on a backup pilot, they were
rushing to judgment about the cause. Egypt's principal spokesman
said that a statement attributed to a relief pilot in the cockpit
was being misinterpreted and did not show that he was about to
commit suicide by sending the plane into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came as a federal official said that aviation
investigators were unsure of the significance of the utterance, in
Arabic, by the relief pilot as captured on the cockpit voice
recorder in the seconds before the Boeing 767 crashed into the sea,
killing all 217 on board.
</P>
<P>
   The chief spokesman for the Egyptian government, Nabil Osman,
said in a telephone interview in Cairo that the words that
investigators believe had been uttered by the relief pilot, Gameel
el-Batouty, was a Muslim prayer ``said in a time of crisis when a
person is facing a difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this prayer would never be said in terms of suicide,''
Osman said. ``It's definitely not to be said by someone who is
going to commit suicide, because suicide is against Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. investigators said Wednesday that despite confusion
about the Arabic phrase, they are still persuaded by information
from the voice and data recorders recovered from the ocean floor
that Batouty may have tried to crash the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that they believed the cockpit's voice
recorders provided evidence that it was Batouty uttering an Arabic
expression that has been translated as ``I put my trust in God.''
</P>
<P>
   At Egypt's request, the U.S. government has delayed a decision
to label the inquiry a criminal investigation and to turn it over
to the FBI. James Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said that more study of the cockpit voice recorder
and data recorder was needed. The crash, U.S. officials said, was a
devastating blow to Egyptian pride. In addition, accusations that
an unstable Egyptian crew member caused it could have a serious
impact on tourism in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The swift agreement by the United States to delay a criminal
investigation reflects the exceptionally close relationship between
Washington and Cairo on a variety of issues, including the Middle
East peace process and counterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other senior Clinton
administration officials have telephoned their Egyptian
counterparts this week to assure them of close consultation between
Washington and Cairo as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said that a group of experts, including representatives
from Boeing, which built the plane, Pratt &AMP; Whitney, which
manufactured the engines, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
FBI and the Egyptian government would begin work Thursday on a
transcript from the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mamdouh Heshman, the head of the civil aviation section of
the Egyptian ministry of transport, and Capt. Mohsne el-Missiri,
the investigator in charge for Egyptair, are among the Egyptians
already in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts tell whether sounds and speech were picked up by the
microphone of the captain or the first officer, or one in the
middle, called the cockpit area mike. They also try to define
sounds, including alarms going off and levers or switches being
moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group expects to work through the weekend and will attempt
to complete this transcript next week,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said Wednesday that a new interpretation
of the Arabic utterance could have some bearing on their initial
theory as to what happened to bring down Egyptair Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those investigators emphasized that the
interpretation of the utterance was not the only factor that had
led them to theorize that Batouty, a 59-year-old veteran of
EgyptAir who was serving as a relief pilot for the flight, might
have tried to crash the plane.
</P>
<P>
   According to that hypothesis, after the co-pilot left the
cockpit, the pilot, Capt. Ahmed el-Habashy, left, leaving Batouty
alone in control of the aircraft. Batouty then uttered the phrase,
``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' and someone turned off the autopilot.
Habashy then returned to the cockpit and remarked that something
was wrong and needed to be fixed. Seconds later, the plane began a
deep descent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators said that their initial theory _ that one
pilot was trying to drive the plane into the sea and the other was
trying to save the jet by pulling the nose up _ was influenced by
the absence so far of any evidence of mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, safety investigators said that Wednesday they had
confirmed from the flight data recorder that an elevator on the
tail _ a kind of flap, controlled from the co-pilot's seat _ was in
the ``nose-down'' angle while the other elevator controlled from
the pilot's seat was in a ``nose-up'' position. The two elevators
are normally aligned.
</P>
<P>
   Senior law-enforcement officials said Wednesday night that while
their theory that Batouty intentionally caused the crash was
plausible and consistent with the evidence, they have not found any
reason why he would have committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo's indignation and anger over the theory that one of its
pilots could have been responsible for the crash comes against a
background in which Egyptians and others in the Muslim world
believe that Westerners can be insufficiently sensitive to the
subtleties of Islam and too eager to attribute deadly events to
Islamic extremism.

BISHOPS CALL FOR STRICTER CHURCH CONTROL OVER CATHOLIC COLLEGES 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds: See optional trims) 
 
By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a ground-breaking decision, Roman Catholic
bishops voted Wednesday for stricter church control over America's
235 Catholic colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The prelates, representing dioceses across the 61 million-member
American church, voted 223-31 for the new strictures, which now go
to the Vatican for approval. A two-thirds majority was needed for
passage.
</P>
<P>
   The move means local bishops must approve theologians _ granting
them a ``mandatum'' to teach _ for the first time since 1789 when
Georgetown University in Washington, the nation's first Catholic
college, was founded. The guidelines also require that ``to the
extent possible'' the majority of university boards of trustees
should be committed Catholics, college presidents should be
Catholic and non-Catholic professors must be ``respectful of the
Catholic faith tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, granting the ``mandatum'' _ essentially a
commission to teach in the name of the church _ is the
responsibility of the local bishop. In theory, if a conservative
bishop wanted to get rid of a theologian at a Catholic college, he
now could.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility and other vagaries concern Catholic university
presidents and some Catholic theologians who lobbied to delay
passage of the new guidelines. They fear the strictures will
curtail academic freedom, undercut reputations of prestigious
schools and prevent them from receiving government funding. Others
fear the new guidelines open the door to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the 1,500-member Catholic Theological Society of
America issued a statement expressing its disappointment that the
bishops did not respond to appeals for further dialogue, saying
efforts ``to juridically control the work of theologians'' are
``potentially damaging to the best work of theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Several bishops raised similar objections Wednesday with
Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee, calling the guidelines
a ``pastoral disaster'' that could put theologians at the mercy of
``vigilante groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to be Big Brother and give all the solutions to
everything? I don't think we want to,'' Bishop John G. Vlazny of
Winona, Minn., said.

   Reaction was mixed among Catholic theologians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth in advertising demands that those who teach Catholic
theology at a Catholic university should be scrupulously faithful
to Church teaching,'' said the Rev. Michael Miller, president of
Houston's University of St. Thomas. ``I'm for it. I would probably
have preferred a little more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic theological society president Margaret Farley of Yale
Divinity School in New Haven, Conn., said her organization is
disturbed that the criteria for granting the ``mandatums'' are too
vague. ``We have no assurance that it (the criteria) would be
applied consistently from diocese-to-diocese,'' Farley said noting
theologians object to being put a legalistic relationship with
bishops.

   American Catholic colleges and universities affected by the
legislation enroll about 670,000 students. Conservative church
people worry some Catholic schools are too secularized. In the
United States, Catholic schools have wrangled with the church over
issues, including abortion, gay rights and theology.
</P>
<P>
   Such tensions erupted into a faculty member's dismissal in 1986.
That year, the Rev. Charles Curran, who now teaches at Southern
Methodist University in Dallas, was told he could no longer teach
at Washington's Catholic University because of his views on
homosexuality, contraception and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   The great divide between Catholic colleges and the institutional
church dates back decades and springs in part from the history of
church-affiliated institutions in the United States.
</P>
<P>

Many American universities, including Princeton University in New
Jersey and Yale University in Connecticut, were founded by
churches. But most linked to mainline Protestants have severed
those ties this century. So have several Southern Baptist schools,
including Baylor University in Texas and Wake Forest University in
North Carolina.

</P>
<P>
   As drafted, it appears the new Catholic guidelines do not
specify which professors of theology will have to obtain
``mandatums.'' But in an earlier draft, such certifications would
have been needed by theologians teaching Bible, dogmatic theology,
moral theology, pastoral theology, canon law, liturgy and church
history at Catholic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines allow a one-year grace period, following approval
from Rome, before they go into effect. A process for continuing
dialogue between the bishops and Catholic theologians is not
included but is assumed, several bishops said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee drafting the guidelines, Bishop
John Leibrecht of Springfield, Mo., said local application will
vary depending upon applicable state and federal laws and needs
peculiar to a particular Catholic school, which range from
research-oriented universities to community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The current discussion dates to 1983 when the requirement for
the mandatum first became an issue after being included in the
worldwide church's code of canon law in 1993. In 1990, Pope John
Paul II issued a decree titled ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae,'' directed to
Catholic universities around the world and meaning ``from the heart
of the church.'' Each nation's bishops had to apply it. The U.S.
bishops in 1996 issued a looser policy, which Catholic colleges
supported, but it was rejected by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of this new document will remain unclear until Rome
acts, the U.S. bishops implement it, and it faces a court
challenge, said Lawrence Cunningham who teaches theology at the
University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. ``Right now, it's
almost like a bill in conference committee,'' he said.

 WASHINGTON: Islamic extremism.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prominent scholars of Egypt and U.S. diplomats who have served
in Cairo say they are concerned that U.S. investigators have been
too quick to rule out catastrophic mechanical failure as the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are holes in this story that puzzle me,'' said Frank
Wisner, , who was U.S. ambassador to Cairo from 1986 to 1990.
``Egypt has one of the lowest suicide rates in the world. They are
not a suicidal people.'' He said that the utterance attributed to
the pilot is commonly used by all Egyptians in everyday settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egyptian expressions are constantly interposed with
communications to the almighty _ when you sit down to eat food,
when you move, you are constantly using the almight's name,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Shibley Telhami, who holds the Anwar Sadat chair for
peace and development at the University of Maryland, said the
Egyptian reaction was based on a heightened sensitivity that
Americans' first instinct in such an event was to think of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a case where the immediate instinct was to portray
whatever statement was made in the cockpit as a prayer and it was
immediately tied to the fear people have in the west of militant
Islam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said that another factor was that the Egyptian
government has found itself battling Islamic extremists and feels
it has been largely successful in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Mamoun Fandy of Georgetown University's Center for
Contemporary Arab Studies said Wednesday that the Egyptian
government is very proud of its efforts to combat terrorism and
``especially proud of its security procedures on EgyptAir which is
the national carrier.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as U.S. and Egyptian investigators struggled to sort out
the cause of the crash, American lawyers who specialize in aviation
disasters said that they were planning lawsuits against EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Kreindler, a New York lawyer who has represented the
families of victims in several major jet crashes, said Wednesday
that he had already been retained by the family of one of the
EgyptAir victims and that he expected to represent several others
in lawsuits against the Egyptian carrier.
</P>
<P>
   He said that under international aviation agreements, it would
matter little if the plane had been brought down by a suicidal
pilot or a mechanical error in terms of EgyptAir's liability.
</P>
<P>
   Under international treaties, an airline is responsible for the
crash of one of its planes unless it can prove that it took ``all
necessary measures'' to avoid the crash, a legal hurdle that has
proved difficult if not impossible for airlines to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler said EgyptAir would certainly not meet the standard if
the cause of the crash was a pilot suicide. ``EgyptAir employed
that pilot, they had the opportunity to train him and test him,''
he said. ``The argument is not going to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspected that any effort by EgyptAir to point
investigators away from a conclusion of pilot suicide had nothing
to do with the airline's fear of legal liability. ``It's more of a
matter of honor and disgrace for them,'' he said.

YOUNG GUNS, SAFE SHOOTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SAUGUS, Calif. _ In today's political environment, in which
kids and guns often are thought to be a poor combination, some
might not only be surprised but startled _ even outraged _ to
discover that one of the state's few private trap-shooting teams
comprised entirely of teen-agers competes in the Santa Clarita
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a place for such a team, and the reason is that it
takes the illicit fascination out of gun use,'' said Sylmar
computer technician Wayne Johnson, father of two members of the
Rock Chuckers _ the North Hollywood Sportsman's Club Youth Shooting
Team.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, participants say, such a rare opportunity
promotes gun safety, independence, self-esteem, camaraderie and
pride in competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the boys should be trained in how to use a weapon,
how to be responsible and how to be good members of the community,
and this clubinstills those qualities,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Scout Master became familiar with the program when his Boy
Scouts troop trained for its shotgun or rifle merit badges with the
help of North Hollywood Sportsman's Club instructors at their San
Francisquito Canyon shooting range. ``Kids are going to have fun
shooting; the fun was a given. The emphasis is on safety and
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Refreshing attributes, to be certain, in an age when qualified
supervision in such matters  &UR; !ital! &LR; isn'ta given.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the dozen competitors themselves and you'll quickly
find just how serious they are about dissolving any stereotypes and
extinguishing any misconceptions _ all the while having a swell
time doing something they love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns and kids don't always mix, but people come out here and
watch us and see what we're doing, we're safe,'' said Nick Sawhill,
18, of Granada Hills. ``All people have to do is come out and watch
us one time and they can see how it is. They are going to see kids
shooting, being safe.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a single visit during a practice staged each last
Saturday of the month or during quarterly competitions, one can see
that they are proving that kids can have a very real, grounded
respect for weapons _ shotguns broken, muzzles down, ear and eye
protection worn religiously. If anything, impressionable youths can
be as safe _ or safer _ than adults because they are less apt to
harbor a know-it-all attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to be learning from experts dedicated to preserving a
sport _ which is contested at the Olympics in its highest form _
that has not enjoyed the healthiest returns in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here is super supportive,'' said Johnson's
17-year-old son, Tyler, who is joined on the Rock Chuckers by his
brother Marcus, 16. ``Even people I don't know. They'll say,
`You're dropping your gun. You're not following through.' I've
learned that when you've shot, you should keep moving your gun
where the target should be; the (shot) pattern continues to travel,
so follow the bird down the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Adult club members anticipate their patience will pay off; it's
an act of self-preservation, one that's needed if the shooting
sports are to survive, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youths are the next step to tomorrow; they are our
tomorrow,'' said Bradley Cornell of Shadow Hills. She keeps track
of the youth team's scores and organizes the squads _ putting
together two groups of five for that 10 shooters who are required
to form a competitive team.
</P>
<P>
   And while most Rock Chuckers are children of members, the North
Hollywood Sportsman's Clubextends an invitation to anyone 18 and
younger to consider participating. ``The more the merrier,''
Cornell explained.
</P>
<P>
   With a healthy coffer built up over its 60-year existence and a
grant from the sponsoring National Rifle Association, the club is
committed to expanding its youth trap-shooting team. ``We have the
funds to do it; now we need the kids,'' said club board member and
youth coordinator Joe Kubasak of Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the team last year,'' he explained, ``because at
all the different round-robin events (intraclub shooting contests),
no one was promoting youth shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just took it upon ourselves; we thought it was necessary to
get youths shooting because of all the bad press that guns get. And
we all know we gotta pass this sport down to somebody. It's just
senseless not to get them involved. So we made a conscience effort
_ the board got together and we all voted to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting within the Boy Scouts paid off, with Marcus and Tyler
Johnson joining the squad. Others who show interest and promise can
receive one year's honorary membership into the club, a requirement
of youth-team members; shooters must pay a $100 club initiation and
$50 for annual dues thereafter. Until a gun can be afforded and
purchased, one is provided. Ammo and use of the range are included.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to make it affordable, No. 1, and fun,'' Kubasak
said. ``We just want them to participate, And so far, we are very
successful, I'd like to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Success also has been measured in the improvement of shooting
scores over the course of five trap tournaments since the squad's
inception. The team's collective tallies have jumped by as much as
16 percent, and one individual's score has more than doubled,
marking an improvement of nearly 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boys have amazed me,'' Cornell said. ``The first time
they came out here, they were shooting six and 10 (out of 50 clay
pigeons). Now one (shooter) topped out at 46 in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournament action takes place against themselves, since they
haven't found another youth squad to square off against.
</P>
<P>
   While there are some high school trap teams around California,
as few as two other private youth trap teams exist in the southern
half of the state, according to Thomas Audetat, the National Rifle
Association field rep for Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   One is found within the Apple Valley Gun Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is good for the kids is it's an
individual sport; they compete with themselves to improve their
scores at all times,'' said the club's junior chairman, Sue Kirst
of Apple Valley. ``It teaches them a lot of concentration. They
become focused. It gives them confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Which also translates to such life issues as education, she
said. ``In schoolwork, you are also competing yourself; you want to
do better than you did before.'' &QL;

Daily News.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Do you believe in the power of
accessories?
</P>
<P>
   Cher apparently does. The Accessories Council named the
flamboyant diva one of this year's Best Accessorized Celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 well-heeled women on the list ``understand the value of
accessories and have promoted them in both their personal and
professional lives,'' says Sheila Block, executive director of the
council. ``Accessories help us define our own sense of personal
style.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Best looks like this: TV newswomen Katie Couric
and Barbara Walters; New York socialite Blaine Trump; songstress
Lauryn Hill; Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow; and mega-kilowatt
actresses Cameron Diaz, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts and Sharon
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   At the council's third annual awards earlier this month, the
following also were announced:
</P>
<P>
   Best Visual Merchandising in an Accessory Department _ Saks
Fifth Avenue
</P>
<P>
   Company with Best Accessory Advertising Campaign _ Kenneth Cole
</P>
<P>
   Best Coverage of Accessories by a Consumer Fashion Magazine _ In
Style
</P>
<P>
   Best Accessories Licensed Program _ Ralph Lauren
</P>
<P>
   Best Accessories Designer _ Kate Spade
</P>
<P>
   The top prize, the Accessories Council of Excellence Award, went
to ``Another World'' actress Linda Dano. Previous winners include
Joan Rivers and Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Accessories Council was formed four years ago to
raise awareness of the $25 billion business in jewelry, handbags,
belts, shoes and other accessory items.

 &HT;    From hard-core to no more _ a former smoker sometimes feels
regret
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It will happen tonight at a jazz bar or
a birthday party or a lonely city stoop. Someone, somewhere, will
bum a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   And she'll smoke just that one.
</P>
<P>
   She'll mooch it from a regular ol' smoker, a sheepish person
with darkened fingers who always smells slightly of nicotine, and
then she'll lean back and relish the heady buzz. She'll enjoy every
last second of that stinking thing, then stub it out like a pro.
And come tomorrow, when the sun comes up, she'll get out of bed and
go about the day, never giving a second thought to cellophane
wrapping and misplaced Bic lighters and smoking sections and
midnight jaunts to the corner store.
</P>
<P>
   I hate these people.
</P>
<P>
   For 23 years, I wanted to smoke like that, the occasional
smoker, the person who smoked one day and not the next. But I
couldn't. I would get up in the morning and fix the coffee in the
kitchen and have my first cigarette before 8 on the back porch. I
would smoke on the way to work and again when I got there and then
again at 9:45. I'd have a cigarette before lunch and another one
after. I'd smoke when I was sick to my stomach and when I had a
headache and when I had the flu. Smoking defined me and no one _
and I mean no one _ ever imagined I could quit.
</P>
<P>
   I was always the hard-core smoker of the bunch, the one who
could, and would, light up the morning after a particularly
decadent night. But eventually, I got tired of the headaches and
the cough and dullness in my chest. And I did it. I've done nothing
spectacular with the money I've saved. I've yet to lose the weight.
But it's been 589 days since I've had a cigarette. Not that I'm
counting.
</P>
<P>
   I have survived all the things I imagined I could not: car
trips, hurricanes, family crises, newspaper deadlines, writer's
block, loud children, late-night telephone talks and one or more
decent beer buzzes. I have slipped just once _ a previously
undisclosed three-puff indiscretion at a Bob Dylan concert. It
tasted divine.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 47 million smokers in this country, and
my husband happens to be among them. This is not to lecture him.
Lectures do no good. This is not an attempt to blindside him with
my inspiration. His own will come with time. This is just to say
that I am a regular person who lived for 23 years with a regular
addiction. Then on April 6, 1998, my dear friend's 40th birthday, I
woke up with a determined plan to leave the cigarettes behind. I
chewed sugar-free gum until I was nauseous and ate little carrots
by the bags. I barked at my husband. I held my son. My emotions
were wacky and my insides itched and my feet would not be still so
I could sleep. And those were the good days.
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes ask me if I'm glad I quit and, really, it's
inexplicable. Every morning, I wake up happy that I do not smoke.
The remainder of the day is a little more complicated. The other
morning I saw a young mother smoking a cigarette in her car, a baby
in the back seat. She was holding her cigarette hand out the open
car window and fanning away her exhaled smoke. It was early _ say 7
a.m. _ and the morning sun had turned the light inside her car into
a smoky haze. And watching her made me half sick to my stomach. Not
the child or the mother or the right or the wrong. Just the thought
of smoking. Then the next day I smelled someone's cigarette on the
smoking porch at work, and my mouth literally watered.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, enough time has passed for me to have met people who
never knew me as a smoker. I find this incredibly odd. It's like
people not knowing I'm married or a mother or a writer, all of
which are givens in my life. Of course I smoked. I lived some of
the most interesting years of my life tethered to ashtrays and
matches and after-dinner disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes and I drove across the country together. We cried on
the phone with friends. We sat alone and wrote bad poetry and
celebrated births and mourned deaths. I patterned my days by my
next cigarette break and made many, many friends at smoking
outposts here and there and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So, you're darn right I don't like occasional smokers, those
disciplined folks who have managed to inhale the euphoria but not
the addiction.

 &HT;    America's long romance with tobacco
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today is a special day for those last-of-a-dying-breed
loyalists to the century's most successful consumer product.
Cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the 23rd Great American Smokeout.
</P>
<P>
   The Great American Smokeout and Earth Day. For a
quarter-century, these days of subdued protest and quiet reflection
have tried their symbolic best to halt the conflagrations that
threaten our most precious natural resources: our planet and
ourselves. But fires still denude the rain forests, and cigarette
smoke still blackens lungs.
</P>
<P>
   More acres of jungle than ever _ and more lungs than ever.
</P>
<P>
   More teen-age lungs. More Chinese, Cambodian, Thai, Kenyan and
Brazilian lungs. Up to 90 percent of grown men's lungs in some
developing countries. More women's lungs. As many American lungs as
in 1990, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which means younger Americans are picking up where
older, dead Americans, left off.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 6 billion pairs of lungs on the planet today, almost as
many are smoke-filled as there were humans on the planet 100 years
ago: 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlboro Man has roamed the range worldwide with great
success. He has lassoed smokers by the hundreds of millions _
billions, counting the dead ones.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he, not Bill Gates or Henry Ford or Dr. Jonas Salk, should
be the American Man of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the day to contemplate all of this. And, if you smoke,
it's the day to give quitting a chance. The rest of the country
will contemplate with you, offer support if you go cold turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Some things to contemplate: At the turn of this century there
were no cars, no airplanes, no computers, and no mass-produced,
mass-marketed products such as razors, cosmetics, Wheaties, Beanie
Babies or cigarettes. Then came Ford, the Wright brothers, IBM's
Thomas Watson, Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   And tobacco's Buck Duke, a Southern planter known for his
ruthless deal-making _ the old grandad of the modern cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue which American consumer product _ cars, TV,
computers, cigarettes _ is the most successful of the century, but
you can't argue which is the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITABLE BONSACK MACHINE
</P>
<P>
   Duke didn't see controversy at the turn of the century when he
beheld a contraption called the Bonsack machine. It could roll 200
cigarettes per minute. Buck Duke saw profits.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy is now a $200 billion-per-year industry. It employs
hundreds of thousands, pays dividends to millions of stockholders.
And it kills its customers.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy with historic hindsight to discount Duke's vision. A
cigarette's most active ingredient, nicotine, is addictive. Even
cigarette companies say as much now. Once America lit up, it stayed
lit up. But Duke knew nothing of nicotine. He saw market potential.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Watson didn't have as clear a vision with his products:
``I see a potential worldwide market for maybe five computers,''
said Watson, in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   And the automobile was not destined to be a mass-market product.
An English newspaper said at the turn of the century that the
automobile was going nowhere ``because there are not enough
chauffeurs to sustain large sales of automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke saw potential from the get-go, and he went after it in the
best tradition of American get-go-ism.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT 'EM
</P>
<P>
   This has been called the American Century. We extended our reach
worldwide. We brought peace, democracy, Mickey Mouse, Babe Ruth and
TV to the four corners of the world. And Buck Duke brought
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   On the homefront, the U.S. government gave cigarettes to
returning doughboys and GIs, sent smokes directly to VA hospitals.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, said the drill instructors. Doctors
recommend Lucky Strikes, said the advertisements. The government
gave fat subsidies to tobacco growers, gave the tobacco industry
the deal of a lifetime: For the entire century, tobacco was the
only consumer product not regulated and tested by the government
for its effects on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered neither food nor drug. It is King Tobacco, the
leaf that made America, immortalized in song, made fashionable by
Bogey and Bacall, nurtured by field hands under summer sun,
protected by generations of senators and congressmen and
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you're in Washington, D.C., look upward at the
columns that line many of the corridors within the U.S. Capitol
building. Look at the fancy, scrolling stonework atop the columns.
Look again. Those are tobacco leafs. King Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine is King Tobacco's illegitimate stepchild. Nicotine is
why office workers will take the elevator 40 floors down, step
outside into sub-freezing temperatures and light up. The American
Cancer Society says nicotine reaches the brain within eight seconds
of inhaling a cigarette. It's both a stimulant and a depressant. It
is a drug. It lends clarity to thought, focuses mental energy. It
is not necessarily a bad drug, but the delivery system _ a
cigarette _ also delivers carbon monoxide, noxious tars, lead,
arsenic and a host of nasty and benign chemicals, more than 100 per
puff.
</P>
<P>
   But still they _ we _ light up. Smokers' stories are different
pages from the same book: I love the taste. I love my coffee and
cigarette. I knew the risks but just couldn't quit. I'm on oxygen
24-7 and my emphysema will kill me, but I still miss the things.
</P>
<P>
   And the denial jokes, the black humor: I mean, what are you
gonna do after a romantic interlude, slap a patch on your arm?
Different pages, same book. The book of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   By the grim numbers
</P>
<P>
   You need a computer to do tobacco by the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   _ By the year 2025, more than 500 million people worldwide will
die from cigarettes, according to former U.S. Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop.
</P>
<P>
   _ That's a Vietnam War of American casualties per day, a Titanic
every 27 minutes for 27 years, says Koop.
</P>
<P>
   _ The yearly worldwide medical, cleaning, fire damage and lost
work-time costs of smoking cannot be calculated. More than a
trillion dollars is probably in the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cigarette companies will pay at least $300 billion in legal
settlements to state governments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cigarette smokers will actually pay the settlements through
increased prices.
</P>
<P>
   How will it all end? Not today, Smokeout or no.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe schoolchildren will someday have to learn about another
Hundred Years War. The first, children, took place long ago between
England and France. The second took place in the 20th century, the
Tobacco War, some call it. Nobody won.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the old days, you turned left at Cezanne's
``Bather'' and proceeded, one gallery after another, until you hit
Pollock, Pop and Minimalism, and that, pretty much, was that.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art, a primary author of the First Book of
Modernism, laid down this history in neatly organized movements
with the high points and patriarchs all clearly indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative had an almost biblical authority and
inevitability. God created Picasso, who created ``Les Demoiselles
d'Avignon,'' from which all else descended as from Adam's rib.
French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, that is, the
groundbreaking paintings of Cezanne, Monet, Seurat, van Gogh and
Gauguin were Old Testament, the prophets of the coming Light.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Modern Starts: People, Places and Things,'' you can say
goodbye to all that, at least for the moment. The show completes
its floor-by-floor unveiling Sunday, with the opening of the
``Things'' section. For starters, there is no clear beginning: you
can go left or right, start at either end. You get to choose, and
to a remarkable and sometimes frustrating degree, you get to make
it up as you go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Starts'' is the first of three enormous shows with
which the Modern is fanning the siecle, as it were, while also
examining its unparalleled collection and the way it has
historically been shaped and presented. Each is being organized by
an interdepartmental team (itself highly unusual for the Modern),
will fill the entire museum and will be up for several months.
(``Places'' and ``Things'' are on view through March 14, ``People''
through Feb. 1.)
</P>
<P>
   With some additions fore and aft, ``Modern Starts'' concentrates
on 1880-1920 (the second part, opening in March, looks at
1920-1960; the third, which arrives next fall, at 1960-2000). Its
organizing team, headed by John Elderfield, chief curator-at-large,
and Peter Reed, the curator of the department of design and
architecture, decided to abandon the familiar narrative, or any
narrative at all, and let art history take the hindmost.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is all here, it turns out to be a doozy of a show:
unwieldy, confusing, amazingly ugly in spots, jarringly arbitrary
in others, repetitive in still others and appallingly misogynist
throughout (there's barely a female artist in sight).
</P>
<P>
   Yet it tries, in some places valiantly, to buck the museum's
oppressive tradition, to suggest that a big exhibition can be a
series of speculative what-ifs and curatorial feints in this and
that direction and to send the mind ricocheting among thoughts
about history, visual culture and the challenges and
responsibilities of the curator's craft. As one might expect, it is
also chock-full of great art.
</P>
<P>
   The curatorial team has approached the show's four-decade span
not in terms of styles, periods or chronology but by subject.
People, places and things are, more or less, the figure, landscape
and still life, the three pillars of academic tradition that became
the launching pads of modern art. Each of these headings has been
subdivided into several smaller exhibitions, some as large as four
galleries (and frequently overlong), or into clusters of works.
</P>
<P>
   The individual shows are clearly demarcated in ``People,'' which
has seven, and ``Places,'' with six; ``Things,'' organized on the
open plan, has four or five loosely defined groups of objects and
artworks.
</P>
<P>
   Within this structure, the exhibition presents what might be
called a sweeping but episodic view of the inexorable drift toward
the modern that began in Europe in the middle of the 19th century.
It is conveyed by fragments of different shapes, sizes and essences
_ historical, formal, technological, psychological.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Places,'' a big section called ``Rise of the Modern World''
traces its subject in photography, encapsulating the early growth
of the medium in the process. Another big chunk of ``Places''
reverts to the Modern's beloved core narrative _ the evolution from
Impressionism to Cubism _ recounting the tale exclusively in French
landscape painting, which the museum owns in abundance and has
never exhibited on its own.
</P>
<P>
   In ``People,'' one sees signs of what might be called modern
consciousness in one of the galleries subtitled ``Composing With
the Figure,'' where images and sculptures of heads and faces reign
supreme. Back in ``Places,'' one senses opposition to modernization
in a small section titled ``Landscape as Retreat: From Gauguin to
Nolde,'' which contains etchings and woodblock prints of isolated
houses and figures by Gauguin, Munch and the German Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary art puts in an occasional appearance. Installation
pieces on the walls of the garden hall galleries give each section
a bit of visual fanfare more or less in tune with its contents: a
big white-on-black wall drawing by Sol LeWitt for ``People''; a
wall surrealistically covered with clumps of artificial flowers,
the work of Maria Fernanda Cardoso, for ``Places''; and, making the
most sense, ``Objects, Ready or Not,'' by the British artist
Michael Craig-Martin, a billboardlike tract of images that depicts
some of the objects included in ``Things'' in hot colors and cool
black outlines.
</P>
<P>
   These isolated cameos make more sense than the persistent
leakage into other time slots throughout the show. ``Posed and
Unposed: Encounters With the Camera'' in ``People'' contains 44
photographs, 25 of which date from after 1930, while many of the
photographs throughout ``People'' and ``Places'' are from before
1880.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things'' starts off with a ravishing series of advertising
posters that like Pop Art, isolate single objects on fields of
solid color. Three are the work of the German designer Lucian
Bernhard; three are by his follower the Swiss designer Niklaus
Stoecklin and date from the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   There are some wonderfully focused moments: a small gallery in
``People'' devoted to the prints of the Mexican artist Jose
Guadalupe Posada and the Belgian James Ensor, two artists from
different worlds, unknown to each other, who worked the same
satiric vein at the same time in remarkably similar ways; another
features the furniture of Hector Guimard, whose sweeping, curling
lines helped ignite French Art Nouveau.
</P>
<P>
   And there are also moments when the exhibition just grinds to a
halt, like a pedestrian patch of ``People'' called ``Actors,
Dancers, Bathers.'' By the fourth gallery of this section, where
Matisse's ``Dance'' is flanked by four of Cezanne's ``Bathers''
etchings, a Picasso ballerina and whatnot, you might as well be
back at the old Modern again.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, at times you may wish you were, partaking of its
clarity and showmanship. The ``Demoiselles,'' for example, looked
better under the ancien regime, in splendid isolation on its own
wall, as if it were the genesis point of modernism, which it is,
according to the gospel. Here, its brusque forms are displayed
between Matisse's great streamlined ``Piano Lesson,'' and Picabia's
bulging, polymorphous ``I See Again in Memory My Dear Udnie,'' a
group distinguished by shared pinks and discordant notions of
abstracting the human form.
</P>
<P>
   But here ``Demoiselles'' looks like what it is _ a great
painting, not a cataclysmic event; this simply achieved
diminishment is an interesting lesson in itself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some sections might as well be titled ``Curators Just Want to
Have Fun.'' The lush if overly homogenous exegesis on French
landscape painting is followed by a spacious, wildly disparate
gallery vaguely titled ``Seasons and Moments.'' Here the art simply
leapfrogs from Monet to Alfred Stieglitz to Cy Twombly to Bill
Viola.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kandinskys are seen in a templelike folly that turns out to
be a re-creation of the New York apartment foyer for which they
were commissioned. And in a particularly sophomoric touch,
Brancusi's ``Newborn,'' a golden, globelike orb, has been placed in
front of Miro's ``Birth of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere you can almost hear a professorial voice in the
background saying, ``Next slide, please.'' This occurs most
blatantly in the ``Unreal City'' section of ``Places,'' perhaps one
of the ugliest groupings of outstanding paintings ever to grace a
major New York museum: a jangling progression of canvases by
Matisse, Mondrian, Delaunay, Leger, Feininger, Severini and most
frequently de Chirico.
</P>
<P>
   It's a formalist relay race. Each painting has one thing (and
usually only one) in common with each of its neighbors. For
example, a Delaunay shares a tower form with a de Chirico on its
left and a passage of fractured, aqua-colored light with a
Feininger on its right. The Feininger in turn shares a row of
arches with another de Chirico to its right. This de Chirico
centers on a statue, as does the Matisse to its right. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   A large map, chart and text panel reveal an underlying
geographical logic: all the paintings were painted in Paris during
World War I, where, the text contends, their abstracting tendencies
were partly a reaction to the war's bewildering destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the artists often lived within a stone's throw of
one another, as the map demonstrates. This information, easily an
MA dissertation, makes somewhat more palpable than before our
notion of Paris before 1920 as a hotbed of invention carried out by
vastly different sensibilities, but I'm not sure it justifies the
visual mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   And occasionally there are groupings that should immediately be
absorbed into the next installation of the permanent collection.
One is found among the same-subject-different-style mismatchings of
the ``Composing the Figure'' section in ``People'' (Gary Hill and
Boccioni?).
</P>
<P>
   It is a gallery that seems to focus on the penchant among
turn-of-the-century artists, including Signac, van Gogh, Klimt and
Schiele, to depict people not just in front of, but embedded
within, richly patterned or painted surfaces. These paintings
essentially reflect the encroachment of abstraction, of
art-for-art's-sake upon representation.
</P>
<P>
   But on the gallery's final wall, another arrangement suggests
quite the opposite: the encroachment of photography on
representational painting, as evinced by portraits that include
Carjat's portrait of Baudelaire, Cameron's of Tennyson, Nadar's of
Georges Sand and Degas' of Rodin sitting next to Mallarme. Adding
to the exchange is the fact that the photographs assume the
conventions of older, more traditional forms of portraiture than
the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   If the main strength of ``Modern Starts'' is refutation of
linearity in favor of multiple ``partial'' narratives, as
Elderfield calls them, its weakness is that it doesn't go nearly
far enough with this or its other concerns. It still radiates an
oppressive Francophilia, reflected in the ubiquity of works by
Picasso, Cezanne and Matisse, the constant references to Paris and
the absence of much painting by anyone else _ Americans, Germans,
British.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an unavoidable reflection of the Modern's
collection, but the attempt to temper it could have been more
strenuous. Even ``Things,'' where the show lives up to its mission
most successfully, can't get by without four Cezanne still lifes
and several works by Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the stunning refusal of this show to allow women
even a ``partial'' presence except as artistic subjects. Of the
dozen or so women represented in the show, only half actually lived
and worked during the period it covers, and excepting the designer
Eileen Gray and the Surrealist Meret Oppenheim, whose fur-lined
teacup is included in ``Things,'' they are all photographers.
</P>
<P>
   (In addition, more recent photographers, like Diane Arbus, Tina
Barney, Dorothea Lange and Helen Levitt, are included in the
``Posed and Unposed'' section.) This is less a step than a free
fall backward, a purge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things,'' isolated on the ground floor, forms an inadvertent
coda to the exhibition. It is the first place where you can see
more forest than trees, which highlights what is lacking in the
galleries upstairs. For one thing, it is beautifully installed in a
way that allows different objects in various media to play off one
another.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the media are in fact various: only in this final
section have objects of design and graphic design been allowed to
mingle freely with paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and
photographs. One is able to watch objects move through various
states, from two to three dimensions, from art to advertising to
nonart.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Gray's classic black lacquered screen, a piece of highly
finished functional art, plays off Brancusi's ``Endless Column,'' a
work of nonfunctional, ruggedly handmade art, and Duchamp's ``Fresh
Widow,'' a French window with blackened panes that has been
appropriated as art.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where the show comes to life, one sees the missed
opportunities. It's unfortunate that furniture, which is
essentially figurative, hasn't been allowed to animate the
proceedings of ``People,'' or that artifacts like the concrete
reliefs retrieved from Frank Lloyd Wright's Midway Gardens, or the
big handsome section of Louis Sullivan's ornate wrought-iron facade
for the Gage Building aren't able to join Guimard in ``Places.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this exhibition opens a very big, very important
door but, for the most part, declines to step through it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the 20th century began, cooking was hard work. There were few
things to make a housewife's life easier, and virtually everything
had to be made from scratch. Even families with modest incomes had
paid ``help'' in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Many housewives counted themselves lucky if they had running
water (yes, a pump counted) inside the house. If not, water had to
be drawn from a well. Wood had to be carried, and a fire had to be
made in the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The cow had to be milked. Coffee was ``boiled up'' in a pot on
the stove, often with a eggshell thrown in for clarity. Biscuits
had to be baked, meat and eggs fried, gravy made, jars of homemade
jam brought from the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   All this and it was only 6 a.m. And there were two more meals to
prepare that same day.
</P>
<P>
   Women's work in the early 1900s was generally in the home, and
much of it was spent growing and preparing food _ and, of course,
cleaning up afterward. Housewives were ready for new advances that
made their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, times were prosperous despite _ or perhaps in part
because of _ Prohibition, which drove even the law-abiding to drink
as sweet cocktails masked the taste of bathtub gin. Chinese
restaurants provided a bit of exotica. For ladies, tearooms became
popular, as did gelatin salads, the fruit-filled Lady Baltimore
cake, devil's food cake and pineapple upside-down cake. At the end
of the decade, with the stock market crash, financial havoc was
created on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rough financial times in the '30s, Americans loved to
socialize and found affordable ways to do it. Sunday night suppers,
tea parties and one-dish meals made entertaining inexpensive.
Gadgets such as the new electric toaster, waffle iron, percolator
and electric mixer made it fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were new things to cook, too: It was in this era that
zucchini and broccoli first became widely available in the United
States. Ruth Wakefield changed American snacking forever when she
chopped up chocolate and mixed it into cookie batter, creating the
first chocolate-chip cookies, which she named Toll House Cookies
after the New England inn she and her husband ran.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking methods became standardized, and assorted cookbooks
began to appear. With the opening of Route 66 between Chicago and
Los Angeles, highway eateries thrived. So did food companies, which
introduced a wealth of new products.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s _ with the best of American food sent overseas to
soldiers and sailors doing the fighting _ those left at home had to
make do with what was left. Meat, coffee, sugar, butter, cheese and
canned goods were rationed _ if they were available at all. So
housewives _ who might have spent their days working in a defense
plant _ planted victory gardens to provide for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Basic American home cooking was the food of the day. Only the
very rich still had servants. Patriotic housewives saved bacon fat
to use in cakes and made their own jams, jellies and pickles. With
commodities scarce, entertaining was often coffee and dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Housewives also benefited from some foods produced for GIs _
dehydrated soups, dried potatoes, canned biscuits, pudding mixes,
margarine and vegetable oils. After the war, GIs brought home a new
taste for exotic food, especially pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed in the food realm. Frozen and pre-made foods
became available _ and supermarkets made shopping easier. A
prosperous future with an abundance of food _ including gourmet and
convenience foods, plus new and more exotic restaurants _ was on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, with World War II and the Korean War over, GI Joe
was home, his wife was back in the kitchen, and that kitchen was
often in the suburbs, where new houses were being built with
fabulous kitchens, patios and barbecues. Beef _ long before any of
us knew about cholesterol _ went on those barbecues. Add a baked
potato, a salad and garlic bread, and you had a meal as American as
apple pie. That's not to say suburbia wasn't a breeding ground for
gourmet cooks, though: Beef Stroganoff and baked Alaska were tops
on any gourmet's list of dishes to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Swanson was marketing TV dinners, complete
frozen meals the family could eat while watching television. Other
convenience and frozen foods also came into their own. Fast-food
chains got their start and boomed.
</P>
<P>
   The psychedelic '60s were a mishmash of food trends, from fast
food to spa food, from blender gazpacho to fondue, from soul food
to luaus. To really put on the dog, cooks dished up veal Orloff,
beef Wellington, rumaki and more. With the affluence, prosperity
and jet travel of the era, foreign foods became more familiar and
accessible. Ethnic restaurants appeared in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s, known by many as the ``me'' decade, was a time of
singles bars, mood rings, pet rocks, Earth shoes and disco, a time
when even the food had strange names, like Screaming Yellow
Zonkers, Fluffernutters and Harvey Wallbangers. Eventually, though,
dinner parties, cooking classes, nouvelle cuisine, regional
cuisine, the food processor and such trendy foods as goat cheese,
farm-fresh greens, chocolate truffles and specialty produce became
all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Crock-Pots (electric slow cookers) had moved into the kitchen,
along with bundt pans and granola. And cooks were turning out
zucchini and carrot cakes slathered with cream cheese frosting
along with crepes and quiche. Restaurant favorites were fettuccini
Alfredo, main dish salads, salad bars, ranch dressing and Kahlua.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had had enough of spa food and itty-bitty portions in
the '80s. They wanted comfort food like Mom used to make. Meatloaf
was king again, along with fried chicken, mashed potatoes (although
cooks added garlic) and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   America's power elite and baby boomers had become foodies,
wheeling and dealing over power lunches at high-priced restaurants
and becoming awed by star chefs who became celebrities at a time
when status and style were all-important.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing _ eating a bit of this and a bit of that throughout the
day _ was the ``in'' thing, and so were Cajun and Southwest
cuisine. Salsa replaced ketchup as the favorite condiment. Cooks
could find kiwi, mangoes, mesclun, free-range chickens, goat cheese
and creme fraiche in markets. Pesto was a new favorite, along with
risotto, croissants and muffins. Cholesterol-lowering oat bran made
up for all that comfort. In the home kitchen, heat-and-eat
convenience foods _ with no cooking required _ were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a backlash to all that comfort food, in the '90s
Americans became obsessed with fat _ how much in food items and
dishes and how to reduce intake _ along with nutrition, health and
fitness. Supermarkets began devoting more shelf space to nonfat and
low-fat cookies, sour cream, cream cheese, ice cream and products
containing a new low-fat fat named Olestra as manufacturers rushed
to get in on the fat-free, reduced-fat product craze. Some were
good and found a permanent place on the shelves; others were so
poor and disappointing that they disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obesity rates soared. Other consumers were into luxury
and quality (super-premium ice creams, fine wines and cheeses, for
instance). Biscotti in an array of flavors became popular. And
bread machines, turning out custom loaves with little effort,
became the rage for home cooks. Foods that were once only available
at ethnic markets were now available in supermarkets. And now it
was possible to order groceries, talk with other cooks and find
recipes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As you look back over the last century in food, reminisce with
this sampling of some of the most popular recipes. Depending on
your age, you may recall having eaten _ or cooked _ some of them. &QL;

COPELAND, CHAMPION OF THE AMERICAN SOUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Aaron Copland, who died in 1990, must have winced a bit when,
late in life, he found himself proclaimed America's greatest
composer.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, for all his self-effacing collegiality, he was
gratified. And the assessment was deserved. Other American
composers have loomed large in this century and produced impressive
catalogs. Elliott Carter's music is more ingenious than Copland's.
Roger Sessions' works are rightly respected for their structural
rigor, impressive density and seriousness of purpose. And the
flinty Charles Ives is by far America's most original composer.
</P>
<P>
   But in its freshness, consistency, auditory acuteness, rhythmic
vigor, spare harmonic beauty and authenticity, Copland's music is
the finest body of work an American has produced. It has certainly
touched the widest range of people, from jaded professional
musicians to the common man Copland saluted in his famous
orchestral fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is the matter of that pesky qualifier, that adjective
of nationality: greatest ``American'' composer. Doesn't it smack of
the Eurocentric snobbery Copland fought against all his life?
</P>
<P>
   If it bothered Copland, he had no one to blame but himself, for
no composer strove more consciously to be American. Born in a
tenement two floors above the dry goods store his Lithuanian Jewish
father ran in Brooklyn, Copland never lived far from New York and
never felt comfortable in any other country, with the possible
exception of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The few years he spent in his early 20s studying with Nadia
Boulanger in Paris and traveling through Germany were for him the
equivalent of the college education he never got. It was important
to absorb what was going on in contemporary music, and Paris was
then the center of it. But he returned from Europe more strongly
resolved than ever to stay home and work to foster among his
colleagues a distinctively American voice for new music.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway, jazz and pop song composers of America in the
early 20th century had found such a voice. Those working in the
classical tradition, Copland felt, were still beholden to European
models. Composers had to turn to their own heritage for inspiration
and source materials, Copland believed. Russian music had a
distinctive sound and tradition, as did French, German and Spanish
music. Why not American music?
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters, including some colleagues Copland was trying to
rally to the cause, argued that this goal was self-limiting and
pointless. In a 1926 letter, the intellectually formidable
Sessions, an avowed internationalist, upbraided Copland for
``wasting precious energy'' on anything ``so vague and dubious as
the `future of American music.'''
</P>
<P>
   Copland's friendly rival Virgil Thomson, wary of all
compositional schools, thought that writing American music was a
no-brainer. ``Just be an American,'' he said, ``and write any kind
of music you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sessions' warnings and Thomson's kidding, Copland
managed to fashion a musical voice that has been accepted ever
since as quintessentially American. All any composer need do to
evoke America is to imitate Copland: the jazzy polyrhythms and
asymmetrical meters; the lean textures; the angular melodies; the
spiky, percussive orchestrations; the sonorities with intervals as
wide open as the plains; the unpatronizing use of folk tunes and
cowboy songs; the sturdy modal harmonies that suggest hymns played
on harmoniums in countless frontier churches.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the image of Copland as Musical Americana obscures the range
of his achievement, which holds up to any international standard.
His popular acclaim rests on a handful of works that get performed
too often for their own good. The best thing about the New York
Philharmonic's Completely Copland festival, a three-week
retrospective that began on Saturday with a Young People's Concert
conducted by Bobby McFerrin and really gets going on Wednesday
evening with a concert conducted by Kurt Masur, is the opportunity
it provides to hear the full scope of Copland's work.
</P>
<P>
   Next Nov. 14 is the 100th anniversary of Copland's birth, and it
is being observed with some 200 events internationally over the
year, a project called Copland 2000 and spearheaded by the
composer's vigilant and eternally grateful publishing house, Boosey
&AMP; Hawkes.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic's offering is the largest component of the
celebration. Virtually all of Copland's orchestral works, as well
as music for film, dance and opera, will be performed in six
different programs led by five conductors. In addition, 10 prelude
concerts will present performances of chamber music, piano works,
choral pieces and songs, with commentary from lecturers and
panelists.
</P>
<P>
   The series offers a roster of thorny, seldom-heard works that
may startle many concertgoers who think they know Copland. How
often does one get to hear ``Connotations'' for orchestra, the
beautifully severe 12-tone work that Copland wrote for the 1962
inaugural concert of Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall),
which was conducted by Leonard Bernstein, the composer's most
ardent disciple. Even the Philharmonic has presented the work only
twice since its premiere, most recently in 1989, again with
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one prelude concert the Sextet for Clarinet, Piano and String
Quartet will be performed. This is actually a 1937 arrangement of
Copland's Short Symphony (1933), an orchestral work renowned for
its difficulties: relentless syncopations, crisscrossing rhythms
and almost constantly changing meters. Stravinsky wrote few pieces
stronger than this sextet. Yet it seldom turns up in chamber music
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another inexplicable rarity is the Piano Fantasy, which the
pianist Michael Boriskin will perform in the festival. Completed in
1957 after several years of labor, this is a monumental, gritty,
technically arduous half-hour composition, freely adapted from
12-tone techniques and true to its name. It holds up to any
20th-century piano piece, by Schoenberg, Messiaen or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Here the use of dissonance is bracing in a way that somehow
seems, well, American. There is no sense of European angst about
it. Rather, the astringent harmonies are ecstatic, energizing. It's
as if Copland were saying: ``Just listen to that dissonance. Isn't
it wonderful?'' The Fantasy is inexorable yet elusive in design,
like an adventure trip with ``few familiar landmarks,'' in the
words of the composer Arthur Berger.
</P>
<P>
   In many years of concertgoing I have come across only one
performance of the piece, during a Copland tribute presented by the
ensemble Boston Musica Viva at Jordan Hall in 1979. Copland, who
was present, had not heard the Fantasy performed for some time, he
said, and was awe-struck by the playing of the pianist, Randall
Hodgkinson. ``It's like you're reading my mind,'' Copland, clearly
moved, told the pianist.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic programs draw from all periods of Copland's
work, which are more diverse than is generally realized, especially
the period during the 1920s when Copland, trying to shake up his
language and make it American, borrowed from jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporating jazz into his symphonic music ``signified a
defiant badge of contemporary urban America,'' Howard Pollack
writes in his new biography, ``Aaron Copland: The Life and Work of
an Uncommon Man.'' Thomson later referred to Copland's venture into
jazz as his friend's ``one wild oat.''
</P>
<P>
   Though witty, the remark is a bit unfair. Works like the Piano
Concerto and ``Music for the Theater,'' which will be performed by
the Philharmonic, are raucous, rude and vibrant.
</P>
<P>
   Copland eventually felt he had come to a dead end. Jazz was too
powerful; it resisted getting dressed up for the concert hall.
Copland's jazz works started sounding like stiff, self-conscious
imitations of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s he simplified his harmonic language. But by the
1950s he was already experimenting with 12-tone music. Pollack, in
his book, convincingly challenges an existing assumption, that
Copland, following Stravinsky's example, started writing 12-tone
music out of a fear of being considered obsolete by younger
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Copland was always curious about new developments. By this time
he felt that his harmonic language was becoming stale. Why did he
turn to dodecaphonic techniques, Bernstein once asked him?
``Because I need more chords,'' Copland replied. ``I've run out of
chords.''
</P>
<P>
   That Copland's music was so stylistically diverse would seem to
complicate the question of its American character. Isn't it futile
to specify what makes his music, or any music, American? What makes
German music German? Copland's bare, widely spaced modal harmonies
may conjure up the spacious American plains. But Palestrina wrote
similar chords in 16th-century Italy. Sturdy, simple hymns may
evoke plain-spoken American pioneers. But Martin Luther's chorale
tunes are just as simple and sturdy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a disarming quality in all of Copland's music that
comes from its shifting moods, by turns joyful and ecstatic,
brusque and riotous, pensive and reserved. Somehow, the shifts
never seem tortured or neurotic; rather, just two sides of the same
identity, expressed clearly, without apology or fuss. But is this
American?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that quality comes more from Copland's personality than
from any general character trait of the American people. For a
homosexual man coming of age in the America of the 1910s, Copland
was remarkably well adjusted. He accepted his difference, and the
resultant isolation, with inner calm and little self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he cultivated privacy. In public he was avuncular and
discreet about his personal life. With friends he was open and
easy. But the public reserve, the public face, was always there,
not least in his music.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable document movingly captures Copland's sense of
reserve as it relates to his music and illuminates the question of
his Americanness. In 1974 he conducted the chamber ensemble version
of ``Appalachian Spring'' for a Columbia recording. Included with
that album was a six-inch bonus record of excerpts from the
rehearsal session, and it is a revelation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, have we come a long way where food's concerned in the last
100 years _ and it's been a delicious and fun-filled journey. At
the outset of the 20th century, getting meals on the table was hard
work. There were no refrigerators, toasters, or gas or electric
ranges. Gadgets and appliances like stand mixers, blenders and food
processors were nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Buying groceries was a time-consuming effort, offering consumers
little choice. Canned, frozen and convenience foods gradually began
to appear. New types of eateries _ including the cafeteria, soda
fountain and fast-food establishments _ offered quicker, more
accessible and less expensive options for eating out.
</P>
<P>
   Self-service grocery stores and giant supermarkets were born.
And the culinary scene exploded with new foods, restaurants and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that Americans greeted each new advance _ from
the introduction of packaged cake and pudding mixes to microwave
ovens and bread machines _ with great enthusiasm?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a listing of some of the products, gadgets and (we've
come to believe) necessities that have helped make our lives in the
kitchen easier over the past century. Some may take you down memory
lane.

 UNDATED: a revelation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The players are top-rank, and as Copland greets them, he wryly
says, ``I assume you all know the piece.'' Someone answers back,
just as wryly, ``Only by reputation.'' A collegial mood thus
established, the musicians set to work. Before hearing a note,
Copland issues directions for the tranquil opening episode of the
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``A warm, soft sound without any sense of effort,'' he requests.
To the clarinetist, who will play the simple triadic opening motif,
which is the germ of the entire piece, Copland asks for a ``sort of
noncommittal sound.'' The musicians start to play, but Copland soon
stops them. ``Do it without any sense of diminuendo on each note,''
he tells the string players.
</P>
<P>
   At the first breakout section of the score, the Allegro dance,
he asks for the music to be bouncy, playful. ``This is a barnyard
dance,'' he says. ``It's not symphonic.'' When the dance fades
away, except for a recalcitrant jumpy flute, and a string chorale
tries to change the mood, he warns the musicians, ``Watch out, this
is getting too sweetly sentimental, a little too on the Massenet
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling moment comes at No. 16 in the score, when the
music seems to want to settle into a simple little oompahpah dance,
but the rhythms become irregular instead, and a solo clarinet plays
a wistful elongation of the triadic opening motif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it more American in spirit, in that the sentiment isn't
shown on the face,'' Copland says. ``More cool. The music by itself
is warm. You don't have to help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Copland never gave a more succinct summary of what being
American meant to him as a composer and a man. Maybe there is no
such thing as an essential American character. But in his work
Copland convinces us that there is. And if in pursuing this
American idiom, Copland limited his scope, he certainly humanized
his voice. That's what people respond to.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree Copland's call to find a collective national
voice resonated among his colleagues, his role in organizing
composers was pivotal. His work in this regard will be a recurring
topic in panels and lectures during the retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   Copland conscripted a little commando unit of American
composers. Thomson, Sessions, Roy Harris and Walter Piston were the
soldiers; Copland was the officer in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was a loose-knit group. Harris spent most his time
out West teaching, taking it easy and writing neo-Romantic
symphonies that won him an enviable popularity, which has not
lasted. Piston was a conservative type, comfortably ensconced on
the Harvard faculty and not especially interested in shaking up the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions was essentially opposed to collective action on behalf
of American composers. He believed to his core that music was
either good or bad: something vastly more important, and
discernible, than whether it was French or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, after hearing Boulanger play through Copland's Symphony
for Organ and Orchestra (1924), on the piano, Sessions wrote his
friend a chastising letter. You ``deserve hell,'' Sessions wrote,
for ``allowing yourself, when you can write music of your own like
that, to take any interest whatever in other people's music, and
especially in the music of other young Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you see,'' he continued, ``that any two pages of your
symphony are worth all the collected works of the `jeunes
americains' that you so generously allow yourself to be interested
in, and who have got to stand or fall on their own strength?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, though primarily based in Paris from 1925 to 1940,
shared Copland's belief in the importance of organization.
Collectivism was in the air, and both Copland and Thomson felt that
composers had more to gain by cooperating than by competing. The
real competition, as Thomson later described it in his
autobiography, was the ``German-Austrian musical complex,'' which
he likened to an ``international cartel operating through the
familiar techniques of price-fixing, dumping and pressures on the
performing agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they believed, was to form American composer-run
organizations, professional guilds to assure fair payment of
royalties, promote performances and subsidize publication. They
encouraged their colleagues to follow their example and get
involved in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Composing music for theater, film, high school bands and the
like was admirable professional work. Copland was immensely pleased
when, after four prior nominations, he won an Oscar in 1949 for his
music for ``The Heiress.''
</P>
<P>
   This score and others will be discussed by two composers who
know the business from the inside out, Andre Previn and David
Raksin, in the final event of the festival, ``Copland and Film
Music,'' a program at the Museum of Modern Art on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   That the festival will end in a museum is fitting. Copland's
work has been felt well beyond the confines of the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the filmmaker Spike Lee, who used Copland's music in
the soundtrack for ``He Got Game,'' which tells the story of the
bitter relationship between a young inner-city basketball star,
played by Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks, and his father, a
convict, played by Denzel Washington. Why Copland?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I listen to his music, I hear America, and basketball is
American,'' Lee writes in liner notes to ``Spike Lee Presents: The
Music of Aaron Copland,'' a Sony Classical recording.
</P>
<P>
   So Aaron Copland is now as American as basketball. He could not
have asked for better validation of his ``vague and dubious'' goal
of fostering a recognizable American musical voice. It was not
futile after all.

CLINTON FRIEND IS ACCUSED IN TEAMSTER MONEY SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former Democratic official has testified that
Terence McAuliffe, President Clinton's friend and chief
fund-raiser, played a major role in promoting an illegal scheme in
which Democratic donors were to contribute to the Teamster
president's re-election campaign and in exchange the Teamsters were
to donate large sums to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Richard Sullivan, the Democratic National
Committee's former finance director, testified in Manhattan at the
trial of William Hamilton, the Teamsters' former political
director, that McAuliffe urged him and other fund-raisers to find a
rich Democrat to donate at least $50,000 to the 1996 re-election
campaign of Ron Carey, the former Teamsters president.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-week-long trial, Sullivan testified that
McAuliffe had said that if a Democratic donor made a large
contribution to the Carey campaign, then the Teamsters would
contribute at least $500,000 to various Democratic Party
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have focused on what they said are two
conspiracies, one involving a swap scheme with Democratic officials
and one in which they say Hamilton steered more than $700,000 in
Teamster money to liberal groups and in exchange, donors to those
groups gave $200,000 to the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has described a desperate attempt by Carey
campaign aides to prop up Carey's faltering campaign by using union
money as a vehicle to get donors from outside the union to donate
heavily to Carey. Two top Carey campaign aides have pleaded guilty,
and Carey's 1996 election victory was overturned because of the
finance fraud. One of those aides, Martin Davis, originally
proposed the scheme to persuade Democratic donors to give to Carey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McAuliffe was the finance chairman of the Clinton-Gore
Re-election Committee. He is a top fund-raiser for Vice President
Al Gore, and he had agreed, until the Clintons obtained another
mortgage, to guarantee the mortgage for the Clintons' new house in
Westchester County with $1.35 million of his assets as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Describing McAuliffe's comments at a meeting on October 1996
with the Democrats' fund-raising staff, Sullivan said, ``He said
that if we could get a $50,000 contribution for the Carey campaign,
he knew we could get $500,000 for Unity from the Teamsters.'' Unity
was a joint fund-raising effort by the Clinton-Gore campaign and
the campaign committees for the House and Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's lawyer, Richard Ben-Veniste, denied that his client
had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is charged with fraud and conspiracy, accused of
illegally diverting $885,000 in union money to help Carey's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gage, Hamilton's lawyer, has repeatedly asserted his
client's innocence at the trial in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. The jury began deliberations Wednesday after Gage argued
in his summation that the prosecution's main witness was not
credible and that Hamilton was the victim of manipulations by the
two Carey aides who pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Veniste said McAuliffe raised the idea of finding a wealthy
donor to give to the Carey campaign at a meeting in October 1996
when he was reviewing fund-raising options for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This review occurred at a time and in the context of his
raising literally thousands of more fund-raising opportunities at
the very end of the campaign,'' Ben-Veniste said. ``It was not
dwelled upon. Terry McAuliffe did not encourage anybody to pursue
this possibility. Nor did he personally attempt to raise any funds
in this manner for Mr. Carey.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that McAuliffe was cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's testimony suggested that McAuliffe repeatedly urged
that a Democratic donor be found to help Carey. Sullivan said he
had five or six conversations with McAuliffe about the Carey
campaign in the spring or summer of 1996. He said that McAuliffe
raised the idea of Democratic donors' giving to Carey two or three
times that October.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Democratic officials located a wealthy Philippine
woman who had wanted to donate to the Clinton campaign, but she
could not because she was a foreigner. Democratic officials
suggested that she instead give $100,000 to the Carey campaign, but
she was not allowed to because, as an employer, she was barred from
donating to union campaigns. Ultimately the Democrats did not
produce a donor for Carey, and the Teamsters never contributed the
$500,000 to the Democrats.

KRAFT MUSIC HALL APPETIZER CLAM DIP
</P>
<P>
   When the recipe for clam dip first appeared on the Kraft Music
Hall television show in the early '50s, New York City sold out of
canned clams within 24 hours. The mania for clam dip continued
through the '60s (by then, premade clam dip could be found in the
refrigerator section of the supermarket).

1 (4 1/2-ounce) can deviled ham &QL;

PORCUPINE MEAT BALLS
</P>
<P>
   The sort of easy, novelty recipe that appealed to cooks in the
'30s appears to have been developed during World War I as a way to
stretch meat. In ``Conservation Recipes'' (1918), compiled by the
Mobilized Women's Organizations of Berkeley and published by the
Berkeley Unit, Council of Defense Women's Committee, there is
something called Rice Meat Balls, a clear forerunner of the recipe
here, which is adapted from ``My Better Homes and Gardens Cook
Book'' (1939). The 1918 version plumps up a pound of round steak
with 1 cup crumbs and 3/4 cup rice. The Better Homes recipe
specifies beef neck, shank or plate ground to order _ not readily
available today. Ground chuck has been substituted. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck &QL; 
1/2 cup uncooked converted rice &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon black pepper &QL; 
1 tablespoon minced yellow onion &QL; 
1 (10 1/2-ounce) can condensed tomato soup &QL; 
1 soup can water
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix beef, rice, salt, pepper and onion well and
shape into 1-inch balls.
</P>
<P>
   Mix tomato soup and water in a medium heavy skillet and bring to
simmering over moderate heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add meatballs, adjust heat so mixture bubbles very gently, cover
and simmer 1 hour. Serve accompanied by a crisp green salad. Makes
6 servings.

CALIFORNIA DIP
</P>
<P>
   This may not be ``the mother of all dips,'' but it is surely
America's most beloved. The Lipton Company, whose dry onion soup
mix is the basis of California Dip, doesn't claim to have invented
it. That distinction belongs to an anonymous California cook, who
blended sour cream with the soup mix back in 1954 _ two years after
it hit the market. Beginning in 1958, Lipton included the recipe on
every box of Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion Soup Mix. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 envelope dry onion soup mix &QL; 
2 cups dairy sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Mix ingredients and serve with potato chips, crackers or
bite-size chunks of raw vegetables _ celery, carrots, broccoli or
cauliflower. Makes about 2 cups.

FROZEN FRUIT SALAD
</P>
<P>
   This salad is from ``The Charlotte Cookbook'' published in 1971
by the Junior League of Charlotte, North Carolina. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (3-ounce) package cream cheese &QL; 
1 tablespoon plus 1 cup whipping cream &QL; 
1/3 cup mayonnaise &QL; 
1 tablespoon lemon juice &QL; 
Dash salt &QL; 
1 cup canned pineapple, drained &QL; 
1 cup orange sections, drained &QL; 
1 cup Royal Ann cherries, drained OR green seedless grapes &QL; 
1/2 cup maraschino cherries, drained &QL; 
3 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
1 cup miniature marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Blend softened cream cheese, 1 tablespoon cream and mayonnaise.
Add lemon juice and salt. Add fruit, which has been cut in small
pieces. (Any fruit may be substituted.)
</P>
<P>
   Whip remaining 1 cup whipping cream, folding in sugar. Fold
whipped cream, marshmallows and fruit mixture together. Pour into
refrigerator trays or a square pan and freeze until firm. Makes 8
servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TACO SALAD
</P>
<P>
   This salad arrived with the Tex-Mex fast-food franchise, which
began to pepper the country in the '60s. This recipe for Taco Salad
is adapted from the May 1968 issue of Sunset. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 pound lean ground beef &QL; 
1/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion &QL; 
2 teaspoons chili powder &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce &QL; 
1 medium head iceberg lettuce, shredded &QL; 
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese &QL; 
2 medium tomatoes, peeled, cored and cut into wedges &QL; 
1 medium avocado, pitted, peeled and sliced (optional) &QL; 
1 1/2 to 2 cups corn chips OR tortilla chips
</P>
<P>
   Crumble beef into a a large nonstick skillet. Add onion and
stir-fry over moderate heat until beef is no longer pink, 6 to 8
minutes. Mix in chili powder, salt and tomato sauce. Bring to a
simmer and keep hot.
</P>
<P>
   Divide lettuce among 4 dinner plates. Top with hot beef mixture
and sprinkle with cheese. Divide tomato wedges, avocado slices and
corn chips among 4 plates, arranging as artfully as possible. Serve
at once. Makes 4 servings. &QL;

Edition'' (1994). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 can (10 1/2 ounces) condensed tomato OR cream of mushroom soup,
undiluted &QL; 
2 pounds ground beef &QL; 
1 pouch dry onion soup and recipe mix &QL; 
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs &QL; 
1 egg, well beaten &QL;

SLOW-COOKER CASSOULET
</P>
<P>
   This particular recipe shows just how far knowledge of this
French country classic had spread by 1975. That was the year Mabel
Hoffman's ``Crockery Cookery'' appeared, the book that taught mass
America how to throw a meal in an electric pot and let it cook
slowly unattended. This recipe is adapted from that award-winning,
five-million-copy best-seller. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (3- to 3 1/2-pound) chicken, cut up &QL; 
1 leek, trimmed, rinsed and thinly sliced &QL; 
1 clove garlic, minced &QL; 
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon pepper &QL; 
2 (15-ounce) cans white kidney beans, drained &QL; 
1/2 pound smoked sausage links, sliced 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Place chicken in a slow cooker and sprinkle evenly with leek,
garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. Spoon beans and sausage on top,
distributing evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Pour in wine, cover and cook on low heat setting until chicken
is tender and meatiest pieces show no signs of pink in center, 5 to
6 hours.
</P>

   RIVER ROAD BAKED SWEET POTATOES WITH MARSHMALLOWS
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe is from ``River Road Recipes'' (1959) by
The Junior League of Baton Rouge, Inc. It is more typical of the
sweet potato casseroles popular in the '50s and '60s. Often crushed
pineapple substitutes for milk and sometimes the potatoes are
spiked with sherry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
8 medium-size sweet potatoes &QL; 
1 cup milk &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
3 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
1/2 stick butter &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
Few dashes nutmeg &QL; 
1 tablespoon orange juice &QL; 
Marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Bake sweet potatoes in preheated 350-degree oven until done.
Peel hot potatoes and put through a ricer until mashed. Scald milk
and add vanilla, sugar and butter.
</P>
<P>
   To potatoes add cinnamon, nutmeg and orange juice. Stir. Add
milk mixture to potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Layer 1/2 of the potato mixture in a buttered casserole; add a
layer of marshmallows and remaining potatoes. Bake at 350 degrees F
until very hot. Add a top layer of marshmallows and brown. Makes 8
to 10 servings.

HOLIDAY POKE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   The original Poke Cake, a beloved classic in the heartland,
seems to have appeared in the early '80s, and this red, white and
green Christmas version in the mid-'90s. This version is from the
1994 Jell-O/Pillsbury ad. &QL; 
1 (1 pound 2.5 ounce) package white cake mix &QL; 
2 cups boiling water &QL; 
1 package (4-serving size) any flavor red gelatin &QL; 
1 package (4-serving size) lime flavor gelatin &QL; 
1 can (16 ounces) creamy vanilla frosting
</P>
<P>
   Prepare, bake and cool cake mix as directed on packages for 2
(9-inch) cake layers. Place cake layers, top sides up, in 2 clean
9-inch round cake pans. Pierce cake with a large fork at 1/2-inch
intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Stir 1 cup boiling water into EACH flavor of gelatin, in
separate bowls, 2 minutes or until dissolved. Carefully pour red
gelatin over one cake and lime gelatin over second cake.
Refrigerate 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Dip one cake pan in warm water, 10 seconds; unmold into a
serving plate. Spread with about 1/4 cup frosting. Unmold second
cake layer; carefully place on first layer. Frost top and sides of
cake with remaining frosting. Refrigerate 1 hour or until ready to
serve.

CHEESE STRATA
</P>
<P>
   This recipe _ buttered slices of bread layered into a casserole
with shredded Cheddar and topped with beaten eggs and milk _ begins
appearing under various aliases shortly after the turn of the
century. Sara Rorer (``Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book,'' 1902), calls
it Cheese Pudding. And ``Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book''
(1903), titles it Escalloped Cheese. A few books even call it
Cheese Fondue. Being meatless, filling and frugal, Cheese Strata
was popular during World War I and the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
6 slices firm-textured white bread &QL; 
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter OR margarine, at room temperature
(optional) &QL; 
3 cups coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese &QL; 
3 eggs &QL; 
2 1/2 cups milk &QL; 
1 teaspoon prepared mustard &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon ground hot red pepper (cayenne)
</P>
<P>
   Spread each slice of bread with butter on 1 side, then quarter
slices. Layer bread and cheese alternately in an ungreased 2- to 2
1/2-quart casserole, beginning with bread and ending with cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together eggs, milk, mustard, salt and cayenne; pour
evenly over bread mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven, uncovered, 40 to 45 minutes,
until set like custard. Makes 6 servings.

SPAGHETTI SAUCE WITH MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning (around the turn of the century),
Italian-American restaurants did not serve meatballs with their
spaghetti. These were added to satisfy America's hunger for red
meat. Of course, there are dozens of variations on the theme. But,
the best, to my mind, is this make-ahead spaghetti sauce with
meatballs, cooked up by Sharon Bates, a recipe I featured in a 1992
Family Circle article. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEATBALLS: &QL; 
1 1/4 pounds lean ground beef &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/4 cup Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon black pepper &QL; 
SAUCE: &QL; 
3/4 pound hot Italian sausage, thickly sliced &QL; 
5 (14 1/2-ounce) cans stewed tomatoes, with their juice &QL; 
1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree &QL; 
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste &QL; 
1/2 pound mushrooms, wiped clean and chopped &QL; 
2 large ribs celery, chopped &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper &QL; 
1 clove garlic, minced &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian herb seasoning &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For Meatballs, coat a 15 1/2x10 1/2x1-inch jelly-roll pan with
nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix all meatball ingredients thoroughly. Shape into
1-inch balls; arrange on pan. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 12
to 15 minutes until uniformly browned.
</P>
<P>
   For Sauce, brown sausages in a large heavy kettle, over
moderately high heat until most of drippings cook out, 8 to 10
minutes. Pour off drippings. Reduce heat to moderate, add meatballs
and all sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Adjust heat so
mixture bubbles generously, cover and simmer very slowly for 3
hours, stirring, as needed, to prevent sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Cool mixture, ladle into food freezer containers, date, label
and store in 0 degrees F freezer. Makes 1 gallon.

TIME WARNER SAYS IT IS ENDING `SOFT MONEY' GIFTS TO PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Time Warner announced on Wednesday that it would no
longer make unregulated donations to political parties, saying such
``soft money'' contributions distort the electoral process and
sully the givers.
</P>
<P>
   The company joins a handful of other corporations in swearing
off contributions to the parties, but advocates of campaign finance
reform said it was too early to declare the unilateral actions a
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which owns Cable News Network, Warner Bros. and
Time magazine, among other properties, has given roughly $1 million
to the Republican and Democratic parties in each of the last two
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald M. Levin, the chairman at Time Warner, said much of the
soft money has been used for misleading and negative advertising
that cheapens the nation's political dialogue. Levin said the
company would use the money instead to beef up coverage of politics
and to sponsor electronic town meetings to educate the voters
better.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to employees, Levin and Richard D. Parsons, the
company's president, said the company would halt its corporate
giving to the parties but would continue to operate a political
action committee using voluntary contributions from employees to
make donations to individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The memo referred to the company's ``special responsibility'' to
provide full and fair coverage of politics, an acknowledgment that
many in the newsgathering side of the company were uncomfortable
with the parent corporation's political largess.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is analogous at other major television companies
that are owned by conglomerates with broad interests and big
political budgets. General Electric, which owns NBC and the Walt
Disney Co., which owns ABC, are substantial contributors to parties
and candidates. Viacom, the parent of CBS, gives virtually no money
to the parties but its political action committee contributes
sizable sums to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of campaign reform applauded the Time Warner
announcement, but other corporations, unions and wealthy
individuals showed no sign of following the company's lead. Time
Warner has not been among the biggest corporate soft-money givers _
it ranked 46th in 1997-98 with $471,000 and 48th in the current
cycle, at $155,000 so far this year. In 1997-98, Disney ranked 8th
overall among corporate soft-money donors, General Electric ranked
29th and Viacom 434th, according to FEC Info, an independent group
that tracks campaign expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they've done is courageous and we hope it will be
a good model for other companies around the country to follow,''
said Charles Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic
Development, a group of business executives who favor the
elimination of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb said that General Motors, Monsanto Co. and Allied Signal
announced a year ago that they would no longer make soft-money
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the current system identify soft money as one of
its chief evils. Corporations, unions and wealthy citizens gave
$190 million to the two major parties in soft money in the 1998
campaign and have donated $60 million already this year, according
to FEC Info.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the soft money is used to pay for so-called issue
advertisements that purportedly do not advocate the election of an
individual candidate. Critics say the ads are merely a means of
circumventing spending limits imposed on candidates but not on the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   A Time Warner official said the announcement followed a yearlong
review of the company's political activities and did not come in
response to a particular event.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just a profound trend that we grew uncomfortable
with,'' the official said. But he added that the company would not
seek refunds of the $80,000 it has already given the Democrats and
the $75,000 it has donated to Republicans this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a campaign finance research group, said the Time Warner
announcement could embolden other companies.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be a sign of what Makinson called donor fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have been hit up and hit up and hit up and the
election is still a year away,'' he said.

 &HT;    Official reopens inquest into Davidian's death
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Justice of the Peace David Pareya said Wednesday
that he will reopen the inquest into the death of Michael
Schroeder, killed by agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms on the day of the 1993 raid on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Pareya said a recent review of the file showed the case to be
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the cause of death,'' Pareya said. ``The purpose of
this proceeding will be to close out the case and make a
determination on the manner of the death.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder _ who was married to Kathryn Schroeder, a Branch
Davidian who became a key government witness in the 1994 criminal
trial of 11 Davidians _ was not at Mount Carmel on the morning of
Feb. 28, 1993, when ATF agents tried to arrest the late David
Koresh. Four ATF agents and five Davidians died in the resulting
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, ATF agents shot and killed Schroeder when he, Bob
Kendrick and Norman Allison tried to sneak into Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick escaped and Allison was arrested at the scene. An
autopsy showed that Schroeder was shot numerous times in the head,
shoulder and thigh. ATF agents reported that Schroeder fired first
at them. He reportedly was carrying a loaded Glock 9 mm
semiautomatic pistol and two ammunition magazines. Four days passed
before Schroeder's body was recovered because FBI officials, then
in charge of the scene, claimed the body could not be removed
safely because it was in the line of sight of Davidian sentries
manning the tower at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Pareya viewed Schroeder's body before it was removed. ATF agents
in a barn behind Mount Carmel showed Pareya several bullet holes
that they said were caused by Schroeder firing at them. They
reported shooting Schroeder while he was in a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them if that was the case, I needed to know who shot
him,'' Pareya said. ``I asked several times for that information.
Like a lot of other things I asked for during that time, I never
got an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pareya said he's hoping the information will be in a Texas
Rangers' report on the shooting that he finally received last week.
He has not yet reviewed the report, Pareya said.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Pareya was only given the Rangers' preliminary
report on Schroeder's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional information was to follow,'' Pareya said.
``Unfortunately, it was never submitted to me for the final
disposition of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   A resurgence of interest in the Branch Davidian case _ driven by
a wrongful death lawsuit set for May _ led to numerous requests for
information on file in his office, Pareya said. In reviewing the
voluminous file, he noted that Schroeder's case was not closed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was awaiting information from various agencies that had
investigated the death,'' Pareya said. ``Frankly, that information
is more easily obtained now. To a certain extent, I've been able to
take advantage of the timing. People are giving out information
that wasn't made public before.''
</P>
<P>
   Pareya has not set a date for the inquest or determined what
form it will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do a private inquest, which is what we normally do,''
Pareya said. ``If witnesses need to be called, I will have to go
into another phase. There would need to be a court reporter at that
point, and we would go into a more formal mode. Until I delve into
this more, see what (evidence) I have on hand, I don't know what
procedure I will set up.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's mother, Sandra Connizzo, has tried for years to
learn the circumstances surrounding her son's death.
</P>
<P>
   She's suspicious of the government's official explanation of
Schroeder's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they finally did pick up the body, the Rangers marked
things,'' Connizzo said. ``The FBI was telling them, 'Koresh is
threatening us. Hurry up. Let's get going.' I find that kind of
hard to believe. I'd like to hear the tape with that threat on it.
Then the FBI wouldn't let the Rangers on the site for another 10
days, until the rain had washed everything away. I'm sorry, but I
find that incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's report on Mount Carmel states that the
FBI's Jeffrey Jamar initially let the Rangers recover Schroeder's
body and perform a limited crime scene analysis. But when the
Rangers later asked permission to complete the crime scene search
by casting footprints and gathering other evidence, the report
concluded that ``Jamar refused to allow the request, and did not
allow them back onto the crime scene for ten days. By then, rain
had severely eroded the footprints they hoped to process.''
</P>
<P>
   Connizzo also wonders what happened to the felt cap worn by
Schroeder when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the body arrived at the coroner's office, his hat was
missing,'' Connizzo said. ``Mike McNulty told me that he saw
Michael's hat and a stun gun in a bag labeled M. Schroeder.''
</P>
<P>
   McNulty, who helped produce the Oscar-nominated film, ``Waco:
Rules of Engagement,'' toured the Davidian evidence locker in
Austin last spring before U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr.
of Waco took custody of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hat worn by Schroeder was not tested, the autopsy
on Schroeder done by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office
showed no signs of soot deposition, powder tattooing or a muzzle
imprint _ any of which would indicate a shooting at close range.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is not the only Davidian whose cause of death is not
listed.
</P>
<P>
   However, authorities often did not have enough body parts in the
other cases to determine how the individual died. Pareya and three
other local justices were given the formidable job of sorting
through bodies mutilated by fire and the collapse of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to determine a cause of death, local JPs
struggled to identify the mingled remains of the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us two years, through DNA testing and numerous
requests for information, to close out the majority of cases,''
Pareya said. ``It was a very difficult process to go through. I
would often be here at my office late at night calling foreign
countries trying to contact family members about pauper funerals. A
lot was going on. It was mind-boggling to a certain extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Pareya said his decision to officially close out the Schroeder
inquest isn't related to the renewed questioning of the
government's explanation of the events at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unfinished business that needs to be taken care of,''
Pareya said. ``I have to do it. It's what I was elected to do. It's
my duty. What is going on now will not play a role in this.''

<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The house is unremarkable, a modest gray
Craftsman bungalow on a shady side street a few blocks from the
University of California.
</P>
<P>
   You know, though, that a serious cook lives there the minute you
walk into the spacious, modern kitchen. Not that the room gleams
with marble and stainless steel like a designer's fantasy, or that
it's packed with gimmicks and gadgets, or that everything matches.
Utility is the hallmark here. A bright yellow La Cornue range
stands along one wall, and a big rectangular copper sink catches
the eye, but at heart, this is a kitchen made for cooking, not
looking.
</P>
<P>
   One Tuesday morning in early November, it was dressed for
autumn. Branches of red and orange and mottled yellow leaves filled
a handsome purple glass vase, along with blowsy Cafe au Lait
dahlias and yellow English Garden roses.
</P>
<P>
   The mistress of the house had laid out big bowls of pomegranates
and persimmons, walnuts and chestnuts, Ida Rose apples and Adriatic
figs and crab apples. Quinces, too, that someone had filched from
an old tree on a vacant lot nearby. A stalk of brussels sprouts lay
on the table, and a cabbage, a Platonic ideal of a cabbage, its
outer leaves unfurled into a sort of halo, sat on a metal stand.
</P>
<P>
   Food as still life, fit for a 17th-century Dutch master.
</P>
<P>
   An oak fire, lighted at 7 o'clock, had produced a fine bed of
coals beneath the plump hen turkey that was revolving on a stout
spit. Alice Waters (for it was she, in a long striped apron and
black chef's clogs) was rehearsing for Thanksgiving 1999, reaching
into the kitchen fireplace with a long branch of rosemary to baste
the browning bird with warm olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Why a rosemary branch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Ms. Waters replied. ``It's pretty, and it works
well, and it adds a bit of flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time I turned up to watch, along with my wife, Betsey,
two of Ms. Waters' longtime colleagues at Chez Panisse, the
influential Berkeley restaurant she has run since 1971, had joined
her. They were trimming vegetables with the short, sure strokes of
the professional that make amateurs like me so jealous. Both of
them _ Jean-Pierre Moulle, a bearded, soft-spoken native of the
Charente region in southwestern France, and Fritz Streiff, a
Harvard man who wears Philip Johnson glasses _ have helped her to
establish the restaurant's worldwide reputation for extraordinarily
fresh, organically grown raw materials, cooked simply and superbly
in a hybrid Italo-Franco-Californian style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first real day of fall,'' Moulle said. In the
backyard garden, pomelos and Meyer lemons still hung from the
trees, and exactly four raspberries fought against time on a bush
near the guest cottage, but there was a nip in the air that the
bright sunshine could not quite dispel.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked, the three cooks chatted about the provenance of
the ingredients that would go into Ms. Waters' Thanksgiving feast.
The unusually fine-leaved escarole and the fabulously peppery
watercress for the salad had been grown by Bob Cannard in the
Valley of the Moon in Sonoma County, northwest of Berkeley. The
sourdough bread had come, of course, from the Acme Bakery just a
few blocks away, one of the cluster of establishments that have
flourished here since the food revolution began 30-odd years ago.
The vegetables had come from various farmers' markets, and the
cranberries for the upside-down cake baked by the restaurant's
pastry chef, Charlene Reis, from the Ladybug Cooperative in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have, would have, should have made the cake, if I'd
had the time,'' volunteered Ms. Waters, an intense, pale-skinned
woman who was once a Montessori teacher. ``It's easy enough for
even me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The cranberries really slayed me. You have to be a bit of a
maniac to conceive of organic cranberries, let alone find them, and
Ms. Waters pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you go to extremes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has gone so far as to hire a forager, Alan Tangren, who
searches not only for wild nettles and the like in back yards, but
also for unlikely suppliers like the Ladybug Co-Op.
</P>
<P>
   What about the turkey? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Blank looks. Eager to give credit to all her suppliers, as she
always does on Chez Panisse's menus, Ms. Waters made an urgent
telephone call to the restaurant. It turned out that Ms. Turkey, a
13-pounder, had been raised on the Diestel Ranch, a small farm on
the outskirts of Sonora, a town not far from Yosemite National
Park. The bird had grown up, Ms. Waters emphasized, not in a cage,
but free to roam, eating grass and other vegetation innocent of
pesticides, herbicides and artificial fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Using a method she developed several years ago, Ms. Waters
soaked the turkey for 72 hours in a well-seasoned brine before
cooking it. Doing so, she said, helps keep the bird moist, and when
we tucked into it later, it was a juicy revelation. Even the
thinnest slices of white meat held together without crumbling,
which is more than you can say for most of the turkeys I have
cooked (or eaten) in the last few centuries. The marination also
added subtle overtones of herby, spicy flavor to a bird that, let's
face it, can taste bland as blancmange.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey was stuffed with a mixture of bread, herbs and wild
mushrooms, chiefly golden chanterelles. Chanterelle stems, a few
chestnuts, poultry stock and the turkey giblets went into a silky
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works perfectly in an oven,'' Ms. Waters said, ``but I'd
rather cook over a fire when I can. I have a fascination with fires
_ the flavors, the aromas, the primal quality of the process. I'm a
rotisseuse at heart. Some people can make sauces. They're
comfortable at the stove, but this is me, here, in front of the
flames, roasting.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moulle, a keen hunter, suggested that the brining method would
be especially well suited to wild turkey, which is even more prone
to desiccation during conventional cooking than domesticated birds.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Moulle and his wife, Denise, and a dozen or so
others assemble for Thanksgiving with Ms. Waters at the house of
Jay and Pam Heminway, her longtime friends, which is set amidst
mountain vineyards in the Chiles Valley, northwest of the Napa. But
the Moulles will miss this year's celebration. It will take place a
continent away, at the Heminways' house in Watch Hill, R.I., so
that Ms. Waters can be with her daughter, Fanny, 16, who is
attending the Mountain School at Vershire, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the change of venue, Ms. Waters said, would
be East Coast oysters, which she prefers to those of the West
Coast. Some other ingredients, she said, she would take with her
from Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving has always been a big deal for Ms. Waters, and it
has always involved a big crowd. Growing up in Chatham, N.J., she
recalled, ``that was the one time of the year when my parents had a
big party'' _ the one time they put all the leaves in the table and
asked 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the year, my mother never made real desserts, like
pumpkin pie,'' she said. ``The rest of the year it was fruit
cups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Always friends' wines on holidays,'' Ms. Waters said as we
started our early Thanksgiving meal with a cool glass of Chateau La
Louviere 1990, a white Bordeaux made by Mrs. Moulle's father, Andre
Lurton. Later on, with the turkey, we _ the cooks, Mrs. Moulle and
the two of us _ drank a bottle of the Heminways' lean Red and Green
Vineyards zinfandel 1998, rather reminiscent of Tuscany, and
Lurton's Chateau Dauzac 1985, a fifth-growth Margaux. A bottle of
Dauzac 1978 materialized with the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody went to the table for the first course. In the European
manner, it was the most luxurious part of the meal. We stood around
or sat on kitchen stools to nibble on four kinds of oysters,
freshly opened and set atop a mound of shaved ice and seaweed _
Wellfleets from Cape Cod and Kumamotos, Hog Islands and
thumbnail-size Olympias from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   With those came pork sausages, purposely made with little
seasoning other than a bit of white wine, so their blandness would
contrast with the coppery, briny taste of the oysters. The
combination is traditional not only in France but also in
Tidewater, Va., as my wife reminded me.
</P>
<P>
   Then came slices of a terrine of foie gras, made by Moulle from
Sonoma County duck livers and served on slices of sourdough toast
hot from a grill in the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   And then came bagna cauda, an Italian dip for raw vegetables
that is also served in Provence. It is made from olive oil, garlic
and anchovies pounded in a mortar, and the anchovies, packed in
salt in Sicily in a big round can, provided the morning's only
crisis, however transitory.
</P>
<P>
   Cans are uncommon denizens of Ms. Waters' kitchen, and Streiff,
one of Ms. Waters' collaborators on the new ``Chez Panisse Cafe
Cookbook'' (HarperCollins, $34), could not for the life of him find
an opener. Neither could Moulle. But Ms. Waters rummaged around on
a shelf and came up with one, an ancient lever-action model, rusty
but serviceable.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable plate that accompanied the bagna cauda won the
prize, everyone agreed, for sheer good looks _ purple radishes,
deep red and light green radicchio, scarlet strips of bell pepper,
brilliant orange carrot curls, and paler celery, turnips and
artichoke hearts. The sauce tasted even better, I thought, sopped
up with a chunk of an Acme Bakery baguette.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours, the turkey was done, its ivory skin now
richly dappled.
</P>
<P>
   While it rested for a few minutes, the three cooks applied the
finishing touches to the vegetables, taking care, as they had all
day, to drop small scraps into a plastic pail for composting and
bigger leftovers into a basket, to be taken to the restaurant for
use in the stockpot.
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing about the whole meal was the absence of sugar
and cream, which are omnipresent in many Thanksgiving dinners. Even
the cranberry cake was tart-sweet, unlike pecan or pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sweet potatoes, Ms. Waters served a puree of potatoes
and parsnips, boiled separately, then mashed together with a little
milk and very little butter. The other vegetable, braised fennel,
was prepared in an equally straightforward, equally satisfying way:
the fennel bulbs, cut into pieces, were stewed in a little water
and olive oil, and the feathery tops, chopped, were stirred in at
the last minute as a flavor-booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like desserts with a little bit of a tart edge,'' she said.
``Richness is not what it's about. Cream overwhelms the taste of
vegetables, so I like to cook them in olive oil, the way the
Italians do, braising and stewing to bring out the vegetables' own
flavor. This isn't a health issue. It's a flavor issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The oval table in front of the kitchen fireplace table was set
in a minute or two with big, utilitarian napkins, sturdy cutlery,
pretty Deruta plates and a pair of well-worn brass candlesticks. A
food stylist might not have approved, but we eager eaters thought
it looked just right.
</P>
<P>
   Streiff popped a new disk of Vivaldi songs by Cecilia Bartoli
onto the stereo, and we went to work on our meal. The soprano's
swooping vocal line prompted talk of opera at Salzburg, the
director Peter Sellers, the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado,
the Adelaide festival in Australia and, somehow, eating in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   By then we had reached the salad, a great pile of airy greens on
each diner's plate, the dressing light but garlicky.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese _ a whole-milk Vacherin from the Jura, whose peak
season happily coincides with Thanksgiving _ came with music from
the Russian soprano Edita Gruberova. Last, the cake _ slim little
pieces, not much room left _ and glasses of tea made from spearmint
from the garden.
</P>
<P>
   None of us could have asked for a more delicious or more
celebratory holiday meal, and I got up from the table, I must
confess, feeling a great deal less laden than I usually do on the
final Thursday in November.

   BRINE-CURED ROAST TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Alice Waters
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4 hours and 15 minutes, plus 72 hours for brining  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   } cup plus 2 tablespoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   } cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   \ cup diced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 leek, white and light green parts only, cleaned and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 star anise
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 12- to 14-pound naturally fed, free-range turkey
</P>
<P>
   Wild Mushroom Stuffing (see recipe) or other stuffing
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil or butter
</P>
<P>
   Fresh rosemary branches, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. In 16-quart or larger stockpot, bring 2 gallons water to a
boil. Add salt and sugar, and stir until completely dissolved. Turn
off heat, and add carrot, onion, celery and leek. Add bay leaves,
peppercorns, coriander, red pepper, fennel seeds, star anise and
thyme. Refrigerate until cold.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove giblets from turkey. Cover and refrigerate liver if
using in stuffing. Discard remaining giblets or reserve for another
use. Add turkey to stockpot. If necessary, weight it with a plate
so that it stays below the brine's surface. Refrigerate for 72
hours, then remove from brine and allow to come to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Loosely fill the turkey at both
ends with stuffing, and truss as you would a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place turkey in a large roasting pan, and roast until it
starts to brown, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350
degrees, and roast for 12 minutes more per pound, until internal
temperature at deepest part of the leg reaches 130 degrees. (Total
roasting time will be about 3 hours.) Baste frequently with olive
oil or butter and pan juices, using rosemary branches as a brush if
desired. If the bird begins to darken too much, cover it loosely
with a piece of foil. Before serving, remove turkey from oven and
leave covered with foil. Allow it to rest for 20 minutes before
carving and spooning the stuffing into a serving dish. Yield: 15
servings.

 &HT;    Gore unfair in Medicare debate, Bradley charges at Morehouse
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Democrat Bill Bradley accused rival Al Gore on
Wednesday of using blacks and Latinos as ``political footballs'' in
his efforts to discredit Bradley's health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the Morehouse School of Medicine, Bradley strongly
defended his $65 billion proposal to provide health insurance to
the poor against Gore's criticisms that the plan would adversely
affect minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a politics that uses people who are poor as
political footballs,'' Bradley said. ``I am disappointed, quite
frankly, that he has chosen to use these scare tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore has charged that Bradley's proposal to
phase out Medicaid and allow recipients to join the insurance
program for federal workers would leave many blacks and Latinos
with no health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to continue the theme this weekend in New Hampshire,
meeting with disabled voters who claim that Bradley's proposal
would rob them of Medicaid coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley struck back Wednesday before a friendly audience of 250
students and faculty at the historically black medical school.
Morehouse's central mission is to train doctors to serve poor
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that Medicaid, a partnership between the federal
government and the states, was failing to reach more than one-third
of those living in poverty. He called the system a ``bewildering''
bureaucracy, layered with 50 different state regulations that
guaranteed the poor a second-class system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this and say, `Can't we do better than this?'''
Bradley said. ``We will have a better system under the system I
have proposed than Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of Medicaid in providing health coverage to the poor is
the essential difference between Bradley and Gore on the issue of
health care.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley would phase out Medicaid, Gore would expand it to
include children whose families earn 250 percent of the federal
poverty threshold. Gore would allow the parents of those children
to buy the Medicaid coverage as well.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bradley's comments, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
said Bradley's plan amounted to an $1,800 annual voucher that
``won't buy much in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing is (former) Senator Bradley's health care
plan,'' Lehane said. ``It will literally leave you out in the
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley noted that President Clinton's plan for universal health
care coverage in 1994 also would have phased out Medicaid. He noted
that Gore was supportive of the concept then, ``but now he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '94 health care debate, (former) Senator Bradley was
missing in action,'' Lehane said. ``He only seems to have come
across this issue when he started running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also blamed the 1996 welfare reform bill, which Gore
supported and Bradley voted against, for allowing the poor to lose
Medicaid coverage when they moved off the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nigel Harris, dean of the medical school, applauded
Bradley's emphasis on the problems of the nation's 44 million
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicaid is not achieving what it had set out to achieve,''
Harris said. ``But at the same time, what we have now is better
than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bradley's message Wednesday was meant to reinforce his
credentials among black voters. Roger Wilkins, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning black journalist and history professor at George
Mason University, flew to Atlanta to introduce him to the Morehouse
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defies credulity that Bill Bradley would do anything to
hurt blacks and Latinos,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's visit to Atlanta was only his second as a presidential
candidate. After speaking at Morehouse, he met privately with more
than two dozen local elected officials, then attended a fund-raiser
in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser _ at the home of Anne Cox Chambers, chairman of
the company that owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution _ raised
$200,000 for the campaign, according to spokeswoman Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he spoke to delegates attending the general assembly of
the United Jewish Communities.

   AIRCRASH-RDP (Washington) _ The Egyptian government escalates
their condemnation of U.S. officials investigating the EgyptAir
crash, saying that by focusing suspicion on one of the pilots they
were rushing to judgment about the cause. Egypt's principal
spokesman says that a statement attributed to a relief pilot in the
cockpit is being misinterpreted and does not show he was about to
commit suicide by sending the plane into the Atlantic. By Neil A.

   GORE-JOURNALISM (Nashville, Tenn.) _ In September 1971, the
latest $95-a-week greenhorn, a shaggy-haired 23-year-old named
Albert A. Gore Jr., joined the Nashville Tennessean. The grizzled,
bourbon-swilling veterans presumed that the son and namesake of
Tennessee's recently deposed U.S. senator was looking to pad his
resume. But to their surprise, Gore stayed for nearly five years
and became a skilled investigative reporter. Many were caught off
guard when he abandoned the trade to run for Congress in 1976. By

   TECH-WORKERS-SHORTAGE (San Francisco) _ Thanks to the booming
technology-based economy, companies' long-standing scramble for

But IRS managers and union leaders, and even some in the inspector
general's office, say intensified scrutiny will distract many IRS

MILLENNIUM-RECIPES)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, have we come a long way where food's concerned in the last
100 years _ and it's been a delicious and fun-filled journey. At
the outset of the 20th century, getting meals on the table was hard
work. There were no refrigerators, toasters, or gas or electric
ranges. Gadgets and appliances like stand mixers, blenders and food
processors were nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Buying groceries was a time-consuming effort, offering consumers
little choice. Canned, frozen and convenience foods gradually began
to appear. New types of eateries _ including the cafeteria, soda
fountain and fast-food establishments _ offered quicker, more
accessible and less expensive options for eating out.
</P>
<P>
   Self-service grocery stores and giant supermarkets were born.
And the culinary scene exploded with new foods, restaurants and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that Americans greeted each new advance _ from
the introduction of packaged cake and pudding mixes to microwave
ovens and bread machines _ with great enthusiasm?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a listing of some of the products, gadgets and (we've
come to believe) necessities that have helped make our lives in the
kitchen easier over the past century. Some may take you down memory
lane.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the 20th century began, cooking was hard work. There were few
things to make a housewife's life easier, and virtually everything
had to be made from scratch. Even families with modest incomes had
paid ``help'' in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Many housewives counted themselves lucky if they had running
water (yes, a pump counted) inside the house. If not, water had to
be drawn from a well. Wood had to be carried, and a fire had to be
made in the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The cow had to be milked. Coffee was ``boiled up'' in a pot on
the stove, often with a eggshell thrown in for clarity. Biscuits
had to be baked, meat and eggs fried, gravy made, jars of homemade
jam brought from the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   All this and it was only 6 a.m. And there were two more meals to
prepare that same day.
</P>
<P>
   Women's work in the early 1900s was generally in the home, and
much of it was spent growing and preparing food _ and, of course,
cleaning up afterward. Housewives were ready for new advances that
made their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, times were prosperous despite _ or perhaps in part
because of _ Prohibition, which drove even the law-abiding to drink
as sweet cocktails masked the taste of bathtub gin. Chinese
restaurants provided a bit of exotica. For ladies, tearooms became
popular, as did gelatin salads, the fruit-filled Lady Baltimore
cake, devil's food cake and pineapple upside-down cake. At the end
of the decade, with the stock market crash, financial havoc was
created on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rough financial times in the '30s, Americans loved to
socialize and found affordable ways to do it. Sunday night suppers,
tea parties and one-dish meals made entertaining inexpensive.
Gadgets such as the new electric toaster, waffle iron, percolator
and electric mixer made it fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were new things to cook, too: It was in this era that
zucchini and broccoli first became widely available in the United
States. Ruth Wakefield changed American snacking forever when she
chopped up chocolate and mixed it into cookie batter, creating the
first chocolate-chip cookies, which she named Toll House Cookies
after the New England inn she and her husband ran.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking methods became standardized, and assorted cookbooks
began to appear. With the opening of Route 66 between Chicago and
Los Angeles, highway eateries thrived. So did food companies, which
introduced a wealth of new products.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s _ with the best of American food sent overseas to
soldiers and sailors doing the fighting _ those left at home had to
make do with what was left. Meat, coffee, sugar, butter, cheese and
canned goods were rationed _ if they were available at all. So
housewives _ who might have spent their days working in a defense
plant _ planted victory gardens to provide for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Basic American home cooking was the food of the day. Only the
very rich still had servants. Patriotic housewives saved bacon fat
to use in cakes and made their own jams, jellies and pickles. With
commodities scarce, entertaining was often coffee and dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Housewives also benefited from some foods produced for GIs _
dehydrated soups, dried potatoes, canned biscuits, pudding mixes,
margarine and vegetable oils. After the war, GIs brought home a new
taste for exotic food, especially pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed in the food realm. Frozen and pre-made foods
became available _ and supermarkets made shopping easier. A
prosperous future with an abundance of food _ including gourmet and
convenience foods, plus new and more exotic restaurants _ was on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, with World War II and the Korean War over, GI Joe
was home, his wife was back in the kitchen, and that kitchen was
often in the suburbs, where new houses were being built with
fabulous kitchens, patios and barbecues. Beef _ long before any of
us knew about cholesterol _ went on those barbecues. Add a baked
potato, a salad and garlic bread, and you had a meal as American as
apple pie. That's not to say suburbia wasn't a breeding ground for
gourmet cooks, though: Beef Stroganoff and baked Alaska were tops
on any gourmet's list of dishes to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Swanson was marketing TV dinners, complete
frozen meals the family could eat while watching television. Other
convenience and frozen foods also came into their own. Fast-food
chains got their start and boomed.
</P>
<P>
   The psychedelic '60s were a mishmash of food trends, from fast
food to spa food, from blender gazpacho to fondue, from soul food
to luaus. To really put on the dog, cooks dished up veal Orloff,
beef Wellington, rumaki and more. With the affluence, prosperity
and jet travel of the era, foreign foods became more familiar and
accessible. Ethnic restaurants appeared in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s, known by many as the ``me'' decade, was a time of
singles bars, mood rings, pet rocks, Earth shoes and disco, a time
when even the food had strange names, like Screaming Yellow
Zonkers, Fluffernutters and Harvey Wallbangers. Eventually, though,
dinner parties, cooking classes, nouvelle cuisine, regional
cuisine, the food processor and such trendy foods as goat cheese,
farm-fresh greens, chocolate truffles and specialty produce became
all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Crock-Pots (electric slow cookers) had moved into the kitchen,
along with bundt pans and granola. And cooks were turning out
zucchini and carrot cakes slathered with cream cheese frosting
along with crepes and quiche. Restaurant favorites were fettuccini
Alfredo, main dish salads, salad bars, ranch dressing and Kahlua.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had had enough of spa food and itty-bitty portions in
the '80s. They wanted comfort food like Mom used to make. Meatloaf
was king again, along with fried chicken, mashed potatoes (although
cooks added garlic) and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   America's power elite and baby boomers had become foodies,
wheeling and dealing over power lunches at high-priced restaurants
and becoming awed by star chefs who became celebrities at a time
when status and style were all-important.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing _ eating a bit of this and a bit of that throughout the
day _ was the ``in'' thing, and so were Cajun and Southwest
cuisine. Salsa replaced ketchup as the favorite condiment. Cooks
could find kiwi, mangoes, mesclun, free-range chickens, goat cheese
and creme fraiche in markets. Pesto was a new favorite, along with
risotto, croissants and muffins. Cholesterol-lowering oat bran made
up for all that comfort. In the home kitchen, heat-and-eat
convenience foods _ with no cooking required _ were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a backlash to all that comfort food, in the '90s
Americans became obsessed with fat _ how much in food items and
dishes and how to reduce intake _ along with nutrition, health and
fitness. Supermarkets began devoting more shelf space to nonfat and
low-fat cookies, sour cream, cream cheese, ice cream and products
containing a new low-fat fat named Olestra as manufacturers rushed
to get in on the fat-free, reduced-fat product craze. Some were
good and found a permanent place on the shelves; others were so
poor and disappointing that they disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obesity rates soared. Other consumers were into luxury
and quality (super-premium ice creams, fine wines and cheeses, for
instance). Biscotti in an array of flavors became popular. And
bread machines, turning out custom loaves with little effort,
became the rage for home cooks. Foods that were once only available
at ethnic markets were now available in supermarkets. And now it
was possible to order groceries, talk with other cooks and find
recipes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As you look back over the last century in food, reminisce with
this sampling of some of the most popular recipes. Depending on
your age, you may recall having eaten _ or cooked _ some of them. &QL;

 &HT;    Gore wedges stump issues into Atlanta visit
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It wasn't an official campaign speech, but Vice
President Al Gore hit all his key themes anyway in a brief stop in
Atlanta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription coverage for the elderly on Medicare. Health care
insurance for all U.S. children. A woman's right to choose
abortion. More teachers for more schools. Stronger penalties for
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 5,000 international delegates to the United Jewish
Communities General Assembly meeting at the Atlanta Civic Center
applauded Gore's positions on those issues almost as strongly as
they did his unwavering support for Israel and the ``hopeful but
fragile'' Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's 35-minute address to the gathering was part of his vice
presidential duties, and he never once mentioned former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination who was in town for a Georgia fund-raiser and a meeting
with Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's speech _ apart from a laugh-evoking top four list of
Jewish country-western songs _ was one that could have fit on
almost any stump in America.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with biographical sketches stressing his family's emphasis
on education and commitment to civil rights, Gore reached out to
Jewish leaders, underscoring that their values are very similar to
his.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to fight to enhance penalties for hate crimes, a key
issue for Jewish groups, and said the Senate ought to reconsider
and ratify the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders, like those gathered in Atlanta to try to unite
Jews throughout the world, can help push those policies, Gore said.
``I see things happening in our country right now that make me
believe this gathering can have a decisive voice in embodying our
values in our laws.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of oil Wednesday topped $26 a barrel, the highest
level in almost three years. If it climbs just a few more pennies,
it will be the highest since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of other important commodities _ from copper and
lumber to tin and hogs _ are also rising. In fact, commodity prices
are now on track to show their first combined gain since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after a sharp three-year decline that helped keep
inflation in check, the increases do not present an inflationary
threat yet, in part because commodities _ other than oil _ are a
small component in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, the
rising cost of industrial metals, like copper and tin, have been
somewhat offset by falling prices for agricultural products, like
soybeans and wheat.
</P>
<P>
   But oil, especially in the form of gasoline, is helping push
consumer prices modestly higher. For the 12 months through October,
the Consumer Price Index is up 2.6 percent. If oil prices had held
steady, the index would be up 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that energy is up a ton,'' said Robert J.
Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Rye Brook, N.Y. But
because the market rally has not pushed consumer prices markedly
higher, people are comfortable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors and Wall Street analysts are focusing less on the
total index and more on the core inflation rate, which excludes
food and all energy costs. In the last year, the core rate has
risen 2.1 percent, compared with a climb of 2.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The direction of commodity prices depends heavily on OPEC's
actions, the rebound of the world economy and the weather. But
William Byers, director of futures research at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.,
predicted that ``this rise in commodity prices is probably going to
flatten out.''
</P>
<P>
   A cutback in oil production that OPEC members agreed to in March
has been the major reason for rising prices. So far this year, the
price of the near-term futures contract traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange has jumped 120.7 percent to $26.60 a barrel.
That is just two cents below the recent high of $26.62 on Jan. 8,
1997. And if that high-water mark is breached, oil will be at its
highest since it began falling from $32 a barrel in January 1991,
just after the American and allied success in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the rally stopped with oil just short of $25 a
barrel, and the price slipped to $20.90. But the rise has resumed
in recent weeks as confidence has grown that members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would extend their
production cuts beyond March 2000, the end of their one-year pact.
</P>
<P>
   Several OPEC members said this week that there was already an
agreement to extend the production cuts beyond March. But oil
ministers from Saudia Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, who met
Wednesday, asked only for a commitment to the planned production
cuts through March. They did not commit to an extension.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the rally was a report by the American Petroleum
Institute after the close of the market on Tuesday. It showed that
inventories dropped 2.49 million barrels last week to 308.97
million, a bigger drop than expected, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rothman, the senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch who
has attended OPEC meetings since 1986, suggested in a note to
clients on Monday that OPEC may have changed its thinking about
``what's too high an oil price.'' The threshold is now near $30,
instead of $25, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC does not want the price to stay at $30, he said,
reiterating his forecast of a price decline later next year.
Economists at Merrill Lynch said that the higher oil price would
not have a significant impact on either economic growth or
inflation, he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Along with crude oil, gasoline and heating oil have led the rise
in commodity futures prices this year. The price for the near-term
unleaded gasoline contract traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange is up 105.6 percent to 73.40 cents a gallon this year. The
price of heating oil has jumped 102.1 percent to 68.73 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The rising prices of industrial metals is a sign that the
economies that suffered during the global financial crisis that
began in July 1997 are turning around. If prices continue to rise,
they will spur economic growth in the countries that rely heavily
on the sale of commodities. Asia's potential is enormous. South
Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, where the
economic pains were greatest, accounted for about a quarter of the
growth in demand for copper from 1992 through 1996 before the
crisis began, according to the International Monetary Fund. Metals
are also being bolstered by an economic turnaround in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains in those prices are small compared with those in
energy. The near-term copper future, traded on the Commodity
Exchange, is up 18 percent this year to 78.30 cents a pound. Last
year the price of copper fell 13.7 percent. The Journal of Commerce
index of industrial commodities, which includes oil, tin, copper,
lead, rubber, hides and other products, has climbed 6.2 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural prices continue to be weak overall. Hog prices are
up sharply, with pork belly futures up 73.7 percent. But that is
from lows last year that forced some farmers to shoot their pigs in
the pen rather than bring them to market. And some grains are off
sharply. Soybean prices are down 29.3 percent, while wheat is down
11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that industrial metals are the only place where you
can extrapolate a trend for higher prices,'' said Byers of Bear
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera of Hoenig &AMP; Co. said he did not expect Federal Reserve
policy makers to worry about a modest rise there as long as it was
driven by growth in the rest of the world while the American
economy slowed down.

PUTTING ON THE BIRD
</HEADLINE>
 2 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: note 3-column chart below ...) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's your turn to host the Thanksgiving feast this year, and
that means orchestrating the meal and cooking the turkey. Don't
panic. While the big bird can appear intimidating _ especially if
you're a novice _ it's really not difficult. Once you learn the
ABCs, you'll find it as easy as 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Food experts and professionals have varying opinions and
theories about the the best way to roast the bird. Some favor
breast side up, others breast side down. And some cooks even
recommend turning the turkey during roasting, which can be awkward
and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   While some cooks like to stuff the bird (it wouldn't be a
traditional Thanksgiving without the stuffing cooked inside the
turkey), for safety reasons food professionals don't. The same goes
for basting _ some favor doing it often during roasting (which
really isn't necessary as it doesn't penetrate the skin much) while
other cooks just oil the skin, shove the turkey in the oven and
forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook authors vary on temperature preferences. Some prefer
low, slow-cooking. Others like hot, high temperatures for roasting
the bird. And the middle-of-the-roaders like combinations thereof.
But the experts at the United States Department of Agriculture's
Meat and Poultry Hotline and the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line
recommend a steady 325 degrees F for safety's sake and optimum
results.
</P>
<P>
   Without fail, every holiday finds someone whose frozen turkey
still hasn't fully thawed or someone panicked about doing things
just right, said Diane Van, supervisor of the USDA's hotline.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just want to make cooking the turkey complicated,''
said Jean Schnelle, director of the Illinois-based Butterball
Turkey Talk-Line, which has 48 home economists on staff this year
to answer the 200,000 consumer calls usually received this month
and next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot to do with traditions, expectations and standards
people set for themselves,'' Schnelle said. ``You have memories of
past Thanksgivings, and they all seemed wonderful and perfect. And
if it's your turn to host Thanksgiving, you want to meet those
standards and expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she emphasized, the fuss over cooking the picture-perfect
turkey is really much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about cooking the turkey is that you
don't perceive it as such a major hassle. Relax! Cooking the turkey
is the easiest part of the Thanksgiving dinner,'' Schnelle said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Butterball hotline started in 1981, most callers wanted
help to achieve the perfectly moist, nicely golden brown turkey.
Today, food safety questions top the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not used to thawing out something so big _ and it
always takes longer than anyone expects,'' said Schnelle, noting
that the company has expanded thawing time recommendations because
complaints kept growing. ``Our observation is that glass shelves in
new refrigerators are slowing down the thawing _ due to less
circulation. Also, a full refrigerator is less effective in thawing
quickly as there is less air circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   An 18-pound bird takes at least four days to thaw in the fridge.
And it can be completely thawed up to a day or two ahead of
roasting, which means you could put a frozen turkey in the fridge
up to six days ahead of roasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkeys do not take as long to cook as people perceive they do
_ and that's a major mistake people also make,'' added Schnelle.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a run-down of answers to common questions tackled on both
the USDA's and Butterball's hot lines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRELIMINARIES
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should I buy a fresh turkey or a frozen turkey?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although opinions vary regarding this matter, there is no
significant difference in quality between a fresh and a frozen
turkey, according to Van at the USDA hot line. Mostly, the choice
depends on when you plan to shop (last minute or several days in
advance) and if you have sufficient space to store and thaw a
frozen turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long can a fresh turkey be stored in a home refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   A: No longer than two days. Some fresh turkeys are labeled with
pull dates, so check the label on the turkey when you buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I estimate how big a turkey I'll need to feed the
crowd I'm serving?
</P>
<P>
   A: Figure on 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of turkey per person _ more if
you have hearty eaters or desire leftovers. If you know that more
guests will prefer dark meat than white, consider buying extra
parts and roasting in a separate pan. Be sure your oven is large
enough for the size turkey you'll be buying. In some instances, it
may be best to buy two smaller birds and roast them side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should I buy a hen or a tom?
</P>
<P>
   A: The sex designation of hen (female up to 16 pounds) and tom
(male larger than 16 pounds) is optional on the label and is an
indication of size rather than tenderness. There is no significant
quality difference, said Van.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything I should look for on the label when I buy a
turkey?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Look for the inspection mark that lets you know the
turkey has been inspected by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service for wholesomeness and accurate labeling. Also look for a
USDA grade symbol; most are marketed grade A today.
</P>
<P>
   A turkey label marked ``fresh'' means it has been stored at a
temperature no lower than 26 degree F. A ``frozen'' label indicates
the turkey must be stored at 0 degrees F or below. ``Basted'' or
``self-basted'' means the turkey has been injected with a solution
(3 to 8 percent allowed) containing edible fat, broth, stock, or
water, plus spices and other approved substances. ``Natural'' means
the turkey contains no artificial flavors, colors, chemical
preservatives, etc. and is minimally processed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've had a turkey in my freezer for nine months. Is it OK to
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: At 0 degrees F or below, a frozen turkey will keep for up to
one year without appreciable loss of quality and flavor. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THAWING
</P>
<P>
   Q: How should I thaw the turkey?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three options.
</P>
<P>
   In the refrigerator, place the wrapped frozen turkey on a tray
or in a pan lined with paper towels (to catch moisture that
accumulates as it thaws), allowing 24 hours for every 5 pounds of
turkey. A 12-pound turkey, for example, would take two to two and a
half days to thaw. The thawed turkey can remain in the refrigerator
up to two days prior to cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Using cold water is another thawing method. It's faster than
refrigerator thawing, but requires more attention. Place wrapped
turkey (if there are any leaks in packaging, place in a clean
plastic food bag and secure) in a sink of cold tap water, changing
water the every 30 minutes. Allow about 30 minutes per pound of
turkey for complete thawing. A 12-pound turkey, in this case, would
take about six hours to thaw.
</P>
<P>
   It's feasible to thaw a turkey of 12 pounds or less in the
microwave oven on the defrost cycle, turning often. However, it's
necessary to cook the turkey, unstuffed, immediately after thawing,
either in the microwave or a conventional oven because some areas
of the turkey may become warm and begin to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My friend thaws her frozen turkey on the counter at room
temperature? Is it safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. NEVER thaw a turkey at room temperature or in warm water.
Bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature and in the hours it
takes for a turkey to thaw, the surface bacteria could multiply to
dangerous levels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROASTING
</P>
<P>
   Q: Once thawed, how do I prepare the turkey for roasting?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unwrap the turkey and remove giblets and neck piece from the
cavities. Rinse turkey inside and out with cold water; drain well.
Pat dry with paper towels. (Stuff turkey at this point, if
desired.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the easiest way to roast the turkey?
</P>
<P>
   A: Place the turkey breast side up on a rack in a shallow
roasting pan, 2 to 2 1/2 inches deep. Do not add water. Brush
lightly with vegetable oil (or melted butter).
</P>
<P>
   Truss the bird, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Cover turkey loosely with foil, leaving a little space between
bird and foil and pressing foil over drumsticks either the first or
last (it doesn't matter) 1 to 1 1/2 hours of roasting time.
</P>
<P>
   Roast in a preheated 325 degree F oven according to the chart,
until the inner thigh reaches 180 degrees F on a meat thermometer,
the center and all parts of the stuffing reach 165 degrees F and
the breast is 170 degrees F. Both the USDA and Butterball emphasize
the necessity of using a meat thermometer for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When done, remove from oven and allow the turkey to stand 20
minutes before you remove the stuffing or begin carving. &QL;

   Q: How long will it take to roast a turkey?
</P>
<P>
   A: Roast the bird using these times provided by the USDA. The
times are approximate. Variations in ovens, pan sizes and
materials, and the temperature of the turkey at beginning of
roasting affect roasting time. Therefore, begin checking for
doneness about an hour prior to the end of the recommended roasting
time. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I cook the turkey partway through one day and finish it
the next?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. You should never partially roast a stuffed or unstuffed
turkey one day and complete roasting the next. Interrupted cooking
increases the possibility of bacterial growth.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My friend says her mother has always cooked the turkey in a
200 degree F oven overnight. Is it safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Overnight cooking at a low temperature isn't a safe
method for cooking turkey. According to the USDA hotline, it is not
safe to cook any meat or poultry at a temperature lower than 325
degrees F. At 200 degrees F, meat remains in the ``danger zone''
(between 40 degrees and 140 degrees F), where bacteria multiply
rapidly and can form toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can a turkey be prepared any way other than roasting?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can grill it, smoke it, microwave it, or deep-fry it, but
the turkey should not be stuffed. Deep-frying is a trendy way to
cook a turkey these days, but it requires special equipment and can
be messy and dangerous. For more information on these and other
cooking methods, see the USDA Web site, www.fsis.usda.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's Thanksgiving Day and I forgot to thaw the turkey. What
can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can start cooking the unwrapped frozen (unstuffed) turkey
in a preheated 325-degree F oven, but you'll need to add 50 percent
more cooking time to the original times on the chart. Also once the
turkey is thawed enough, you'll need to very carefully (without
burning yourself) remove the giblets and neck piece from the turkey
cavities. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
STUFFING
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm debating _ should I stuff the turkey or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Food safety professionals advise against stuffing the turkey
and recommend baking the stuffing separately in a casserole dish _
it's the safest way. But it's your call. An unstuffed turkey takes
less time to cook than one that is stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   If you desire a stuffed turkey, the stuffing should be placed in
the cavities at the last minute just before the turkey goes into
the oven.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt to bake the stuffing separately, place in a greased
dish, cover with foil and bake 1 hour (the last hour the turkey
roasts) at 325 degrees F. Remove foil the last 30 minutes of baking
time to allow the top to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to stuff the turkey. How do I do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mix stuffing just before it goes into the turkey. Never stuff
a turkey in advance. Allow 3/4 cup of stuffing for each pound of
ready-to-eat turkey. Bake any extra stuffing separately.
</P>
<P>
   The wet and dry ingredients can be prepared and cooked ahead of
time and chilled separately. Combine and mix them just before
placing inside a turkey or a casserole.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the stuffing in the turkey, close the neck and body
cavities by folding the neck skin over the back and fastening with
a skewer, trussing pins, clean string or toothpicks; then twist the
wing tips under the back of the turkey to rest against the neck
skin. Close the body cavity with skewers or by tucking ends of legs
under a band of skin at the tail, or into metal ``hock-locks,'' if
provided. You can also close the opening by tying the legs together
with a clean string. Allow for extra cooking time, because a
stuffed turkey takes longer to cook than an unstuffed one. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOOD SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just discovered I cooked the turkey with the package of
giblets still inside the cavity. Are the turkey and giblets safe to
eat?
</P>
<P>
   A: If giblets were paper wrapped and left in the cavity during
roasting, even though this is not recommended, the turkey is
probably safe to eat. However, the giblets should be discarded,
noted USDA's Van. Both the turkey and giblets should be discarded
if the packaging containing the giblets were in plastic and had
been altered or melted during cooking because harmful chemicals
from the packaging may have penetrated the surrounding meat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long is it safe to keep cooked turkey leftovers at room
temperature?
</P>
<P>
   A: Within two hours of removing the turkey from the oven,
refrigerate or freeze the leftovers separately _ the turkey,
stuffing and gravy. Cut the turkey into smaller pieces (leg, wing,
half breast) or remove the meat from the bones to speed cooling in
the fridge. Refrigerated turkey should be used within two to three
days. Frozen cooked turkey should be used within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am fixing turkey for the office party this year. How should
I serve it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's probably simpler and safer to serve it cold. Cook the
turkey at home, slice and refrigerate in a shallow container for
transporting to the party. Keep the meat refrigerated until serving
time. Throw away any leftovers that have been left out more than
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to bake some pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving Day two
days in advance. Can I leave them on the counter or do I need to
refrigerate them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Foods made with eggs and milk such as pumpkin or custard pies
and cheesecake must first be safely baked to at least 160 degrees
F. After baking, cool up to two hours at room temperature and then
refrigerate. Eggs and milk have high protein and moisture content
and when these baked products are left at room temperature,
conditions are ripe for bacteria to multiply. Other holiday cakes,
cookies or breads with a perishable filling or frosting (such as
cream cheese or whipped cream) should also be kept refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What food safety tips should I follow in preparing the
Thanksgiving meal?
</P>
<P>
   A: To reduce the risks of foodborne illness, keep hot foods hot
and cold foods cold. Don't leave perishable foods at room
temperature for more than two hours on the big day. Two hours is
considered the bacteria danger zone in which harmful bacteria can
grow rapidly in temperatures between 40 degrees F and 140 degrees
F.
</P>
<P>
   Also wash your hands with soap and hot water before and after
handling any food. To prevent cross contamination, use two cutting
boards, one for meat and one for other foods. Wash utensils with
soap and hot water after using. And use paper towels, not
dishcloths, to clean up any spilled meat juices and to dry the
turkey after rinsing. &QL; 
____
</P>
<P>
   If you run into turkey problems this holiday season, call the
USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at (800) 535-4555 or the Butterball
Turkey Talk-Line at (800) 323-4848. Both will have operators
available Thanksgiving Day. &QL;

FLORIDA'S MESSY EXECUTIONS PUT ELECTRIC CHAIR ON TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In Florida, say opponents of the death penalty, there is
something worse than death. There is death in the state's electric
chair.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Lee Davis, a 300-pound triple murderer known as ``Tiny,''
was electrocuted at Florida State Prison in Starke last July.
Photographs of his execution, posted on the Internet by the Florida
Supreme Court at the request of one of its judges who is opposed to
the electric chair, show in graphic detail what happened as the
switch was thrown.
</P>
<P>
   His body reared back against the chair's restraints, giving
witnesses a grotesque glimpse under a black hood designed to hide
the faces of the condemned. His round, moon face contorted grossly,
the flesh seeming to knot, and colored a vivid purple. Blood poured
from his nose, ran down the wide leather strap that covered his
mouth and soaked his white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   After the power was turned off, Davis, who had killed a pregnant
woman and her two young daughters in 1983, was still alive.
Witnesses said his chest rose and fell about 10 times before he
went still.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials and Gov. Jeb Bush say the chair
functioned properly. Bush called what happened to Davis a
``nosebleed,'' insignificant when viewed alongside his crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the photographs, the latest evidence that this state has
trouble humanely putting to death its condemned inmates, have
whipped up renewed passion in an old debate that could signal the
end of the electric chair in Florida and perhaps the rest of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis execution was not the first to raise questions in
Florida about the humaneness of electrocution. In 1990 and 1997,
inmates caught fire in the chair as they were being put to death.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, long the subject of dark humor in the state, has
become the focus of talk shows and political rallies as far away as
Madrid, and may be considered in a special legislative session
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed interest has put Bush on the defensive and has
emboldened the forces opposing the death penalty. There is even
some evidence that residents of Florida, long supporters of using
the electric chair, are having a change of heart. A recent poll
showed that more than half the state's registered voters thought it
might be time for a new means of execution.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate rages, all executions in Florida are on hold. The
U.S. Supreme Court, considering the appeal of another condemned
killer in Florida, agreed in October, for the first time in more
than a century, to consider whether the electric chair is cruel and
unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush contends that the chair is humane, but is considering a
special session of the Legislature in January to discuss a change
to lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the death penalty, in Florida and around the
nation, have called the state's use of the chair barbarism. They
have also accused Bush and other state officials who defend it of
using such spectacles to deter crime and to prove they are tough on
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the death penalty say more is at stake here than
whether Florida continues to use the chair or changes to lethal
injection, as other states have done. In 34 of the 38 states that
have death-penalty laws, lethal injection is either the only method
or a choice given to the condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a humane alternative to hanging and the firing
squad, electrocution is now seen by many people in Florida as the
preferred way of exacting justice for a much different reason:
because it poses the possibility of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A method that was once defended because it was supposed to be
humane is now being mostly defended by a state because of its
inhumanity,'' said Carol Steiker, a law professor and associate
dean at Harvard Law School. ``It's been turned on its legal head.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three other states _ Alabama, Georgia and Nebraska _ use
the electric chair exclusively. Some legal experts say the Supreme
Court case out of Florida could be the beginning of the end for all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will bring an end to all electrocutions in the
United States,'' said Stephen Bright, a lawyer who works with death
row inmates and is the director of the Southern Center for Human
Rights, in Atlanta.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Bush told reporters he thought the Supreme Court would
dismiss the debate over Davis' execution as ``an argument over a
nosebleed of a criminal who savagely murdered a pregnant woman and
her two young daughters _ and who was successful in delaying his
own execution 16 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statewide poll conducted by The St. Petersburg Times and
The Miami Herald, 58 percent of the people asked said they
supported a state law to switch from the electric chair to lethal
injection.
</P>
<P>
   That has not swayed Bush, said Lucia Ross, his press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is in the process of considering other options
that include lethal injection,'' Ms. Ross said. ``That does not
diminish his feelings about the constitutionality of the chair.
It's legal, it works and we fully support it. We believe it is a
quick and humane way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's legal advisers have said he will consider lethal
injection if his insistence on use of the chair has the effect of
delaying executions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's intervention stems from an appeal by Anthony
Braden Bryan, who was convicted of kidnapping and killing a man in
the Florida Panhandle. Oral arguments in that case are expected to
begin in February.

 &HT;    North Georgia fires nearly contained
 &HT;    By Rick Badie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A fire that crept along a North Georgia mountain ridge
Wednesday feasted on wilderness that succumbed with a snap, crackle
and pop. A 20-man crew of Puerto Rican firefighters watched the
blaze, just in case it raced across a gravel road into a thicket of
white pine, dogwood and sweet gum trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have corralled it, not contained it,'' said Sid Hall,
leader of the crew helping to fight a 1,450-acre fire near Pigeon
Roost Mountain, north of Cleveland. ``It's between the roads and
creeks right now, and we have a good chance of keeping it there.''
</P>
<P>
   An interagency effort to stop several fires that since Saturday
have scorched 4,400 acres of mountain wilderness gained ground. The
total number of fires increased to eight, but two of them _ Pigeon
Roost and Turkey Stamp in Lumpkin County _ were burning themselves
out. Favorable winds, coupled with natural and man-made barriers,
aided in keeping the fires from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural boundaries and containment lines we are putting in
are beginning to pay off,'' Alan Polk, spokesman for the U.S.
Forest Service, said Wednesday. ``We're starting to put a circle
around the fires, and a big factor has been the wind. But you never
know what the weather is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 firefighters battling fires in Gilmer, Lumpkin and
other mountain counties used rakes, hoes and leaf blowers to clear
natural paths and build 4-foot lanes to starve the flames. Another
100 firefighters from the west who were to arrive Wednesday will be
in the field today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of two fires that have consumed 1,800 acres in
Gilmer County has been contained; the other fire that was heading
toward the southeast was doused with water by helicopter. Three
smaller fires in Rabun, White and Chattooga counties were
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Today, firefighters may start their own fires to control
burning. Those fires, called ``backburns'' would be set to burn
toward the fires they want to put out, said Hall, the crew leader
from Saguache, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both fires would sit and smolder a little bit, but they
wouldn't be a threat,'' said Hall, as soot and smoke bellowed from
a ridge near Pigeon Roost. ``What we don't want to happen is a tree
to fall across the road and ignite a new area.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does, firefighters including Rey Lorenzo of Puerto Rico
stand ready. Since becoming a firefighter in 1992, Lorenzo has
worked natural disasters in Florida and Texas. It's his first trip
to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have family that we leave behind, but we are here to
protect the people,'' said Lorenzo, 30. ``But for us, it's a matter
of pride to be here. We are called in because we are trained for
this kind of work.''

 MIAMI: in February.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bryan's lawyers persuaded the Supreme Court to review his case
and stay executions in Florida by citing the history of the
electric chair in this state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, smoke and flames leaped from the face mask of Pedro
Medina, a convicted murderer. In 1990, flames shot three feet high
from behind the head of another condemned killer, Jesse Tafero.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, we just can't seem to pull the switch and get
people to die instantly,'' said Walter Campbell, a Democratic state
senator from Coral Springs, near Fort Lauderdale, who favors the
death penalty but is tired of the embarrassments caused by the
electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors working for the state have always contended that death
in the chair is fast and painless, despite burns and other evidence
to the contrary. And a majority of the Florida Supreme Court has
repeatedly held that the chair is not a cruel and unusual form of
punishment, and the court did so again this year by a vote of 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But in a dissent, Justice Leander Shaw wrote, ``Execution by
electrocution, with its attendant smoke and flames and blood and
screams, is a spectacle whose time has passed.''
</P>
<P>
   He requested that the pictures of Davis' electrocution be posted
on the Internet. The state Supreme Court complied, as a way to let
the public see exactly what went on, said Jane Bentley, a
spokeswoman for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four states that use the chair exclusively _ seven others
give the condemned inmate a choice between the chair or lethal
injection _ none has Florida's reputation for messy executions.
</P>
<P>
   While talk shows here have lampooned the chair, opponents of the
death penalty see Florida's use of it as macabre.
</P>
<P>
   The executioner is not a state employee, but a private citizen
who is paid $150 per electrocution to pull the switch. Condemned
inmates are granted a last meal, but only if it costs $20 or less.
Then, once strapped in the chair, the inmate fears not only death,
but agony, said death penalty lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the poster child for ugly executions,'' said Bruce Rogow,
a lawyer and professor at Nova Southeastern University, who was
Tafero's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client's scalp caught on fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wooden chair that caused flames in the executions of Tafero
and Medina was built in 1923, by inmates, and was so rickety by the
time the obese Davis was executed that state prison officials
replaced it with a sturdier one. But they used the old chair's
electrical system.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said that Davis had been taking blood-thinning
medication, which can increase bleeding. He did not suffer, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with the chair,'' said C.J. Drake, the
state prisons spokesman. ``But it was a profuse nosebleed. He was
wearing a white shirt, which made it a lot more noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tafero's execution, the flames were attributed to a faulty
sponge _ wet and used to transfer electricity _ in the headpiece.
In Medina's execution, prison officials wet the sponge improperly.
</P>
<P>
   The botched executions have backfired on state officials who
want to speed the process of carrying out the death sentence. The
problems have been fodder for lawyers trying to win stays for many
of the 372 inmates on death row, creating logjams in the appellate
courts. More than half have been there 10 years or more, and some
for 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it's done is delayed and delayed,'' Campbell said. ``The
real victims are the victims' families.''
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted many state officials to propose the switch to
lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most Floridians that support capital punishment don't
see a difference,'' said Ron Klein, a Democratic state senator from
Boca Raton. ``I mean, dead is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has said that many Floridians, like himself, do not see
the chair as cruel. Interviews with the friends and families of
murdered people bear witness to that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, George Pfeil, a reserve deputy in Seminole County, near
Orlando, was on his way home when he stopped in at a pharmacy in
Longwood to pick up a prescription for his sick wife. He walked in
on a robbery and was shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``George did not deserve to die like he did,'' said Capt. Al
Sanchez, who had worked beside Deputy Pfeil.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy's killer, Terry Sims, has been on death row for 20
years and was scheduled to die last week, until the Supreme Court
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez not only wants him to die, he wants him to die in the
chair. ``Lethal injection is too humane for these guys,'' he said.
``I think they ought to suffer a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment
placing the death penalty in the state constitution and allowing
any method permitted by the U.S. Supreme Court, including the
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people think that these people deserve this
type of punishment,'' said Bright of the Southern Center for Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the photos of Davis' execution convinced many people that
the chair was, if not cruel, at least an embarrassment. The photos
even provoked one international incident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the U.S.
Embassy in Madrid as the Florida Supreme Court heard an appeal by a
death row inmate and Spanish citizen, Joaquin Martinez. He shot and
stabbed to death a young woman and man in Tampa in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters paraded in front of the embassy chanting
``assassins'' and ``beasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials say Florida could have avoided such
unwelcome attention if it had been more competent in
electrocutions.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty experts, like Ms. Steiker at Harvard, say there is
no solid proof that executions _ no matter how carried out _ deter
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The people on death row acted out of passion or depravity, death
penalty lawyers say, and few stopped in the course of their murders
to ponder the repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think about the chair or having a needle stuck in
their arm,'' Rogow said. ``Does it prevent the next guy from
committing murder? No.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, he said, that state executions are revenge killings,
and messy executions are sweeter revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Pfeil was this really nice guy,'' Sanchez said of the
reserve deputy's death. ``Decent guys, killed by less-than-decent
people. They deserve everything that's coming to them.''

<P>
   Maybe it depends which side of the Pacific you're on.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since China and the United States signed a deal that
may lead to Chinese admission into the World Trade Organization,
the Chinese stock market has made small gains, with indexes of
mainland stocks up about 1 percent. Hong Kong stocks did better,
with the leading index of such shares up 3.6 percent since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the relatively small number of Chinese stocks traded
on major U.S. stock markets have risen sharply. In some cases they
have gone absolutely berserk. Suddenly, any stock with China in its
name seems to have willing buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gains have gone to stocks that previously had been
of little interest to American investors. By contrast, China
Telecom (Hong Kong), which provides cellular telephone services in
China and has been an institutional favorite in America, rose on
Monday and Tuesday but fell $5.9375, to $86.5625, Wednesday, and is
up just 2 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   But such languid performance is more than offset by other stocks
that have skyrocketed. A list of nine stocks _ all traded on the
New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq and all with the word ``China''
in their names _ shows increases of at least 60 percent for six of
the nine since Friday. Investors who put an equal amount of money
into each of the stocks on Friday _ the last trading day before the
WTO agreement was announced _ would have more than quadrupled their
money by Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing move came in the shares of China Prosperity
International Holdings, a company that does property renovations in
China _ but that has also been talking about doing something
related to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   China Prosperity was once something of a hot stock, moving as
high as $37 a share in Nasdaq trading in 1996 _ adjusted for a
later reverse split. But it had fallen out of investors' favor, and
by Monday was trading at $1 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Tuesday, the stock leaped to $11.06, trading as high as
$14, and volume rose to 521,100 shares, or more than had traded in
the previous year. That however, was just the prelude. Wednesday
volume totaled 4.4 million shares, or more than the total volume in
this country since the company went public in 1995. The price
leaped as high as $80, then began to slide before ending at
$32.0625.
</P>
<P>
   There was no announcement from the company, but the same could
not be said for another suddenly high flyer. China Resources
Development, a distributor of natural rubber, reported that its
losses were growing. It added that it had no explanation for the
stock's movement in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   That stock jumped $19 to $25 a share in Nasdaq trading
Wednesday, on volume of 906,800 shares. That volume is nearly twice
the total number of shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Another amazing performance was turned in by Dransfield China
Paper Corp., which rarely trades on Nasdaq. During October, there
were only two days when shares in the company, which distributes
paper products and is building pulp mills in China, were traded.
The price then was $1 a share. It fell to 43.75 cents on Monday,
and then did not trade Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, with anything named China looking hot, 1.3
million shares were traded _ more than triple the total volume
traded since the company was listed on Nasdaq in 1997 _ and the
price rose as high as $29 before closing at $11.125.
</P>
<P>
   China.com, a company based in Hong Kong that provides a portal
for Chinese users of the Internet, leaped from $58 on Friday to a
close of $105 Wednesday, trading as high as $137. It had gone
public, at $20 a share, in July.
</P>
<P>
   Even China Tire, a company that makes car and truck tires, got
in on the action. Since Friday, it is up 77 percent, to $10.625.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to explain such moves based on expectations of
what will happen if China is successful in entering the World Trade
Organization, something that could yet be derailed by congressional
opposition. Changes in the Chinese economy will arrive over a
period of years, and the opening of the economy to competition from
foreign companies may damage some Chinese businesses even as others
are helped.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to have been little in the way of such analysis
regarding many of the stocks that were moving Wednesday. Instead,
Internet chat rooms were full of comments about how certain stocks
were sure to keep moving because there were relatively few shares
available for trading. Traders were chasing performance, and in the
process they were creating it.

SALE SETS RECORDS FOR 18 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices for artworks made in the last 30 years were so
high at Christie's in New York on Tuesday night that it seemed as
if a bubble were getting ready to burst. Bidders acted like spoiled
children, consistently ignoring the estimates and paying whatever
it took to outpace the competition, even though many works had been
up for auction in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of contemporary art totaled $13.2 million, above
Christie's high estimate of $12.8 million. Of the 60 lots offered,
56 found buyers. Records were set for 18 artists, ranging from Jeff
Koons to Chuck Close to Damien Hirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of an unhealthy market,'' said Edward
Nahem, a Manhattan dealer. ``There's just too much money around.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the evening's catalog featured Jeff Koons' ``Pink
Panther,'' a porcelain sculpture of a semi-nude blonde hugging the
cartoon character. Five bidders sought the work, which finally sold
to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.8 million, more than
twice its high estimate of $800,000. The seller was believed to be
Kent Logan, the San Francisco collector.
</P>
<P>
   Another telephone bidder bought Chuck Close's ``Cindy II''
(1988), a portrait of the photographer Cindy Sherman. Estimated at
$600,000 to $800,000, it sold for $1.2 million after five bidders
vied for it. The painting had sold for $231,000 at Sotheby's in
1992. Tuesday's price was a record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were on the work of two British artists, Rachel
Whiteread and Hirst, who are currently represented in the Brooklyn
Museum's ``Sensation'' exhibition. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who
deemed the show offensive, tried to cut off city support to the
museum and threatened to evict it from its city-owned building. He
also questioned the financial interest behind the show, since
Christie's had donated $50,000 toward the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Did Christie's investment pay off? It's hard to say. Ms.
Whiteread had one piece in the sale: ``Untitled (Three Tables),'' a
1996 floor piece being sold by Gerald Fagginato, the London dealer.
Estimated at $100,000 to $150,000, it went to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $112,500.
</P>
<P>
   The sale included five works by Hirst, known for submerging dead
animals in formaldehyde. They performed well, but not so
spectacularly as many other works on Tuesday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The five are all from different periods in his career. Three had
been on the market in the last 18 months, but that didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Way'' (1990-91) _ one of the artist's well-known
pharmaceutical works, actually a medicine cabinet filled with old
drug bottles _ set a record for the artist. Estimated at $250,000
to $350,000, it sold to an unidentified bidder for $354,500. Just
last year, it was sold at Sotheby's for $262,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loss of Memory Is Worse than Death,'' a 1994 piece consisting
of a steel cage filled with formaldehyde containers, masks, gloves
and a syringe, was estimated at $120,000 to $180,000. Simon de
Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe who is now a
private dealer in Geneva, bought the work for $178,500 _ quite a
handsome price, considering that it failed to sell at Christie's in
London in October 1998, when the estimate was $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hirst that didn't sell last year but soared above its
high estimate on Tuesday was ``Alone Yet Together,'' a 1993 wall
piece consisting of 100 dead fish floating in individual glass
blocks filled with formaldehyde. Estimated at $180,000 to $250,000,
it sold to de Pury for $277,500. Last year in London, it carried an
estimate of $170,000 to $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dead Head,'' a photographic self-portrait of Hirst at age
16 posing with a severed human head, was estimated at $25,000 to
$35,000. It sold to a telephone bidder for $74,000.
``N-(9-Acridinyl) Maleimide,'' from 1992, one of the artist's dot
paintings, was expected to bring $150,000 to $200,000; a telephone
bidder paid $173,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most exciting moment in the sale came when Martin
Kippenberger's ``Untitled'' (1998) went on the block. The painting,
showing a man dressed only in boxer shorts looking at himself in a
bubble-like mirror, was estimated at $40,000 to $60,000. Seven
bidders wanted it badly. When the bidding reached $500,000, the
audience began laughing in disbelief. It finally went to an
unidentified telephone bidder for $717,500, a record for the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Another huge price was paid for the 1986 ``Last Supper'' from
Andy Warhol's famous series of reflections on Leonardo da Vinci's
``Last Supper'' (1495-97). Estimated at $400,000 to $600,000, it
sold to another telephone bidder for $772,500. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sale included property from several collections, among them
the O.R.S., Doron Sebbag Art Collection, owned by Tel Aviv art
patrons who support the Israel Museum. The first 12 lots in the
sale came from this collection.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Thomas Struth's ``Musee du Louvre 4, Paris,
1989,'' a photograph of visitors to the Louvre stopping in front of
Gericault's ``Raft of the Medusa.'' Estimated at $30,000 to
$40,000, it sold for $178,500, a record for the artist, to Perry
Rubenstein, a Manhattan dealer. In May 1997, Sotheby's sold the
work for $39,100 in an auction of works from the Boston Children's
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few casualties was Bruce Nauman's ``First Hologram
Series: Making Faces (F,G)'' and ``Second Hologram Series: Full
Figures Poses (B).'' These three holographic images on glass, from
1968-69, were expected to bring $200,000 to $300,000, but nobody
was interested and bidding stopped at $170,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, prices were stronger than many
dealers would have liked. A Charles Ray drawing, ``Untitled,'' of
an enraged Superman rendered in the comic-book style of Roy
Lichtenstein, sold for $189,500, more than four times its high
estimate of $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemarie Trockel, the German-born artist whose work was in this
year's Venice Biennale, was represented in the sale. Her sculpture
of a bronze deer lying on its side, expected to bring $50,000 to
$70,000, was sold to de Pury for $85,000, a record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were paying a lot of money for talent that hasn't been
proven,'' said Marc Selwyn, a Los Angeles dealer, leaving the sale.
``It all seemed out of kilter.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: BRUCE SMITH'S NEVER-ENDING STRUGGLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ian Rafferty was doing just fine until Tuesday. He was living the
anonymous life of a free-agent rookie lineman trying to make it in
the NFL. Rafferty, an offensive tackle from North Carolina State,
was waived in September by the Tennessee Titans and then signed to
the Titans' practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the 23-year-old rookie received an SOS call from
the New York Jets, who got right to the point. They were playing
Buffalo on Sunday. Jason Fabini, the starting right tackle and the
backup at left tackle, is out for the season; Jumbo Elliott, the
starting left tackle, has a bad back and may not be able to play.
And the Jets need a left tackle, because they will going up against
Bruce Smith, Buffalo's future Hall of Fame, rookie-devouring
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Rafferty found himself in New York before 9 a.m. Wednesday, at
the Jets' complex by 9:30 and up to his ears in the team's fat
playbook shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of their very slim playoff hopes, the Jets have to
hope that Rafferty won't have to play against Smith, that Jumbo
Elliott is healthy enough to get on the field, that Ray Lucas,
Monday night's star quarterback against the New England Patriots,
won't suffer the same fate Boomer Esiason suffered in 1995 when
Smith roared in from the left, past the rookie tackle Everett
McIver and knocked Esiason cold.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets can't afford any more losses, not in personnel, and not
in games. At 3-6, the team has the slimmest of chances for a
miraculous playoff run and absolutely no margin of error; Bruce
Smith is the error the Jets cannot afford to let happen.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Wednesday that he was fully expecting to line up
against his old adversary, Elliott, on Sunday. He said he was
equally sure that if Rafferty has to play, he'll get plenty of
help. ``They tend to give players who don't have a great deal of
experience or are very young a lot of help through slide
protection, or leaving a back or tight end back there to help,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, for the next 72 hours, Ian Rafferty will sit in
front of a screen and watch hours of Bruce Smith footage. Then, on
Sunday, the rookie may discover, as rookies always discover, that
the qualities that make players like Smith great don't show up on
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, everyone, I guess, thinks I'm a great athlete,''
Smith said. ``I'm a gifted athlete who works hard during the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what the film doesn't show is how much I put into
preparing myself to play a ball game _ working out year-round, 365
days a year, as opposed to six months out of the year. Studying in
the classroom, just putting in that extra time by myself to make
sure I'm fully prepared. My eating habits _ making sure I stayed
the same weight the last 13 years. Those are little things you
can't see on film.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a stellar season for Smith, but a difficult year,
too. His 78-year-old father has emphysema, heart problems and other
ailments. He lost a favorite aunt on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying my best to stay focused,'' Smith said. ``My father
tells me to stay focused and pray and do the things that are
necessary to keep me strong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the biggest difference between the 36-year-old Smith
and the 23-year-old Rafferty isn't size or strength, speed or
quickness. The difference is an ocean of experience, of highs and
lows, of disappointments and travails that Smith has overcome and
Rafferty has yet to face. Smith has known rivers; they have
strengthened his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been reading a book, and one of the concepts the book
focuses on is struggle,'' Smith said. ``That's what I tend to think
about certain points of my career _ it's been a struggle. But
through struggle I was able to gain a lot of knowledge, dignity,
respect. Struggle builds character. I'm still in the struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, so are the Jets. ``They're a dangerous team.''
Smith said. ``I saw their game against New England. We thought it
would have been a good game, but we didn't realize they were going
to go out and be able to win commandingly as they did.''
</P>
<P>
   For the young Ian Rafferty, who is trying to make it in the
National Football League, the battles are defined by each week's
game. For the veteran Bruce Smith, who has been to four Super Bowls
and known only defeat, battles are framed by far-reaching goals. He
signed a six-year, $28.2 million deal in 1997, but that was merely
a mark of success, not success in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggle to get better, I struggle to make my teammates
better, I struggle to try to help this team win,'' Smith said.
``It's a struggle to teach some of these younger players how to
play this game of football, how to study. It's always going to be a
struggle, until I win a championship or retire.''

ARMY PLANNING NEW NAME AND MISSION TO LATIN SOLDIERS' ACADEMY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Mass., Fla.)   (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army school that taught generations of Latin
American soldiers to fight leftist insurgencies during the Cold War
_ and along the way trained officers who went on to commit
human-rights abuses _ is changing its name and its mission in hopes
of improving its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by years of protests and chastened when Congress nearly
closed it this fall, the Army plans to restructure the academy,
known as the School of the Americas, to make its focus less
strictly military and more academic, senior Army officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under plans drawn up by Army Secretary Louis Caldera, the Army
will rewrite the school's charter and recruit civilian as well as
military students. It also plans to drop some strictly military
courses, including one in commando tactics, and shift final
authority over the school's curriculum to the Department of
Defense, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By next spring, pending approval from the Pentagon and
legislative changes from Congress, the Army hopes to ``reopen'' the
school, at Fort Benning, Ga., as the Center for Inter-American
Security Cooperation. The officials said they wanted to transform
it into a regional training institute similar to the George C.
Marshall European Center for Security Studies in Germany, created
in 1993 to foster democratic militaries in formerly Communist
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's plans stop short of shutting down the School of the
Americas or ending all combat training, as many critics have
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The School of the Americas' reputation is so bad that, even if
they put these changes in place, I'm not sure it goes far enough,''
said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., who joined in sponsoring the
legislation that would have cut the school's financing. ``It's like
putting perfume on a toxic dump.''
</P>
<P>
   But Army officials said the changes would significantly alter
the school's mission and curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are changing our focus from the Cold War, and the role the
school played in the past, to this mission of helping educate
military and civilian leaders within the context of democratic
principles,'' a senior Army official said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   First opened in Panama in 1946 and moved to its current home
near Columbus, Ga., in 1984, the school has served as the nation's
principle training ground for Central and South American military
and police officers, playing host to more than 60,000 soldiers and
officers.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it has been a magnet for controversy and protests,
since some of the school's graduates have been implicated in some
of Latin America's most notorious human-rights violations. Alumni
include 19 of the 26 Salvadoran soldiers who assassinated six
Jesuit priests in 1989, a Guatemalan colonel linked to the killing
of an American innkeeper in 1990, and Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the former ruler of Panama now in prison in the United States on
drug charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Caldera and other Army leaders have strongly defended the
school, saying the Army has never abetted or condoned abuses and
arguing that the school's training has a legitimate role in Central
and South America. But the officials acknowledged that they were
forced to consider changes because of the school's lingering
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted earlier this year effectively to shut the school
by eliminating the money for students' scholarships, but the
funding narrowly survived in September when the Senate sided with
the Army. This weekend, thousands of opponents are scheduled to
gather at Fort Benning's gate, marking the 10th anniversary of the
Jesuit killings with protests to demand the school's closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that we're going to keep fighting the same battles
unless we change,'' another Army official said.
</P>
<P>
   The school's opponents reacted warily to the proposed changes,
which the Army expects to make public in the weeks ahead. Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla., said that if the Army was serious, the school
could change to reflect the moves in Latin America toward freer,
more democratic societies. ``I think there's a great opportunity
for the school to change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Central and South America, the school has already undergone
a transformation since the days when the United States eagerly
trained militaries struggling against insurgencies supported by the
Soviet Union or Cuba. Today young cadets or officers receive
training in combating drug traffickers and coping with natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   After the embarrassment the Pentagon suffered in 1991 after
disclosing that training manuals used at the school included
references to torture, blackmail and ``neutralizing'' insurgents,
the school began emphasizing courses in human rights and civilian
control of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials argue that the school, with the relatively small
budget of $4 million, gives the United States a chance to inculcate
democratic values to rising stars in Latin American militaries.
While the Pentagon and other services offer training to military
officers from Latin America, the school is the only one that offers
training exclusively in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, the Army plans to ask the State Department
to contribute lecturers and include Latin American political and
civilian leaders as students. They also plan to expand its
seven-member board of civilian advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the Army would still provide combat
training, especially for commanders of small units, which, they
say, are critical to dealing with countries' security threats,
especially from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear the militaries are going to play an important role
in the life of the nations of Latin America, for historical reasons
and because of the legitimate security interests that they have,''
the senior Army official said. ``We can't wish them away, nor
should we wish them away. What we need to do is engage them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moakley said the United States should be devoting its
resources to helping Latin American countries strengthen judicial
systems or other democratic institutions, rather than their
militaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't teach democracy,'' he said, ``through the barrel of
a gun.''

 &HT;    The mall channel: Turner to target shoppers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now television will follow you to the mall and urge
you to buy more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting will create a new channel, based on a
smorgasbord of its programming, to air exclusively in Lenox,
Phipps, Mall of Georgia and the other malls of the Simon Property
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The as yet unnamed channel will use Turner Broadcasting shows
and characters to promote products and encourage shopping.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the effort will help Turner Broadcasting not only
launch channels but also expand into new product lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to touch our viewers in all aspects of their lives,''
said Steven J. Heyer, Turner Broadcasting's president and chief
operating officer. ``We're trying to create loyalty that extends
beyond our channels.''
</P>
<P>
   What the channel will look like and how it will appear in the
malls has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   One thing it won't be is weighty. ``This channel doesn't lend
itself to two-hour movies,'' Heyer said. ``We're talking about
shorter, crisper clips.'' Programming will be based on the content
of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting's 18 cable TV channels.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting is no stranger to specialized repacking of
its programming. Its Airport Channel pumps reconfigured versions of
CNN material into airports worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting executives hope to begin airing the mall
channel, which will run 24 hours a day, by late next year.
</P>
<P>
   The channel is part of a multimedia alliance between Turner
Broadcasting and Simon to put interactive kiosks in 256 malls
nationwide that will offer Web access and family entertainment.
Simon owns or has a stake in eight malls in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Heyer declined to reveal the level of investment in the new
partnership, other than to say it would be relatively minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The effort will require setting up a new division, to be based
in Atlanta and New York. Most of the programming will be done in
Atlanta, while sales and marketing efforts will be directed from
New York. A general manager will be hired for the channel, and will
work out of both cities.
</P>
<P>
   The new mall channel is part of a larger effort. Turner wants to
establish the names of its 18 channels, which include CNN, TNT and
the Cartoon Network, as brands recognized beyond the television.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting couldn't ask for a bigger opportunity to
extend its brand recognition. Indianapolis-based Simon Property's
malls serve 100 million shoppers. It has locations in the nation's
top 20 markets.
</P>
<P>
   For Simon, the deal is a way to distinguish its properties in
the highly competitive and crowded world of mall shopping.
``Creating this new multimedia platform is a significant
competitive advantage for both of our companies,'' said chief
executive David Simon.
</P>
<P>
   The company will draw on the vast library of Turner Broadcasting
and of its parent, Time Warner. Original programming also will be
developed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In October last year, deep in the midst of
Indonesia's financial breakdown, the French food retailer Carrefour
set up one of its sprawling hypermarkets on the edge of Jakarta. If
opening a fancy modern grocery in a shrinking Third World economy
seemed risky then, it seemed foolhardy a month later, when rioting
mobs came to the new Carrefour and looted it.
</P>
<P>
   In the year that followed, though, the supermarket has been
visited by a different sort of mob, one bent on buying as much as
it can.
</P>
<P>
   Carrefour and another French chain, Promodes, have been so
successful in Indonesia despite the country's severe economic
downturn that they now have a total of five stores in Jakarta and
plan to build more.
</P>
<P>
   The two global companies, which in August agreed to a $16.6
billion merger, are revolutionizing Indonesia's retail industry by
offering shoppers a greater variety of products at prices lower
than those at traditional markets, with no haggling and no pesky
flies. Besides illustrating the potential that exists for patient
foreign investors, the success of the French retailers illuminates
one of the most baffling aspects of Asia's financial crisis. The
phenomenon helps explain how Asia's cities managed to maintain a
surprising air of normality _ even a sober prosperity _ thanks to a
vast cushion of middle-class savings that helped sustain consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say this reservoir of personal wealth is one of the
keys to Asia's unexpectedly rapid bounce-back from the financial
crisis touched off in Thailand in mid-1997. Even in Indonesia,
where the economy shrank 13 percent last year, cities seized by
riots over rising prices and official corruption quickly regained
their bustle. Now, calmed by a new democratically elected
government, the country is joining an economic recovery across the
region in which affluent households hold a vital role. Driven thus
far by low interest rates and government spending, economists say,
the recovery will increasingly depend on the bourgeoisie's ample
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovery has to be carried by households,'' said David
Fernandez, an economist with J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the crisis should have been a great leveler,
devastating the affluent by destroying the value of their property
and their shareholdings while eliminating jobs in such modern
industries as manufacturing and construction that were suffering
from excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Indonesia's middle- and upper-classes have survived the
crisis largely intact, thanks to traditional values of thrift and
mutual family support, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   It was this growing class of affluent Indonesians that lured
big-name foreign retailers to Indonesia in the first place. Though
the average annual income in Indonesia is just $600, the gulf
between haves and have-nots is tremendous. In a nation of 207
million people, the world's fourth most populous country, there are
roughly 20 million people in households that spend at least $1,200
a year on routine expenses like rent and food, according to A.C.
Nielsen, the market research firm. They represent a market of color
TV-owning consumers larger than the entire population of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge country with huge markets,'' said Percival
Manglano, a consultant with the Castle Group here, a consulting
company for foreign investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carrefour set its sights on Indonesia in the mid-1990s as part
of an expansion that led it into Taiwan, Malaysia, China and
Singapore. J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart Stores also set up shop in the
country. Because Indonesian laws prohibited direct foreign
investment in retailing, each had to find a local partner.
Carrefour teamed up with a powerful ethnic-Chinese family that owns
a distribution company, Tigaraksa Satria.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis that started in Thailand in mid-1997 and
soon spread to Indonesia changed everything. Wal-Mart and J.C.
Penney cleared out. Though the International Monetary Fund, as a
condition of its $43 billion economic aid package, compelled
Indonesia to lift its restriction on foreign retail investment,
Carrefour and Promodes delayed plans to open as riots shook
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   While the violence and demonstrations were bringing down
Indonesia's corrupt regime, the crisis was seemingly devastating
Carrefour's potential customers. The nation's currency, the rupiah,
plummeted more than 75 percent against the dollar, real wages fell
35 percent and the number of Indonesians the World Bank estimated
were living in poverty doubled, to 40 million.
</P>
<P>
   In outer islands, poor subsistence communities felt little
impact. Those that were growing cash crops that could be exported
even enjoyed a local boom as a result of the rupiah's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   It was the urban poor and villagers on overcrowded Java that
bore the brunt. ``The amount of money you need to live in squalor
has gone up tremendously,'' said Farquhar Stirling, managing
director at A.C. Nielsen's office in Jakarta. Some families had to
stop sending their children to school for a time and some Javanese
were forced to skip meals. For many though, strong family ties
provided a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were laid off went back to their villages, and
their mothers and fathers took care of them,'' said Sri Adiningsih,
an economist at Indonesia's Gadjah Mada University. The middle
class also had its own insurance. Indonesians, like most Asians,
are prodigious savers, stashing away on average roughly a quarter
of their income. During the crisis, inflation eroded the real value
of these savings, but sky-high interest rates of more than 35
percent on deposits helped soften the blow.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious consumers cut back on spending, but with their bank
balances rocketing higher, many middle class and affluent city
dwellers felt wealthy enough to maintain a comfortable existence.
An indeterminate amount of spending money, economists say, came
from a sizeable ``informal'' economy: untaxed, traditional cottage
and service industries, mattress money and gold.
</P>
<P>
   So, while by official measures spending has not yet recovered,
many retailers and wholesalers say it has. That is in part because
money that has not been spent on airline tickets or automobiles has
entered the retail sector in ways that do not always show up in the
consumer-spending figures.

 JAKARTA , Indonesia : consumer-spending figures.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Determined entrepreneurs opened up roadside food stalls, serving
everything from humble noodles to steak and cappuccino, eventually
becoming a sort of trendy alfresco Bohemia. Flea markets
proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   And even during the worst of the Indonesian crisis, when orders
to manufacturers dried up, merchandise was still selling on the
street. Now orders are skyrocketing, said Wolfgang Piroth,
president-director of the Indonesian subsidiary of Bayer AG, as
distributors scramble to rebuild their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the scene at the glitzy Plaza Senayan shopping mall
in Jakarta, Indonesia's top savers never lost their appetite for
the finer things. Instead of flying to nearby Singapore to buy
their Cartier watches, they are buying them at home, said Victor
Sassoon, whose Rubina Watch is Cartier's sole distributor in
Indonesia. ``The country is very rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Plaza Senayan's Louis Vuitton outlet, employees say they were
never at a loss for customers. ``All the time, they're buying,
buying, buying,'' said Sadaeli, the shop manager. Across the way, a
new Bulgari outlet is opening.
</P>
<P>
   All of which helps explain why retailers with razor-thin margins
like Carrefour and Promodes are able to generate the kind of
volumes they need to flourish here. Indonesians with savings are
willing to spend on products they find attractive _ especially if
the merchandise is also perceived as a good value.
</P>
<P>
   To an American visitor, a Carrefour appears little different
from an overstocked Wal-Mart with groceries. But in Jakarta, it is
a novelty: brightly lit, with wide aisles and spotless linoleum
floors. Employees will clean and filet fish, and on a recent day
rap music was playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional market nearby presents a stark contrast. Hot and
dank, the narrow alleys are littered with garbage. A cat wanders
through carrying a fish head in its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood market has its advantages. A five-kilogram bag
of rice that goes for 17,000 rupiah ($2.45) at Carrefour costs just
14,000 rupiah in the market. And at the market, where she has been
shopping for more than 30 years, ``you can bargain,'' said Isa
Salim. Sure, the hypermarkets take credit cards, but at the market,
``if I forget my purse, I can borrow money from the shopkeepers,''
Mrs. Salim added.
</P>
<P>
   On a no-haggle basis, however, a bag of sugar costs about the
same at Carrefour and eggs are cheaper there. Meat is neatly
wrapped in cellophane; at the market it is covered in flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are realizing that hygiene is important, and wet
markets are not hygienic,'' said Manglano of the Castle Group. Even
his live-in maid has switched from the market to Carrefour in
search of cleaner meat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Jakartans long ago moved on to modern local grocers
like Hero Supermarket. But Carrefour and Promodes offer greater
selections and lower prices. Analysts say the two companies
benefited from their partners' wider and more efficient
distribution networks, which has allowed them to survive with
profit margins as low as 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors say the foreign grocers have no profit margin at
all, and some accuse them of selling below cost. ``They can't make
any profit if they continue selling that cheaply,'' said Steven
Sondakh, chairman of the Indonesia Retailers Association and a
director at Hero.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Carrefour nor Promodes responded to numerous requests
for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Sondakh says as the hypermarkets encroach, they are driving
small mom-and-pop stores out of business. He is leading an effort
to get Indonesia's Parliament to pass zoning laws that will keep
superstores like Carrefour and Promodes out of downtown Jakarta,
where he says they will worsen the city's traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   The hypermarkets, which convey how the globalization of
Indonesia is continuing, are undeterred. Continent has opened three
stores and is planning a fourth; Carrefour has two and wants to
open two more, one in Jakarta and another in the nearby Javanese
city Bandung. At some point after the companies merge _ in a deal
that would create the world's second-biggest retailer after
Wal-Mart _ the two brands will become one.
</P>
<P>
   And as consumer spending revives, there will undoubtedly still
be room in the cities for traditional retailers, too, thanks to
loyal bargain-hunters like Mrs. Salim. ``For people with smaller
budgets,'' she said as she headed for the market butcher, ``this
will last.''

 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - America West, already plagued by delays, has canceled
more than 400 flights the past two weeks, stalling more than 50,000
passengers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Close to half of those cancella tions occurred Nov. 10-14, when
America West was forced to take three Boeing 757 aircraft out of
service until required maintenance was performed, company spokesman
Steve Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials would not grant
America West a short-term extension on the maintenance overhaul,
and that forced the airline to park the planes until the work could
be completed, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials in Phoenix would not comment on the America West
maintenance issues or cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the scrubbed flights, America West continues to
turn in the industry's worst on-time record, according to figures
com piled through September and released Wednesday, Nov. 17, by the
U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   America West canceled about 40 flights per day during the worst
stretch of its problems, Nov. 10-14. The airline has about 650
flights per day, and about three-fourths of those originate or end
up in Phoenix. So, Valley travelers were hurt the most by the
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Southwest Airlines, by comparison, has about 2,500 flights
per day and averaged fewer than 25 canceled flights during the past
20 days, according to spokeswoman Carol Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The series of cancellations this month at America West, roughly
double the normal rate, and the carrier's ongoing problems with
delays have angered travelers. The problems also raise questions
about the Tempe-based carrier's operations heading into the holiday
travel crush next week.
</P>
<P>
   But America West returned the 757 aircraft to service and does
not anticipate any similar problems next week, according to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back at full strength for the holidays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West would not say how much each canceled flight costs
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The company is initiating changes in maintenance operations that
are taking longer than expected to implement, but it expects to
improve its reliability over the next few months, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be too late for some passengers, who have had their
fill of cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Arnold of Scottsdale and his family were among those caught
by America West's recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's flight to San Francisco on Nov. 10 had an hourlong
weather delay. His flight to San Francisco on Saturday with his two
children, ages 2 and 3, was canceled and a substitute flight to San
Jose was delayed about 90 minutes, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   While standing in line during the delay, Arnold said, he talked
to other America West passengers, and it seemed the airline was
having problems all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was truly wondering if Amer ica West was going out of busi
ness,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip from San Fran cisco with his wife and children
on Tuesday was supposed to leave about 2:30 p.m. but didn't depart
until about 5 p.m. The Arnolds were given meal vouchers and allowed
to make a three-minute long-distance call for their troubles, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fly somebody else when I can,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance problems, which force cancellations or delays, have
been an issue at America West for several years. The airline was
fined $5 million by the FAA in July 1998 over maintenance and
safety viola tions.
</P>
<P>
   Half of that fine was waived in July by FAA officials in
Washington despite objections from Phoenix inspectors who argued
that the airline had not fully complied with an agreement to
resolve it's mainte nance problems.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also had an in-flight accident that injured four
flight attendants on Sept. 20 when a pilot quickly changed course.
A National Transportation Safety Board investi gator indicated the
pilot was react ing to a faulty ground proximity warning system
that America West knew about but had been unable to fix.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 12 months, America West has been last in on-time
performance of the 10 major air lines, with just under seven out of
10 flights arriving within 15 min utes of their scheduled arrival
time.
</P>
<P>
   Canceled flights do not count against a carrier's on-time
perform ance, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry leader, Southwest, completed 80 percent of its
flights on time over the past year, accord ing to the Department of
Transpor tation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airlines have been plagued this year by delays and cancella
tions, creating an uproar among passengers and igniting calls for
greater government oversight. The airlines, meanwhile, blame some
of the flight problems on the over loaded air traffic control
system.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the complaints from passengers keep rolling in. In
Sep tember, federal transportation offi cials received 2,732
passenger complaints about U.S. airlines, more than triple the rate
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released Wednesday by the Department of Transportation
also show that America West com pleted just 65.8 percent of its
flights on time in September, compared with No. 1 TWA at 89.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the America West spokesman, said that some of the
delays in September were due to weather problems in Phoenix and
hurricanes on the East Coast, and that the air traffic control
problems also accounted for delays. &QL;

turn in the industry's worst on-time record, according to figures
com piled through September and released Wednesday, Nov. 17, by the
U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   America West canceled about 40 flights per day during the worst
stretch of its problems, Nov. 10-14. The airline has about 650
flights per day, and about three-fourths of those originate or end
up in Phoenix. So, Valley travelers were hurt the most by the
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Southwest Airlines, by comparison, has about 2,500 flights
per day and averaged fewer than 25 canceled flights during the past
20 days, according to spokeswoman Carol Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The series of cancellations this month at America West, roughly
double the normal rate, and the carrier's ongoing problems with
delays have angered travelers. The problems also raise questions
about the Tempe-based carrier's operations heading into the holiday
travel crush next week.
</P>
<P>
   But America West returned the 757 aircraft to service and does
not anticipate any similar problems next week, according to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back at full strength for the holidays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West would not say how much each canceled flight costs
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The company is initiating changes in maintenance operations that
are taking longer than expected to implement, but it expects to
improve its reliability over the next few months, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be too late for some passengers, who have had their
fill of cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Arnold of Scottsdale and his family were among those caught
by America West's recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's flight to San Francisco on Nov. 10 had an hourlong
weather delay. His flight to San Francisco on Saturday with his two
children, ages 2 and 3, was canceled and a substitute flight to San
Jose was delayed about 90 minutes, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   While standing in line during the delay, Arnold said, he talked
to other America West passengers, and it seemed the airline was
having problems all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was truly wondering if Amer ica West was going out of busi
ness,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip from San Fran cisco with his wife and children
on Tuesday was supposed to leave about 2:30 p.m. but didn't depart
until about 5 p.m. The Arnolds were given meal vouchers and allowed
to make a three-minute long-distance call for their troubles, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fly somebody else when I can,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance problems, which force cancellations or delays, have
been an issue at America West for several years. The airline was
fined $5 million by the FAA in July 1998 over maintenance and
safety viola tions.
</P>
<P>
   Half of that fine was waived in July by FAA officials in
Washington despite objections from Phoenix inspectors who argued
that the airline had not fully complied with an agreement to
resolve it's mainte nance problems.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also had an in-flight accident that injured four
flight attendants on Sept. 20 when a pilot quickly changed course.
A National Transportation Safety Board investi gator indicated the
pilot was react ing to a faulty ground proximity warning system
that America West knew about but had been unable to fix.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 12 months, America West has been last in on-time
performance of the 10 major air lines, with just under seven out of
10 flights arriving within 15 min utes of their scheduled arrival
time.
</P>
<P>
   Canceled flights do not count against a carrier's on-time
perform ance, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry leader, Southwest, completed 80 percent of its
flights on time over the past year, accord ing to the Department of
Transpor tation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airlines have been plagued this year by delays and cancella
tions, creating an uproar among passengers and igniting calls for
greater government oversight. The airlines, meanwhile, blame some
of the flight problems on the over loaded air traffic control
system.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the complaints from passengers keep rolling in. In
Sep tember, federal transportation offi cials received 2,732
passenger complaints about U.S. airlines, more than triple the rate
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released Wednesday by the Department of Transportation
also show that America West com pleted just 65.8 percent of its
flights on time in September, compared with No. 1 TWA at 89.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the America West spokesman, said that some of the
delays in September were due to weather problems in Phoenix and
hurricanes on the East Coast, and that the air traffic control
problems also accounted for delays. &QL;

DEFAULTERS ARE ARRESTED IN PAKISTAN

<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The military government, making good on
threats to jail people who have defaulted on millions of dollars in
bank loans, began arresting some of the nation's wealthiest
citizens Wednesday, including senior executives, politicians and a
retired air marshal.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law enacted overnight, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who came
to power in a coup on Oct. 12, has set up a National Accountability
Bureau with the power to place willful defaulters behind bars for
14 years. Convicted offenders also face the seizure of assets.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning, hours after a heavily publicized deadline
to pay up on bad loans, authorities began a national sweep. Among
21 influential people taken into custody were Anwar Saifullah Khan
and Nawaz Khokhar, both ministers in Benazir Bhutto's government
from 1995 to 1997, and Islamuddin Sheikh, briefly a minister under
the recently ousted government of Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   A televised bulletin also said Ms. Bhutto and Sharif were wanted
on charges of corruption. Ms. Bhutto, who lives in London, already
faces a five-year term on an earlier conviction. Sharif has been
held in a secret location since he was pushed from power.
</P>
<P>
   Saifur Rehman, a high-profile politician who ran Sharif's own
anti-corruption campaign, and Shahbaz Sharif, former chief minister
of Punjab, have also been named in the defaults. They, too, have
been in detention since the coup.
</P>
<P>
   These people ``have committed a crime against this nation,
against this country,'' Interior Minister Moinudeen Haider, a
retired general, said. ``Obviously, we have to be tough with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Toughness is what Musharraf has in mind, asserting that the
eventual return to democracy has to be preceded by a war on
corruption. Banks are owed $4.2 billion in unpaid loans, much of
which is thought to be cash borrowed with little or no collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Defaulters had 30 days to make good on the loans. Few did so,
though the number is now expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people are talking, and they are agreeing to submit what
they have taken from the national wealth,'' Finance Minister
Shaukat Aziz said at a news conference. ``No one will be spared.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers, asked to supply lists of defaulters, have been asked to
make distinctions between willful defaulters and those whose debts
have resulted from business reversals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, special courts will be convened for the
corruption cases. The proceedings are not to last beyond 30 days.
One appeal would be permitted.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ JFS International Inc., a Lithonia, Ga.-based KFC
Corp. franchisee, has consolidated its operations in Georgia by
buying four restaurants. The four newly acquired units in Georgia
bring the number of JFS holdings to eight. Beth Redford, a KFC
spokeswoman, said the owners of JFS, Milton and Judy Sanders, sold
three restaurants in West Virginia and Ohio. They then bought four
company-owned units on Bankhead Highway, Austell Road, Canton Road
and Powder Springs Road. The Sanderses are part of a partnership of
other minority owners that operate 11 KFC restaurants in Knoxville,
Tenn. Redford said KFC Corp., a unit of Tricon Global Restaurants
Inc., based in Louisville, Ky., plans to sell 200 company-owned
stores next year. An undetermined number are in Georgia. Minority
franchisees will be given the opportunity to make first offers on a
fourth of those restaurants.

CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT AGREE IN PRINCIPLE ON BUDGET CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Republican leaders in Congress
agreed in principle on Wednesday to an across-the-board spending
cut to seal a deal on the overdue federal budget, then argued
fiercely over how to impose it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, all sides said a deal was imminent. Rep. C.W. Bill
Young, R-Fla., who is chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said his party expected the dispute to be settled within
hours and the final spending bill to be filed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Their dispute was ``like when you go to buy a house, and you've
agreed on the price, and all that's left is a disagreement over the
color of the trim on the tool shed,'' said Robert Stevenson, a
senior aide to Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. the chairman of the
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The across-the-board cut would be about .33 percent of the $610
billion budget for federal agencies, and would yield about $1.3
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement threatened to undo the final budget deal, even
though both sides had said earlier on Wednesday that an accord was
only hours away. Also potentially standing in the way of a final
agreement is another dispute over federal price rules for dairy
farms, an issue so crucial that the combatants are threatening to
shut down the Senate, block any final budget bill and keep Congress
in session well into December.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., in an effort to protect his state's
23,000 dairy farmers from legislation favoring milk producers in
the Northeast, has placed a formal hold on the final spending
package. The budget cannot pass, and Congress cannot adjourn, until
Kohl lifts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take the dairy out of the appropriations
package,'' said the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
``It's got to come out. It will blow it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, the White House budget director, said the dairy
dispute was so dire that it ``raises a real risk of a government
shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that problem, a budget agreement is still one handshake
away.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want nearly $7 billion in spending cuts and
savings from the White House. That would allow the Republicans to
say that their spending bills will not dip into Social Security
surpluses, a political point they have made daily, since spring,
but still have not formally fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The money would ``help them fill the hole they created'' with
new programs they wanted, along with new spending that the White
House fought for and won, Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over an across-the-board cut is a fine-print feud
over who controls the budget-cutting scalpel _ high-level
administration officials, as the Democrats want, or mid-level
budget officers at federal agencies, as Republicans want _ and
whether certain programs can be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides described this as an issue of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said: ``It still matters how it's done. If it goes
across-the- board cut with no flexibility, that would lead to very
foolish results.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democrats demanded that the cuts should be ``a
targeted reduction,'' under the control of the president and his
aides, and focused on specific programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking semantics,'' said the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``If it exempts personnel, whatever, you could
then call that some sort of targeted savings. O.K., I'm all right
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted on cutting all federal programs more or
less equally. They would let budget officials at each agency wield
the knife. They could protect individual programs from any cut.
Other programs could be cut by up to 5 percent, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM(
</P>
<P>
   The day's war or words began when the speaker of the House,
Dennis Hastert, said President Clinton had agreed to an
across-the-board cut of 0.38 percent in the budget, which is now 47
days overdue.
</P>
<P>
   It dragged on all day.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was seeking every last new dollar it could
extract from Congress before shaking hands, including $100 million
for a program for disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House brought nearly $7 billion to the bargaining
table on Wednesday, enough to cover the Republican's demands
without an across-the-board cut, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   About half that sum would come in a onetime transfer from the
Federal Reserve's portfolio of government securities _ a
bookkeeping device, since the money belongs to the government
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The rest would come from delaying government paychecks for
military personnel and many civilian employees for about 48 hours,
until just after Oct. 1, 2000, _ the start of the next fiscal year.
This accounting maneuver, a variation on a theme first proposed by
the Republicans, would not actually save money, but simply shift
about $3.2 billion into next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Clinton vetoed a 0.97 percent across-the-board
cut that Congress passed, almost exclusively with Republican votes,
calling it a ``blind'' and ``mindless'' exercise. To make such a
cut seem sensible to Democrats, the White House insisted more
``flexibility'' to protect some programs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But evening came with no agreement. Lew and the White House
chief of staff, John Podesta, left the Senate, and the Republicans
began writing the final version of the spending bills by
themselves, talking with the White House by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Several Senate Republicans called the cut largely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small gesture,'' said Lott. ``Both sides get all caught
up in symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how small, an across-the-board cut was a matter of
principle for the party's conservatives in the House, who on
Wednesday wore big buttons on their lapels saying they had
``stopped the raid on Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   This stance, the Democrats insisted, was pure political
sloganeering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This symbolism is important to the Republican side,'' said
Lew.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to two Democratic senators are demands for
favors for their home states.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia is threatening to filibuster the
final spending bills to protect his state's coal miners from a
federal court ruling barring the dumping of wastes into valley
streams. Byrd has drafted last-minute legislation that would stop
the court ruling from taking effect for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which first supported Bryd's effort on behalf
of his state, then opposed it and said it would veto any bill
containing it, appeared to be taking a noncommital stance on the
issue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Kohl and the dairy dispute, which is holding up
the process of writing the final budget bill that will wrap 5 of
the year's 13 spending measures into one package.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy problem dismays most members of Congress. When the
House majority leader, Dick Armey, R-Texas, began talking about it
on the House floor, members began to moo.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the House approved a measure that lets a system
keeping the price of milk in New England artificially high to
remain in place for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has formally placed a hold on every piece of legislation
pending in the Senate, including the budget bill, to stop that
measure from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw politics _ that's what originated it, and that's what
keeps in going,'' Kohl said in an interview on Wednesday. He
promised to ``do everything I can'' to keep the cartel from being
extended.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a provision of a 1996 farm bill that allowed the
formation of a cartel, called the Northeast Dairy Compact, which
puts a floor on the price of milk in the six New England states.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is to keep milk from Midwestern dairies out of New
England. Politicians from New England say this prevents hundreds if
not thousands of dairy farmers in their states from going under.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl calls it an attack on Wisconsin's 23,000 dairy farmers, and
a program ``diametrically opposed to everything this country stands
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Authority for the cartel expired Sept. 30, at the end of the
last fiscal year, although a judge's order has kept the pricing
mechanism in place temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the House voted, 285 to 140, to extend the system.
Midwesterners mounted a filibuster against the measure in the
Senate. A 53-47 vote to cut off debate indicated that a majority
favored the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   With those votes in mind, Hastert and Lott agreed this week to
attach a two-year extension of the cartel to one of the final
must-pass spending bills. The measure would also prevent the
secretary of agriculture from imposing a new national milk-pricing
system that would benefit dairies in the Midwest.

BRAVES' CHIPPER JONES WINS NATIONAL LEAGUE MVP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baseball Writers' Association of America confirmed Wednesday
what New York Mets fans _ and certainly Mets pitchers _ have known
since mid-September: that Atlanta's Chipper Jones is the National
League's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Jones all but locked up the landslide vote _ he received 29 of
32 first-place votes _ when he almost single-handedly clinched the
National League East title for the Braves and nearly prevented the
Mets from making the playoffs by belting four home runs in a
three-game sweep that began a seven-game losing streak for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves led the division race by just one game over the Mets
when the series began. When it ended, the Braves were a comfortable
four games ahead and on their way to another World Series, and the
Mets were reeling toward oblivion. The Mets ultimately recovered _
they broke the losing streak with a victory over Atlanta a week
later _ and stretched the Braves to six games in the National
League Championship Series, largely by pitching around Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those four home runs were huge,'' Jones said. ``Any time I've
read anything over the last couple of months pertaining to the MVP
race, they point to that Mets series. I was fortunate to be seeing
the ball really well at that time. Playing against a New York team,
where you get the press you get in New York, I'd like to think my
name was on the map before that, but that jump-started
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months before, Shea Stadium had started its own
``M-V-P'' chant for third baseman Robin Ventura and second baseman
Edgardo Alfonzo. Ventura (.301, 32 home runs, 120 runs batted in)
finished sixth in the voting, Mike Piazza (.303, 40, 124) was
seventh and Alfonzo (.304, 27, 108) was eighth. Houston's Jeff
Bagwell finished second and Arizona's Matt Williams was third.
</P>
<P>
   But midway through the season, Jones became the front-runner for
the award. The Braves had been decimated by injuries to their top
offensive players all season. Many observers thought that when
catcher Javy Lopez went down as the season entered its final two
months that the Mets had a perfect opportunity to finally win the
East.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones had worked on hitting right-handed with Don Baylor,
the Braves' hitting coach this past season. More comfortable from
the right side of the plate than he had ever been in his career _
something Manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets discovered when Jones
hit homers from both sides of the plate in the first game of the
sweep _ Jones belted 45 home runs (third in the league behind Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa) and hit .319 with 110 RBI, 116 runs, 25
steals and 126 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was also third in the league in walks, fourth in slugging
percentage (.633), on-base percentage (.441) and total bases
(.359), seventh in runs and 10th in batting. He was particularly
impressive during the second half of the season, hitting 30 homers
and driving in 79 runs after June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Jones became the fifth Brave to win the award. He joins Bob
Elliott (1947), Hank Aaron (1970), Dale Murphy (1982 and '83) and
Terry Pendleton (1991).
</P>
<P>
   Jones has one year left on his contract with Atlanta. If he does
not sign before the end of next season, he would be part of next
year's extraordinary class of free agents. But Jones said Wednesday
that he expects talks to begin with the Braves soon, and he hopes
to have an agreement worked out this season.

HEWLETT-PACKARD RESULTS BEAT FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After warning last month of an earnings
shortfall, Hewlett-Packard Co. reported results Wednesday that beat
analysts' revised estimates by two cents, not including charges
related to the spinoff of Agilent Technologies, its test and
measurement business.
</P>
<P>
   Carleton S. Fiorina, who joined Hewlett-Packard in July as
president and chief executive, said she was setting a goal for the
year of 12 percent to 15 percent growth in revenue and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hewlett-Packard said it had raised the price and the
number of shares of Agilent it intends to offer to the public.
Agilent, based in Palo Alto, Calif., now plans to sell a 15 percent
stake, or 65 million shares. The shares will be sold in an initial
public offering for $30, which would give the company a market
value of $13.4 billion. Last month, the company said it planned to
sell 57 million shares at $22. The revised deal would raise $1.95
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard announced its results after the close of the
market. Its shares closed at $77.4375, up $1.3125, on the New York
Stock Exchange, but still down 35 percent from their 52-week high
of $118.43. Analysts said Hewlett-Packard shares were likely to
move up now that investors could focus on future growth rather than
this quarter's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations had been talked down, annihilated, dashed,
but now we see Carly charging employees with a growth rate of 12 to
15 percent,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co. ``Of course they have to make those numbers, but Carly's a
smart person. She knows how Wall Street works. She's not setting
these high numbers for herself to get a done-day jolt. She has to
think there is reality behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   For its fourth quarter, which ended Oct. 31, Hewlett-Packard
reported earnings of $760 million, or 73 cents a diluted share, up
7 percent from the comparable period a year ago; revenue rose 10
percent, to $11.36 billion. The quarter's earnings reflect
spinoff-related costs of 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Without those charges, Hewlett-Packard had earnings of 75 cents
a diluted share. Analysts had expected Hewlett-Packard to earn 73
cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the reduced expectations, it looks like a solid quarter,
but there's still work to be done,'' said Steven Milunovich, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenues up 10 percent looks like what they were talking about
early in the quarter,'' before warning on Oct. 1 that earnings
would fall short, he said. ``Strong printer sales certainly had
something to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Ms. Fiorina said that after
warning analysts to expect a weaker quarter she had challenged
Hewlett-Packard employees to produce a strong October and they had
risen to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are capable of far more than our prior achievements would
indicate,'' she said. ``We need to set our goals high and stretch
to achieve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, at the Comdex computer trade show in Las
Vegas, Ms. Fiorina announced a $200 million global brand campaign
and a new logo to reflect what she called ``the new H.P.'' The new
logo uses the initials, without spelling out the company name, and
promotes the word invent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a company founded by inventors, fueled by invention and
adept at reinventing ourselves,'' she said Wednesday. ``But as we
look in the mirror we know we have been squandering the H.P.
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard now reports earnings on a continuing operations
basis, separating the contribution of the business units that will
be spun off as Agilent.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Agilent reported revenue of $2.4 billion, an
increase of 23 percent over the same period last year. Net earnings
for the quarter were $146 million compared to a net loss of $51
million for the same quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, including the Agilent contribution,
Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $3.49 billion, or $3.34 a
diluted share, up 19 percent from fiscal 1998. Revenue rose 7
percent, to $42.37 billion, from $39.42 billion in the prior year.

 &HT;    Winning Jewish voters a key test for Democrats
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia is not destined to be decisive in the battle
between Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, so
Wednesday afforded a rare opportunity to see both Democratic
presidential candidates in town on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Although they gave different sorts of presentations, both Gore
and Bradley spoke to the United Jewish Communities' first General
Assembly in the United States _ an interesting setting in which to
consider how the Democratic rivals stand.
</P>
<P>
   While Jewish voters may not play quite as central a role for
Democratic strategists as they have in the past, they are still
important to the party, not least because their sentiments are one
barometer of a much larger demographic. Many people in the
electorate, like these Jewish voters, are traditionally Democratic
but increasingly independent, more suburban and affluent than their
parents but more nervous about their identity. Winning over these
voters will be decisive in the struggle for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the Jewish group may be unfamiliar, because it is
itself the product of an identity crisis over the past few years.
The UJC is a combination of three older organizations, brought
together under the leadership of Canadian businessman Charles
Bronfman. It may not have been entirely accidental that the Maple
Leaf was displayed between the United States and Israeli flags at
Wednesday's convocation.
</P>
<P>
   On matters such as relations with Israel and hate crimes
legislation the two candidates can make competitive claims, but the
campaign for these voters' affections revolves at this stage around
broad matters of style _ not only personal style but what that says
about where each candidate wants to lead the party.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of the kinds of changes that have been necessary
within their religious and charitable community, these Democrats
may be looking at the two contenders with an eye to which can take
on a similar task in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Knicks hero and New Jersey senator, Bradley has a
natural appeal for many Jews from the Northeast, but Gore has had
the vice presidency in which to prove himself a ``strong and
unyielding supporter,'' as he put it Wednesday, of the country's
``unshakable'' relationship with Israel. The Tennessee native even
had a list of supposed Jewish country song hits, including ``I've
Got My Foot on the Glass, Now Where Are You,'' and ``The Second
Time She Said Shalom I Knew She Meant Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience he had ``so many friends in this group,''
he could walk up one aisle and down the other saying hello to them.
He went to some lengths to make a personal connection, taking
microphone in hand _ which created temporary havoc with the sound
system _ and walking in front of the podium to tell the inspiring
story of his mother, an early feminist, and his father, a crusader
for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   It was much the same schtick he would have done with retirees in
New Hampshire, but it was striking to see so open a courtship in
front of the larger group Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spoke Wednesday night in a smaller but very crowded
room. He talked about the country's need for ``a particular kind of
leader in the world today,'' and told of his leadership in standing
down the Saudis over increasing the strategic oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   His audience listened carefully, as they had to Gore. Many of
these Democrats seemed undecided still, as the race enters a more
feverish phase.

   U.S. PLANS TO CRACK DOWN ON IRS AGENT MISDEEDS
</P>
<P>
   Urged by Congress to get tough on abuse of taxpayers, a new team
of Treasury agents plans a sharp increase in investigations of IRS
employees for misconduct. Indeed, the number of cases expected to
be opened against IRS employees will soon nearly equal the number
of cases of suspected of tax crimes. The IRS goal has stirred
worries even within the inspector general's own staff that
investigators are being forced to search for far more misdeeds than
may exist.
</P>
<P>
   SCRAMBLE FOR TECHNOLOGY WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the booming technology-based economy, companies'
long-standing scramble for qualified technical workers has taken on
an air of desperation. A severe shortage of engineers who design
hardware and software and create Web pages has led companies and
their recruiters to try all sorts of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ETHICS INQUIRY SOUGHT FOR RUBIN
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of consumer and community groups has called for a
government ethics investigation into former Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin's decision to accept employment from Citigroup, the
financial services conglomerate, contending the move presents an
``undeniable appearance of impropriety.'' Rubin said that his
decision to join Citigroup was entirely unrelated to anything he
worked on while in government.

   GERMANY STAYING OUT OF PHONE BID
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from recent past reactions in Germany, political
leaders have not tried to intervene as Vodafone Airtouch of Britain
attempts the biggest hostile takeover ever _ a $100-plus billion
bid for Mannesmann, the telecommunications giant.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's board, scheduled to meet Thursday, will consider
paying as much as $125 billion in its hostile bid for Mannesmann.

   STOCKS SLIDE ON INFLATION WORRY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks stumbled as oil prices neared three-year highs,
rekindling inflation fears. The Dow Jones industrial average closed
down 49.24 points, to 10,883.09. The Nasdaq composite index ended
with a loss of 26.13 points, at 3,269.39. The Standard and Poor's
500-stock index slipped 9.36 points, to 1,410.71, after setting a
record on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices fell for the second consecutive session as the
yield on the 30-year issue rose to 6.13 percent from 6.06 percent.
</P>

   BT ALEX. BROWN SETTLES SEC CASE
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said that BT Alex. Brown,
now a part of Deutsche Bank, had agreed to pay $15.3 million to
settle allegations that the brokerage firm defrauded the federal
government and the state of Pennsylvania in municipal bond
transactions in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   HEWLETT PROFIT BEATS ESTIMATES
</P>
<P>
   After warning last month of an earnings shortfall,
Hewlett-Packard posted results that beat analysts' revised
estimates. Carleton S. Fiorina, who joined Hewlett-Packard in July
as president and chief executive, said she was setting a goal for
the year of 12 percent to 15 percent growth in revenue and
earnings. Before the results were announced, shares of
Hewlett-Packard closed at $78, up $1.875.

FIELDS AIRCRAFT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Fields Aircraft Spares Inc. has filed for Chapter 11
federal bankruptcy protection, the latest in a series of setbacks
for the once-growing company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Alan Fields said he plans to meet face
to face with customers and vendors, explaining his intention to
stay in business and emerge from bankruptcy protection a stronger
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a financial breather so we can step back and
make some changes,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company is given
protection from creditors in order to reorganize its business.
Fields stressed that he does not intend to go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which specializes in production and installation of
aircraft interiors, had structured its business plan based on an
expectation of increasing profits and revenues, Fields said. ``We
expanded expecting the growth to continue,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company's financial troubles mounted over the past
year due to a general slowdown in cosmetic maintenance by airlines,
according to Fields.
</P>
<P>
   The company contracted last month with a consulting firm
specializing in keeping firms out of bankruptcy. But Fields was
forced to halt trading in its stock last week on the Nasdaq stock
exchange after the exchange said it needed more information to
prepare for a scheduled delisting hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, scheduled for Dec. 2, will be held to determine
whether Fields Aircraft meets Nasdaq's minimum net asset
requirement for continued listing.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Aune, Fields' chief financial officer, said in a statement
the company intends to use the protection from creditors to
restructure its bank credit line and to get out of a long-term
lease it signed on a plant in Simi Valley that is too large for its
scaled-back operation. Fields moved its manufacturing in September
from the plant in Simi Valley, about 35 miles northwest of downtown
Los Angeles, to a smaller one in Monrovia, about 19 miles northeast
of downtown L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is working out a deal with its bond holders to
swap the debt for an equity stake in the company, Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has 90 employees, employed 245 at its peak.
It reported a net loss for the first half of 1999 of $1.9 million,
or 75 cents per share, on sales of $10.7 million.

ARABIC SPEAKERS URGE CAUTION IN INTERPRETING PILOT'S WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Tenn., N.C.)  (Duplication warning: also moved in `a' category; with
AIRCRASH-RDP) 
(th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I put my trust in God,'' the voice repeated on the recorder
that was recently recovered from the underwater wreckage of
EgyptAir's fatal Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic prayer uttered in Arabic, ``Tawakilt ala Allah,''
has prompted some investigators to suspect that a crew member may
have caused the Boeing 767 jetliner to crash into the Atlantic
Ocean near Nantucket on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Islamic scholars and other Arabic speakers caution that the
phrase is so common in the Middle East that it carries no
particularly ominous overtones. The Arabic spoken by Egyptians and
others, they say, is peppered with prayerful affirmations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere utterance of this kind of phrase would in no way
indicate criminal behavior or criminal intent,'' said Ibrahim
Hooper, the national communications director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group in Washington.
Someone bent on destruction, Hooper said, would have far stronger
Arabic phrases to draw upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an information gap when it comes to Islam and Muslims,
and this gap is easily filled with ignorance,'' Hooper said. ``If
the inference was by a Christian pilot who said, `God help me,' we
wouldn't even have this conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Rabbat, a professor of Islamic architecture at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained, ``Religious
Muslims usually say it even for the slightest of beginnings, such
as turning the ignition in a car or putting the key in a keyhole to
open a door.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions are used often in Egypt today, said Rabbat, who
was born in Syria but visits Egypt often.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is involved in practically every single decision,'' Rabbat
said, ``and if a person was religious, he would say this even if he
was entering the cockpit'' of the fated jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud el-Azzazzay, a travel agent in New York City who
formerly worked for EgyptAir, called such a prayer commonplace.
``We say it probably 200 or more times a day,'' Azzazzay said.
``This is what God recommended us to do. It means all my future is
in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the meaning of the phrase, which is
transliterated into various English spellings, lies at the heart of
EgyptAir's request that the American investigators step back and
let the Egyptians interpret the reference to God themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And confusion about the phrase and its meaning has only been
deepened by the fact that it has been reported differently by
different newspapers and television networks, each of which has
been relying on sources involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my decision now. I put my faith in God's hands,'' was
the translation of the phrase offered by USA Today and several
television networks. And other daily newspapers variously reported
``Tawakilt ala Allah'' or ``La Allahu lil Allah wa Mohammed rasul
Allah,'' which means ``There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is
Allah's messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Gwynne, an associate professor of Islamic and Arabic
studies at the University of Tennessee, said that the bumper
sticker on her car bears the phrase, which she transliterated as
``tawakkalt ala Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may indicate that the pilot had taken drastic
action,'' she said, ``it might also indicate that he had done the
last thing he could to save the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent J. Cornell, an associate professor of religion at Duke
University who has worked in North Africa, said that the Arabic
declaration has some significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically used to initiate something, if you're embarking
on a situation where you don't know the outcome,'' Cornell said.
The meaning of the phrase, he emphasized, would depend upon the
context in which it was used.
</P>
<P>
   Haka Arafa, a native Egyptian who works in Washington for the
Voice of America's Arabic branch, said that the Arabic language is
full of prayerful expressions that tend to get cited out of habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say it as soon as I get into my car to pick my daughter up
from school,'' Ms. Arafa said. ``I also say it when I start cooking
in the kitchen and when I arrive at work and start my
assignments.''

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Again, America is angry and confused and, again, it's
our fault.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem isn't that newspapers and TV broadcasts are filled
with bad news, but that reporters don't recognize good news when it
hap pens, as it did Tuesday, Nov. 17, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson
got himself arrested in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has spent most of the past few weeks in Decatur. He said
after being released from the slammer, ``It's an honor to be
arrested for a righteous cause.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in America when ``righteous cause'' meant
eliminating large-scale discrimination, segrega tion and
disfranchisement.
</P>
<P>
   A ``righteous cause'' was marching through Jackson, Miss., after
crimi nal thugs murdered activist Medgar Evers.
</P>
<P>
   A ``righteous cause'' was the Civil Rights Act, the Voting
Rights Act, the establishment of the Equal Em ployment Opportunity
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the final days of the millennium, ``righteous cause''
means defending a handful of punks who got into a fight at a high
school football game.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this is reported as bad news, when clearly it
isn't. &QL; 
ARM-IN-ARM &QL; 
Jesse Jackson, who walked arm-in-arm with the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., now walks arm-in-arm with the parents of boys expelled
for participating in a near riot during an athletic contest between
the Eisen hower Panthers and the MacArthur Generals.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower won, by the way, 25-18.
</P>
<P>
   The game was in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many days afterward, the local school board decided to
expel for two years seven African-Ameri can youngsters involved in
the fight ing. One of the students withdrew from school during
expulsion hear ings. Three face criminal charges in the incident.
</P>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Again, America is angry and confused and, again, it's
our fault.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem isn't that newspapers and TV broadcasts are filled
with bad news, but that reporters don't recognize good news when it
hap pens, as it did Tuesday, Nov. 17, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson
got himself arrested in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has spent most of the past few weeks in Decatur. He said
after being released from the slammer, ``It's an honor to be
arrested for a righteous cause.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in America when ``righteous cause'' meant
eliminating large-scale discrimination, segrega tion and
disfranchisement.
</P>
<P>
   A ``righteous cause'' was marching through Jackson, Miss., after
crimi nal thugs murdered activist Medgar Evers.
</P>
<P>
   A ``righteous cause'' was the Civil Rights Act, the Voting
Rights Act, the establishment of the Equal Em ployment Opportunity
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the final days of the millennium, ``righteous cause''
means defending a handful of punks who got into a fight at a high
school football game.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this is reported as bad news, when clearly it
isn't. &QL; 
ARM-IN-ARM &QL; 
Jesse Jackson, who walked arm-in-arm with the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., now walks arm-in-arm with the parents of boys expelled
for participating in a near riot during an athletic contest between
the Eisen hower Panthers and the MacArthur Generals.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower won, by the way, 25-18.
</P>
<P>
   The game was in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many days afterward, the local school board decided to
expel for two years seven African-Ameri can youngsters involved in
the fight ing. One of the students withdrew from school during
expulsion hear ings. Three face criminal charges in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Students and parents complained. The local representative of

CANCELED FLIGHTS ANGERS AMWEST PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - America West, already plagued by delays, has canceled
more than 400 flights the past two weeks, stalling more than 50,000
passengers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Close to half of those cancella tions occurred Nov. 10-14, when
America West was forced to take three Boeing 757 aircraft out of
service until required maintenance was performed, company spokesman
Steve Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials would not grant
America West a short-term extension on the maintenance overhaul,
and that forced the airline to park the planes until the work could
be completed, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials in Phoenix would not comment on the America West
maintenance issues or cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the scrubbed flights, America West continues to
turn in the industry's worst on-time record, according to figures
com piled through September and released Wednesday, Nov. 17, by the
U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   America West canceled about 40 flights per day during the worst
stretch of its problems, Nov. 10-14. The airline has about 650
flights per day, and about three-fourths of those originate or end
up in Phoenix. So, Valley travelers were hurt the most by the
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Southwest Airlines, by comparison, has about 2,500 flights
per day and averaged fewer than 25 canceled flights during the past
20 days, according to spokeswoman Carol Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The series of cancellations this month at America West, roughly
double the normal rate, and the carrier's ongoing problems with
delays have angered travelers. The problems also raise questions
about the Tempe-based carrier's operations heading into the holiday
travel crush next week.
</P>
<P>
   But America West returned the 757 aircraft to service and does
not anticipate any similar problems next week, according to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back at full strength for the holidays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West would not say how much each canceled flight costs
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The company is initiating changes in maintenance operations that
are taking longer than expected to implement, but it expects to
improve its reliability over the next few months, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be too late for some passengers, who have had their
fill of cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Arnold of Scottsdale and his family were among those caught
by America West's recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's flight to San Francisco on Nov. 10 had an hourlong
weather delay. His flight to San Francisco on Saturday with his two
children, ages 2 and 3, was canceled and a substitute flight to San
Jose was delayed about 90 minutes, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   While standing in line during the delay, Arnold said, he talked
to other America West passengers, and it seemed the airline was
having problems all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was truly wondering if Amer ica West was going out of busi
ness,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip from San Fran cisco with his wife and children
on Tuesday was supposed to leave about 2:30 p.m. but didn't depart
until about 5 p.m. The Arnolds were given meal vouchers and allowed
to make a three-minute long-distance call for their troubles, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fly somebody else when I can,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance problems, which force cancellations or delays, have
been an issue at America West for several years. The airline was
fined $5 million by the FAA in July 1998 over maintenance and
safety viola tions.
</P>
<P>
   Half of that fine was waived in July by FAA officials in
Washington despite objections from Phoenix inspectors who argued
that the airline had not fully complied with an agreement to
resolve it's mainte nance problems.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also had an in-flight accident that injured four
flight attendants on Sept. 20 when a pilot quickly changed course.
A National Transportation Safety Board investi gator indicated the
pilot was react ing to a faulty ground proximity warning system
that America West knew about but had been unable to fix.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 12 months, America West has been last in on-time
performance of the 10 major air lines, with just under seven out of
10 flights arriving within 15 min utes of their scheduled arrival
time.
</P>
<P>
   Canceled flights do not count against a carrier's on-time
perform ance, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry leader, Southwest, completed 80 percent of its
flights on time over the past year, accord ing to the Department of
Transpor tation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airlines have been plagued this year by delays and cancella
tions, creating an uproar among passengers and igniting calls for
greater government oversight. The airlines, meanwhile, blame some
of the flight problems on the over loaded air traffic control
system.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the complaints from passengers keep rolling in. In
Sep tember, federal transportation offi cials received 2,732
passenger complaints about U.S. airlines, more than triple the rate
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released Wednesday by the Department of Transportation
also show that America West com pleted just 65.8 percent of its
flights on time in September, compared with No. 1 TWA at 89.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the America West spokesman, said that some of the
delays in September were due to weather problems in Phoenix and
hurricanes on the East Coast, and that the air traffic control
problems also accounted for delays. &QL;

JURORS BEGIN DELIBERATING IN TEXAS MAN'S DRAGGING DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The 1998 torture slaying of a disabled black man
``already has been avenged'' by guilty verdicts against two other
white men, and justice would be served if jurors acquit Shawn Allen
Berry, his attorney told an all-white jury as he closed his case
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in the capital murder trial began deliberating shortly
after noon, and requested numerous transcripts, Berry's
blood-stained clothing and other evidence, leading prosecutors to
predict there would not be a quick verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of seven women and five men have a choice of finding
Berry, 24, guilty of capital murder, guilty of murder or not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   An alternate juror, released from duty before deliberations
began, said he would have voted for a capital murder verdict.
George Coleman of nearby Buna said that both Berry and his fiancee,
ex-beauty queen Christy Marcontell, lacked credibility on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Berry admitted giving James Byrd Jr., 49, a ride on June 7,
1998, during a night of beer drinking and cruising for girls, and
that he initially lied about his actions.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted Tuesday that he did not kill the disabled
African-American. After an initial attempt to help Byrd, Berry said
he stood by, paralyzed by fear, as John William King Jr. and
Russell Lawrence Brewer beat Byrd, chained him behind Berry's
pickup and then dragged him to death along a bumpy rural road.
</P>
<P>
   King, 25, and Brewer, 32, who belonged to the same white
supremacist gang in prison, were sentenced to death earlier this
year. Unlike them, Berry had no racist affiliations. Numerous
defense witnesses, including three African-Americans, said he was
not hateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Byrd Jr.'s murder has been avenged,'' defense attorney
Joseph Columbus ``Lum'' Hawthorn said in a closing statement. ``The
two people who killed James Byrd Jr. were tried, convicted and
sentenced to death. ... Justice has been served.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Berry knew his childhood friend Bill King had come back
from prison a racist, Berry viewed him as a boastful blowhard who
never had followed through on threats, Hawthorn said. And neither
King nor Brewer had shown any violent tendencies, he said,
explaining why his client would invite a black man into his truck
with two avowed white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason for Shawn Berry to believe that Bill King
was anything other than a bag of wind,'' the attorney said.
``Nobody took Bill King seriously, not until this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray insisted that Berry not only
gave Byrd a ride but was driving when the black man was dragged to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he picked up James Byrd, he knew it was wrong,'' Gray
said. ``It went from drinking beer and picking up girls to some
other kind of fun. ... Whoever had his hand on the wheel was having
fun. ... He was just as active as the other two. Really, he's more
active than the other two.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial, Gray suggested that King was starting a hate
group in Jasper and that Byrd's slaying was an initiation rite,
possibly for Berry. During the trial, Gray said Berry was not a
racist, but a young man out for a deadly form of thrill-seeking on
June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three people who participated, and that man was the
worst of the bunch on that particular night,'' Assistant District
Attorney Pat Hardy said. ``Because as sick as their beliefs were,
at least King and Brewer believed in something. Shawn Berry did all
of this for nothing but the fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Motive aside, the prosecution hammered away at Berry, citing his
own statements, acknowledged lies and evidence collected in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Shawn Berry's truck, Shawn Berry's chain,'' Gray said.
``It was Shawn Berry that made the decision to pick James Byrd up.
Shawn Berry made the decision to drive out to a remote area. Shawn
Berry has got blood on his boots, he's got blood on his pants, and
he's got blood on his shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Bill King had one drop on his sandal.
Russell Brewer had one drop on his tennis shoes,` the district
attorney said. ``Shawn Berry has got more blood on him than any one
of the three.''
</P>
<P>
   But the defense suggested that Berry got blood on his clothes by
accident while he and King sprayed down the pickup and logging
chain at a carwash the afternoon after the dragging death.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, a cinema manager, showed little emotion throughout the
six-day trial. And although he said he was sorry he did not
intervene more effectively to stop the slaying, he made no
expression of regret for Byrd's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, his 23-year-old fiancee, a former Miss Newton
County, sat next to him. His biological father, whom he hadn't met
until just before the trial, flew in from Ohio and sat in the first
row with other friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Byrd sat on the other side of the courtroom.
Several of Byrd's sisters said they considered Berry at least as
culpable as King and Brewer because he picked up their brother
knowing that King and Brewer were Ku Klux Klansmen.

 &HT;    Atlanta strip club hit with indictments
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Gold Club, a prominent Atlanta nude dance club, is
a den of prostitution that overbills its patrons, provides free sex
to celebrities, bribes Atlanta police officers and buys protection
from the Gambino organized crime family, federal prosecutors said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A 97-page racketeering indictment charges that the Gold Club's
owner, Steven Kaplan, intimidated his competitors by using his
Mafia ties and corrupted two Atlanta police officers in return for
special favors.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment by a federal grand jury also provides details of
numerous sex acts allegedly performed by Gold Club dancers.
According to prosecutors, Gold Club dancers performed lesbian sex
acts and prostitution for club patrons and celebrities, including
professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment contends the club paid dancers $1,000 to go to a
Charleston, S.C., hotel, where they staged a sex show and had sex
with members of an unnamed professional basketball team. The club
also sent them on sex trips to a Buckhead hotel and to Las Vegas
and Miami, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the grand jury indicted the Gold Club, Kaplan and 15
other people _ including club managers, dancers, one current and
one former Atlanta police officer and two Delta Air Lines
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities did not attempt to shut down or take
immediate control of the club. The government will attempt such a
move if it wins a criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's lawyers said they ``vigorously deny the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gold Club is licensed by the city of Atlanta and has
always operated in strict compliance with the law,'' said a
statement issued by attorneys Benjamin Brafman of New York and
Steve Sadow of Atlanta. The lawyers predicted ``complete
vindication'' for Kaplan and his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The city will allow the club to continue operating.
``Indictments are accusations, and it would be premature to revoke
their license at this point,'' said City Hall spokeswoman Zee
Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bush, the FBI's assistant special agent in charge, said,
``This is one step taken by law enforcement to eradicate the
influence of organized crime. It should also serve notice to
Georgians that organized crime is far-reaching and not limited to
cities historically associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who took control of the club in 1994, is accused of
having long-standing ties to the Gambino crime family, once run by
John Gotti. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Kaplan operated clubs in
Boca Raton, Fla., and New York, where he ``refined and perfected''
his criminal activity and then brought it to Atlanta, the
indictment said. He is said to own homes in Atlanta and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Kaplan and other club officials of
skimming millions of dollars in cash from club operations in order
to evade taxes and pay the Gambino family for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing faded blue jeans and tennis shoes, Kaplan, 40, entered a
plea of not guilty Wednesday in federal magistrate court in
downtown Atlanta. He was released after posting a $2 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult entertainment world is built on fantasy and so is
this indictment,'' said Atlanta lawyer Bruce Harvey, who represents
a dancer charged in the indictment. ``We look forward to getting
into the reality of the facts when we get into the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's client, Jacklyn Bush, also known as ``Diva,'' and
another dancer, Jana Pelnis, known as ``Frederique,'' pleaded not
guilty to charges of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Atlanta police Officer John
Redlinger provided protection and fixed traffic tickets for club
officials. In return, Redlinger accepted cash, food and drinks,
free use of the club's limousine and free tickets to Disney World,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Burney, another officer, notified the Gold Club when it
was about to be inspected, the indictment said. Burney, who is no
longer an Atlanta policeman, allegedly received sex and
complimentary food and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard defended her department.
``In this instance, we believe these were individual police
officers who made individual choices to tarnish their badges,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Club is popular with conventioneers, and women often
promote it by standing outside the Georgia World Congress Center
handing out free admission passes. Four golden lion statues greet
patrons at the club's front entrance. Inside, a large room with
couches and chairs is surrounded by private anterooms where naked
women dance for tips.
</P>
<P>
   Regular patrons paid for sex, the indictment said. One customer,
described only as ``G.H.,'' was charged more than $107,000 on his
credit card for prostitution and other illegal sexual favors over
six months ending in February, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Richard Deane declined to name the celebrities or
athletes who allegedly received sex.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities and athletes were ``enticed, invited and routinely
cajoled to visit the Gold Club,'' Deane said. ``...This enhanced
the reputation of the Gold Club and helped pull in other
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most air trips made by Gold Club officials and dancers were on
Delta Air Lines. According to the indictment, two Delta ticket
managers _ Lawrence Wooten in Atlanta and Aaron Maker in New York _
arranged for club officials to receive reduced rates in exchange
for free drinks, food and other unspecified favors, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has suspended Wooten and Maker, company spokesman John
Kennedy said. The two men defrauded Delta of more than $50,000 in
airline fares, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment draws on a history of Kaplan's alleged
involvement with organized crime. Since the 1980s, Kaplan has owned
nightclubs that made payments to the Gambino family for
``protection,'' according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the indictment said, a member of the Bonanno
organized crime family tried to gain a foothold in Kaplan's
businesses in Boca Raton. Kaplan obtained help from the Gambino
family in ``removing'' an unnamed Bonanno associate from running
Club Boca's food concessions, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Kaplan and his associates have skimmed cash from his
business operations, including the Gold Club, and funneled it to
the Gambino family, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Art Leach, who is heading the
prosecution, said organized crime families expect payoffs to keep
other crime syndicates from pressuring club operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is protection in the truest sense of the word,'' Leach
said. ``If you don't go along, anything can happen, including
physical damage.'' Staff writers Scott Thurston, Ron Martz, Joshua
B. Good and Julie Hairston contributed to this article.

 &HT;    Last race, then surgery for Martin
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Martin will run under the green flag at Sunday's
NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The next day, the Winston Cup
driver will go under the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will have back surgery on Monday in New Smyrna Beach,
Fla. He ``chickened out'' of the operation at the last minute a
year ago but has no escape plan this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go through with it,'' Martin said Wednesday in
Marietta, Ga. ``I've decided this is what I have to do to improve
the quality of my life. So I'm going to do it and finally get it
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   The back problems have hindered one of stock-car racing's
greatest drivers over the past few years _ even though Martin
insists that the discomfort does not affect his driving.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will finish third in the Winston Cup points standings,
but it is difficult to ignore his apparent discomfort at the track.
Sometimes, he walks awkwardly to take the pressure off his back.
After wrecking at Daytona in July, the crew members of Ford No. 2
had to carry and place Martin into the car for several ensuing
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my back (problems) have had any impact on my
racing,'' Martin said. ``I think it has made it harder for me to
smile. And sometimes I didn't sign autographs when I normally might
have. That's about all.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has been bothered by back problems since the age of 18,
but the pain has intensified over the past several seasons.
Martin's frustrations peaked this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm half a man,'' Martin said at Rockingham. ``I
can't even pick up a chair or move it. Or pick up my son or bend
over and get something. There are so many things that I am limited
to doing, and, on top of that, I have knee limitations. With those
things, man, I feel useless. I feel like I have to get out of the
race car and get on the couch.'' Doctors diagnosed Martin last year
with a bulging disc. He was set to have surgery to slice off some
of the disc. During tests, however, Martin was discovered to be
suffering instead from a pair of degenerating discs in his lower
back.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has two separate discs that slide in the opposite
direction and irritate nerves when he bends his back. The new
course of direction was to graft bone from Martin's existing
vertebrae and fuse the two discstogether.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin heard about fusion suddenly being involved with the
procedure, he abruptly canceled the operation.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Martin fully understands how the surgery will work
and is mentally prepared to cope with it. He will check himself in
at 6:30 a.m. on Monday at Bert Fish Medical Center of New Smyrna
Beach, Fla. The operation will be performed by orthopedic surgeon
Charles Kollmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is anxious about it,'' team owner Jack Roush said.
``Whenever you have your back operated on, there is always a
question to the outcome. Mark could wind up with more pain, the
same pain or less pain than he has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things are acceptable: the same pain or less pain. If it
does either, then Mark will be all right for a while. If it
worsens, it may affect how he can drive a race car. Mark was not
inclined to come back and make the judgment (to have surgery) until
he was nearing a threshold where the amount of pain was distractive
to a point that it might shorten his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's season-ending race, Martin said he will devour a
hearty breakfast. Then he won't be able to eat again until after
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we don't have rain during the race,'' Martin said.
``That would be my luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin will remain in the hospital for at least five days.
Afterward, he will rest at his home for six to eight weeks. He
plans to attend the Winston Cup awards banquet in New York on Dec.
3, but he will have another driver test his car at Daytona in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be able to do a lot for the next two
months,'' Martin said. ``I'm going to be lying on my back on the
couch. I have to make sure that I have plenty of batteries for the
remote control.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've got a `Sanford &AMP; Son' video that I haven't watched.
My son (Matt) has some `Good Times' shows taped that he wants me to
see. I also need to do some studying for my airline-transport pilot
license.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different for me, because I'm a real active
person. I'm sure I'm not going to be happy for a while, but this is
something I need to do so I'll have a good enough body to live a
rich, full life.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MARK MARTIN FILE

 &HT;    Changes for Pontiac in offing
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Winston Cup is considering changes for the Pontiac
Grand Prix, but nothing will happen at the season-ending NAPA 500
on Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no rule changes for Atlanta,'' said Kevin
Triplett, NASCAR director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson, the organization's Winston Cup Series director,
said last weekend that adjustments are likely in store for the
Pontiacs next season. Pontiac swept the poles and victories in each
of the past two races.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet and Ford drivers have been complaining that Pontiacs
have an unfair advantage with extra rear spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear us complaining when (Fords and Chevys) win
races, do you?'' said Tony Stewart, who drives the No. 20 Pontiac.
``If it's that big of deal, put one body on all (the cars).''
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER GORDON
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and Robby Gordon are no relation, but both will be
competing in Winston Cup next season. Robby announced Wednesday
that he is leaving CART to return to NASCAR. He drove in 22 Winston
Cup races for Team Sabco in 1996-97 before being released because
of personality conflicts with car owner Felix Sabates.
</P>
<P>
   Team Gordon, headed by the 30-year old driving veteran and
co-owners Mike Held and John Menard, is in the process of moving
its Southern California-based operations to the Charlotte, N.C.,
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't begin to tell you how excited I am to be returning to
NASCAR country, and I do plan to stay here this time,'' Robby said.
``This brings us back to the most popular racing series in the
world, and we're committed to being here for the long haul. In this
day and age, if you're in the business of racing, you better be
racing NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   MARTIN: TITLE CONTENDER
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin won't win the Winston Cup championship this year,
but there is another family member on the brink of racing title.
Matt Martin, 7, has a slim points lead heading into Friday's season
finale of the junior novice division of the Mid-Florida Quarter
Midget Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is what he will want to do for a living
some day, and I'm not sure if this is what I want him to do, but he
is having fun and that is what's important,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Matt's car travels at about 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Extra laps
</P>
<P>
   AMS said Wednesday that approximately 12,000 reserved tickets in
the East Turn and Weaver Grandstands are available for Sunday's
race.... The purse for the NAPA 500 has increased from $2,578,392
to $2,845,192 _ the richest event in AMS's 40-year history....
Morgan Shepherd to will attempt the No. 5 Pontiac for Sunday's
event. Shepherd has three of his four career wins at AMS....
Stewart called Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Bobby Labonte to apologize
for their incident in the Pennzoil 400. Stewart bumped Labonte on
lap 249 to take the lead and eventually win the race.

ADVERTISING: BP AMOCO AND BELLSOUTH SHUFFLE THEIR AGENCY ROSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two big advertisers in two big competitive categories _ energy
and telecommunications _ are making changes on their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The larger of the changes involves BP Amoco, the oil titan
formed by the merger in December of British Petroleum and Amoco
Corp. BP Amoco, based in London, is naming Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, as its global agency, though
Ogilvy had not previously worked for the company.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco is shifting assignments to Ogilvy that had been handled
in local markets by various agencies including Leo Burnett Co. and
Doner. The Ogilvy New York office will serve as the lead agency on
the account.
</P>
<P>
   Billings for the combined BP Amoco account are difficult to
determine because the merged company is only now deciding how to
proceed with brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The BP and Amoco brands have continued to be marketed
separately. But after BP Amoco announced plans to acquire ARCO,
which sells petroleum products under that brand, there has been
widespread speculation that all BP Amoco gasoline stations would be
rebranded as BP.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing Week, a trade publication in Britain, estimated the
potential combined billings at 125 million pounds, or about $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   A formal announcement of the selection of Ogilvy is planned for
Friday. The choice, which came with little or no formal review, was
described yesterday by advertising executives who had been briefed
about BP Amoco's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The selection came less than a week after Ogilvy resigned its
North American advertising and marketing assignments from Shell Oil
Co., a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The resignation will
require the closing of the Ogilvy office in Houston, which has
handled the Shell account since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when the resignation was announced, Ogilvy did not
disclose that it would return to the petroleum category faster than
you can say ``fill 'er up.'' Ogilvy North America chairman Tro
Piliguian , did hint, however, at what was to come in a statement
in which he described the Ogilvy Shell account as ``limited to
North America,'' adding, ``We believe that global partnerships are
the necessity in today's marketplace in every category.''
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco is Europe's second- largest petroleum company after
Royal Dutch/Shell, which uses an Ogilvy sibling, J. Walter
Thompson, as its agency of record in all countries except Canada,
the United States and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, part of Leo Group, had handled the Amoco brand in the
United States since 1996. Doner had been the longtime agency for BP
in Britain, parts of Europe and the United States and recently
defeated M &AMP; C Saatchi for a corporate account known as Clean
Fuels, pitching BP Amoco's so-called clean gasolines.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Petersen, a spokesman for Burnett, and David Kiley, a
spokesman for Doner in Southfield, Mich., referred inquiries to BP
Amoco. Telephone calls to the BP Amoco office in London were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Burnett and Doner had anticipated that sometime
soon they would square off in a shootout for the consolidated BP
Amoco account. So Ogilvy's selection surprised them. But Ogilvy
previously landed combined accounts from clients that did not
originally work with Ogilvy, most notably the worldwide IBM account
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in The Chicago Tribune, Ogilvy entered the
picture after Sir John Browne, chief executive of the company, met
with Shelly Lazarus, chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy in
New York, and Martin Sorrell, chief executive at WPP in London.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell, reached Wednesday in London, declined to comment,
referring inquiries to Ms. Lazarus. She referred inquiries to BP
Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   The other change involves BellSouth, one of the regional Bell
operating companies, which awarded its corporate branding account,
with billings estimated at more than $30 million, to Merkley Newman
Harty in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Battcher, a spokesman for BellSouth in Atlanta, confirmed
the selection of Merkley Newman in response to an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a three-month review between Merkley
Newman, part of the Omnicom Group, and the Atlanta office of West
Wayne. Those agencies had shared the corporate branding account;
both also handle a variety of other assignments that include
BellSouth products and services.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spent a total of $136 million on advertising last
year, according to Competitive Media Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless/Cronin, the new Atlanta agency that is affiliated with
Merkley Newman, will ``play some role, still to be determined'' in
handling the corporate branding account, said Scott Lahde, a
spokesman for Merkley Newman.
</P>
<P>
   In another change, the Tampa, Fla., office of West Wayne was
awarded a small BellSouth account that had been handled by
Bayless/Cronin. The account, Battcher said, involves wireless
products and services that BellSouth sells in the Tampa market. &QL;

KNOWLEDGE GAP ON VOUCHERS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ariz., Wis., Ohio) (jt) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study suggests that a majority of Americans have little or
no understanding of what a publicly financed school voucher is, or
what distinguishes a charter school from other public schools _
even in Milwaukee, Cleveland and Arizona, which were among the
earliest places to experiment with such options.
</P>
<P>
   In a response that the authors of the study highlight as
alarmingly typical, one woman suggested that a voucher was a chit
that could be redeemed for a school uniform.
</P>
<P>
   A voucher is indeed a chit, but one that, at least as defined in
Cleveland and Milwaukee, enables some students to attend parochial
or other private schools at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, nearly 1,700 charter schools have opened in 28
states; they are largely exempt from union contracts and other
regulations that govern most other public schools, but must
demonstrate specific progress within a designated period of time or
risk being closed.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study, which was made public on Tuesday,
interviewed more than 1,200 adults selected randomly across the
country, as well as 208 parents in those communities that
participate in voucher or charter experiments. The study, which was
conducted by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan educational organization,
has a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The authors maintain that public officials, educators and
journalists have largely failed to educate the public on the merits
or distinguishing characteristics of such academic alternatives.
Deborah Wadsworth, the executive director of Public Agenda, said
the study showed that ``even the community leaders themselves have
a limited grasp of the essentials of this debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found, for example, that 63 percent of those
interviewed reported knowing ``very little'' or ``nothing'' about
vouchers. Even in communities that have voucher programs, that
figure was 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The general public reported knowing even less about charter
schools, with 81 percent of those interviewed saying they knew
little or nothing about such schools. In communities with charter
schools, the figure was 52 percent.  &QL;

NO BAD FEELINGS THIS TIME AS DAVENPORT TOPS MAURESMO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was back to basics Wednesday night at the Chase
Championships: Lindsay Davenport and Amelie Mauresmo kept things
impersonal in their opening-round match at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They put aside their checkered past, that awkward Australian
Open moment when the disgruntled Davenport reacted to her semifinal
surrender to the then 29th-ranked Frenchwoman by accusing her of
hitting the ball like a person of a different gender; a person of
the wrong gender to be performing on the WTA Tour. A person whose
avowed lesbianism also gained her the label of ``half a man'' from
top-ranked Martina Hingis, who merrily and mercilessly throttled
Mauresmo in the Australian final.
</P>
<P>
   That particular fence was never properly mended, but Mauresmo
made her peace with Davenport, who quickly sent her a note of
apology and publicly praised Mauresmo's rippling one-handed
backhand and rippling musculature as a strength and a weapon, not a
curiosity. By the time the hard-hitting duo hit the court Wednesday
night, their rivalry was evenly proportioned at 2-2, and the
second-seeded Davenport made it clear she didn't take this opponent
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   After an ineffectual opening set in which Mauresmo surged to a
3-0 lead and Davenport, hobbled by a sore left thigh, seemed
disinclined to play catch-up until Mauresmo was serving for the set
at 5-1. The 1999 Wimbledon champion upped the ante and inflicted a
3-6, 6-3, 6-2 reversal of fortune on her challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Daveport said she was injured Sunday in Philadelphia, where she
won the Advanta Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore, but what can you do?'' Davenport said. ``It's the
end of the year; I'm not dying, but it's tough to play. The more I
played, the more I got used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing can't-miss tennis in the early stages of the first
set, Mauresmo proceeded to play all-miss tennis in the next two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could have won this one,'' said Mauresmo, whose
actions did not back up her mental meanderings. ``On this surface,
you know, you miss, you make a winner. It's up and down all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was all downhill for Mauresmo after the opening set.
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo had so much trouble winning that set once Davenport
bestirred herself from her early trance that she bungled four set
points, the fourth with a double fault, before sealing the set, a
hint of fallibility to come. Davenport roared through the middle
set, and in the third, she amassed a 4-0 lead before Mauresmo
collected her weapons and began to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   The morning match, watched by 2,000 customers, not all of them
paying, and contested between two best friends, produced an upset:
17th-ranked Anke Huber, a 1995 Chase finalist who barely squeaked
into this year's event, ousted ninth-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis,
6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Huber, the maid of honor at Halard's wedding to her coach,
Arnaud Decugis, attributed her success against her friend to her
serve, which yielded six aces and was unbreakable Wednesday. The
two had a 3-3 record in previous encounters, but Huber confused
Halard-Decugis by mixing things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I changed a little bit my game,'' the German said. ``I think
she just never knew where I was serving to. It was just a very good
day; not every day is like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Huber said she needed to have a banner day in her quarterfinal
against Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Lindsay, I lost the last, I don't know, five, six,
seven times,'' Huber said. ``But now it doesn't matter. I'll try to
do my best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played eight weeks in a row, but I'm still alive and I'm
trying,'' said Huber, who reached a career-high fourth in the
rankings five years ago but has battled recurring injuries in the
interim.

EDITORIAL: AS NORTHERN IRELAND WAITS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thurs., Nov. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The promises coming out of Northern Ireland this week stirred
hope, once again, that 30 years of internecine warfare between
Roman Catholics and Protestants could yield to what one negotiator
calls simply ``a decent, democratic society.'' As the Northern
Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, put it, the ordinary Northern
Irish are ready to give this peace process ``a go.'' The Catholic
and Protestant party leaders have also found a modest stretch of
common ground where the Good Friday peace accords of 1998 could
finally move into reality.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, comes with the party regulars. After
unusually conciliatory statements at the close of 11 weeks of
negotiations, David Trimble, the head of the Protestants' Ulster
Unionist Party, and Gerry Adams, leader of the Catholics' Sinn
Fein, must now win the support of their rank and file. Adams must
make certain that the Irish Republican Army follows through on a
process for disarmament, undoubtedly a stronger possibility after
the IRA announcement Wednesday. For the first time, the IRA
declared that it was ``unequivocally'' backing the peace accords
and agreed to appoint a go-between to the commission set up to
collect arms from the paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   With those promises, far short of what some Unionist hard-liners
are demanding, Trimble must somehow convince those bucking the
peace process that the time has finally come to step forward into a
new Northern Irish government shared with Sinn Fein
representatives. A Nov. 27 meeting of the 850-member Ulster
Unionist Party council will be a telling obstacle for Trimble, but
if he can persuade the Protestants of the IRA's intent to disarm,
the power-sharing agreement could be set up within a few days.
Disarmament by Ireland's paramilitary groups is scheduled by the
agreement for May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the steady guidance of former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell,
the leaders of Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionist Party worked in
what Mitchell called ``an unprecedented manner'' to untangle this
latest knot in the Good Friday peace agreement. Trimble should be
especially encouraged for his acknowledgment that in his own
community there is need for more ``mutual respect and tolerance
rather than division and alienation'' from Catholic neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hard men,'' as they are called on both sides, can always
destroy this progress, moving their disagreements back to the
streets. As Mandelson explains, at this stage ``only those who are
opposed to peace will condemn the peace process before it is
completed.'' The real goal is to set up what Trimble rightly calls
a ``novel'' government of shared power to complete disarmament and
start arguing, not about spilled blood but over building roads and
improving hospitals. &QL;

 &HT;    Hats off to `Larry'
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They sang it out from the press boxes of the National
League in a strong and unified voice Wednesday. ``Lahr-Ree,
Lahr-Ree, Lahr-Ree'' came the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wayne Jones, Chipper to those not from New York, took his
first MVP award in the same way he took out the regular-season
Mets. He dominated, collecting 29 of 32 first-place Baseball
Writers votes. This landslide went uphill, carrying Jones along to
his place atop Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Just 391 days ago, the Braves' third baseman appeared in these
pages beneath headlines that read ``Tarnished Golden Boy'' and
``Another Fallen Idol Disappoints.'' They dealt with his
confessions of adultery and fathering a son out of wedlock. Not the
recommended preparation for a Most Valuable Season, but Jones
somehow kept the personal embarrassment in its own little box for
the bulk of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This was an award for dealing with it as much as it was an award
for turning on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just being able to separate the two (the broken
marriage and the soaring career),'' Jones said. ``There were times
in my career when I couldn't, and it had an effect on the way I
played the game. I can remember one time in Philadelphia going into
Bobby's office and apologizing to him for how bad I was playing,
thinking I owed him an explanation. It goes back to my immediate
family and the handful of close friends that I have, being able to
have them act almost as therapists to help me deal with things.
Then rededicating myself to my workouts and my career.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorite son of Atlanta baseball would follow the path cut
by his own Braves model, Dale Murphy. Of course, on certain levels,
Jones never can measure up. As strictly a player, the parallels are
there. He got his first MVP at 27, Murphy at 26. And no one would
be shocked if Jones defended the title, just like Murph. Even
without Don Baylor here to hold his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jones stumbled, he went immediately to work to spackle his
image. The repair job has been remarkable. From heel to Most
Valuable Player in 13 short months. Short of entering a monastery,
this award was the next best fix. His was the performance of a man
trying to make it right the only way he knows how.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and put a good product on the field and you let
everybody know that you are genuinely apologetic for what happened,
stand up for it like a man, people respect you a lot more for it,''
he said. ``The best way to make people forget about something bad
that happened is to go out, play as hard as you can, put up career
numbers and let them know you haven't changed as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   The morality play aside, Jones has been an MVP in waiting.
Credit him for cultivating an undeniable talent. Once he added a
little pop from the right side, Jones became positively
frightening. Opponents couldn't walk him quickly enough. He got
more free passes in a season than Kato Kaelin has in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the kind of talent that will be quite expensive to keep
beyond the one year left on his contract. When he says, ``I was
born an Atlanta Brave and would like to stay one as long as
possible,'' write it down. He'll not repeat it much during
negotiating sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Jones' arrival as MVP was immaculate. It applied a
little spit-shine to the image and uplifted the man himself. ``A
wonderful year, all around,'' he can even say now.

 &HT;    Rider to play off the bench
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Isaiah Rider returned Wednesday to the Hawks as the
team's sixth man, after a one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   And Rider, who is unhappy with the assignment, and the team will
have to co-exist for the remaining 74 games, because Hawks
management says it plans no changes. Coach Lenny Wilkens told Rider
that his role would be like that of high-scoring guard Fred Brown
on the coach's 1979 NBA championship team in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred Brown affected the outcome of games in so many ways
(that) to strictly describe him only as a shooter is inaccurate,''
Wilkens said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also said that Rider's role off the bench is not
permanent. ``It doesn't mean he will never be a starter,'' Wilkens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rider, however, thinks that the sixth-man role might cast him in
the one-dimensional role of a shooter. ``It's not about starting,''
said Rider, who has started three games this season. But he went on
to question why ``a coach of Lenny's caliber would not want a
player with my talent to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider played well off the bench against Milwaukee and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks do not dispute Rider's talent. They say they
understand that he wants to play 40 minutes a game and lead the
team in scoring and passing while helping them win a lot of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the same things,'' team president Stan Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
   No trade is in the offing, the Hawks say. ``We've had some very
preliminary talks with some teams, but I can't tell you anything is
going to happen,'' general manager Pete Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said that Rider did not ask for a trade after being
suspended for Tuesday's game against Charlotte. However, he said
that Rider had asked earlier to be traded. ``He changes his mind,''
the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Rider reiterated Wednesday that he does not want to be on a
``rebuilding team at this stage of my career.'' But last week he
said he would accept a trade to a bad team so he ``can be the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said he has no regrets over the deal that brought Rider
and Jim Jackson here from Portland, in exchange for All-Star Steve
Smith and Ed Gray, who is out of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do this for one season. We did it so that we would
be players in the free-agent market over the next few years,''
Babcock said. ``That goal has not changed. In fact, we're more
committed than ever to bringing in a superstar, and making that
deal was the only way we could hope to accomplish that goal over
the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said he and Babcock agreed on the trade. ``We had our
eyes wide open,'' Kasten said. ``This wasn't Pete's deal, not by a
long shot. One man doesn't make those kinds of decisions in our
organization (Turner Sports). One man doesn't make baseball trades,
and one man doesn't make basketball deals. For that reason, the
Hawks will not eat Rider's $5.4million contract simply to be rid of
him. It would create problems with the salary cap and enormous
expenses in paying off a player while getting nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   However, it does not mean that Rider might not be suspended
without pay for extend periods, ultimately for an entire season, if
the Hawks had cause.
</P>
<P>
   Rider has been late for virtually every bus ride, every practice
and every game this season. He was suspended for skipping practice
Monday to take care of personal business involving his cars.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is ``unfortunate and regrettable'' Kasten said,
``but only from the standpoint of how it's turning out. It was a
gamble, and at this point that gamble was a failure, (but) we're
not close to giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we had our eyes open. It was a one-year contract. We also
got Jim Jackson, and we drafted Dion Glover and if the worst that
happens is that it hurts us for one year, weigh that against the
risk of Smitty getting old with four years on his contract.... You
have to take risks in sports. I'm convinced of that. History tells
us that. And that's what we did.''

 &HT;    Aggregate score sends England past Scotland
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lionhearts held on against the Bravehearts.
</P>
<P>
   England's 2-0 win over Scotland in the first leg of the Euro
2000 playoffs on Saturday was just enough for the Lionhearts to
defeat the Bravehearts _ as the tabloids love to call them _ in the
ballyhooed ``Battle of Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Just barely enough.
</P>
<P>
   A header in the 38th minute by Everton striker Don Hutchison at
Wembley in Wednesday's finale gave the Scots hope of repeating
their famous victory in London in 1977. But that's all they could
manage, despite winning 1-0. England advances to next summer's
finals in The Netherlands and Belgium on a 2-1 aggregate score.
</P>
<P>
   The English hero in Glasgow was Manchester United midfielder
Paul Scholes, whose disciplinary record with both club and country
lately has been notorious. He scored twice in the first half as
England overcame its mediocrity under coach Kevin Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   But improving enough to make a good impression next summer is
another thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic of Ireland, injury- and suspension-riddled, was
eliminated after a scoreless draw with Turkey in Istanbul. The
teams were 1-1 on aggregate, but the Turks advance because their
score came as an away goal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia got a 74th-minute goal from Miran Pavlin to earn a 1-1
draw with the Ukraine in Minsk and advance on a 3-2 aggregate. Each
country was seeking its first European Championships berth since
gaining independence after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark had little to fear from Israel after winning the first
leg 5-0 but still rolled to a 3-0 win in Copenhagen for good
measure and an 8-0 aggregate. The only negative was the 17th-minute
removal of goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who has been hampered by
injury this season for Sporting Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: FOUR PLAYOFF SPOTS LEFT
</P>
<P>
   Four of Mexico's powerhouses have secured spots in the Torneo
Invierno playoffs that begin Wednesday. But Guadalajara's hopes
rest on a win Sunday against lowly Santos (1 p.m., Univision) in
the last game of the regular season. Chivas blew a chance to
qualify last week against city rivals UAG Tecos, which got goals in
the 81st minute from Zdenko Muf and in the 89th minute from
Sebastian Abreu for a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Toluca, Cruz Azul, America and Atlas already are in. In Group 1,
UAG and UNAM Pumas are battling it out against Atlante and Celaya,
respectively. Morelia, Puebla and Celaya have chances in Group 2.
Morelia has the upper hand, closing out against eliminated Leon (1
p.m., Telemundo). Group 3 is more complicated. Necaxa leads
Guadalajara and Pachuca but needs a win over America. Pachuca meets
reigning Torneo Verano champion Toluca.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: FAVORITES ON ROAD
</P>
<P>
   After taking a deep breath, the 16 teams remaining in the
European Champions league begin the second round of group play on
Tuesday, with most of the favored clubs starting out on the road.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Barcelona travels to Hertha Berlin and defending
champion Manchester United heads to Italy to play Fiorentina. Serie
A leaders Lazio meet Olympique Marseille in the southern French
city on Wednesday (2:30 p.m., ESPN2). Real Madrid will have a new
manager as it opens at Dynamo Kyiv. Bayern Munich is banged up and
has a tricky contest in Trondheim against Norwegian champion
Rosenborg.
</P>
<P>
   The other matchups are Porto at Sparta Prague, Girondins de
Bordeaux at Valencia and Feyenoord at Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: TOSHACK SACKED
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz said he fired embattled
manager John Toshack on Wednesday for publicly deriding his players
in the Spanish press. But the Welshman's fate in the
pressure-cooker job probably was sealed when the club got off to a
poor start. Toshack, first sacked by Real Madrid in 1990, got the
ax despite qualifying for the second round of the Champions League
and getting a thrilling 3-2 win last week over Primera Division
leaders Rayo Vallecano. Afterward, Toshack lashed out at the play
of third-string goalkeeper Albano Bizarri, who has been erratic all
season. Toshack, signed to a 16-month contract in February, has no
regrets about his criticisms: ``It's more likely for pigs to fly
over Bernabeu Stadium than for me to take back what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: INNOCENTI SUSPENDED
</P>
<P>
   Bari defender Duccio Innocenti might have thought he got away
with crushing the cheekbone of Perugia's Renato Olive during a Nov.
6 Serie A match, but video doesn't lie. Innocenti wasn't carded for
the offense, which took place far away from the ball, but the
league issued a four-match suspension after seeing a replay. It's
the third such action taken against a Serie A player this season.
Olive said he might file a lawsuit. GERMANY: BASLER GETS NEW CLUB
</P>
<P>
   The close proximity of Oktoberfest and Munich's night life got
Bayern Munich midfielder Mario Basler into so much trouble that he
was forced to find a new club. On Tuesday, he signed with
Kaiserslautern, which is near Germany's Mosel River wine country.
He was brought on at the behest of manager Otto Rehhagel, for whom
he played at Werder Bremen, which won two Bundesliga titles in the
mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA: PALERMO INJURED
</P>
<P>
   Boca Juniors striker Martin Palermo scored the 100th goal of his
career in a 2-1 victory Sunday over Colon, but a freak injury later
in the game could put him out of action for as long as nine months.
Palermo, who is set to join Lazio after the Apertura season ends in
December, tore knee ligaments falling off balance after being hit
in the leg with a ball.

 Activists Seek Revised State Lending Rules for Banks  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Two leading California activist groups yesterday urged state
lawmakers to tighten community lending rules for banks, filling a
gap created by a recent weakening of the federal Community
Reinvestment Act.
<P>
   In testimony at a San Francisco hearing of the Assembly Banking
and Finance Committee, Robert Gnaizda, policy director of the
Greenlining Institute, and Alan Fisher, executive director of the
California Reinvestment Committee, called for legislation to
stiffen reporting requirements on bank lending in low-income
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an opportunity for the state to step in and pass a
disclosure law,'' Gnaizda said in an interview. Data could be used
to rate bank performance and eventually allow California to set
minimum community lending standards for any institution that does
business with the state, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   There are now federal, but no state, requirements for banks to
report how much credit they extend in low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Louis Papan, D-Millbrae,
said Sacramento lawmakers may consider such legislation during
sometime in  &LR; the current session.
</P>
<P>
   Introduction of a state community lending bill ``is a
possibility,'' Papan said. ``What we're thinking of is to provide
standard reporting on community reinvestment.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporting provisions would affect only state-licensed banks
_ mostly smaller institutions _ and would be designed to supplement
similar rules regulating banks with federal charters, such as Bank
of America and Wells Fargo, Papan said.
</P>
<P>
   The push for state reporting rules follows final approval
earlier this month of a landmark federal banking bill that includes
provisions easing community lending standards. standard. &LR;   &LR; Under
the new law, federal regulators now review the lending records of
small banks once every four or five years, instead of the previous
schedule of exams every year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great deal of concern about small banks,'' said the
CRC's Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Since passage of the Community Reinvestment Act almost three
decades ago, banks have made hundreds of billions of dollars of
mortgages, small-business loans and other credits in low-income
neighborhoods they once avoided. By the 1990s, multibillion-dollar
community loan pledges had become a routine part of large bank
merger announcements.

   Imagine plans to hire 150 people, bringing its U.S. employment
to more than 400. The company is about ready to burst beyond its
Brisbane office space, where most of those people work, and is
looking for new space.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Paris, where he had gone for a
company board of directors meeting, Imagine chief executive Chris
Anderson gushed about the success of Business 2.0 and the prospects
for the year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine has kind of snuck in under a lot of people's radar,''
Anderson said. He noted that its parent company, the Future Network
PLC, went public on the London Stock Exchange in June and has
doubled in value since then. ``Because it took place in London, no
one really heard about it,'' he said. But it gave the company ``the
resources and motivation to go for a big growth spurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the success of Business 2.0, which will
have a guaranteed subscriber base of 210,000 readers and ad pages
nearly tripling this month to 207 pages, gave Imagine new
credibility with media buyers and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what's happened this year, morale is sky-high,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the first half of 2000 will see the launch of
Maximum Linux, Digital Foto and the music magazine, to be called
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   As a magazine covering the hot open-source Linux software,
Maximum Linux is almost a no-brainer; the company put out a
``one-shot publication this autumn, and the thing blew out the
doors,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution will face a more competitive landscape, but Anderson
said it, too, is a natural. Business 2.0 covers the way the
Internet changes all business; the same thing is happening in
music, he said. The new mag will ``reflect the way people find,
listen to and buy music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Revolution will give out a CD with songs on it,
much the way Imagine's gamer mags give out CDs with game promos?
``There's an insightful question which I can't answer,'' Anderson
said, chuckling. ``Done right, that would have huge consumer
appeal. I don't want to say anything else about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital Foto will give tips on buying and using digital cameras.
Anderson was tight-lipped about the other ventures, which are due
out in the latter part of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much about these subjects _ Linux, music, photography
_ is covered on the Web, but Anderson is a big believer in print.
He doesn't even have the domain names sewn up for Revolution or
Digital Foto, although he does have online partnerships in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he doesn't own www.imagine.com, either, and he seems
to be doing all right in tech publishing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INDEPENDENTS DAY: &QL; 
The Northern California Independent Booksellers Association likes
to take on the corporate titans of the publishing industry and was
therefore heartened to see Chronicle Books this week remain in the
hands of local ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Nion McEvoy, a member of the family that owns Chronicle
Publishing Co., bought Chronicle Books from his relatives for an
undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled it's him and not Bertelsmann from Germany,'' said
Hut Landon, the association's executive director and the owner of
Landon Books in Mill Valley. ``I was glad it was sold to a local
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Roxane Farmanfarmaian, West Coast editor of Publishers Weekly,
agreed. ``It's unusual, in this era of conglomeration, to have a
publishing company become an independent. There are pitfalls, but
there are also opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Books is ``flourishing,'' she said, and has a strong
distribution program, selling the books from other presses, which
should give it an edge. ``In this dog-eat-dog world of bookselling
these days, it's very tough to be a small publisher in the face of
Bertelsmann and Penguin, to stand out and make yourself heard.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the experience of Harper San Francisco was ``a classic
case of what Chronicle didn't want to get into, becoming the
California outpost of a New York publisher.'' She was alluding to
Harper Collins management, which revamped the business and laid off
workers in the early 1990s. When that effort failed, Harper San
Francisco returned to its roots as a spiritual publisher, and it is
successful, albeit smaller than it once was, she said.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy could face pressure, as he'll need to pay back the loans
that enabled him to buy Chronicle Books. But ``it could have gone
to someone who knew nothing about books,'' Landon said. ``Big
conglomerates don't care about books. Their heart isn't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOOD TIMES ON THESTREET &QL; 
I thought the New York Times did a pretty good job with business
coverage, but I guess the Gray Lady needs to call in some relief.
This week, it launched a newsroom in a joint venture with
TheStreet.com, with six reporters and a Times assistant business
editor producing content to run on the Web sites of both TheStreet
and the Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Times was already an investor in TheStreet, and the new
newsroom will further lend the newspaper's prestige to the upstart
Internet financial news organization.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet also plans to announce that it has hired Jonathan
Krim, former assistant managing editor of the San Jose Mercury
News, to be its new  &LR; executive editor. That post has been vacant
since early this year, when Jamie Heller became editor of strategic
ventures for the company _ endeavors like the joint New York Times
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Krim started looking when the Merc brought back
Susan Goldberg, a former Merc editor who spent 10 years at USA
Today, to be managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the CEO gone, the stock price down and talk buzzing
about lower revenues amid bulk subscription discounts, TheStreet's
Editor in Chief Dave Kansas said things are looking up. His spin:
The company has $130 million cash in the bank, a new CEO, new blood
like Krim, and the New York Times deal. ``Things are going pretty
well,'' he said. ``Call me Pollyanna.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NEW MONEY FOR MARKETWATCH &QL; 
Meanwhile, MarketWatch.com, TheStreet's San Francisco rival in
financial news, has a new corporate backer: the Financial Times of
London. The peach-colored broadsheet reported an $800 million
merger this week with Data Broadcasting Corp., which owns a 32
percent stake in MarketWatch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, MarketWatch said CEO Larry Kramer would take on the
title of chairman, relinquishing the role of president to Philip D.
Hotchkiss, founder and CEO of BigCharts.com, a company that
MarketWatch acquired last June.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KRAMER VS. CRAMER REDUX &QL; 
I just happened to like reading MarketWatch's coverage of its rival
TheStreet.com's appointment of a new CEO. The November 7 story
about Thomas Clarke succeeding Kevin English, who resigned, quoted
a former CBS New Media exec as saying that it's a ``real problem''
when senior management leaves so soon after a company goes public.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, MarketWatch is closely allied with CBS New Media, as
a Web property in which CBS Corp. holds a 32 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The article also included this parenthetical clarification about
TheStreet co-founders and board members James Cramer and Martin
Peretz: ``Cramer said a report by CBS.MarketWatch.com that Peretz
and he are no longer talking to one another was untrue. `Marty and
I talk three times a day, every day. We reconciled five months ago,
and I toasted him at his 60th (birthday),' Cramer said in a note to
MarketWatch.com this weekend. `We work closely together.'
CBS.MarketWatch.com apologizes for the error.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, the final knife: Although TheStreet has been a
forceful advocate for opening up company conference calls to
investors _ it was TheStreet's Adam Lashinsky who scored a big
scoop by weaseling his way into a Webvan conference call, garnering
information that forced the company to delay its IPO _ MarketWatch
noted that the company doesn't necessarily practice what it
preaches. In talking to investors about the CEO succession, the
article noted, ``The media company on Friday closed off its
conference call to reporters.''

 Kia Dismisses S.F. Ad Agency as Too Small  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Kia Motors America yesterday dismissed San Francisco's Goldberg
Moser O'Neill after six years as its advertising agency, saying it
was too small to handle the South Korean automaker's growing U.S.
business.
<P>
   The Kia account this year comprised $75 million of GMO's $550
million in media billings.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Goldberg, GMO's chief executive, said his agency will start
looking for a new auto account immediately. He denied that GMO's
size was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think this is more of a financial issue,'' Goldberg
said. ``Their business is going up, but our fees are going down.''
The two companies argued over their 1999 contract for 18 months and
just signed it last week, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kia sales are 61 percent above last year, so the decision to
terminate GMO was not a result of slow sales or bad creative,''
said Dick Macedo, Kia's executive vice president, marketing, in a
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be launching three new models in the next 12 months,''
Macedo said. ``Unfortunately, GMO is unable to support our needs _
and our dealers' needs _ during this incredible growth period for
Kia.''
</P>
<P>
   Kia is negotiating with a new agency, the release said. Kia
executives could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   One source speculated that the Kia account could go to Bates
USA, the ad shop used by Hyundai Motors, which bought Kia in a
bankruptcy court auction last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles office of DDB Needham also has a foot in the
door since Kia has hired that agency for special projects.
</P>
<P>
   GMO's other accounts include Cisco Systems and K.B. Toys.

 Schwab Has New Investing Tool for IPOs  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
IPO road shows _ in which soon-to-be-public companies make their
pitch to big-bucks institutional investors _ are finally going to
be open to individual investors as well.
<P>
   Well, the richer ones anyway.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Charles Schwab Corp. has received a green light
from the Securities and Exchange Commission to broadcast road show
proceedings via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because the SEC's approval came in the form of a ``no-action
letter,'' which sets a regulatory standard that applies to all
market players, other online brokers theoretically could air road
shows for initial public offerings as well.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that Schwab specifically asked for permission to
make road show information available to its ``Signature Gold''
clients _ those with at least $500,000 in assets at the brokerage _
as well as for its fee-based investment advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Less-well-heeled Schwab investors will remain barred from road
shows, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   the time being.  &LR; ``Ideally, over time, we'd like to expand it,''
said Greg Gable, a spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
   As for rival brokerages, it's unclear whether the SEC's letter
would confine their own road show activities only to investors with
half a million bucks worth of assets.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Merrill Lynch in New York said the brokerage is
interested in this matter but declined to comment further.
Representatives of E-Trade Group and Ameritrade Holding Corp. could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of access to IPO road shows has been a bone of contention
among many individual investors. They resent that institutional
investors are given inside information about a company's prospects
before the initial share offering.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, that information is significantly more detailed
than what is generally available to the public via a company's
prospectus or SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, institutional investors and a small number of
``accredited'' individual investors _ the ones with oodles of cash
_ can log on to a handful of Internet services providing real-time
and taped road show presentations.
</P>
<P>
   While Schwab's Signature Gold clients have considerably more
market exposure than most individual investors, they are still well
below the asset threshold of the typical ``accredited'' investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant change,'' Schwab's Gable said. ``It's a
step toward the democratization of what had been a closed market.''
</P>
<P>
   While the road show access would be Internet-based, he stressed
that this is not intended as a way to compel more customers to
become online traders.
</P>
<P>
   Gable said a number of Schwab clients have asked for access to
IPO road shows because they felt ``left out'' of high-flying share
offerings. It's not uncommon for an Internet company's IPO to post
spectacular short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, Schwab said it is joining with Ameritrade and TD
Waterhouse Group to form an online investment bank. The goal is to
secure a greater number of IPO shares from Wall Street
underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Grodsky, director of research at Grodsky Associates in
New Jersey, said providing more access to IPOs will help Schwab
retain wealthier clients in the face of increased competition from
full-service brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them an extra something that they didn't have
before,'' Grodsky said. ``It's a clear plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Gable said Schwab's impression of the SEC's letter is that
regulatory authorities want to proceed slowly in granting more
individuals access to road shows. He said the SEC likely wants to
see how the Signature Gold clients respond before allowing greater
access.

 &HT;    Strong finish closes deal
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The can't-miss kid just hit the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, 27, welcomed himself to the prime of his career
with an MVP season, something that was confirmed on Wednesday when
he won the National League Most Valuable Player award in a
landslide. The 156 points that separated him from runner-up Jeff
Bagwell was the third-highest margin of victory this decade behind
Bagwell in 1994 and Sammy Sosa last season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was voted first on 29 of the 32 ballots by the Baseball
Writers Association of America, second on two and third on one for
a total of 432 points. Bagwell, who received one first-place vote
and 20 seconds, was second overall with 276 points and Matt
Williams was third with 269 points. They were the only players
chosen on all 32 ballots, two from each NL city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tickled pink that he won,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said
from the Cayman Islands, where he is vacationing. ``He absolutely
deserves it. He was extremely important to our pennant race this
season. I can't think of a better player to win the award.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Jones became the front-runner during the
first Mets series in September, when he hit four home runs to spoil
New York's division title hopes, but Jones prefers to think of the
last two months of the season as the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game we played the last two months was a playoff game,''
Jones said. ``You're running on pure adrenaline. To go out for the
last two months when every pitch, every swing, every out, every
inning is big, you'll be surprised what you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did was hit a career-high .319 and a career-high 45 home
runs, score 116 runs, drive in 111 runs and steal 25 bases. He
finished in the top 10 in the league in 10 major offensive
categories to help the Braves to their eighth division title this
decade. But it really shouldn't have been that much of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jones signed with the Braves in 1990 as the first overall
pick in the draft, he has always played under the highest
expectations, and he has yet to disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a perfectionist,'' Jones said. ``I hate when I make an
error. I can't stand striking out. I hate the hundreds of ground
balls I hit to second base. I don't want to get thrown out
stealing. If we're in a dire situation and I don't come through,
that bugs me for days until I get the chance to do it again. Nobody
is going to put any more pressure on me than myself. That's what
keeps me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has had his eye on winning this award since he was a
child. ``I grew up watching Dale Murphy,'' Jones said, flashing his
famous boyish grin. ``Dale was the man. I saw him win back-to-back
MVPs in '82 and '83. I thought how great it would be to be standing
in his shoes one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   And like Murphy, Jones wants to stick around Atlanta for a
while, though it'll cost the Braves to make it happen. Jones is
entering the final year of his current contract _ the Braves
exercised their option to pay him $4 million this year. After
signing a relatively modest contract in 1996 _ worth $12 million
over five years _ Jones will command that kind of money annually
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic that I can stay as a Brave,'' Jones said.
``I was born an Atlanta Brave. I would like to stay here as long as
possible. I like to think (general manager) John Schuerholz and I
have a good rapport and the lines of communication are open. I'm
sure we'll be on the phone with each other pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in his interests and our interests to (re-sign Jones),''
Schuerholz said. ``The lines of communication have been
established. We're hopeful.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 New voice technology lets people `chat' out loud _ online  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
When Billie Lemmerman starts to feel lonely, the 74-year-old widow
boots up her computer and heads to a chat room on the Internet for
some conversation.
<P>
   But instead of just typing a message and waiting for a written
response, the Stockton resident is actually chatting _ using her
voice to talk in real-time with others online.
</P>
<P>
   Online ``chat'' is evolving from a crude, written form of
communication to a multimedia experience, allowing users to hold
oral conversations via the Internet with friends, relatives,
strangers and business associates.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmerman, like millions of other Net users, is using a
technology called voice chat _ turning the computer into a giant
speakerphone that lets her talk with others around the globe at no
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is gaining popularity as major Web portals like
Excite, Yahoo and AltaVista incorporate it into their existing chat
features. And businesses looking for cheaper ways to communicate
with customers, vendors and employees also are beginning to use
voice chat instead of plain old e-mail or even the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people like about voice chat is that it adds personality
to the whole interaction process,'' said Paul Matteucci, president
of HearMe.com  &LR;   &LR; of Mountain View, which provides voice-chat
technology. ``It's like the difference between using the telephone
and writing a letter. Hearing a voice conveys emotion and
personality. That's particularly important when it comes to
strangers coming together in a community site.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, instead of guessing whether Jester182 was flirting with
you, chat room users can hear the subtle inflections that help
people gauge the context of a conversation. And unlike picking up a
telephone, the service is free and allows lots of people to
participate. Although you can talk to large numbers of people
through telephone voice-conferencing, it's expensive, cumbersome
and primarily used by businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Voice chat works by downloading special  &LR; software off the Web
onto your computer's hard drive. With speakers and a microphone,
users can hold a conversation with one or hundreds of people on the
Web. Or they can opt just to type text messages and listen to
others in the room. Like regular chat, there is some latency &LR; 
 &LR; delay so that not everybody talks at once.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VOICECHA (43424 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The software is available on major portal sites such as Yahoo,
Excite and AltaVista, as well as from www.hearme.com and
www.lipstream.com _ two of the companies that developed the
technology and supply it to portals and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Once the software is downloaded, users can participate in
one-on-one conversations or head to a karaoke room to sing en masse
with dozens of other voice chatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have more and more computers that are coming
equipped with microphones and speakers, voice chat is a natural
outgrowth of traditional chat rooms,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, an
analyst with Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an obvious limitation to chat rooms, and that is how
fast you can type.'' With voice, people are limited only by how
fast they can speak, Gerbrandt said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like to chat, the technology may seem a smidgen
too personal. After all, one of the things chat room users seem to
like most is the anonymity that it provides. On the Web, a chat
room user can be anybody they want _ a teenager, a Southern
debutante, an Englishman. But once voice is incorporated, fooling
others into thinking you're from the French Riviera may be a bit
trickier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, companies providing voice chat say that after a while,
most people want to take the chat experience a step beyond written
words. Voice chat is the bridge between traditional chat and
picking up the telephone and calling somebody, said Matteucci of
HearMe.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Lemmerman, hearing a voice _ even if it's a
stranger's _ is crucial at times when she's feeling lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started using voice chat because I'm old and I get lonesome
and to hear a voice is nice,'' she said. Lemmerman, who visits chat
rooms for people over 50, said that last week she met a man from
her hometown in England and had a 10-minute conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Ike DeLorenzo, use it for business. DeLorenzo's San
Francisco Web engineering firm, Parlez Communications, uses voice
chat to communicate with employees in Montreal and Europe, as well
as with customers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm likes to hold virtual meetings, where staff can meet
online and share files, look at charts and discuss details
simultaneously. They do this through a company called WebX, which
recently added voice chat as a service. San Jose's WebX offers a
Web site, www.webex.com, that allows businesses to share
applications and documents online.
</P>
<P>
   Before voice chat, ``the weak link was the fact that we could
communicate a lot of code design and schematics with our people
working in Montreal and overseas, but then we had to pick up the
telephone to communicate with them while we were online,''
DeLorenzo said.
</P>
<P>
   With voice chat, DeLorenzo said, ``I don't have to keep track of
everyone's number or who's going to originate the conference call.
I just start the meeting, everybody talks over the computer, and my
office phone line stays free.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the company's phone bills have dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The portals that offer the service say it's one of the most
popular features, with thousands of people downloading the software
from Yahoo, AltaVista and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Park, senior producer for Yahoo, said the portal added
voice chat as a logical extension of regular chat. The company also
is letting users record and send voice e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if you're a telecommuter logged in from home, you can
send the boss a voice message instead of having to disconnect and
get on the phone, which means you can stay online,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been extremely valuable for people who have long-distance
relationships or who know a lot of people in different countries.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a valuable tool for people like Arizona resident
George Buys, a blind man who uses voice chat to communicate with
others and who is starting his own online business using the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Buys, who lost his sight 13 years ago, has created an online
community where people can communicate via voice chat. At
www.audio-tips.com, people who are blind can talk with others who
have lost their sight and learn how to function without the use of
their eyes, Buys said. Having voice chat enables people who are
blind to feel as if they are a part of the online community instead
of feeling left out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voice chat makes blind computer users more powerful,'' Buys
said.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Clinton's state visit to Turkey has
featured plenty of official meetings, dinners and speeches. But it
has not been all work and no play.
</P>
<P>
   With time to spare before a European security meeting with the
leaders of more than 50 nations here on Thursday, the president has
taken in many of Turkey's cultural gems. Earlier in the week, he
removed his black cowboy boots and walked in stocking feet across
the carpet of the spectacular Blue Mosque, a high point in Ottoman
architecture built on the orders of the Sultan Ahmet I in the early
1700s. ``I'm so honored to be here,'' Clinton said softly to Imam
Emrullah Hatipoglu, the imam of the mosque, who welcomed the
president, his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their daughter,
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The president descended into the Underground Palace, a dimly lit
cistern that was featured in the James Bond movie ``From Russia
With Love &UR; . &LR; '' The Byzantines had constructed it to store the
city's water supply. There, he walked past dozens of stone columns
as the soft rhythmic tones of an ancient Turkish flute created a
haunting atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday he strolled in the marble ruins of Ephesus, where
one of the Seven Wonders of the World _ the Temple of Artemis _ was
built in 550 B.C. With security officials perched in the
surrounding hills, the president paused to admire the grassy Upper
Agora, once a marketplace and public square, and Trajan's Fountain,
which dates to A.D. 102.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle Cure? No Thanks
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton is an engaged tourist, gazing intently at
artifacts and offering observations to his tour guides, he also has
shown that he has his limits.
</P>
<P>
   In the old city of Istanbul on Tuesday, Clinton signed the guest
book at the Haghia Sophia, a cavernous museum built as a Christian
cathedral in A.D. 360. In 1453, it was converted into a mosque
after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the Byzantine name
for Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in dark slacks and a black leather flight jacket,
took a pass on a tourism ritual at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that if one presses one's thumb into a special
spot on a stone column, the restorative powers of St. Gregory the
Miracle Worker go into effect. Clinton walked on by.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling Lighter
</P>
<P>
   One of the officials who has been frequently at Clinton's side
during his state visit to Turkey is Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser. Make that a new slimmed-down version of
Berger. Thanks to a special diet that he did not want to go into,
Berger has lost 35 pounds in recent months. So svelte is he now
that he and his wife had run out to Saks Fifth Avenue a few days
before the trip to have his suits altered.
</P>
<P>
   There was a foreign policy connection to Berger's weight loss.
During the confrontation with the Senate over the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, Berger joked to Trent Lott, the Senate majority
leader, that he would fast until the Senate approved the agreement.
Lott, a Mississippi Republican, told Berger he probably would not
eat again _ and the Senate went on to defeat the pact soundly.
</P>
<P>
   They Gush, He's Grateful &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to Turkey, longer than previous visits by George
Bush and Dwight Eisenhower, has given him gushing coverage in the
local media, and some interesting momentos. He received handmade
clay sculptures from some young earthquake victims, a prestigious
state award from President Suleyman Demirel, a Bible verse on
parchment from Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and a watercolor
scene of boats along the Bosporus from the American-Turkish
Business Council. Clinton said he would treasure them all, and
would hang the painting in his new home in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Just as heart warming have been the banner headlines praising
Clinton for his efforts to strengthen ties between the United
States and Turkey and advocate Turkey's admission to the European
Union. ``Politicians, academicians, labor unions and the public
were very happy to hear from the U.S. president how vital Turkey
will be for the whole world in the next century,'' said an article
in the English-language Turkish Daily News. In Sabah, one of the
country's largest dailies, a screaming headline over a story on
Clinton's speech to the National Assembly called the president:
``LIKE A TURK.''
</P>
<P>
   Further down on the front page, however, was a related story
that left one member of the White House press corps red-faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``LIKE AN AMERICAN,'' said the headline, which was coupled with
two photographs of a female reporter with her legs extended over
the seats in front of her during the National Assembly session. The
photo captain called her a ``mini-skirted journalist'' and poked
fun at her relaxed posture during the official proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   What the paper left out is that a delay in Clinton's speech
meant that American reporters were treated to well over an hour of
parliamentary debate on some rather contentious topic, all in
Turkish, of course. And a closer inspection would have shown other
correspondents in the pack with their legs down but their eyes
shut.

MABEL KING, 66, WHO PLAYED THE WICKED WITCH IN `THE WIZ'

<P>
   Mabel King, an actress and singer best known for her portrayal
of Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West, in the Broadway and
movie productions of ``The Wiz'' and her role as the mother in the
mid-'70s television comedy ``What's Happening!'' died on Nov. 9 at
a hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 66.
</P>
<P>
   She died after a long illness and complications from diabetes,
said a friend, Vickie Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King was born on Dec. 25, 1932, in Charleston, S.C., and
grew up in Harlem. She appeared on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' early
in her career and later made guest appearances on many other
television shows, including ``Barney Miller,'' ``Fantasy Island,''
``The Jeffersons'' and ``Wiseguy.''
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in nine movies, including ``Scrooged'' (1988);
``The Jerk'' (1979), in which she played Steve Martin's mother;
``The Gong Show Movie'' (1980); and ``The Bingo Long Traveling
All-Stars and Motor Kings'' (1976).
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 she appeared in the play ``The Wiz,'' an all-black
musical based on L. Frank Baum's ``Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' that
was later made into a movie; Ms. King had the same role in the film
version. She also worked on Broadway in productions of ``A Race
With the Wind'' and ``The Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King's most visible role was as Mrs. Thomas, or Mama, in the
ABC series ``What's Happening!'' from 1976 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her mother, Rosalee Washington, and a sister,
Rose Washington, both of Manhattan. Her son, Larry, died in 1996.

BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ, 82, DIES; EXPERT ON MAO'S REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benjamin Schwartz, one of the first scholars to show that Mao
Zedong developed his own brand of Communism beyond Soviet control
and a professor emeritus of history and political science at
Harvard University, died of cancer on Sunday at his home in
Cambridge, Mass. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Although not as well known publicly as his mentor, John K.
Fairbank, who helped build the field of Chinese studies in the
United States through constant proselytizing, Schwartz in his books
furnished several crucial ideas that still help form the foundation
for American understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was his research on Mao, showing how the young Mao
had masterminded the Chinese revolution by turning to the poor
peasants instead of following Marx's reliance on urban workers.
</P>
<P>
   Another insight was Schwartz's recognition that for 100 years
the critical question for China has been ``wealth and power,'' or
how to catch up with the West economically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Schwartz was an officer in the cryptoanalysis
branch of the Signal Corps, helping break Japanese codes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was known as a modest man who did not seek personal
titles or pursue consulting contracts like many other Harvard
professors, during the height of the Vietnam war in 1969, when
Harvard students occupied university offices and brought the school
to a standstill, he was improbably selected to a special committee
to defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben was like the man with his finger in the dike and held the
university together at a time when it was not clear it would
hold,'' said Marshal Goldman, associate director of the Davis
Center for Russian Studies at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Isadore Schwartz was born on Dec. 21, 1916, in East
Boston and grew up in a poor family that was further set back by
the Depression and later moved to Dorchester, a working-class
section of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Boston Latin, the city's premier high school
for talented students, and was admitted to Harvard College in 1934
as a scholarship student, commuting daily from home. The experience
of being poor, a day student and Jewish at Harvard in the '30s was
difficult, friends said, and he found the other students and
faculty snobby and elitist.
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated magna cum laude in 1938 with a major in
romance languages and literature, he expected to become a high
school teacher or rabbi, and received a master's from the Harvard
Graduate School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   But the war intervened, and after the war, with his knowledge of
Japanese, he returned to Harvard, where he encountered Fairbank,
always on the lookout for bright students to convert to the gospel
of Chinese studies.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz fell for the pitch, like many others. He soon earned
another master's, this time in regional studies, and a Ph.D. in
history and Far Eastern languages. Harvard appointed him an
instructor in history and government in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, his doctoral dissertation was published as a book,
``Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao,'' by the Harvard
University Press, and immediately established him as a pioneer in
the fledgling study of Chinese communism.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the United States was at war with the new
government in China over Korea and there was a widespread belief
that the Chinese Communists were merely an extension of Soviet
power, Schwartz demonstrated that Mao had led the Communists to
victory in China by defying Soviet plans and orders. Mao had
discovered, after repeated failed uprisings in China's cities by
other Communist leaders, that the real revolutionary force in China
was the impoverished peasantry. Schwartz's book remains a key
source today.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``In Search of Wealth and Power: Yen Fu and the
West,'' was published by the Harvard University Press in 1964,
adding to his stature as an authority on Chinese intellectual
history.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on an encyclopedic knowledge of classical and modern
Chinese literature and philosophy, Schwartz showed that the
overriding goal of the country's leaders from the late 19th century
on has been to resume China's rightful place in the world by
catching up with the West, or in Chinese terms by a search for
wealth and power. Yen Fu was a member of the traditional gentry of
the late Qing dynasty who was the first to translate European works
into Chinese, largely to seek out the secret of Western power.
</P>
<P>
   That goal remains paramount today, as the search by Beijing for
economic and military modernization leads to clashes with the
United States over issues like opening China's market to U.S.
investment or the theft of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Schwartz drifted further back into Chinese
history. In 1985, he published ``The World of Thought in Ancient
China.''
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to an endowed chair, becoming the Leroy B.
Williams professor of history and political science in 1975.
Schwartz continued to work in his office every day from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m., where he was available to students. And he ate lunch without
fail in the cafeteria of the Fairbank Research Center where anyone
could talk with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a product of the Depression, and he felt it was his job
as a professor to be there for his students,'' said Merle Goldman,
a professor of history at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the American Historical Association gave him its
Award for Scholarly Distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Bernice; a son, Jonathan, of West
Hartford, Conn.; a daughter, Sara-Ann Erichson of Montclair, N.J.;
and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   One question his colleagues have is whether the tradition of
lunch in the Fairbank cafeteria, always well attended by
professors, students, and visiting Chinese scholars and officials,
will continue. Goldman said, ``We just don't know what it's going
to be like without him.''

ETHICS INQUIRY URGED ON FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY'S NEW JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A coalition of consumer and community groups has
called for a government ethics investigation into former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin's decision to accept employment from
Citigroup, the financial services conglomerate, contending the move
presents an ``undeniable appearance of impropriety.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which submitted a letter to the Office of government
Ethics Wednesday calling for the investigation, criticized what it
referred to as ``turnstile behavior'' by the former secretary, who
held a leadership post at the Wall Street firm Goldman, Sachs
before joining the Clinton administration in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In his role at Citigroup, announced late last month, Rubin
became one of three members of an expanded ``office of the
chairman.'' He resigned his post as treasury secretary four months
before joining Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Robert Rubin to move from his Treasury job to the highest
echelon at Citigroup in less than four months raises significant
ethical and public policy questions,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Wednesday that his decision to take a job at
Citigroup was entirely unrelated to anything he worked on while in
government. ``During the time I was Treasury secretary, my sole
concern was to produce the best possible public policy,'' he said.
``I could not have cared less how anyone in the industry reacted to
my position or my views.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by leaders of the Center for Community
Change, the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now,
the Greenlining Institute, New York Public Interest Research Group
as well as consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that the circumstances of Rubin's move to
Citigroup should be investigated, in part, because the move
coincides with the passage of congressional legislation repealing
Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that divided banks from other
kinds of financial services companies. The repeal of the law was a
high priority for Citigroup, which faced the possibility of having
to divest its insurance underwriting subsidiary if the legislation
was not repealed.
</P>
<P>
   As Treasury secretary, Rubin was involved in pushing for
modernization of laws governing the financial services industry. He
left office before the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which restricted
banks' freedom to merge with or compete with nonbanking businesses,
was replaced with new legislation.

 &HT;    POWERFUL, LATE-SEASON LENNY POUNDS EASTERN CARIBBEAN
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    EDs: This story will have to be updated with 11 p.m. EDT
coordinates from National Hurricane Center.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ A powerful late-season surprise packing
winds of 150 mph, Hurricane Lenny lashed the eastern Caribbean
Wednesday, uprooting trees, tearing off roofs and downing power
lines as it made a near direct-hit on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny brushed past Puerto Rico on a rare west-to-east course and
seemed likely to go down as one of the most powerful November
hurricanes on record. The storm flirted with reaching Category 5,
the most powerful level on the scale of hurricane strength, and was
expected to leave extreme damage in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. EDT, Lenny's center was located at latitude 17.7 north
and longitude 64.1 west, or about 70 miles southeast of the Dutch
island of St. Maartens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious storm,'' U.S. Virgin Islands Gov.
Charles Turnbull told the island chain's 97,000 residents in a
radio broadcast as the storm bore down. ``The winds are becoming
severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny's well-defined eye passed within 35 miles of St. Croix,
where roofs were ripped away and boats tossed ashore in
Frederiksted on the island's western tip. There were reports of
roads blocked by debris and flooding over much of the hilly,
20-mile-long island, as Lenny dropped 10 or more inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My yard is completely flooded out, the telephone lines are
whistling and the rain is beating against the house,'' said Anthony
Lewis of Frederiksted.
</P>
<P>
   There were no initial reports of fatalities among St. Croix's
55,000 residents, who saw nearly 90 percent of their buildings
damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. The U.S. islands also suffered
multi-billion-dollar damage at the hands of Hurricane Marilyn in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny seemed likely to add to the toll.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it approached the Virgin Islands, Lenny was blamed
for the drownings of two fishermen off the coast of Colombia, where
heavy rains and waves kicked up by the storm pounded the coast and
reportedly left hundreds of people homeless. A St. Maartens man was
killed when his garden wall collapsed on him hours before Lenny's
arrival Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, one man was killed when he fell while trying to
board up his windows. But this island of 3.8 million residents
seemed to escape the worst, experiencing only tropical-storm force
winds and heavy rains as the storm kept to the south. There were
reports of flooding and blocked roads along the island's south
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got very lucky,'' said Carlos Alvarado, 34, a postman who
lives near San Juan. ``There was a lot of rain and some wind, but
nothing like we've seen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   San Juan's airport re-opened late Wednesday and the city's
bustling tourist district hummed with activity.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Rico's residents took the storm seriously, boarding
up homes and stripping grocery stores of emergency supplies. Last
year, Hurricane Georges blasted across the island, causing
extensive damage and leaving 500 people dead throughout the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, a tiny island off Puerto Rico's east coast,
protestors who have been occupying a U.S. Navy bombing range since
May reportedly took shelter from the storm in an old tank used by
the military for target practice. The protestors want the U.S.
military to end its war games on the island.
</P>
<P>
   But Lenny's most potent winds were aimed at the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Turnbull declared a state of emergency and deployed the
National Guard. Tourists packed airline counters, hoping to escape
the islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, which are
normally beginning to fill up this time of year with winter
snowbirds. Many were left stranded as airlines cancelled flights
and airports were closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through (Tuesday) night the police were busy helping
evacuate a number of individuals who sought assistance after their
mobile homes and homes in low-lying areas became threatened by
flood waters,'' said St. Croix police chief Novell Francis.
</P>
<P>
   In Frederiksted, waves smashed a sea wall, tore up a wooden pier
and damaged a large concrete pier that serves cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   One tourist who ventured out into the storm got stranded on a
rock near a resort as surging waves surrounded him. Divers rescued
him after a terrifying hour.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the Caribbean, huge surf wreaked havoc while
Lenny was still more than 100 miles away, sweeping away four
houses, damaging roads and flooding the business district on
Grenada, according to media reports. A small group of people
suffered fractures and other injuries when waves swept over a pier
on St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lenny emerged from a swirl of stormy weather over the central
Caribbean on Monday, quickly blossoming from a disorganized squall
into a hurricane. It pelted Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican
Republic with heavy rains, then picked up speed and strength.
</P>
<P>
   But its direction of movement was the biggest surprise. On
Puerto Rico, residents dubbed the storm ``El Zurdo,'' or ``Lefty''
because of its unusual course.
</P>
<P>
   Most Atlantic hurricanes approach the Caribbean islands from the
south or east, and savvy residents have learned to build towns,
ports and homes on the protected north and west sides of their
islands. Lenny's approach from the west meant huge waves and
damaging winds would torment the heavily populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's strength, course and late-season arrival ``is
unheard of,'' Puerto Rican meteorologist John Toohey said on radio
station WOSC-AM. ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted for French St. Martin, Dutch St.
Maarten, Anguilla, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda,
St. Barthelemy, St. Eustatius, Saba, Puerto Rico and the U.S. and
British Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny also disrupted the efforts of Tori Munden, a Kentucky
lawyer attempting to become the first American _ and woman _ to row
solo across the Atlantic. Munden began her journey in September in
the Canary Islands off Africa and was only 400 miles from her
destination, Guadeloupe, when Lenny's waves reportedly began
hampering her progress.

   Dr. Daniel Nathans, a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist who
pioneered the use of scalpels in analyzing DNA, a technique that
helped create the biotechnology industry, died on Tuesday at his
home in Baltimore. He was 71 and had taught at Johns Hopkins
University for 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said his son Jeremy.
</P>
<P>
   Nathans was chairman of the department of microbiology at Johns
Hopkins and was its interim president in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is shaped like a double helix, and Nathans broke apart the
long twisted strands of DNA molecules by using what is known as the
restriction enzyme technique. Then he reconstructed the molecules
in different combinations to help solve basic problems in biology.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist's greatest reward, Nathans said, ``is seeing your
discovery lead to some practical application.''
</P>
<P>
   His research did, in spades.
</P>
<P>
   Nathans produced ``one of the most fundamental tools in modern
genetics research,'' said Dr. Victor McKusick, a leading geneticist
and the former chairman of medicine at Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan's research also provided the groundwork for the worldwide
effort to map the human genome. ``Indeed, the human genome project
would be impossible without restriction enzymes, and the technique
permitted the first cloning of human genes,'' McKusick said.
</P>
<P>
   And the gene-splicing techniques used to produce drugs like
insulin, growth hormone and interferon came from the research that
Nathans and others did.
</P>
<P>
   Restriction enzymes cut what is being tested in precisely
defined and predictable places. By using a variety of enzymes, each
dissecting in a different specific part of the strand of DNA,
scientists can take apart the double helix bit by bit and study
specific pieces. They can also study the effects of removing a
given piece.
</P>
<P>
   In an industrial application, by splicing genetic instructions
into bacteria, microbes are induced to generate human hormones and
other products.
</P>
<P>
   Until the work of Nathans and others in the 1970s, such products
were produced only by living animals and humans.
</P>
<P>
   Nathans was born in Wilmington, Del., on Oct. 30, 1928. His
parents were immigrants from Russia and his father owned a
five-and-dime store that he lost in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house was cold and leaky, and I learned later my parents
sometimes went hungry, yet they generally managed to retain their
good humor and certainly their hopes for their children,'' Nathans
wrote in a brief biography for the Nobel Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was steered toward medicine at an early age by my father,
who had his heart set on having a physician in the family, and as
the youngest of his eight children, I was his last chance,'' he
said in a graduation speech last year.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the University of Delaware in Newark in 1950
and earned his medical degree from Washington University in St.
Louis in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to return to Wilmington as a family physician, but
after a residency at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New
York City, Nathans chose research. He worked at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., and at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impressed me most was how little was known about the
basic biology of cancer, and how ineffective much of the available
chemotherapy was then,'' Nathans said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, one of his professors in St. Louis, Dr. Barry Wood,
moved to Baltimore and invited Nathans to join the faculty at Johns
Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Wood to lecture students on viruses, Dr. Nathans said
he was impressed through his reading ``that simple viruses had a
profound and permanent effect on the growth of cells in culture or
in a living animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathans' early research focused first on viruses that cause
tumors in animals and then on cellular responses to growth factors,
the mechanisms that cause cells to grow and multiply.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Nathans spent six months at the Weizmann Institute in
Israel working on animal cells and viruses. There, he received a
letter from a Johns Hopkins colleague, Dr. Hamilton O. Smith, who
had discovered a restriction enzyme that cut the DNA of a bacterium
at specific sites along the double helix.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Nathans was working with SV40, a small tumor virus
that causes cancer in primates and makes cells in tissue culture
become cancerous. ``That letter stimulated me to think of using
restriction enzymes to analyze the genes of SV40,'' Nathans said.
He also used the enzymes to break up the DNA found in cancer cells
in an effort to learn what made them different from normal cells.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan found that the restriction enzyme cut the simian virus in
10 places, creating 11 well-defined fragments. Then he found ways
to use the cutting technique to help determine where genes began
and ended in the DNA of the virus. This helped him locate a gene in
the virus that gives the order for production of a tumor-making
protein.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Nathans shared a Nobel Prize in Medicine with Smith and
Dr. Werner Arber of Basel, Switzerland. Arber had discovered the
type of restriction enzymes that dismantle genetic material at
specific points. The Nobel selection committee at the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm predicted that their work would help in the
prevention and treatment of malformations, hereditary disease and
cancer. Restriction enzymes have led to the now-standard prenatal
tests for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia and many other genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Nathans won the nation's highest scientific award, the
National Medal of Science. He was also a member of the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Nathans said his father measured his words carefully and
was not gregarious.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his son Jeremy, a molecular biologist at Johns
Hopkins, Dr. Nathans is survived by his wife, Joanne Gomberg
Nathans; two other sons, Eli, a lawyer who is becoming a historian
at Johns Hopkins, and Benjamin, a professor of European history at
the University of Pennsylvania; and six grandchildren.

NTT PLANS TO CUT 21,000 JOBS IN EFFORT TO BE MORE NIMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, one of the world's
largest phone companies, officially confirmed Wednesday that it
planned to eliminate 21,000 jobs and sharply curtail investment
over the next three years in an effort to enhance its
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had been expected; unions representing NTT
employees leaked word of the plans a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cutback is a strong sign that measures
undertaken by many Japanese businesses to become more efficient are
pressuring even the most stalwart companies to change.
</P>
<P>
   NTT was once the government-owned monopoly for domestic
telephone services. Now, smaller competitors like DDI and Japan
Telecom as well as foreign companies like Cable and Wireless and
British Telecom are pressing NTT to cut costs and change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   The company was recently forced to cut the price of a flat-rate
Internet access service to roughly $75 a month at current exchange
rates, almost half the price it had originally intended to charge.
</P>
<P>
   Others have plans to charge even less. SpeedNet, a joint venture
of Tokyo Electric Power and Microsoft, is hoping to offer consumers
a $48 monthly Internet access service, and Sony is moving to offer
wireless Internet access service in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   NTT's job cuts will be done Japanese style, through attrition,
hiring freezes and what is known as shukko, or pushing excess
workers onto affiliates. NTT, which has 224,000 employees
throughout its affiliates and subsidiaries, said it would send
employees only to growing affiliates, like the NTT Mobile
Communications Network and NTT Data.
</P>
<P>
   Junichiro Miyazu, the president of NTT, made it clear that the
company had no intention of adopting Western-style tactics in job
elimination. ``Sales at NTT East and West are falling, but we will
keep people there who we hired when we were making money from the
telephone business,'' he said, referring to the two entities under
the NTT umbrella that provide local fixed-line service.
</P>
<P>
   The company's plans to cut capital spending by 900 billion yen,
about $8.5 billion at current exchange rates, underscored the
economy's heavy dependence on government spending. Last week, the
government announced an $18 billion economic stimulus package, but
if companies like NTT continue to keep a lid on spending, it may
have to come up with a similar size package sometime next year.

CLINTON AGREES TO CUT AS SIDES INCH CLOSER TO FINAL BUDGET DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed Wednesday to 0.38 percent
across-the-board cut in federal spending as White House and
Republican negotiators put the finishing touches on a final budget
deal after nearly seven weeks of talks.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiators on both sides cited some confusion over how the
cuts would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   There were also signs that disputes among senators over dairy
pricing policy could delay a Senate vote on a final bill aimed at
settling remaining budget issues for the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, House and Senate Republican leaders instructed
their staffs to draw up one large omnibus spending bill, based on a
tentative deal, totaling nearly $390 billion and covering seven
government departments in hopes of pushing it to a vote in the
House on Thursday and in the Senate by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will read that bill to ensure that Republicans kept
commitments they made to the president, especially on teachers,
police officers, the environment,'' White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some confusion over the final details of negotiations,
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said he was ready to
vote for the negotiated budget package based on what he had seen
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, I think it is a favorable agreement if we can
get the final details done,'' Gephardt told reporters, adding that
he would insist that the cuts be carefully targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also hailed the tentative deal as a winner, claiming
that the across-the-board cut of less than four-tenths of a percent
would keep Congress from dipping into the Social Security Trust
Fund to help pay for increased spending in some government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to have an across-the-board (cut) to show our
absolute determination not to dip into the Social Security Trust
Fund,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already signed into law eight of the 13 annual
appropriations bills needed to keep the government running. But the
five remaining bills have been tied up in negotiations since the
start of the 2000 fiscal year Oct. 1, and Congress has had to pass
a series of five temporary spending measures to keep most
government offices open.
</P>
<P>
   The last of those stopgap measures expired at midnight
Wednesday, and Congress was forced to approve a sixth one to
prevent a government shutdown. But that measure runs only through
midnight Thursday, so in all likelihood a seventh stopgap measure
will have to be passed Thursday to enable Congress to complete its
work on the budget and adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to wrap up a final budget agreement, Clinton agreed
in an early morning phone call Wednesday with House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., to accept a 0.38 percent across-the-board cut in
spending. The cut, which Republicans will use to bolster their
claim that they did all they could to avoid using Social Security
money to pay for spending in other areas, will amount to $1.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials said Clinton insisted in his talk with
Hastert that the Democrats would have to accept the cut as well,
and that he would have to be given ``very flexible use'' of his
authority to make sure that the reductions don't hurt vital
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were still trying to figure out how to ``target''
the cuts Wednesday night so they would be acceptable to Clinton and
Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, one of the key negotiators, said
Republicans had agreed to provide some flexibility in how the cuts
are administered. He also said that no department would be allowed
to trim more than 5 percent from any one program as
the-across-the-board reduction is implemented. In addition, he said
negotiators had agreed that no military or civil service personnel
would lose their jobs as a result of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If the cuts are included in the final bill, it would be a
political victory of sorts for Republicans, mainly because Clinton
_ only two weeks ago _ vetoed a bill containing a 1 percent
across-the-board proposal. He called the cut ``mindless'' and
``excessive'' at the time and vowed to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The across-the-board cut is just one of several tools that will
apparently be used to pay for about $6.5 billion in additional
spending next year that Clinton and the Republicans agreed to in
their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find more savings, the two sides also agreed to
delay a payday for the military and some civil service personnel
scheduled for Sept. 30 next year until Oct. 1. The move would
technically push the payday into the 2001 fiscal year, resulting in
a savings in 2000 spending of more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the cost of the rest of the new spending, the
negotiators agreed to transfer money from a Federal Reserve's
foreign currency account to the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the last-minute haggling over how to implement the cuts,
Gephardt said a final bill would honor the commitments made by
Clinton and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president got his priorities and we got our
priorities of (more money for hiring) police (and) teachers. We got
rid of the (anti-regulatory) environmental riders. We got some good
provisions on foreign affairs that we think are important, like
paying our U.N. dues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a final bill does pass the House today, it could
still get bogged down in the Senate, where senators have threatened
to filibuster a final spending package if it does not include a
provision changing the way milk prices are set.
</P>
<P>
   That issues is likely to be debated when the bill reaches the
Senate floor. But in the end, it is not likely to be included as
part of the final 2000 spending package.

CONNECTICUT TO SUE POWER PLANTS, CITING SMOG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ky., Ohio, Va., WVa.)  (js) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following similar moves by New York and federal officials,
Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said Wednesday
that he intends to sue 16 coal-burning power plants in five states
to force them to reduce pollution believed to cause smog and acid
rain in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is the latest in a flurry of recent legal
actions by state and federal law enforcement officials to reduce
air pollution from smokestacks in the Midwest that, according to
federal studies, is carried by wind currents into the highly
polluted New York region and on to New England. Two months ago, New
York's attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, sent letters to the same
coal-burning power plants that Connecticut has focused on _ in
Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia _ notifying
them of his intent to sue them in federal court for violating
emissions standards stipulated in the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3, in what federal officials called one of the largest
enforcement actions in the nation's history, the Justice Department
announced legal and administrative proceedings against 32
coal-fired power plants in 10 states in the Midwest and the South.
The legal actions are intended to force power companies to abide by
provisions of the Clean Air Act that require upgrades of older
coal-fired plants to include new pollution controls that reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, compounds that
cause smog and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other suits brought or pending against the power
plants, Connecticut's claims the power plants have failed to
accompany the upgrades of their turbines and boilers with the
expensive new pollution-cutting equipment required by law,
Blumenthal said. As a result of the upgrades, the largest plants he
intends to sue have increased their coal consumption by 50 percent
to 75 percent in the last two or three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Blumenthal said his office would work
closely with Spitzer's to mount a case against the power companies.
``We'll be using a lot of the same documentation and research,''
Blumenthal said. ``My hope is that there will be other states that
will join us. The added weight of an increasing number of states
may force these plants to do the right thing and obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's suits will be filed in federal courts in each of
the five states where the power plants operate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wooley, counsel to the Clean Air Task Force, said the
attorneys general will need to demonstrate how the plants' upgrades
caused an increase in pollutants not attributable to other, routine
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the coal-fired plants Wednesday accused
Connecticut of ``piling on'' to the Midwest plants' legal battles
instead of focusing on reducing its home-grown pollution. ``We have
an awfully hard time trying to understand where Connecticut is
coming from with this kind of litigation,'' said David M. Flannery,
a lawyer for the Midwest Ozone Group.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Justice Department joined the legal fray earlier
this month, Flannery added, ``It makes it especially curious that
Connecticut thinks it has to step in and pursue this.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who linked the eastward-drifting air pollution from
the plants to water quality problems in the Long Island Sound and
to asthma rates in Connecticut, said his suit was necessary to
protect the state's citizens and resources.

 McDONALD'S TO CONVERT ITS DIVIDENDS  
 (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   McDonald's, a company that grew rich by selling 15-cent
hamburgers, is tired of sending small change to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food chain announced Wednesday that it would pay its
final quarterly dividend, 4.875 cents a share, on Dec. 15. It will
convert to an annual dividend beginning in December 2000, with the
amount to be decided by the board then.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all American companies that pay dividends do so
quarterly, as McDonald's has done until now. But it is following
the lead of Walt Disney, another company that has many shareholders
with just a few shares; Disney shifted to annual dividends a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's has about 900,000 shareholders who own 1.3 billion
shares. Even with most shareholders keeping their shares in
brokerage accounts, to which dividend payments are transferred
electronically, and others using its dividend reinvestment plan,
McDonald's still issues about 110,000 dividend checks each time it
makes a payment.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Ebling, a McDonald's spokesman, said that just over half
of those checks are issued to shareholders with 20 or fewer shares,
meaning the quarterly check is for less than $1. The company's
announcement said that it would save an undisclosed amount of money
in processing costs and that shareholders ``will no longer be
inconvenienced with handling dividend checks for very small
amounts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, in an attempt to reduce the number of small
shareholders, McDonald's offered to repurchase shares from owners
who had fewer than 50 shares. Few of the small owners took the
company up on the offer, and Ebling said the company had no plans
to repeat it. ``We are very happy to have small shareholders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both McDonald's and Disney are companies well known to children,
and many of the small shareholdings reflect gifts of a small number
of shares to children by parents or grandparents hoping to interest
them in investing.
</P>
<P>
   That interest may have been increased by the fact that both
companies have excellent long-term records. But Disney's record has
slipped this year _ presumably not because of its changed dividend
policy _ and its share price is down 12 percent in 1999. If the
price does not rally, it will be the first down year for the stock
since 1993. Shares in McDonald's fell 6.25 cents, to $46.125
Wednesday, but are still up 20.1 percent in 1999.

NOVEL SET IN CHINA WINS NATIONAL BOOK AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Waiting,'' by Ha Jin, a novel set in contemporary
China, about a man struggling with the conflicting claims of two
women, won the National Book Award for fiction Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The winner for nonfiction was ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the
Wake of World War II'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Company/The New Press) by
John W. Dower, about the transformation of Japan into a democracy
under American occupation. The poetry prize went to the dramatic
monologues about urban life in ``Vice: New and Selected Poems''
(W.W. Norton &AMP; Company) by Ai.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Zachary Beaver Came to Town,'' (Henry Holt and Company)
by Kimberly Willis Holt, a coming-of-age story about a 13-year-old
boy who is obese, won the award for young people's literature.
</P>
<P>
   Ha Jin, the author of ``Waiting,'' which is published by
Pantheon Books, served for six years in the People's Liberation
Army of his native China, and came to the United States in 1985. He
is a professor of English at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
National Book Foundation, the sponsor of the awards, was held at
the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan. The talk show host Oprah
Winfrey, a powerful figure in the book world because of Oprah's
Book Club, received a 50th Anniversary Medal from the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than movie stars and rock stars and famous politicians
and world leaders,'' she said, ``I love authors. I love authors
because in the beginning was the word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of you here who are liberated by the word,'' she said,
``God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey founded her book blub in 1996, and since then being
chosen for the club has been almost a guarantee that a book will be
a best seller. Ms. Winfrey remembered calling up Wally Lamb, author
of ``She's Come Undone,'' whose novel was one of her selections,
and he was doing his laundry.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revelation, Ms. Winfrey said. ``Authors do laundry!''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian Steve Martin, who served as master of ceremonies at
the dinner, said that at first when he was asked to be the host of
the event, he thought it was for the National Basketball
Association. But, Martin said, ``I really wanted to come here
tonight because I thought it would be a good way to troll for
intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please keep your acceptance speeches short, especially if you
don't win,'' Martin told the audience of more than 1,000 people,
including 35 past winners, and 17 writers who attended the first
National Book Award ceremony in 1950 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Notably missing from this year's nominations were two of the
industry's biggest books this year. ``Dutch,'' a semi-fictional
biography of Ronald Reagan by Edmund Morris, and ``'Tis,'' the
sequel to Frank McCourt's best selling memoir, ``Angela's Ashes''
both failed to get nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mergers in the publishing industry, the Foundation said
it received nominations from a record number of imprints. Eight
hundred and eighty one titles were submitted, somewhat fewer than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Winners in each category receive a $10,000 cash award and
crystal sculpture.

MORGAN ENTERS CRITICAL SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Wayne Morgan's Long Beach State 49ers had
just cruised to a 41-point win in an exhibition game against a team
even less challenging than the Washington Generals, and you readily
can understand why the 49ers are the preseason picks to win the Big
West.
</P>
<P>
   They displayed all the requisite ingredients needed for such an
achievement: speed, quickness, enthusiasm, teamwork, accurate
shooting, strong rebounding, deft passing and athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a team that seems to have everything, but it also has
Wayne Morgan as its head coach. And, as Morgan enters his fourth
season with the 49ers, it's not known for sure if he's a good
coach, a bad coach, a mediocre coach, or a coach somewhere among
these variants.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line with Morgan during his 36-46 Long Beach
incumbency is that none of his teams has had a winning season and
each of them has had agonizing periods of underachieving and
disorientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you we're going to have a winning season, barring
some sort of natural catastrophe,'' promised Morgan moments after
his team had posted its 117-76 win over something called the Global
All Stars Tuesday night at the Pyramid. ``This is definitely the
best team I've had since I've been here. We have good depth. We
have a group of players on the same page determined to win ... ''
</P>
<P>
   So, as the 49ers get set to open their season Saturday afternoon
at Pepperdine, optimism blooms brightly for a change around
Morgan's program that has surpassed its quota of bleak moments.
</P>
<P>
   His two starting forwards, Antrone Lee and the heralded junior
college transfer, James Williams, both are exceptional leapers who
can score from all angles, with Williams having the potential to be
a dominant performer.
</P>
<P>
   His center, Mate Milisa, is sound fundamentally and can drop in
three pointers, as he did on two occasions against Global.
</P>
<P>
   His off-guard, Ramel (Rock) Lloyd, is a natural scorer who is
particularly effective in the open court and now seems to be
playing with more discipline.
</P>
<P>
   His starting point guard, Charles O'Neal, missed the Global
exhibition because of influenza, but his two sharp-passing backups,
Ron Johnson and Keith Felton, ran the 49ers' offense expertly and
collected 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   His top three reserves, Grant Stone, who can rebound, Brad
Smith, who can shoot three pointers, and D'Cean Bryant, who can do
a little of everything, all played admirably against Global.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers should
</P>
<P>
   win the undernourished Big West, and Wayne Morgan should
</P>
<P>
   , finally, silence the growing legion of community critics that
has become hopelessly restless from the prolonged losing of his
teams that has seriously impacted home attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to have a positive, winning season,'' says Bill
Shumard, the 49ers' athletic director who came thisclose (cq)
</P>
<P>
   to firing Morgan last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I've seen so far,'' says Dr. Robert Maxson, the
Long Beach State president credited with saving Morgan's job.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's no certainty the 49ers will cover themselves with
glory this winter, and no one is under more pressure to succeed
than Morgan, in the fourth year of a five year contract that he
might not be allowed to finish if his team disappoints again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the 49ers have had three straight losing years, do
you consider this the most challenging season of your coaching
career?'' I asked Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career at Long Beach has been challenging,'' he
replied tersely.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly has been and we're not just talking about the 46
losses that nearly included an awfully embarrassing one last season
against, of all schools, Cal State Dominguez Hills.
</P>
<P>
   In Wayne Morgan's defense, he inherited a few players from the
former regime who weren't exactly model citizens and caused serious
team discord.
</P>
<P>
   His teams also have been bedeviled by untimely injuries, but
even Morgan now concedes there are no more excuses to be offered.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are with the exception of O'Neal at peak health and
Morgan personally recruited all the players on his roster, with the
exception of the fifth-year senior Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Morgan, like all coaches, doesn't put much credence
into preseason polls, especially in the one that has his team
favored to win the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not shoo-ins,'' he said. ``New Mexico State has everyone
coming back from last year's team. We have nothing yet to
celebrate. Let's face it, we've had three straight losing seasons,
and we still have to prove ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we will turn it around this season. We have the
players I want. It's a good group that seems to want to win. What I
like about these players is that they come to practice to learn and
to get better, not just to survive. I'm excited about this season.
Very excited.''

TROJANS, BRUINS ON DISPLAY FOR RECRUITS

   LOS ANGELES _ Officially, it will be USC's turn on Saturday to
play recruiting host to most of the top prep football seniors in
Southern California. But don't think it will just be the Trojans
trying to impress the recruits when they play host to UCLA at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said, ``all the good
players in Southern California will be at the game. Sure, they all
say they are there to see USC (which provides the tickets). But
they will be there to take a look at both teams to help in their
decision. There's a huge amount at stake for our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Toledo, who put together two consecutive national Top 10
recruiting classes, knows very well what a ninth consecutive
victory over his team's chief rival would do to help sway a
prospect to Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is all about this rivalry in football,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several of California's top players that still have
both USC and UCLA on their list. And many of them are expected to
attend Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A small list of that group could include Harvard-Westlake tight
end Alex Holmes (6-4, 280), San Diego Mira Mesa quarterback-tight
end-defensive end Teyo Johnson (6-6, 242) and linebacker Amon
Gordon (6-3, 265), Newport Harbor offensive lineman Blair Jones
(6-7, 244), Dominguez offensive lineman Brandon Lockheart (6-6,
330) and safety Kevin Burnett (6-2, 220), Sherman Oaks Notre Dame
defensive lineman Travis Johnson (6-4, 265), Temescal Canyon
defensive lineman Nathan Goodson (6-4, 250), Mater Dei safety Matt
Grootegoed (6-0, 200) and St. Paul cornerback Mike Holloway (6-3,
190).
</P>
<P>
   A player whom both schools wanted but has already made up his
mind is Valencia running back Manuel White. The 6-foot-2, 220-pound
bruising tailback said earlier this week that he plans on becoming
a Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   USC appears to be close to adding a pair of junior college
players to its list of commitments. Orange Coast College fullback
Jimmie Banks (6-1, 250) and Palomar College cornerback Chris Cash
(5-11, 180) are reportedly close to committing to the Trojans, but
neither will be at the USC-UCLA contest because they have games of
their own to play.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bruins score big
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend was equally important for UCLA as the Bruins
welcomed several key recruits to watch the upset win over
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors included receiver Ronnie Rodamer (6-4, 190) of
Morgantown, W.Va. and defensive tackle Stevie Lee (6-4, 260) and
safety Phillip Geiggar (6-2, 190) of nationally top ranked
Shreveport (La.) Evangel Christian. Rodamer has UCLA and Tennessee
as his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento Christian running back Albert Hollis, who committed
to UCLA early but has since wavered, was also at the game as were
Grootegoed, Holmes, Travis Johnson and Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   __ Devil of a time
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State picked up its seventh commitment when Canyon
Springs offensive lineman Chad Rosson (6-7, 260) announced he
intends on becoming a Sun Devil. Rosson, who was high school
teammates with ASU freshman linebacker Solomon Bates, also
considered Oregon, Oregon State and Washington State.

PHILIP MORRIS GIFTS TO ALBANY LAWMAKERS PUT FOCUS ON ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night in March 1997, a group of New York state legislators
dined at a French restaurant in Albany called Nicole's Bistro, and
when the bill for $1,818.20 arrived, none of them had to reach for
it. The meal came courtesy of Philip Morris' chief lobbyist in New
York, who has long been a popular and generous dining companion
around the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyist, Sharon Portnoy, will not be picking up the check
again for lawmakers any time soon. Settling an inquiry by the state
lobbying commission, Philip Morris last week paid a record fine of
$75,000 and acknowledged that it had repeatedly falsified or failed
to report its lobbying expenditures under the state's lobbying law.
Ms. Portnoy was fined $15,000 and barred from lobbying on state
matters for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying commission did not examine the conduct of the
lawmakers who dined at Nicole's or that of their colleagues who
have accepted gifts from the tobacco giant in recent years. The
rules regarding gifts fall under a separate state ethics law. And
while some advocacy groups call the lobbying law inadequate, they
contend that the ethics law is even weaker. The lawmakers
themselves are required to police it, but they do not, the groups
say.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics law prohibits legislators from accepting meals and
other gifts of $75 or more if they are intended to influence the
legislators' decisions. Documents released in the lobbying case
show that since 1996, roughly 60 members of the 211-member state
Legislature have accepted gifts of $75 or more from Philip Morris.
The gifts ranged from tickets to the ballet to expensive meals in
Albany and places like El San Juan Hotel and Casino in Puerto Rico
and the Colony Surf Hotel in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous lawmakers are listed more than once in the documents.
The company described most of the gifts as worth between $75 and
$125 each; none was valued at more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing extraordinary about an Albany lobbyist buying a
meal or tickets to a Yankee game for a lawmaker. But the disclosure
of Philip Morris' gifts has highlighted the extent of the practice
and provided new ammunition to advocacy groups and a handful of
renegade lawmakers who want the Legislature to approve a ban on
gifts from lobbyists in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris gifts are one pillar in an expensive lobbying
campaign that has made the company a formidable presence in the
State Capitol for much of the decade. Ms. Portnoy and the company's
other lobbyists have frequently persuaded lawmakers to block
legislation that could hurt its profits by, for example,
prohibiting smoking in restaurants or raising cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several lawmakers who accepted the gifts said
they had not violated the ethics law. Some disputed the cost listed
for their meals. (In its records, Philip Morris divided the total
for the meal by the number of people present; for instance, at
Nicole's, the cost was listed as $90.91 per person). Others said
they did not know that Ms. Portnoy was paying, or that if they did,
they considered the meals social, not lobbying, events, so the
money was not spent to influence them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I am very much offended by the fact that Philip Morris has
apparently conveyed information which implies that we violated the
law when in no way in my awareness was that ever done,'' said state
Sen. Roy Goodman, R- Manhattan, who said that while he might have
been at the Nicole's dinner and one other paid for by Ms. Portnoy,
he did not believe that his meals exceeded the $75 limit.
</P>
<P>
   While that was a common sentiment among those on the list, it
was ridiculed by advocacy groups that want the Legislature to
follow the lead of other states and the U.S. House of
Representatives by enacting a ban. They said that to debate the
exact value of a gift missed the point: lawmakers should not accept
any favors from people seeking to sway votes.
</P>
<P>
   The groups point out that lawmakers receive a stipend for
expenses while in Albany on state business _ now $110 a day. When
lobbyists treat lawmakers to meals, the lawmakers are not required
to return any of the stipend to state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ethics law was approved in the late 1980s, no lawmaker
has been sanctioned for accepting illegal gifts or breaking any
other provision of the statute, which carries a maximum penalty of
a $10,000 civil fine or a misdemeanor charge. Donors also are
subject to the law, but none have been penalized.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Ethics Committee, which enforces the law and is
comprised of eight legislators from both major political parties,
has traditionally acted with the stealth of a Congressional
intelligence panel. The ethics committee's members typically
decline to discuss their inquiries or even to say when they meet.
</P>
<P>
   Three advocacy groups _ Common Cause New York, the New York
Public Interest Research Group and the League of Women Voters of
New York State _ filed a complaint with the ethics committee
earlier this week, urging it to investigate the lawmakers, as well
as Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics committee members would not comment on the Philip Morris
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the committee's eight members have been identified by
Philip Morris as having received gifts. One, state Sen. James Lack,
R- Suffolk, is listed as having often accepted items of $75 or
more.

   In an interview, Lack said such meals did not affect his votes.
He declined to comment on the committee or say whether he supported
tighter lobbying or ethics restrictions. ``I have an opinion,'' he
said. ``I prefer to discuss it with my colleagues first.''
</P>
<P>
   The other four members were described in internal company
documents as having accepted gifts, but their value could not be
determined. Those members are Assemblyman H. Robert Nortz, an
upstate Republican; State Senator George Onorato, D-ueens; state
Sen. William Stachowski, D- Buffalo; and Assemblywoman Helene
Weinstein, D-Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Nortz and Onorato did not respond to two telephone messages left
at their offices seeking comment.

<P>
   Ms. Weinstein said that in general, she believed that lawmakers
were being unfairly characterized as beholden to those who treated
them to meals or other items.
</P>
<P>
   Stachowski said, ``I think that the $75 rule now is just fine.''

BT ALEX. BROWN AGREES TO PAY $15.3 MILLION IN BOND CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that BT
Alex. Brown Inc. had agreed to pay $15.3 million to settle
allegations that the brokerage firm defrauded the federal
government and the state of Pennsylvania in municipal bond
transactions in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is the largest yet won by federal officials, who
have been investigating accusations that several Wall Street firms
engaged in ``yield burning,'' or profiting heavily by vastly
inflating the prices of government securities.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its investigation, the SEC also charged six people,
including the former head of public finance at BT Alex. Brown and a
key adviser to the former state treasurer of Pennsylvania, and
three other companies with participating in the alleged scheme,
which SEC officials said included influence peddling and
undisclosed financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In resolving its case, BT Alex. Brown, now a unit of Deutsche
Bank, also reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service
and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, both
of which had been investigating the case. The firm said it neither
acknowledged nor denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the case, the SEC filed a securities fraud complaint
against Patrick H. McCarthy III for his role in two bond offerings
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said that although he was not a state employee, McCarthy
used his influence as a fund-raiser and key adviser to the former
state treasurer, Catherine Baker Knoll, to influence state
decisions and steer business to Alex. Brown on the condition that
the brokerage firm agree to split its fees with the state's
financial adviser, Arthurs Lestrange &AMP; Co., a Pittsburgh brokerage
firm. The SEC said that McCarthy then arranged to have a consultant
to the financial adviser make a payment to his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC does not contend that either Alex. Brown or the
financial adviser were aware of the payments to McCarthy's law
firm. But the agency said McCarthy failed to disclose the
compensation that his law firm received to the state of
Pennsylvania. No state officials were charged with wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, a prominent Pennsylvania lawyer, could not be reached
for comment Wednesday. But his lawyer issued a statement on his
behalf that read, ``Rather than face years of litigation and
attendant legal fees, my family and I decided to move on with our
lives.'' McCarthy agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000; his
law firm repaid $172,000 to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the SEC also reached settlements totaling more
than $500,000 with several former employees of Alex. Brown; two
consulting firms, HDI Inc. and JMS Associates Inc.; and Arthurs
Lestrange.

GIRL SCOUTS SETTLE BIAS CLAIM OF GIRL WITH HIV 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Girl Scouts settled a human rights complaint this week that
accused them of excluding a 9-year-old girl from at least five
troops in upstate New York because she was infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. The Scouts admitted no wrongdoing but
agreed not to bar girls like her in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was believed to be the first claiming that a Girl
Scout or Boy Scout organization discriminated against a person with
the human immunodeficiency virus.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides Wednesday would not discuss the case or
indicate whether a monetary settlement was involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Legal Action Center of New York City had filed the complaint
last March with the state Division of Human Rights on behalf of
Quashawn Donovan, now a fourth grader, who lives in Queensbury, a
rural town about 50 miles north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack Council of the Girl Scouts and the Girl Scouts of
the United States of America were named in the complaint, which
alleged violations of the state's human rights law. Neither the
council nor the national organization admitted that any unlawful
discrimination had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Dianne Donovan, said in a statement released
Wednesday that the Adirondack Council would revise its policy to
ensure that volunteers understand that girls may not be denied
admission to a troop or discriminated against because of their HIV
status. The council also has set up a comprehensive education
program for troop leaders and staff members regarding HIV
transmission, universal precautions and the organization's
nondiscrimination policy, Mrs. Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Donovan expressed pleasure that the ``matter was resolved
amicably.'' The complaint arose after troop leaders rescinded an
invitation to allow Quashawn to join a troop last November after
they learned that the girl was HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   The troop's co-leader told the girl's mother that the troop was
full, the complaint said, but the leader later admitted that she
and her co-leader feared that other Scouts would leave the troop
out of fear that they could contract the virus from Quashawn.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of several other troops refused to admit Quashawn
because of similar fears, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   The national Girl Scouts organization had been accused in the
complaint of failing to take the necessary action to halt the
discrimination. The organization will continue to investigate
complaints of alleged HIV discrimination and to take appropriate
action, Mrs. Donovan's statement said.

VODAFONE'S BOARD TO DEBATE AN OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The board of Vodafone Airtouch PLC is scheduled to meet
Thursday to weigh paying as much as $125 billion in a takeover of
German rival Mannesmann AG, executives close to the British company
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That amount, equivalent to 240 euros ($249.84) a share, would be
the largest unsolicited bid ever, eclipsing the record $106.4
billion Vodafone offered Sunday, which Mannesmann rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Vodafone stressed that it would not decide
on a final bid price until the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone chief executive Christopher Gent pledged Tuesday to
press ahead with an offer and warned that his company, the world's
largest mobile phone operator, would make a hostile bid if
Mannesmann resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is expected to bring its bid to Mannesmann's board on
Friday, according to executives close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone also hired Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to advise on
its bid after its main adviser, Goldman, Sachs, stepped aside.
Mannesmann has contended Goldman betrayed confidential information,
obtained in earlier dealings, to Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann is also considering going to court to have the
Vodafone bid thrown out because of the Goldman allegation,
executives close to Mannesmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shares fell 5.3 percent Wednesday, to 196.65 euros
($204.71).
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Vodafone rose 1.9 percent Wednesday to 277 pence
($4.50) in London.

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Two years ago, Krupp ignited a political
firestorm in Germany by attempting a hostile takeover of its rival
in the steel industry, Thyssen AG.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, as Vodafone Airtouch of Britain contemplates the
biggest hostile takeover of all time, a $100-billion-lus bid for
Mannesmann AG, the reaction here is far different.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders have not tried to intervene. Germany's biggest
banks and insurers, which have a long tradition of rescuing
troubled companies, have largely been passive.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who blocked a steel merger several
years ago when he was the state premier of Lower Saxony, indicated
this week that Mannesmann must fend for itself. ``Whoever wants to
buy a British company, like Mannesmann with Orange, can't say
`We're allowed and they are not,''' Schroeder said this week.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, hostile takeovers still run against a deeply
ingrained habit in Germany of seeking consensus _ one that has
created a clubby, often impenetrable web of cross-links among
banks, industrial conglomerates and sometimes even government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Vodafone bid has aroused alarm in some quarters.
Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German Chamber of Industry and
Commerce, has repeatedly assailed an unwanted bid as nothing more
than a shortsighted attempt to break up one of Germany's most
successful companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a major departure from German business leaders' hostility to
regulation, Stihl has proposed that the government prohibit
``destructive takeovers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is not whether the takeover is hostile or
friendly,'' said Axel Koblitz, who oversees the association's work
on antitrust issues. ``The issue here is the breakup of a very
successful and healthy company. That's what gives us concern.''
</P>
<P>
   But in corporate Europe of the last year or two, those views
have been the exception. Europeans have seen hostile takeovers of
Telecom Italia SpA, the French oil company Elf Aquitaine and the
financial services company Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, German companies have become among the world's
most acquisitive. Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler Corp.; Deutsche Bank
bought Bankers Trust; the chemical and pharmaceutical company
Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer in the situation that we were in a few years
ago,'' said Norbert Walter, chief economist of Deutsche Bank.
``Within the country and within Europe, events like this have
become familiar. People recognize that an unwanted takeover is a
form of negotiation _ a different form of negotiation, but one that
can also be orderly.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an enormous change. When the Krupp steel group attempted
a hostile takeover of Thyssen in 1997, labor unions and politicians
from steel-making regions assailed the effort as ``casino
capitalism.'' Helmut Kohl, who was the the chancellor, telephoned
the head of Deutsche Bank, which was financing Krupp's offer, and
told him to engineer a friendly compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many executives and deal makers now view the Krupp battle
as a watershed. As events worked out, Krupp and Thyssen negotiated
a friendly merger of just their steel operations and then later
merged their other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In Vodafone's takeover plan, the most contentious issue, at
least so far, is not the presumed hostile nature but rather the
expected price.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich Hocker, president of Germany's biggest advocacy group for
small investors, has fiercely criticized the anticipated Vodafone
offer for its size.
</P>
<P>
   Hocker is furious that Stihl and the chamber proposed government
prohibitions on ``destructive takeovers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is horrifying that our own Stihl is demanding that our
lawmakers put up legal restrictions,'' he said. ``It cannot be the
government's job to protect badly run companies from competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann has thus far not sought political protection. ``We
have made it clear we don't like hostile offers,'' a spokesman,
Manfred Soehnlein, said. ``But we are not asking for government
restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   German newspapers have greeted the Vodafone battle as evidence
that German corporations are opening up to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The takeover attack from Britain could be a test case for
Germany,'' the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung suggested in an
editorial this week. ``It will show whether Germany remains the
closed industrial club it has been up until now or whether it has
opened up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a company like Mannesmann might have sought
protection with its longtime financier, Deutsche Bank. The bank has
held a significant stake in Mannesmann for years, as well as in
many of Germany's other conglomerates, and it has frequently used
its position to foil deals it disliked.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Bank has made no move to raise its stake in
Mannesmann or even to assert an opinion about the Vodafone offer.
``We are treating this just the way any other shareholder would,''
said bank spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   For institutional investors in Germany, the only real issue is
price. Mannesmann's shares are widely distributed, with more than
half in the hands of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   A German fund manager said he would not be interested in selling
unless the British company raised the price to at least 250 euros a
share, or around $130 billion in all. Mannesmann shares closed
Wednesday at 196.65 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Vodafone's offer is expected to be entirely in stock
rather than cash, he said, Vodafone will have to pay a very high
premium over Mannesmann's current market price to be credible.
</P>
<P>
   Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said the possibility
of hostile bids is now a fact of life for German corporations,
especially those with international aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be a global player,'' he said, ``it is obvious
that those who hold shares have to be able to make up their own
minds after they've been informed. The only practical alternative
is to invite government interference, and inviting government
interference would make more problems.''

JURORS DELIBERATE LATE INTO THE NIGHT IN JASPER CASE

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Jurors deliberated late into the night Wednesday
in the capital murder case of Shawn Berry, the last of three white
men to be tried in last year's gruesome dragging death of a black
man.
</P>
<P>
   If the deliberations went on too late, state District Judge Joe
Bob Golden intended to sequester the jury in a local motel for the
night and order them back to the Jasper County Courthouse on
Thursday. The all-white jury of seven women and five men is trying
to decide whether Berry is guilty of capital murder, murder or
whether he was not responsible for the death of James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister Betty Boatner said she was prepared for whatever
the jury would say. Even if Berry is acquitted, he eventually will
have to answer to God, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a higher court to go to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 24, admitted during his trial that he invited Byrd _ 49
years old, disabled and inebriated the night of June 7, 1998 _ into
his truck with two white supremacists, Bill King and Russell Brewer
Jr. Berry drove the three of them to the East Texas woods where
Byrd was beaten, chained and dragged to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Berry denied participating in the crime. He said it was King,
25, and Brewer, 32, who attacked Byrd, and he was too frightened to
intervene because King had threatened to kill him, too. Berry said
he had no idea what King and Brewer planned to do when they picked
up Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate juror George Coleman, who was released from the jury
when deliberations began at about 12:30 p.m. CDT, said he didn't
believe Berry's story. Had he remained on the jury, Coleman said he
would have voted to convict Berry and sentence him to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a big lie,'' said Coleman, a 26-year-old construction
worker from Buna.
</P>
<P>
   While being questioned during jury selection, Coleman admitted
knowing a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Berry wouldn't have lived
with King, a Klansman, if he didn't hold similar racist views,
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an initiation,'' Coleman said of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also said he didn't believe Berry stood idly by while
Byrd was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes more than two people to hold somebody down and put
chains on his feet,'' Coleman said. ``To me, he had more to do with
it than the others did.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, a theater manager in the racially mixed community of
Jasper, was not known to be a racist. But prosecutors contended
Berry knew King and Brewer were. Both King and Brewer had been
incarcerated and both joined the Confederate Knights of America, a
small racist prison gang. The arms of both men were blackened with
racist tattoos and they talked of starting a race war. During
Berry's trial, jurors saw photographs of King and Brewer's tattoos,
including one on King's arm depicting the lynching of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also had to know King and Brewer were up to no good when
they stopped to pick up Byrd, a divorced father of three, as he
walked along Martin Luther King Boulevard on his way home.
</P>
<P>
   The men drove Byrd to a clearing in the woods, beat and kicked
him and then dragged behind Berry's pickup for more than three
miles. A pathologist testified that for at least two of those
miles, Byrd was conscious and fighting desperately to keep his head
off the pavement. Byrd ground his elbows to the bone in the futile
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's agony ended when his body slammed into a concrete culvert
and he was decapitated. His head, right shoulder and arm were found
in a ditch the next morning. The rest of his body lay about a mile
away, just outside a rural black cemetery on Huff Creek Road.
</P>
<P>
   The crime shocked Jasper residents and prompted armed black
activists and the Ku Klux Klan to march on the community.
</P>
<P>
   The jury contemplated Berry's case behind closed doors for five
straight hours before breaking for dinner. After an hour, the jury
returned to the courthouse and continued discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The juries in the King and Brewer trials did not take near as
long to return verdicts. In King's trial last February, a Jasper
jury with one black member convicted him after only 2 1/2 hours. A
Bryan jury in September convicted Brewer in four hours.
</P>
<P>
   If Berry is convicted of capital murder, which would mean he
both kidnapped and killed Byrd, he would face life in prison or
join his co-defendants on death row. If the jury convicted him of
the lesser charge of murder, Berry could get five years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Berry is acquitted, he will not walk out of the
courthouse a free man. He must answer to a charge that he violated
the terms of probation he received for a burglary conviction by
associating with known felons, Brewer and King.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute closing argument, defense attorney Joseph C.
``Lum'' Hawthorn insisted that Berry had no idea that King was
violent. Hawthorn asked the jury to have the courage to acquit
Berry, just as three blacks and one biracial woman braved public
criticism to take the stand in Berry's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Byrd Jr.'s murder has been avenged,'' Hawthorn said.
``The two people who killed James Byrd Jr. have been tried,
convicted and sentenced to death. Justice has been served.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn reminded jurors that Berry has a 2-year-old son,
Montana, with a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors countered Hawthorn's argument by telling jurors
Berry assaulted the child's mother, Christie Marcontell. On at
least two occasions, Marcontell gave statements to police, saying
Berry hit her, choked her and threatened to throw her off a
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Pat Hardy told jurors Berry was just
as responsible for Byrd's killing as King and Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three people involved in this ... and that man was
the worst of the bunch,'' he said, pointing at Berry. ``As sick as
their beliefs were, King and Brewer, at least they believed in
something. Shawn Berry did all of this for nothing but the fun of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Berry claimed he had no idea why white
supremacists would offer a black man a ride until he heard King
say, ``Let's kill this nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors disputed that account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Berry knew exactly what was going on,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray: ``It was
Shawn Berry's truck, Shawn Berry's chain. It was Shawn Berry (who)
made the decision to pick James Byrd up. Shawn Berry made the
decision to drive out into a remote area. Shawn Berry has got more
blood on him than any one of the three, and it was Shawn Berry
driving that truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the killing, Berry admitted he went to a local
carwash and helped King clean the pickup and the 24-foot logging
chain used to drag Byrd. Berry later led police to a shallow hole
outside a friend's trailer home, where he said King and Brewer hid
the chain. The defense claimed any blood found on Berry's clothes
was splatter from the water used to wash the chain.
</P>
<P>
   Berry gave several conflicting stories to police after his
arrest. The lies were part of his usual pattern of refusing to take
responsibility for his actions, Gray said. Berry did the same thing
when he and King were arrested for their first crime together _ a
burglary that landed both of them in a prison boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't tell the truth. He can't accept responsibility for
what he did,'' Gray said. ``He was the same way in 1992. It was
always somebody else: ``I didn't mean to do that. I was just
there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy was an active participant,'' Gray said, ``just like
the other two.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Byrd family waited pensively for the jury to
reach its decision Wednesday, Byrd's oldest daughter, Francis Renee
Mullins, gave birth to Byrd's second grandchild at a hospital near
her home in Hawaii. The baby will be nicknamed ``Son,'' which was
James Byrd Jr.'s nickname, family members said.

CALIF. CONGRESSIONAL VICTORY; TIMING LOUISIANA'S CAUCUS; SUPPORT

   VICTORY PROVES SWEET, BUT IS NOT SIGNIFICANT
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic victory in Tuesday's special election in
California's 42nd Congressional District appears to hold few
significant clues about what to expect in House races in Election
2000. But it is nevertheless a sweet victory for Democrats since it
means that the district, centered on San Bernardino, just east of
Los Angeles, remains under Democratic control and the Republican
margin of control in the House stays at just five seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate, state Sen. Joe Baca of Rialto, won
comfortably, taking 52 percent of the vote, compared with 44
percent for his Republican opponent, Elia Pirozzi, a lawyer and
mortgage broker from Rancho Cucamonga.
</P>
<P>
   National Democratic leaders hailed the Baca victory as a
harbinger for next year's elections. National Republican leaders
insisted that Pirozzi had exceeded expectations and therefore House
Republicans were sure to keep their majority in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But non-partisan political experts see no great national
implications in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a contest in a Democratic-leaning district and though
Republicans had some openings, it easily stayed Democratic, which
is about the size of it all,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of
The Rothenberg Political Report, an independent publication
distributed mainly to political professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The election was called after Rep. George E. Brown Jr., the
hard-left Democrat who had held the seat for 27 years, died in
July. Republican challengers had made several good runs at him in
recent years and party leaders were hopeful, initially, that in the
special election their candidate might finally prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates the Republican leaders most diligently
recruited turned down the request to run, apparently figuring that
the district, although it had seemed for a while to be trending
conservative and away from Brown, was remaining solidly,
working-class Democratic, especially as more and more Hispanics
moved in. In the end, disappointed party leaders found themselves
backing a retread candidate, Pirozzi, a solid conservative who only
a year earlier had been beaten by Brown in the congressman's last
run.
</P>
<P>
   Baca is more conservative than was Brown, whose unyielding
liberalism almost cost him several re-election races. So unable to
effectively play the liberalism card against Baca, Pirozzi rested
his hopes on a big Republican turnout and a prayer that the
Democratic vote, badly split in the earlier primary, would remain
split.
</P>
<P>
   Pirozzi got a pretty good turnout. But the Democratic vote came
together enough to give Baca a comfortable win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever the Republicans put up in the district next year
probably shouldn't expect things to be any easier,'' said
Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   FIGHT GETS TOUGHER ON LOUISIANA CAUCUS
</P>
<P>
   The fight over whether Louisiana should jump nine days ahead of
Iowa and hold the nation's first presidential caucuses next year on
Jan. 15 is no longer just a war of words between Gov. Mike Foster
and Mike Francis, the chairman of the state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now Foster, also a Republican, is pushing to get a majority of
the 213-member Republican State Central Committee, the top party
policy group, to sign a petition demanding that Francis scrap his
plan to have Louisiana go first. The governor argues that none of
the major Republican candidates will risk angering Iowa voters by
going to Louisiana and thus the Louisiana caucuses will be an
embarrassing political disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to consider the issue on Dec. ll. So
far, 85 of the required 107 committee members have signed the
petition.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MCCAIN'S RACE
</P>
<P>
   More good polling news in New Hampshire for surging Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a poll there had the Arizona Republican almost in a
dead heat with the other top Republican contender, Governor George
W. Bush of Texas. Now comes another poll, this one by the polling
institute at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   First the institute matched the Democratic contenders, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, and found them in a
dead heat. Then it threw McCain into the mix _ and found that he
could beat either of them, Gore by 19 points and Bradley by 7
points.

GERMAN COURT OVERTURNS PORNOGRAPHY RULING AGAINST COMPUSERVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Overturning a verdict that has horrified
the Internet industry in Germany for the last two years, a Bavarian
court ruled Wednesday that the former top executive of Compuserve's
German subsidiary is not guilty of distributing pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a big victory for online services, which had
viewed the case as a crucial legal test of their legal
responsibility for material that customers might obtain from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a Munich court convicted the executive of
Compuserve Deutschland, Felix Somm, of distributing pornography
because customers could use Compuserve, a unit of America Online,
to download child pornography from Internet sites in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Compuserve had argued that it was helpless and had tried to
block German customers from a long list of pornographic sites. But
a local court in Munich dismissed that defense, ruling that
Compuserve could have done more. It sentenced Somm to two years of
probation and fined him 100,000 marks, or about $180,000. A state
court in Munich overturned that verdict. Invoking a new multimedia
law passed shortly after Somm had been convicted, the court ruled
that Somm could not have done much more than he did and could not
be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Somm is ``a slave of the parent company,'' said the court's
chief judge, Laszlo Ember. Taking note that Somm had briefly tried
to block access to a number of Internet sites, later giving up
because the blockade proved unmanageable, Ember said Somm had done
all he could.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Compuserve in Germany were ecstatic about
Wednesday's ruling. ``On the eve of the new millennium, the German
judiciary has disposed of another explosive waste product,'' said
Ulrich Sieber, a law professor who prepared much of Compuserve's
defense. Besides exonerating Compuserve in Germany, he said, the
decision eliminated a major source of legal uncertainty for the
online industry across Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Though it came as a relief, legal experts said the decision was
not entirely unexpected. At the time Somm was first convicted, in
November 1997, the German parliament had not yet passed a
multimedia law that was intended to shield online services from
liability for material that simply traveled over their networks.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is identical to one that has been at the center of
heated political debate in the United States: To what extent should
a company that provides access to the Internet be held responsible
for material that it does not own or control but which flows over
its network?
</P>
<P>
   Germany has been more aggressive than almost any other Western
nation in trying to police the Internet. The federal government
maintains lists of illegal Web sites, some of which contain
pornography and some of which support violent or neo-Nazi
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Somm, who is Swiss, has since left Compuserve and now runs a
small company of his own.

LEADING MEDIA COMPANIES FORMING JOINT WEB VENTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unusually broad news-sharing arrangement is bringing together
some of the nation's leading media companies in a venture to share
news reports on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The venture includes the nation's leading broadcaster, the most
popular news site on the Web, one of the country's most prominent
newspapers, the No. 2 weekly newsmagazine and an all-news cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by major subsidiaries of NBC News,
MSNBC and The Washington Post Co. and represented one of the most
significant developments in media alliances in response to the
challenge of attracting audiences in the narrowcasting era of cable
TV and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their companies' World Wide Web outlets will receive daily lists
of planned articles from the partners and have access to the final
news reports. Wednesday, a Washington Post report on traveller's
reluctance to fly on New Year's Eve was on MSNBC.com.
</P>
<P>
   Many details remain unsettled. But the executives of the news
organizations said Wednesday that the journalism of The Washington
Post, NBC News, Newsweek and MSNBC will be available on both
MSNBC.com, Washingtonpost.com and a planned new site,
Newsweek.MSNBC.com. Some exclusive reports will be held back until
after they have been published or broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NBC's local owned-and-operated station in
Washington, WRC-TV, will share its news reports with the Post on
their respective online outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue from the collaborative ventures would be
shared, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the upcoming election year, NBC, MSNBC and MSNBC.com can
supplement their coverage with reports from the Washington Post's
respected corps of political reporters. MSNBC and MSNBC.com are
joint ventures of NBC, a unit of General Electric, and Microsoft.
The Washington Post owns Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a media analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.,
who for many years was a producer with NBC News, said Wednesday
that the effort to aggregate high-quality journalism on a Web site
could quickly broaden that site's audience _ and its appeal to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got, both with the Web but also with TV and cable,
is a recognition that depth of content, depth of proprietary
content, counts,'' he said. ``As you move into an
advertiser-supported Internet, `your' site needs to have more
proprietary content than `mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Collaborative reporting among some of the news organizations
have also been discussed, executives on a conference call said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be discussions about shared presentations of news
between NBC and The Washington Post,'' said the Post's executive
editor, Leonard Downie Jr. ``We have no idea what form it will
take. This is new territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between the news outlets of NBC and the Post
company is one of many arrangements that have made competing news
organizations into partners. Some arrangements have supplemented
earlier alliances and others have superceded them. For instance,
now that Washington Post and Newsweek reporters will be appearing
on Brian Williams' MSNBC news broadcast, reporters from The New
York Times will not.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's agreement leaves intact the broader pre-existing
partnership between Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal's parent,
and CNBC, the financial news cable channel owned by NBC. The Wall
Street Journal's reporters regularly contribute material to CNBC.
In return, Dow Jones is paid a licensing fee and shares in the
advertising revenue. Articles from the Journal are also posted on
the MSNBC.com site.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has been exploring ventures with other news
outlets, like ABC, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co. ``We've
talked to them about a whole range of things, including a limited
collaboration on campaign coverage and some cooperation in
television and Internet news,'' said Bill Keller, the managing
editor of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all at the talking stage at this point,'' he added. ``We
haven't signed any formal agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of the Web, alliances are the rule, as media giants
seek partners to help them compete in myriad online niches. This
week, Pearson plc, the parent company of The Financial Times,
announced it would take a stake in one of the major owners of the
financial news Web site Marketwatch.com. That site is also partly
owned by CBS, and its journalists appear on some CBS news programs.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times also holds a 6.3 percent stake in
Thestreet.com, another financial news site. Several reporters
working out of thestreet.com's offices in the financial district
file reports throughout the day to both The New York Times on the
Web and Thestreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the news organizations in the alliance announced
Wednesday will retain editorial control over its publications or
news broadcasts. Editors at the Web sites receiving material from
partner newsrooms, however, cannot edit the material without
consultation.

PLAYBOY, IN CHICAGO, TO SUE PLAYDOG, ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playboy says it can take a joke, but not trademark infringement,
so lawyers for the magazine have threatened to sue the Milltown,
N.J., man who started a Web site called Playdog.com that features
pictures of dogs wearing nothing but their fur.
</P>
<P>
   With an editor named ``Spot Hephner'' and a Playdog of the
Month, the site's inspiration is obvious. This month's playdog is
Daisy (her turn-ons include drooling and sleeping; her turnoffs
include mailmen). Readers are invited to send in pictures of their
dogs. The site is not recommended for cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is dog nudity,'' the site warns, it is
``appropriate for viewers of all ages,'' with the possible
exception of cats. ``If you're looking for dirty pictures, you're
barking up the wrong tree.''
</P>
<P>
   But apparently somebody did get confused, after receiving e-mail
from Playdog.com, and asked Playboy if there was any connection,
said Angela DePaul, a spokeswoman for Playboy Enterprises in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Playboy's legal department began writing to
Steve Sackman, the 37-year-old Milltown bartender who started the
site in September 1998 to attract subscribers to a print magazine
for dog owners that he plans to begin publishing in February. He
said Wednesday he was shocked that Playboy had paid him any mind at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different market,'' he said. ``The only
similarity is the word `play.' I have dogs, they have women. I'm
not calling their models playdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Playboy is demanding that he alter his logo's typeface,
which is similar to Playboy's, to avoid the impression that there
is any connection with the magazine. The company also objects to
his use of the logo on dog dishes and other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the humor,'' Ms. DePaul said, ``but it's the
idea that if you let one individual infringe on the brand, because
it's online, the brand can become diluted.''

IRA TO DISCUSS HANDING OVER WEAPONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ In what could signal the end of its long war to end
British control of Northern Ireland, the Irish Republican Army said
Wednesday that it would discuss handing over weapons as soon as a
power-sharing government, including its political allies, was
formed.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's four-paragraph statement, signed by its fictional
messenger, P. O'Neill, did not promise to turn in weapons. But a
concession was widely seen from the IRA, which had hitherto refused
to countenance even a token gesture on weapons. The statement said
the IRA would talk to the international commission overseeing the
disarming of paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the IRA equate the turning in of weapons to surrender,
something the IRA insists it will not do. But the leadership of
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political allies, has convinced IRA leaders
that their goal of a united Ireland will come about sooner through
democratic politics than armed insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The statement Wednesday was the first public confirmation that
the IRA's ruling Army Council accepts that arms decommissioning is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was also the latest in a series of steps to break
the impasse that has stalled the peace process for 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, said that
in exchange for an IRA pledge to send a representative to the arms
commission, his party was willing to drop its demand that IRA
weapons be turned in before forming a power-sharing government with
Catholic republicans. That government will include two members of
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events that is supposed to lead to a break in
the impasse has been scripted by George Mitchell, the former US
senator from Maine who brokered the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and
who has spent the past 10 weeks trying to save it from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement called for the creation of political institutions
aimed at transforming the conflict over whether Northern Ireland
should remain part of the United Kingdom, or merge with the
Republic of Ireland. The idea is to change the debate from violent
to political exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The process stalled 17 months ago. Then, the unionists said they
would not sit in government with Sinn Fein until the IRA began
disarming. The republicans countered that nothing in the agreement
linked creation of the government to decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two months of patient coaxing by Mitchell,
however, Trimble indicated on Monday that he was willing to risk
his leadership by seeking his party's backing for the compromise
that drops the party's ``no guns, no government'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble gets approval from a meeting of the 800-member party
council, tentatively set for Nov. 27, the local government could be
formed within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, said that Irish
republicans, who for two centuries have considered it their duty to
use force to seek an independent and united Ireland, accept that
the decommissioning of IRA weapons ``is an essential part of the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams also gave his most explicit repudiation of violence,
including a condemnation of vigilante beatings and shootings, which
both the IRA and loyalists routinely use to police the
neighborhoods they control.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the IRA made no reference to the beatings
Adams deplored, but said it backed the Sinn Fein leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who like Trimble has a hard task of persuading hardliners
in his party to accept the accord, Wednesday praised the IRA for
its ``courage, discipline and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the man whom Adams ousted as the leader of Sinn Fein more
than a decade ago, Ruairi O Bradaigh, said a new generation would
rise and take over the ``armed struggle'' that the IRA was giving
up.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ J.J. Stokes one-on-one against Ronnie Lott . . .
Jonathan Ogden blocking Chip Banks . . . Chris Claiborne tackling
Freeman McNeil . . . Junior Seau blitzing Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the possibilities. Imagine the prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I want to be the ticket vendor for that game,'' said UCLA
assistant Bob Field. ``That would really be something.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagination meets newsprint in the Daily News' two-part mythical
matchup between the greatest players from UCLA and USC. Today, the
Bruins offense faces a USC defense so good that Dennis Thurman and
Willie McGinest didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense isn't bad, either. Quarterback Gary Beban, the
school's only Heisman Trophy winner, didn't make it. Neither did
left tackle Kris Farris, an Outland Trophy winner, or tailback
Gaston Green, the school's career rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the matchup might seem one-sided. The Bruins have no
Heisman Trophy tailbacks, and tight end Tim Wrightman and receiver
Dick Wallen probably would struggle against USC's defensive backs
(Lott, Mark Carrier, Dennis Smith and Tim McDonald.)
</P>
<P>
   Even UCLA's offensive line, however accomplished, might lack the
overall size and speed to repel Gary Jeter, Tim Ryan and a Trojans
linebacking corps for the ages: Seau, Claiborne, Banks and Richard
Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long list of great Trojan players,'' former UCLA
assistant coach Jerry Long said. ``Some of those guys were giants.
But you look back and there are some incredible UCLA victories
against the monsters from USC.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have a chance, if only for one reason: Their offense
is stocked with players who made their names with legendary
performances against USC. Size and speed are nice, but there's
nothing more important than playmaking ability in the
pressure-filled city series.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Trojans fans which UCLA quarterback they'd least like to
face, and it probably wouldn't be Beban or John Sciarra or Bob
Waterfield or even Troy Aikman. It'd be McNown. He was to USC what
Rodney Peete was to the Bruins in the late '80s _ a nemesis
nonpareil.
</P>
<P>
   McNown beat the Trojans four times and invariably made the
game-winning plays.
</P>
<P>
   As a true freshman in 1995, his last-minute, third-down sprint
preserved UCLA's possession and enabled the Bruins to run out the
clock. In 1996, McNown passed for 356 yards, scored three
touchdowns and directed the greatest comeback in school history.
(The Bruins trailed 38-21 with 6 minutes left, then won in
double-overtime.) In 1997, McNown passed for three touchdowns in a
seven-point win.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for Stokes, whose three-touchdown, 263-yard
masterpiece in 1992 helped the Bruins to a 38-37 victory. (UCLA
trailed by 14 points in the fourth quarter.)
</P>
<P>
   McNeil, too, saved his best for the Trojans. The Bruins could
have five Ogdens blocking in the mythical matchup and they'd still
struggle to run outside on Seau and Banks. But McNeil, at 210
pounds, was strong enough to run between the tackles, thereby
negating USC's speed. What's more, McNeil has the playmaking skills
to match Stokes and McNown, as the 1980 USC-UCLA game proved.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with an injured hip that necessitated extra padding,
McNeil had 111 yards running and 74 receiving. His last play was
best: With two minutes remaining and the Bruins trailing by three,
Jay Schroeder's sideline pass to McNeil was deflected by USC
cornerback (and current NFL coach) Jeff Fisher. McNeil made an
acrobatic catch, then raced 35 yards for the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-17 victory snapped USC's four-year mastery of the Bruins.
It was also coach Terry Donahue's first win over the Trojans after
several narrow defeats in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play, that win, was huge for the program,'' Field said.
``It was a real breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the stuff of legends. &QL;

JURORS BEGIN DELIBERATING IN TEXAS MAN'S DRAGGING DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Updates 2nd graf with jury retiring for the night) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The 1998 torture slaying of a disabled black man
``already has been avenged'' by guilty verdicts against two other
white men, and justice would be served if jurors acquit Shawn Allen
Berry, his attorney told an all-white jury as he closed his case
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in the capital murder trial began deliberating shortly
after noon, and requested numerous transcripts, Berry's
blood-stained clothing and other evidence, leading prosecutors to
predict there would not be a quick verdict. Shortly before 10 p.m.,
the jury retired for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of seven women and five men have a choice of finding
Berry, 24, guilty of capital murder, guilty of murder or not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   An alternate juror, released from duty before deliberations
began, said he would have voted for a capital murder verdict.
George Coleman of nearby Buna said that both Berry and his fiancee,
ex-beauty queen Christy Marcontell, lacked credibility on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Berry admitted giving James Byrd Jr., 49, a ride on June 7,
1998, during a night of beer drinking and cruising for girls, and
that he initially lied about his actions.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted Tuesday that he did not kill the disabled
African-American. After an initial attempt to help Byrd, Berry said
he stood by, paralyzed by fear, as John William King Jr. and
Russell Lawrence Brewer beat Byrd, chained him behind Berry's
pickup and then dragged him to death along a bumpy rural road.
</P>
<P>
   King, 25, and Brewer, 32, who belonged to the same white
supremacist gang in prison, were sentenced to death earlier this
year. Unlike them, Berry had no racist affiliations. Numerous
defense witnesses, including three African-Americans, said he was
not hateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Byrd Jr.'s murder has been avenged,'' defense attorney
Joseph Columbus ``Lum'' Hawthorn said in a closing statement. ``The
two people who killed James Byrd Jr. were tried, convicted and
sentenced to death. ... Justice has been served.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Berry knew his childhood friend Bill King had come back
from prison a racist, Berry viewed him as a boastful blowhard who
never had followed through on threats, Hawthorn said. And neither
King nor Brewer had shown any violent tendencies, he said,
explaining why his client would invite a black man into his truck
with two avowed white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason for Shawn Berry to believe that Bill King
was anything other than a bag of wind,'' the attorney said.
``Nobody took Bill King seriously, not until this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray insisted that Berry not only
gave Byrd a ride but was driving when the black man was dragged to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he picked up James Byrd, he knew it was wrong,'' Gray
said. ``It went from drinking beer and picking up girls to some
other kind of fun. ... Whoever had his hand on the wheel was having
fun. ... He was just as active as the other two. Really, he's more
active than the other two.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial, Gray suggested that King was starting a hate
group in Jasper and that Byrd's slaying was an initiation rite,
possibly for Berry. During the trial, Gray said Berry was not a
racist, but a young man out for a deadly form of thrill-seeking on
June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three people who participated, and that man was the
worst of the bunch on that particular night,'' Assistant District
Attorney Pat Hardy said. ``Because as sick as their beliefs were,
at least King and Brewer believed in something. Shawn Berry did all
of this for nothing but the fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Motive aside, the prosecution hammered away at Berry, citing his
own statements, acknowledged lies and evidence collected in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Shawn Berry's truck, Shawn Berry's chain,'' Gray said.
``It was Shawn Berry that made the decision to pick James Byrd up.
Shawn Berry made the decision to drive out to a remote area. Shawn
Berry has got blood on his boots, he's got blood on his pants, and
he's got blood on his shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Bill King had one drop on his sandal.
Russell Brewer had one drop on his tennis shoes,` the district
attorney said. ``Shawn Berry has got more blood on him than any one
of the three.''
</P>
<P>
   But the defense suggested that Berry got blood on his clothes by
accident while he and King sprayed down the pickup and logging
chain at a carwash the afternoon after the dragging death.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, a cinema manager, showed little emotion throughout the
six-day trial. And although he said he was sorry he did not
intervene more effectively to stop the slaying, he made no
expression of regret for Byrd's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, his 23-year-old fiancee, a former Miss Newton
County, sat next to him. His biological father, whom he hadn't met
until just before the trial, flew in from Ohio and sat in the first
row with other friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Byrd sat on the other side of the courtroom.
Several of Byrd's sisters said they considered Berry at least as
culpable as King and Brewer because he picked up their brother
knowing that King and Brewer were Ku Klux Klansmen.

POLICE SCOUR SHELTERS FOR MAN WHO HIT WOMAN WITH BRICK

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police detectives fanned out to homeless shelters and
soup kitchens in Manhattan Wednesday in search of a man who hit a
woman with a brick in an unprovoked attack on a busy midtown street
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker, who is believed to be homeless, struck the woman,
Nicole Barrett, in the back of the head with a brick as she waited
to cross the street at East 42nd Street and Madison Avenue about 3
p.m. Tuesday. As detectives searched more than a dozen shelters for
the man Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir met with the victim's parents and later held a news
conference in which they sought to allay mounting fears about the
random nature of this and other recent attacks in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, 27, a native of a small town in Texas who moved to
New York a year ago, remained in critical condition Wednesday at
Bellevue Hospital Center with a skull fracture and brain swelling.
Investigators said she probably did not see her attacker, whom the
police described as a black man, in his 40s, between 5 feet 6 and 5
feet 7 inches tall, with short hair. They said the man was wearing
dirty blue jeans and a black nylon jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that after being hit by the brick, which was
either thrown or smashed against her head, Ms. Barrett, who was
returning to work after running an errand, fell to her knees and
landed face first on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Ms. Barrett, a graduate of a community college in
Texas, was on her last day of work in a temporary job Tuesday and
was to begin a new full-time job this week. She was also
considering going back to school to study interior design.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, police detectives began searching for a
homeless man who was believed to be mentally ill and had frequently
been seen in the area where the attacked occurred. The police also
canvassed construction sites nearby, in a search for clues about
where the brick may have come from. But by Wednesday night, the
police had made no arrests or other significant headway in the
case, officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The assault of Ms. Barrett added to the list of capricious
crimes in which unsuspecting victims were attacked in the past
year, including the killing of a Manhattan woman, Kendra Webdale,
and the maiming of a Bronx man, Edgar Rivera, both of whom were
pushed in front of subway trains by assailants they had not
previously known.

ATTACK SHATTERS YOUNG LIFE AS IT WAS COMING TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (With NY-BRICK-ATTACK) 
(rk) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Things had been going Nicole Barrett's way since she
moved from East Texas to New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   She had found a steady boyfriend, was soon to have a steady job,
and was lining up a new apartment in Queens. With her life coming
neatly together, she was planning a Thanksgiving trip back home
next week, when she was to introduce her boyfriend to her circle of
family and friends in Athens, the small town where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, that introductory trip happened in reverse, as Ms.
Barrett's parents flew to New York to visit their daughter in the
neurosurgical intensive care unit at Bellevue Hospital Center in
Manhattan. Ms. Barrett was the victim of what the police called a
random attack on Tuesday in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   A man, apparently without motive or provocation, approached her
from behind and struck her in the head with a large brick, sending
her sprawling to the pavement near the corner of 42nd Street and
Madison Avenue. She received a head wound so large that one of the
first people to rush to her after she fell said he thought she had
been hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   A vigil was under way at the bedside of Ms. Barrett, 27, who was
listed in critical condition and under sedation after two
operations to relieve the pressure on her brain caused by the
ravages of a skull fracture. ``It could be very grim,'' said one
Bellevue staff member. ``It may be so severe that nothing
consequential can happen'' to repair it.
</P>
<P>
   As the police search continued, friends of Ms. Barrett's
provided a description of a young woman who was eager to get to New
York and strike out on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, after a relationship with a Texas man ended, Ms.
Barrett traveled to New York to join a friend, Stacey McGlaun, who
had accepted a job as a physical therapist, friends of the family
said. Ms. Barrett and Ms. McGlaun have been friends since
elementary school, and attended college together at Trinity Valley
Community College in Athens and at Southwest Texas State University
in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, shortly after arriving, Ms. Barrett wrote a
letter to Debbie Baker, a friend from Texas and the current head of
the community college drill team, saying that she had taken the
opportunity to move on after her breakup and was optimistic about
her prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Bobby had moved away, I thought: `What the hell. Why
not?''' Ms. Barrett wrote. ``So I made a spur of the moment
decision and within three weeks I quit my job, sold my car, packed
up and moved to the Big Apple. It's been a huge move, but it's been
fun so far. Kind of crazy though.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after arriving, Ms. Barrett and Ms. McGlaun met two men
at Le Bar Bat, on West 57th Street, and began double dating, said
one of the men. The relationships went well. The four moved in
together in a small second-floor apartment on a quiet lane in
Maspeth, Queens, where they kept mostly to themselves, neighbors
said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while Ms. Barrett had been a temp worker, working out of
the Taylor Grey employment agency. A company statement called her
``a kind person and a hard worker.'' But that stint was over, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   She was due to start a new job this week and Kelly Herriage, a
longtime friend, said she was considering returning to school to
study interior design. She was also planning to move with her
boyfriend this month to an apartment of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herriage, speaking from Texas, said Ms. Barrett had embraced
city life, and though she was wary of the possibility of danger,
she never harped on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She mentioned that it was kind of scary at night on the
subways, but she never really mentioned she feared anything,'' she
said. ``I feared it, but it's because I'm not there. I'd worry
about her because she was there.''

T-SHIRT CASE NOW INVOLVES SECRET SERVICE AS CHAPPAQUA GROUP IS
WARNED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ A week ago, White House lawyers ordered a
college scholarship group here to stop selling T-shirts bearing the
presidential seal, warning that the seal's misuse was a crime
punishable by up to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Secret Service says the unauthorized use of its name on
the shirts violates yet another federal law. And once again, future
neighbors of the president and first lady have found themselves
threatened with jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, two Secret Service agents knocked on Robert M.
Bernstein's door and warned him that his group, the Horace Greeley
Educational Fund, must not even give away the T-shirts, which bear
the words ``Secret Service, Chappaqua Bureau, Presidential
Detail.'' Using the service's name without authorization is a crime
punishable by up to a year in jail, they told him.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, a salesman, is not accustomed to receiving mail from
the White House and visits from the Secret Service. ``When they
came to the door, and he flashed his badge, it was sort of
surreal,'' he said. ``It was like something out of a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service has not yet decided whether to confiscate the
T-shirts. Last week, a White House spokesman said that as long as
the fund did not sell the shirts or manufacture more, it could give
away the shirts that had already been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to work with them,'' said James Mackin, a spokesman
for the Secret Service. ``Our concerns are not just the use of our
name but also security issues. We wouldn't want people to assume
that someone wearing one of the shirts was an agent of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackin said lawyers for the service were discussing how to
preserve the integrity of the Secret Service name ``without being
too heavy-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The forbidden T-shirts were first sold in September, shortly
after President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, announced they
planned to buy a house in Chappaqua, in preparation for Mrs.
Clinton's expected bid for the U.S. Senate from New York. Profits
from the $15 shirts went to the scholarship fund for needy
graduates of Chappaqua High School.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts sold out immediately. The fund ordered 36 dozen more
and was quickly selling them out when the letter from the White
House arrived. In the flurry of media attention that followed, the
shirts became a hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, people have pledged hundreds of dollars to the fund,
hoping to get shirts. One man sent in a $1,000 check, asking for
four T-shirts in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a waiting list of 300 people now,'' said Wendy S.
Nolan, a real estate agent who came up with the fund-raising idea.
``They are a collectors' item now. They are a piece of history.
Everywhere I go, people ask me if I can get them one.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she got up to eight calls a day from people
seeking shirts but that she did not know how to respond to the
requests. The shirts are safely locked up while Bernstein waits for
word from the Secret Service about whether he can give the shirts
away without risking imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would just tell us, one way or the other,'' Ms.
Nolan said. ``If they end up saying no, you just hope that people
with a conscience will say, `Keep the money, it's good for the
foundation.'''

SOMEHOW, BRUINS WILL TRY TO TOE THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pushed to the brink by injuries and frustration,
UCLA's offensive line responded with its best game of the season
last week against Washington. But can the Bruins, who have lost
three starters in the last two weeks and are down to their
fourth-string center, do it again?
</P>
<P>
   Running consistently and protecting rookie quarterback Ryan
McCann are essential to defeating USC for the ninth consecutive
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington game gave us a real boost emotionally,'' guard
Brian Polak said. ``We're actually enjoying it. The last few weeks,
I've been joking about the situation. It helps me keep my sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The key this week, as it was against Washington, is
aggressiveness. The Bruins play better with an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``With young guys, you have to learn the speed and learn the
offense and how to play, and the last thing to come is
aggressiveness,'' line coach Mark Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   __ In relief: Freshman tackle Blake Worley (sprained knee) is
expected to play but won't start. The other reserves Saturday will
be scout-team players Ed Anderson, Doug Cummings and Tyson Clayton.
Cummings and Clayton are walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tight end Bryan Fletcher (235 pounds) is taking a
crash course on playing tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to know what to do,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``I told
him it's like tight end, except one step closer to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ How bad? The Bruins have so many injuries that for the first
time in Toledo's tenure, there's no season-ending scout-team
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my coaching career, never ever have I gone through a
season like this,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cummings, Anderson and Clayton are practicing with the
starters, there's only one offensive lineman on the scout-team
offensive line: freshman Shane Lehmann. The other linemen are
defensive players: Asi Faoa and Mat and David Ball.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat of the day: USC has not defeated UCLA in the Coliseum
since 1987, when Rodney Peete beat Troy Aikman. The teams tied
10-10 in 1989 when UCLA's Alfredo Velasco missed a game-winning
field goal. The Bruins won in the Coliseum in '91, '93, '95 and 97.
</P>
<P>
   USC is a seven-point favorite Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update: The Bruins have stopped recruiting Albert
Hollis, a top tailback prospect from Sacramento. Despite committing
to UCLA over the summer, he visited Georgia and has scheduled trips
to Notre Dame, Nebraska and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia running back Manuel White, who committed to UCLA
earlier this week, replaces Hollis as the Bruins' 10th commitment.
They have approximately seven slots remaining. &UR;  &QL;

IN VENEZUELA'S HOSPITALS, GRAFT IS DEADLY INFECTION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ When Miguel Perez Carreno Hospital first
opened its doors here 30 years ago, it was proudly described as the
largest and most modern medical center in all of Latin America, the
showcase project of a government flush with oil money and soon to
become even richer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the 13-story complex on a hill overlooking the
working-class neighborhoods of southwest Caracas stands as a symbol
of a different sort. To the ordinary people who flock there for
care, it is a monument to the ills that have crippled Venezuela and
made possible the rise of President Hugo Chavez and the ``social
revolution'' he has vowed to carry out: corruption, inefficiency,
featherbedding and a political patronage system.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this South American country of 23 million people
continues to sit atop the largest reserves of oil outside the
Middle East. But at hospitals across Venezuela so much equipment
and supplies have simply disappeared _ and so little money is
available to replace them _ that many patients, to their outrage,
are now forced to bring their own sheets, syringes and medicine,
and the ``moral renovation'' of public services has become a
national crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in this country was politicized by an elite that
took everything for itself and left nothing for the people,''
complained Jesus Boada, 70, who was visiting a granddaughter
hospitalized with a stomach ailment. ``The result is what we have
to put up with when we come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Miguel Perez Carreno Hospital, named for a prominent
surgeon who was also dean of the main medical school here, had
1,710 employees. But over the years, even as the number of beds in
service was declining, that figure inflated to more than 5,000
workers, or nearly double the average number of employees per
hospital bed in the United States, according to statistics compiled
by the American Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that bloated work force was a substantial contingent
hired not because of its qualifications but as a reward for loyalty
to the party in power. Every time there was a change of government,
one batch of political appointees would leave and be replaced by
another from the rival party.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The bureaucracy kept growing and growing,'' said Dr. Jose
Maria Urbina, 45, a traumatologist who was a student at the
hospital during the years of the oil boom and now, as its medical
director, is trying to halt the decline. ``People were paid, but
didn't work, and since they had obtained their jobs because they
had worked in someone's campaign, they could not be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That situation could perhaps be tolerated so long as Venezuela's
oil bonanza continued. But when the market price of a barrel of oil
fell almost to the cost of production, so did the government's
largess: hospital officials said their budget has not enjoyed a
significant increase in at least a decade and has been frozen for
the last two years.

   ``Since you have so many employees and you don't pay them well,
what you get is a mentality that says, `I have a right to take home
sheets or a pair of scissors once in a while,''' said Robert
Bottome, editor and publisher of the Veneconomia newsletter here.
``And since there is no accountability, there is no real check on
corruption.''

   Francisco Colmenares found that out when a series of operations
were required on his right arm after an accident. During the most
recent, he ``collaborated'' with the medical staff, as he put it,
by buying the surgical needle and thread that was needed to sew him
up but could no longer be found in the hospital's stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a normal situation, but that's what you have to put
up with if you want to get medical attention,'' said Colmenares, a
52-year-old truck driver. ``We've been moving backward in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the budget squeeze, the hospital's library cut all
subscriptions to medical journals in 1994, a severe blow to an
institution that is also a teaching hospital. In addition, someone
recently stole three nursing textbooks from the library, so now all
nurses are prohibited from examining the remaining manuals, which
are locked up.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The problem of theft in Venezuelan hospitals is now so severe
that Dr. Antonio Briceno, a physician and a member of the
Constitutional Assembly that is drawing up a new charter for the
nation at Chavez's insistence, wants to make it a criminal offense
to be punished as severely as homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corrupt are murderers, and their crime should be treated
just like terrorism, rape and drug trafficking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While legal scholars and human rights groups here and abroad
have criticized efforts by Chavez, a 45-year-old former army
paratrooper, to shutter a Congress and court system he describes as
corrupt and discredited, that appears to be of only secondary
importance to ordinary Venezuelans. To them, the president's
promises to overhaul public services that he has described as ``a
series of disasters'' are far more important.
</P>
<P>
   Other vital sectors of government activity, not just health
care, are also afflicted with such problems. A public education,
for instance, is supposed to be free, or so promises the current
Constitution, ratified in 1961 and disdained by Chavez as
``moribund.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, though, are underpaid and schools are chronically
underfinanced and in ill repair, so many principals have devised a
system that requires parents to pay a ``registration fee'' of up to
$50 per pupil to enroll their children. Often, those pupils whose
families will not or cannot pay are not allowed to attend classes,
constitutional guarantees notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in February, however, Chavez has condemned
that system and recently announced that he would allow no such fees
to be collected this school year and will dismiss any educator who
defies him.
</P>
<P>
   Principals complain that with no increase in government
financing being offered, instruction will inevitably suffer.
Parents, however, have generally hailed the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rich country, and we should not have to pay for a
right that is ours by law,'' said Amanda Escobar Lujan, a mother of
three who was shopping for school supplies here. ``We would not
even be in this situation if the political parties had not been
plundering the national treasury for 40 years, lining their pockets
and stealing from our children.''

REACHING ACROSS THE GENERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Trillions of dollars of wealth will pass from
generation to generation in the next decade. Much of it is tied up
in family-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever seen or been in families ripped apart by
inheritance squabbles can appreciate the monstrous challenge when a
company's assets are part of a family estate.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, asset-transfer plans are made before the older
generation's deaths. That's the only way to avoid steep tax
consequences. But therein lies the rub: By their very
entrepreneurial nature, those who built businesses are typically
reluctant to let go.
</P>
<P>
   Relinquishing financial control means relinquishing power. Few
who have built a business from scratch, or shepherded a family firm
through decades of ups and downs, say goodbye easily.
</P>
<P>
   Such transfers are exacerbated by sibling rivalry and questions
of fairness and equality (which are not the same things) when
accumulated wealth is divvied up among offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that there's a growth industry in providing
wealth-transfer advice for family-owned enterprises. The names of
such fast-blooming advisory firms tell the story. Just a few blocks
apart from each other in Overland Park, Kan., for example, are the
Legacy Financial Group and Legasus Group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite similar names, they are separate organizations. Each has
grown and thrives in different niches hewn from the need to
transfer control of family-owned companies from one generation to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Legacy Financial Group was the Patrick
Murphy Agency, a life insurance sales group affiliated with
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. Murphy had the vision,
though, to build the agency into a diversified financial consulting
group that specializes in family-business succession, drawing from
the expertise of 40 financial professionals and about 35 support
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Legasus Group, once planning advisers for small and
midsize businesses, has evolved into a consulting organization that
specializes in the organizational and emotional parts of
family-firm successions.
</P>
<P>
   The two organizations are meeting the market need that has
fueled the Family Firm Institute since its founding 13 years ago.
The Boston-based membership organization says between 80 and 90
percent of all businesses in North America are family-owned.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking just mom-and-pops here. According to the
institute, 30 percent to 35 percent of all Fortune 500 companies
are family-owned. This is big money.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Garton, director of business development at Legacy, says
family-firm counselors have to be part psychologist, part diplomat
and complete financial wizard.
</P>
<P>
   It takes broad-based talent to meld the wishes of a family
firm's chief executive officer _ usually the father and//or founder
_ with those of the ``chief emotional officer'' _ who typically is,
you guessed it, the wife and mother.

AD EXECUTIVE CITES HER RACE IN AIRPORT SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A black advertising executive accused U.S. Customs
officers Wednesday of subjecting her to an extensive pat-down
search for drugs at Newark International Airport solely because of
her race.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Yvette Bradley, said that after she returned from
a trip to Jamaica in April, several customs agents interrogated
her, tore through her luggage and then patted her down in a search
for drugs, delaying her for an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have worn my blond wig and blue contacts and I
probably wouldn't have been stopped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bradley, 32, an art director at an advertising firm in
Manhattan, SpikeDDB, a partnership with DDB Needham, filed a legal
notice Wednesday against the federal Customs Service seeking
$500,000 in damages. The agency has six months to respond before a
damage suit can be filed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after a news conference at the New York Civil
Liberties Union office on Broad Street, she said: ``It was very
invasive. They touched everything. It was very humiliating.'' She
said the inspector who patted her down was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Her case is being handled by the civil liberties union and by
lawyers with a Roseland, N.J., law firm, Lowenstein Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Bradley's legal initiative is one of the first
involving an airport search in the New York metropolitan area,
about a dozen lawsuits filed in the last two years have accused
customs offices elsewhere of racial bias, several legal experts and
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, a class-action suit was filed last year in Chicago
on behalf of 83 black women who said they were strip-searched or
patted down by customs agents, inspectors and supervisors at O'Hare
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Murphy, a spokesman for the federal Customs Service,
declined to comment on Ms. Bradley's claim or any continuing legal
matter. But he said agency officials have previously reviewed
airport searches and found no evidence of racial bias. ``We don't
tolerate racial profiling,'' he said. ``It's not a part of our
policy and should not be part of our practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits and complaints of racial bias are part of the
reason that Raymond W. Kelly, the federal customs commissioner,
appointed an independent committee in April to examine the agency's
search policies. The committee's findings are expected by the end
of the year, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 71 million passengers who pass through the nation's
international terminals each year, customs agents pull aside 3
percent to open their luggage or search them physically, agency
records show.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The number of personal searches, which was 50,000 in fiscal
1998, dropped to about 25,800 in fiscal 1999. Murphy attributed
that decline to recent procedural changes that require closer
supervision and oversight of the search process. For instance, an
inspector must now get a supervisor's permission before patting
down a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Because of national security concerns, federal regulations give
customs inspectors more leeway in conducting searches than police
officers have, several legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that inspectors need have no
cause for suspicion before patting down a clothed passenger, but
must have reasonable suspicion to search more closely. Murphy said
the agency sets a higher standard than the law by requiring that
agents have some suspicion before any physical check of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the customs regulations were still less
demanding than the probable cause that is required before a police
officer can obtain a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald T. Shuford, a lawyer who specializes in racial
profiling litigation for the national civil liberties office, said
the ``unbridled discretion'' of customs officers could lead to
discriminatory practices such as deciding to search an airline
passenger just because of race. ``It happens every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt absolutely helpless,'' Ms. Bradley said. ``There are so
many subtle things that happen to me because of my skin color, and
it's hard to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bradley said in the interview that a customs official told
her later that she was subjected to the drug search because she was
wearing a striking headpiece of tan, turquoise and lavender yarn
twisted loosely into braids. But, she said, her headpiece was not
inspected during the search and officers stopped other black women
on her flight. &QL;

WHEN SELLING TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, TRUMP-SIZE EGO IS NO HANDICAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger J. Stone has worked with Donald J. Trump for 19
years, a relationship longer than any of their marriages that is
now reaching its blissful apotheosis with Stone as director of the
Donald J. Trump Presidential Exploratory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Like his client, Stone is thin-skinned, with a shatterproof ego.
Adores power, and the myriad ways to grab it. Has a Sisyphean
struggle with hair color. A history with the National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   And an aversion to shaking hands with strangers. ``For him it's
a health issue, for me it's a suffer-fools-gladly thing,'' Stone
said, during lunch at a Manhattan restaurant. ``I used to watch Lee
Atwater'' _ once his partner _ ``brown-nose people he didn't like
or respect. I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Beltway, news that the strategist behind Trump's
latest gamble is Stone has been greeted with delighted groans,
hisses and the occasional murmur of grudging respect. This is,
after all, the corporate and political fixer who, at 19, was an
entry-level dirty trickster for Richard M. Nixon; whose 30th
birthday party was given at the ``21'' Club by Roy Cohn; who
consulted on campaigns for Ronald Reagan, George Bush and countless
lesser Republicans; and who cites, among his shining moments, his
successful $27 million strategy for the U.S. Sugar Corp. to defeat
a one-penny-per-pound tax on sugar to help the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a superb program to tell the voters why not to vote for
it,'' he fondly recalled. ```How do you know the money will really
go to the Everglades? These politicians in Tallahassee, you can't
trust them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two questions about Stone.
</P>
<P>
   First: Just how odd a duck is he? Answer: Very.
</P>
<P>
   The balding spot apparent years ago has disappeared, and the dye
job is obvious. Stone hates his natural mousy brown color.
</P>
<P>
   With his silver watch fob, spread-collar shirt and wide-striped
double-breasted suit tailored to accentuate his bodybuilder's
silhouette, Stone, a fan of Fanny Brice and Al Jolson, says he
often feels like someone born in the wrong era. ``I never owned a
pair of blue jeans until I met my second wife,'' said Stone, 47.
</P>
<P>
   That preternaturally youthful face?
</P>
<P>
   He credits a decadeslong regimen of Chinese herbs, breathing
therapies, tai chi and acupuncture, in which he learned that
personality types correspond to a specific organ. Roger Stone is a
kidney. He says that means he is aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   For all his eccentricities, Stone is nothing if not resilient.
In September 1996, soon after the lurid sex revelations about Dick
Morris, the Democratic consultant, the National Enquirer wrote that
Stone, then a volunteer spokesman for Sen. Bob Dole, had placed ads
and photographs seeking sexual partners for himself and his second
wife, Nydia. Stone denied the stories, saying the ads had been
placed by a former domestic helper who had stolen photographs and
his credit card. He bowed out of the Dole campaign. Of that time,
he says now, with a thin smile: ``An awful lot of people left me
for dead after that, but I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Second question: Just how ruthless is Stone?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The man who enjoys being known as the Prince of
Darkness, really, really did not want it published that his three
grandchildren _ by way of Nydia's past marriages _ call him,
shucks, ``Pop-pop.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading Republican consultant, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said, ``Roger does have a sense of ethics, loath as he
is to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Stone is an exuberant negative campaigner, known for
drawing journalists to seamy rumors. As a Nixon fan and a volunteer
for the Committee to Re-Elect the President, he donated money to
the presidential primary campaign of a Republican challenger, using
the name of a left-wing group, and then mailed the receipt to a
newspaper. In 1989, for local New Jersey Republicans, he designed a
direct mail piece with government-style writing that said,
``important tax information enclosed.'' It warned homeowners that
their taxes had doubled, courtesy of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to political shrewdness, Stone was precocious. As
a junior, then vice president of his northern Westchester high
school, he manipulated the ouster of the president and his own
succession. Running for re-election as a senior, ``I left nothing
to chance,'' he said. ``I built alliances and put all my serious
challengers on my ticket. Then I recruited the most unpopular guy
in the school to run against me. You think that's mean? No, it's
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   As for handling the maverick Trump, whose various business
interests he has long represented, Stone is clearly having a grand,
unbuttoned time of it. After Trump announced his tax-the-rich
notion, ``Every Wall Street economist trashed our plan,'' Stone
said. ``A conventional politician would pull his hair out, but we
love it!'' Attention, for better or worse, was paid.
</P>
<P>
   He professes little interest in the mainstream candidates,
although he keeps his four Washington Rolodexes spinning for his
corporate clients. As long as Trump is in the race, Stone said, by
way of understatement, ``We're not going to bore anyone to death.''

SPRINT AND MCI STRESS CONSUMER ADVANTAGES IN FILING MERGER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. filed with the
Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday for approval of
their $129 billion merger and put a pro-consumer spin on a deal
that many business and consumer advocates are urging regulators to
block.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after the filing, the companies portrayed
the merger as the union of two ``dragon slayers, price slashers and
innovators'' and the best hope for creating a company that can
compete with cable and local-telephone powerhouses such as AT&AMP;T,
Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the merger, said MCI general counsel Michael
Salsbury, is ``to create a dramatically more effective competitor
... that will take on the entrenched monopolies in the United
States and around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives downplayed the widespread concern that the new
company could control long-distance prices, despite the fact that
the deal would leave 80 percent of the market controlled by AT&AMP;T
and the new WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they painted a picture of a market filled with hundreds
of aggressive, if smaller, long-distance rivals and a market facing
upheaval with the imminent entry of the regional Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Salsbury said that with the rapid growth of long-distance
capacity in fiber networks built by such upstarts as Qwest
Communications, ``there are no shortages that somebody could
exploit to drive up prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the companies will urge phone and antitrust regulators
to ignore the historical distinction between local and
long-distance calling, which they say is rapidly eroding.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to judge the merger's effects, they said, is to
look one or two years into the future. By that point, they said,
the regional Bells will have added long-distance service to their
local and Internet offerings. AT&AMP;T will be providing local,
long-distance and Internet service over cable lines. And consumers
will be buying integrated bundles of all the services from one
provider, with all-distance, flat-rate pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear and read a lot about this merger being the merger of
the No. 2 and 3 long-distance carriers,'' Salsbury said. ``We don't
look at the market that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we see it, it's really the merger of the Nos. 4 and 7
providers in the domestic telecommunications market. AT&AMP;T, SBC and
Bell Atlantic are all bigger today. ... We would be the No. 4
player in a post-merger world. We view this as a way to get big
enough to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   Salsbury said the combined company would benefit from economies
of scale, the scope of its combined services, and $15 billion in
operating and capital expenditure savings over four years, which
could be passed to customers in the form of lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies stressed the strategic sense of the merger.
Sprint owns local telephone assets in rural areas, and MCI owns
local facilities in 100 urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint owns America's fastest-growing wireless company, Sprint
PCS. MCI is a big player in the paging industry through its Skytel
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are investing heavily to roll out broadband
services. In the past year, the companies have snapped up companies
owning fixed wireless licenses, radio spectrum that can be used to
provide high-speed Internet and voice services through a 9-inch
antenna mounted on a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separately, we don't have sufficient mass to develop that into
a broadband access vehicle,'' Salsbury said. ``Together, we reach
about 60 percent of households. That does become very attractive,
with sufficient scale and reach, to be an attractive alternative''
to high-speed Internet services offered by cable and local
telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's general counsel, suggested that the
combined company might consider shedding some Internet assets to
allay antitrust concerns. But he said any further divestitures,
such as parts of the companies' long-distance business, would be
``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to complete their merger by mid-2000. There
is no time limit on the FCC process, but the agency has been under
congressional pressure to speed up its reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC will open up the proposed merger for a public comment
period of 30 to 60 days and then take replies from the companies.
At that point, the FCC is free to act, but it also could go into
additional proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI said they expected the review to move much more
quickly than did the review of SBC's purchase of Ameritech, which
took 15 months because that merger involved the combination of
local monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this deal is expected to undergo scrutiny. The
Justice Department has already asked for more information from the
companies, indicating that it will be conducting a full-blown
antitrust review.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the companies announced their plan to merge, William
Kennard, the FCC chairman, said they would bear ``a heavy burden to
show how consumers will be better off.''

EDITORIAL: SENATOR HAGEL'S DECEPTIVE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 18:
</P>
<P>
   In the welter of unfinished business left behind by Congress
this year, campaign finance legislation again stands out.
Nevertheless, progress has been achieved. The House passed a reform
measure in the summer, and 55 senators backed some form of ``soft
money'' ban promoted by Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold.
Less noticed but also significant, five more Republican senators
now say some controls on soft money are needed. Congress can build
on these gains next year.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential election year is not usually productive
legislatively, but cleaning up the election fund-raising system
could prove an exception to that rule. A sign of the turning tide
came yesterday with the announcement by Time Warner, one of the
biggest corporate donors, that it would no longer make soft-money
contributions to the political parties. With its action, Time
Warner joins a growing number of companies that are in open
rebellion against traditional fund-raising. Through groups like the
Committee for Economic Development, that rebellion has spread
despite heavy-handed warnings from Sen. Mitch McConnell, a leading
defender of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain has gained in the polls by supporting a
campaign finance overhaul and has promised to bring up his bill
again next year. This growing support for limits on
special-interest money has produced a new danger, however. Sen.
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, an articulate critic of current
fund-raising practices, has proposed an alternative bill to control
soft money. His bill has gained some adherents, but it is fatally
flawed. The danger lies in this measure's serving as an excuse for
not passing genuine improvements in the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   The objective of reformers, embodied by the McCain-Feingold
bill, has been to outlaw soft money _ the unlimited contributions
by corporations, unions and rich donors to political parties that
circumvent the tight limits on donations to the candidates
themselves. Hagel argues that an outright ban on soft money is
extreme. He wants to cap such donations to parties at $60,000 a
year, raise the ceilings on regular donations to individual
candidates from $1,000 to $3,000, and allow an individual aggregate
of $75,000 a year to parties for all races.
</P>
<P>
   These ceilings are unacceptably high. They would not end the
corrupt soft-money system so much as legitimize it. The $60,000
annual cap would actually be $120,000 for each two-year cycle,
translating into $240,000 for a couple, along with $300,000 for
each couple for direct donations to candidates. The caps would be a
step backward, legalizing donations from corporations (outlawed in
1907) and from unions (outlawed in 1947). Another loophole in
Hagel's bill would allow unlimited donations to state parties for
use in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his bill, Hagel argues that the McCain-Feingold
measure, with its complete soft-money ban, is dead in the Senate.
He says he is only trying to find a middle ground. But this is no
middle ground. It is a surrender to the corrupt status quo. The
tipoff is that McConnell, the Senate Republicans' chief
fund-raiser, has praised Hagel's bill and announced hearings on it
for next year. Surely no more hearings are needed on this issue.
McConnell is simply trying to use hearings as an excuse to
forestall stronger legislation.
</P>
<P>
   What is actually going on is that pressure is building on
wavering Republicans to break the filibuster engineered by
McConnell and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to thwart the
majority support in the Senate for the McCain-Feingold bill. That
pressure has led George Voinovich and Mike DeWine of Ohio, along
with Spencer Abraham of Michigan and Craig Thomas of Wyoming, to
back Hagel's bill, apparently hoping that their constituents will
be fooled. Their anxiety is at least encouraging. Hagel can now
perform a service by acknowledging the flaws in his own bill and
bringing it closer to serious reform.

TEACHER WHOSE FIELD TRIPS ARE AN ART IS HONORED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARCHMONT, N.Y., Nov. 16 _ Donald S. Tedesco had been teaching
for only about four years when he almost gave up on it. Frustrated
by the conventional classroom, its stodgy textbooks and
sit-at-your-desk formality, he had decided to resign, but an
assistant superintendent in the Mamaroneck School District here
challenged him to find a better way to teach _ and then gave him
the freedom and the budget to try his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   For 29 years now, through shifting school board policies, a
variety of administrators and a changing school culture, Tedesco
has continued his experimental program, known as Actionville. And
on Sunday, his untiring effort won national recognition at Disney's
American Teacher Awards ceremony in Hollywood, where Tedesco was
named the Outstanding General Elementary Teacher in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our inception it has not been easy,'' said Tedesco, who
returned to class Wednesday after five days of celebrity treatment
in California. ``When you do something different, there are always
obstacles. At times, keeping Actionville going has been like rowing
up Niagara Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Actionville program, Tedesco has sidestepped textbooks
and focused instead on direct experience _ supplemented by
newspapers, magazines and, more recently, the Internet. Every week,
his 50 students at the Hommocks Middle School, who study all their
academic subjects through the program, go on a field trip. And
parent participation, in everything from helping create projects to
leading required dinner table conversation, is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of parents who didn't want their kids in the
program, because it's really intense parent participation,'' said
Nancy Miller, a book editor, whose son Benno Kling is a graduate of
the program. ``It wasn't easy for me _ I had a job, a younger child
and a baby _ but I wouldn't have missed it. It made you so involved
in your child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, a mix of fifth and sixth graders chosen by a
districtwide lottery, learn by solving problems and creating
projects, Tedesco said. Each year, for instance, students have to
write a novel as part of their English requirement. For social
studies, this year's class is redesigning the exhibits at the
Thomas Paine National Museum in New Rochelle to make the displays
more user-friendly _ and getting a good dose of American history in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and teachers in the Mamaroneck schools worry that
the Actionville program takes more than its share of school
resources and draws the best students away from the district's
other programs. But Ann R. Tannen, the district's director of
public information, said that was not the case. ``Alternative
programs by their nature cost more,'' she said. ``It's not as much
as people on the street seem to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Actionville costs about $15,000 more than a traditional program
of its size, for staff, supplies and trips, but spread out over 50
students, the cost is small, Ms. Tannen said. ``Is there jealousy
from teachers?'' she said. ``It's human nature. If not jealousy,
wistfulness. People thinking, `If I had that extra little whatever,
I could do more, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   For winning the Disney award, Tedesco and his school will each
receive $2,500. The overall Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award
went to Teri Lindner, a high school special education teacher from
State College, Pa. She and her school district won a total of
$60,000.
</P>
<P>
   They were chosen from a large field: 75,000 teachers were
nominated, 15,000 of those filled out Disney's extensive
application form, and 39 were chosen as finalists and invited to
Los Angeles, where 12 were chosen as winners in various categories.
The awards program was held Sunday night and broadcast Monday on
the Disney Channel.

H&AMP;R BLOCK JOINS IRS PROGRAM THAT MAY TRIM COST OF FASTEST REFUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Taxpayers who want their refunds really
quickly in the upcoming filing season may get a price break for the
fastest possible delivery, H&AMP;R Block Inc. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Block, which operates the nation's largest tax preparation
network, announced it was joining a growing number of tax services
participating in a one-year Internal Revenue Service pilot program
designed to double-check refund claims from taxpayers who file
electronic returns.
</P>
<P>
   The new program, Debt Indicator, is part of an effort by the
federal government to make sure taxpayers aren't delinquent on back
taxes, student loans, child support and certain other kinds of debt
before it issues refunds.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan also will provide Block and other tax services the
most solid assurance they've had since 1995 that taxpayers will get
the refunds they claim.
</P>
<P>
   These assurances are what companies rely on to make short-term
loans that put refunds in taxpayers' hands in days rather than
weeks. Tax services and the lenders with which they work currently
run their own special forms of credit checks to judge whether full
refunds will be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS program will likely result in substantially lower fees
for this service,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni, Block's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Debt Indicator program, the IRS checks incoming
returns for suspicious claims or to see if money for debts might be
withheld from a refund. Then the IRS sends its findings to Block or
other participating preparers to relay to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the program represents a significant
advancement in fighting potential tax fraud. Preparers such as
Block say the arrangement also is a potentially important tool for
delivering fast refunds more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, it takes the IRS about six to eight weeks to send
refunds to taxpayers who file paper returns and about one to three
weeks for those who file electronically. Tax services cut this time
to about two or three days by offering taxpayers what are known as
refund anticipation loans.
</P>
<P>
   Tax services offering these loans will calculate the refunds and
help arrange for taxpayers to get that money _ minus a fee of
usually about $60 on an average-size refund _ from a bank instead
of the government. The bank is repaid three weeks later when it
receives the full refund that otherwise would have gone to the
taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   Block said about 5.5 million of its customers took advantage of
these loans to get their refunds as quickly as possible during the
1994 filing season, the last in which the IRS provided assurances
directly to lenders that refunds would be sent.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS stopped offering those earlier notifications in 1995
because electronic assurances were being sent to lenders faster
than refund amounts could be verified.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the number of customers dropped below 3 million, and
loan costs to those remaining clients rose sharply when lenders
switched to their own screening programs, Block said.

SPURRIER STIRS UP QB CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the rivalry 99.9 percent of the nation will focus on,
except for the sliver of the country interested in two 4-6 teams
playing each other at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Florida-Florida State probably features the two best teams in
the nation, and wouldn't you know that ornery Steve Spurrier is in
his finest form as the game approaches. He benched starting
quarterback Doug Johnson for last week's victory over South
Carolina and used Jesse Palmer, who had not played since the second
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't exactly seem like the best way to go into the biggest
game of the year, but Spurrier jumped on reporters who dared ask
which quarterback would start against the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to do whatever gives us the best chance to beat
FSU,'' he said. ``Quit trying to figure it out for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier has grown increasingly frustrated with Johnson in
recent weeks as Florida's high-powered offense sputtered. Two weeks
ago against Vanderbilt, the Gators had to hold off the Commodores
in the final seconds of a 13-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Although they weren't threatened in the second half at South
Carolina, a 20-3 win over a winless team is nothing to brag about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look overly impressive in our games right now,''
Spurrier said. ``We played as hard as we could both halves. That's
what we are. We aren't as mighty as people like to think we are,
but we keep winning somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarterback change might seem like drastic approach to take in
mid-November, but Spurrier-watchers know he's always had a quick
trigger with the position and it's hard to argue with his track
record.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed just 15 of 33 passes for 161 yards, one
touchdown and one interception against South Carolina. Johnson, who
had started 15 straight games, did not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me too long to get into a groove,'' Palmer said.
``It's been about a year since I started. I have worked in
practice, but you've got to go out and execute on the field. We had
a lot of guys open and I was making the right decisions, I just
wasn't getting them the football.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, Florida State Bobby Bowden is in high spirits,
even if he does have to go to The Swamp. He remembers winning there
in 1993 during the Seminoles' national championship season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're going in there in as good a circumstance as
we can go in,'' he said. ``You still have to go down there and do
it and the odds of playing in that stadium are not big and yet the
year we won the national championship, we did it. You wonder if
those are signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, '93 was the last time the visiting team won in
this series.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bad team: If nothing else, the Iowa football team
inconsistent. Consistently bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes rank 102nd or worse in six statistical categories
nationally, last in 10 Big Ten categories and are 1-9 overall, 0-7
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the factors is we aren't the most experienced group,''
Iowa first-year coach Kirk Ferentz said. ``The other, obviously, is
we're playing in a league right now that's extremely strong from
top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he including Indiana and Northwestern in that statement?
</P>
<P>
   __ What a streak: As Wisconsin tailback Ron Dayne and his
teammates celebrated Dayne becoming the NCAA's all-time rushing
leader, a streaker with a red wig came out of the far end zone and
ran the length of the field into the waiting arms of security at
Camp Randall Stadium. Along the way he paused at about the 20-yard
line and did the Heisman pose.
</P>
<P>
   __ Date with destiny: The last three Louisiana State head
coaches _ Mike Archer, Curley Hallman and Gerry DiNardo _ all saw
their terms come to an end Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   __ Redemption: Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner spent a year
living down his fumble that opened the door for Tennessee's
improbable win over the Razorbacks a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Stoerner's brother gave him a gag gift for Christmas
_ afootball with a handle glued on it. One day when Stoerner and
his girlfriend were passing oranges in the grocery, a couple of
guys starting saying, ``Oh, he dropped it. He dropped it!''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner won't hear any more stories now that the Razorbacks
upset Tennessee last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rivalry 101: South Carolina coach Lou Holtz has been teaching
his players about the history of the Gamecocks' rivalry with
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   It must beat worrying about their winless season.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Holtz will test his players on the knowledge of the
series, who won the first game, when it was played and who has won
by the most lopsided score.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things I didn't know about the history of the
Gamecocks, '' senior tight end Trevon Matthews told The State
(S.C.) newspaper. ``There's so much I never knew, like back then a
touchdown was worth fourpoints. . . . That's something I'm glad he
taught us.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rooting for the enemy: Washington State players are
disappointed that Washington lost to UCLA on the eve of the Apple
Cup, which makes the game slightly less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty upset that Washington couldn't beat UCLA,'' said
senior safety Torry Hollimon, whose brother played at Washington
before an acrimonious transfer in the spring of 1997. ``It takes a
little something out of the Apple Cup. We wanted to be the ones to
knock them out of the Rose Bowl.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCOTT WOLF'S TOP 10 &QL; 
__ 1. Florida State (10-0): Everyone writes off Seminoles' chances
against Gators. Bad idea. &QL; 
__ 2. Florida (9-1): Spurrier loves a QB controversy, so he benches
Doug Johnson. &QL; 
__ 3. Virginia Tech (9-0): Could Hokies possibly lose to lowly
Temple two straight years? &QL; 
__ 4. Nebraska (9-1): Fiesta Bowl bid awaits if Huskers beat Texas
in Big 12 title game. &QL; 
__ 5. Tennessee (7-2): No divine intervention to prevent Arkansas
victory this year. &QL; 
__ 6. Kansas State (9-1): No what-ifs about making BCS title game
this year. &QL; 
__ 7. Wisconsin (9-2): Great Dayne just guaranteed himself a
Heisman Trophy. &QL; 
__ 8. Alabama (8-2): Does this mean Mike DuBose will keep his job? &QL; 
__ 9. Penn State (9-2): Joe Paterno sporting an 0-3 record against
Michigan's Lloyd Carr. &QL; 
__ 10. Mississippi State (8-1): Bulldogs play first real team.
Surprise, lose first game. &QL; 
__ Five more to watch: 11. Michigan (8-2); 12. Texas (9-2); 13.
Georgia Tech (7-2);14. Marshall (10-0); 15. Michigan State (8-2).
</P>
<P>
   THE LIST
</P>
<P>
   It's time to look at the major bowl bids. Here's the way things
shape up today, assuming Florida defeats Florida State on Saturday.

<P>
   Best Bet

<P>
   __ No. 1 Florida State (10-0) at No. 3 Florida (9-1)
</P>
<P>
   These are the only two schools to finish in the top 10 the past
eight seasons, so it's fitting that this game helps determine the
national champion. Florida coach Steve Spurrier is 4-6-1 against
the Seminoles; Florida State coach Bobby Bowden is 13-11-1 against
the Gators. &QL; 
QUOTE OF THE WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to bury them. Not bury them in a bad way but like a
wounded animal. We didn't want them having any last gasp.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Illinois defensive tackle Mike McGee after a 46-20 win over
No. 25 Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   STAT OF THE WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   7,494
</P>
<P>
   _ The attendance reported for Southern Methodist's final game in
the 68,252-seat Cotton Bowl in its contest against CSUN, even
though reporters guessed it was closer to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T MISS TV GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Florida State at No. 3 Florida
</P>
<P>
   Channel 2, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   You don't really need to know much more than that _ except the
Gators might be the most unimpressive third-ranked team in the
country in a long time. They don't even know who'll play
quarterback because neither has impressed.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Alabama at Auburn
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Auburn (5-5, 2-5 SEC) needs one more win to become bowl
eligible. How'd that happen? Because QB Ben Leard has been passing
at a 72 percent clip, with 50 of his 85 completions going to WR
Ronney Daniels. The game's at Auburn's Jordan-Hare Stadium, where
the Tide is 0-4 in meetings there.
</P>
<P>
   Washington at Washington State
</P>
<P>
   Pay-per-view, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies need to win and hope Stanford loses to Cal so they
can return to Pasadena and get the bad taste of that loss to UCLA
last week out of their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State at Oregon
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks can still go to the Rose Bowl. How? If they win and
Stanford and Washington lose. Even though Oregon would be tied with
Stanford, it would go because of its better overall record. The
Ducks and Cardinal didn't face each other this year.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard at Yale
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like about this annual gridiron classic? How about
they play this like they did in 1899 _ no helmets. There's also a
local angle _ Randy Rosenbloom is doing the play-by-play.

HOUSE OF LLOYD IS SOLD TO NEW YORK INVESTMENT GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Privately held House of Lloyd Inc. in Grandview, Mo.,
has been sold for an undisclosed price to a New York investment
group that has similar retail holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds of the sale by the Harry J. Lloyd Charitable Trust are
to benefit hundreds of Christian evangelism groups, charities and
medical research projects worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner is a partnership made up of Kier Group Holdings
LLC, a New York investment firm, and SG Capital Partners, an
American affiliate of France's Societe Generale, one of the world's
largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lloyd's chief executive, Demi Lloyd, will step
down, and Kier Group Chairman Joel Kier, 35, will assume the titles
of chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Kier said Wednesday that the company's 1,000 seasonal and
full-time workers in Grandview were assured of their jobs and that
he expected expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invested in the business and the people there who are in
place,'' Kier said. ``We gave them that message in a meeting today.
We encouraged all of them to stay with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business that has extreme potential to grow in a
robust industry that brings a retail shopping experience into the
customer's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Founder Henry Lloyd died in 1997, and federal charitable trust
tax laws mandated the company's sale within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Demi Lloyd said her departure marked the end of the Lloyd
family's direct involvement in operations of the 47-year-old
worldwide marketer of giftware, Christmas decor, and home and
kitchen wares.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said of the sale decision: ``There were some emotions
involved. My sister (Jami Kay) and I considered purchasing the
company, but we don't have the resources for such an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is proud that the company Dad founded and nurtured
is in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said she would stay at home and raise her children, ages 1
and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mom job will be more challenging'' than being
chief executive of a worldwide company with offices in Mexico,
Europe and Puerto Rico, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale proceeds are to be distributed by the Lloyd trust to
various religious and medical research groups. The Loch Lloyd
Country Club will remain part of the trust.
</P>
<P>
   At the House of Lloyd, the catalog offers many religious items
and features photos of Demi Lloyd and district manager Carie White
and their families. In a message to customers, Lloyd wrote in one
catalog about her father's faith and said his company was a
``business that enables people to put their families first ...
(and) is dedicated to bringing joy and meaning to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kier pledged that those values would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture and the traditions of the business are very
important with any company, and with this one in particular,'' he
said. ``We think Christian and home values are an important concept
that we want to nurture and build.''
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lloyd does not disclose sales figures, but Demi
Lloyd said the company filled about half a million orders annually.
Most of those sales are made through 30,000 representatives who
stage home parties and demonstrate the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Lloyd has a terrific name and legacy behind that
name,'' Kier said. ``We are absolutely committed to (maintaining)
that name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kier group owns other collectible, giftware and candle
firms, including Ceratech Inc., Papel Giftware Inc., Fitz and Floyd
Inc. and Flintlock Ltd. Kier also has interests in Bell Sports Inc.
and a home cleaning products firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kier previously was a senior executive at Edizione Holdings SpA,
the primary holding company for the Italian Benetton family's
interests in the worldwide sporting goods industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kier lives in New York with his wife and daughter and is active
in wildlife conservation.

   JASPER, Texas _ Jurors deliberated for more than eight hours
Wednesday but could not reach a verdict in the capital murder case
of Shawn Berry, the last of three white men to be tried in last
year's gruesome dragging death of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. CDT State District Judge Joe Bob Golden sent the jury
to a local motel. He ordered them back to the Jasper County
Courthouse on Thursday to continue deliberations. The all-white
jury of seven women and five men is trying to decide whether Berry
is guilty of capital murder, murder or whether he was not
responsible for the death of James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister Betty Boatner said she was prepared for whatever
the jury would say. Even if Berry is acquitted, he eventually will
have to answer to God, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a higher court to go to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 24, admitted during his trial that he invited Byrd _ 49
years old, disabled and inebriated the night of June 7, 1998 _ into
his truck with two white supremacists, Bill King and Russell Brewer
Jr. Berry drove the three of them to the East Texas woods where
Byrd was beaten, chained and dragged to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Berry denied participating in the crime. He said it was King,
25, and Brewer, 32, who attacked Byrd, and that he was too
frightened to intervene because King had threatened to kill him
too. Berry said he had no idea what King and Brewer planned to do
when they picked up Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate juror George Coleman, who was released from the jury
when deliberations began about 12:30 p.m., said he didn't believe
Berry's story. Had he remained on the jury, Coleman said he would
have voted to convict Berry and sentence him to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a big lie,'' said Coleman, a 26-year-old construction
worker from Buna.
</P>
<P>
   While being questioned during jury selection, Coleman admitted
knowing a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Berry wouldn't have lived
with King, a Klansman, if he didn't hold similar racist views,
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also said he didn't believe Berry stood idly by while
Byrd was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes more than two people to hold somebody down and put
chains on his feet,'' Coleman said. ``To me, he had more to do with
it than the others did.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, a theater manager in the racially mixed community of
Jasper, was not known to be a racist. But prosecutors contended
Berry knew King and Brewer were. Both King and Brewer had been
incarcerated and both joined the Confederate Knights of America, a
small racist prison gang. The arms of both men are covered with
racist tattoos and they talked of starting a race war. During
Berry's trial, jurors saw photographs of King and Brewer's tattoos,
including one on King's arm depicting the lynching of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also had to know King and Brewer were up to no good when
they stopped to pick up Byrd, a divorced father of three, as he
walked along Martin Luther King Boulevard on his way home.
</P>
<P>
   The men drove Byrd to a clearing in the woods, beat and kicked
him and then dragged behind Berry's pickup for more than three
miles. A pathologist testified that for at least two of those
miles, Byrd was conscious and fighting desperately to keep his head
off the pavement. Byrd ground his elbows to the bone in the futile
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's agony ended when his body slammed into a concrete culvert
and he was decapitated. His head, right shoulder and arm were found
in a ditch the next morning. The rest of his body lay about a mile
away, just outside a rural black cemetery on Huff Creek Road.
</P>
<P>
   The crime shocked Jasper residents and prompted armed black
activists and the Ku Klux Klan to march on the community.
</P>
<P>
   The jury contemplated Berry's case behind closed doors for five
straight hours before breaking for dinner. After an hour, the jury
returned to the courthouse and continued discussing the case until
Golden sent them to the motel.
</P>
<P>
   The juries in the King and Brewer trials did not take nearly as
long to return verdicts. In King's trial last February, a Jasper
jury with one black member convicted him after only 2 1/2 hours. A
Bryan jury in September convicted Brewer in four.
</P>
<P>
   If Berry is convicted of capital murder, which would mean he
both kidnapped and killed Byrd, he would face life in prison or
join his co-defendants on death row. If the jury convicted him of
the lesser charge of murder, Berry could get five years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute closing argument, defense attorney Joseph C.
``Lum'' Hawthorn insisted that Berry had no idea that King was
violent. Hawthorn asked the jury to have the courage to acquit
Berry, just as three blacks and one biracial woman braved public
criticism to take the stand in Berry's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Byrd Jr.'s murder has been avenged,'' Hawthorn said.
``The two people who killed James Byrd Jr. have been tried,
convicted and sentenced to death. Justice has been served.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors countered Hawthorn's argument by telling jurors
Berry assaulted his child's mother, Christie Marcontell. On at
least two occasions, Marcontell gave statements to police, saying
Berry hit her, choked her and threatened to throw her off a
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Pat Hardy told jurors Berry was just
as responsible for Byrd's killing as King and Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three people involved in this ... and that man was
the worst of the bunch,'' he said, pointing at Berry. ``As sick as
their beliefs were, King and Brewer, at least they believed in
something. Shawn Berry did all of this for nothing but the fun of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Berry claimed he had no idea why white
supremacists would offer a black man a ride until he heard King
say, ``Let's kill this nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors disputed that account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Berry knew exactly what was going on,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray: ``It was
Shawn Berry's truck, Shawn Berry's chain. It was Shawn Berry (who)
made the decision to pick James Byrd up. Shawn Berry made the
decision to drive out into a remote area. Shawn Berry has got more
blood on him than any one of the three, and it was Shawn Berry
driving that truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the killing, Berry admitted he went to a local
carwash and helped King clean the pickup and the 24-foot logging
chain used to drag Byrd. Berry later led police to a shallow hole
outside a friend's trailer home, where he said King and Brewer hid
the chain. The defense claimed any blood found on Berry's clothes
was splatter from the water used to wash the chain.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Byrd family waited pensively for the jury to
reach its decision Wednesday, Byrd's oldest daughter, Francis Renee
Mullins, gave birth to Byrd's second grandchild at a hospital near
her home in Hawaii. The baby will be nicknamed ``Son,'' which was
James Byrd Jr.'s nickname, family members said.

LEADERS SEE INSTITUTE AS CATALYST FOR INCREASED RESEARCH
INVESTMENT

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As the $200 million Stowers Institute for
Medical Research takes shape, area leaders are looking to it as the
catalyst to turn Kansas City into one of the nation's top 10
biomedical research and development sites.
</P>
<P>
   The institute marks a milestone Thursday as it moves into its
new administrative office and introduces the first three scientists
it is bringing to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   When the institute begins scientific work about a year from now,
it will do biomedical research that could result in better ways to
treat cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to help improve the quality of everyone's life,
while making this area of the country known as one of the best
places in the world for biomedical research,'' said James E.
Stowers Jr., the mutual fund executive who founded the institute
with his wife, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, city leaders hope that the Stowers Institute will pump
new life into the area's scientific, educational and economic
spheres.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a task force has recommended that the area
raise $300 million for community-wide research and development over
10 years. Meeting that goal may be viewed as the city's answer to
recent losses of corporate and organizational headquarters, task
force members say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort will produce a sense of pride and control over our
destiny in the Kansas City area,'' said John M. Edgar, co-chairman
of the Life Sciences Task Force. ``This is a community undertaking,
which is located here and is not susceptible to being acquired and
taken from this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the task force is to boost the level of research and
development in the Kansas City area, now about $100 million a year,
to $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Noffsinger, executive director of the University of
Kansas Medical Center Research Institute, predicted that if Kansas
City was successful in becoming a biomedical research center, it
would create the kind of economic impetus in the next decade that
Sprint Corp. provided in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pull this off the way it's going now, there will be an
economic turnaround,'' he said. ``It's (biomedical research) a huge
new growth area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stowers Institute alone is expected to be a welcome addition
to the city's economic arsenal. The projected value of building and
equipping the office building and the first 230,000 square feet of
research space is about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, which is being built on the site of the old Menorah
Medical Center at 49th Street and Rockhill Road, will have enough
room to grow into 530,000 square feet of research space.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers research is focusing on some of the most fundamental
questions in the life sciences: how the genes that carry the
blueprint of every living organism work together to produce and
maintain life, and to cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   This knowledge is considered essential to understanding many
illnesses, including cancer, diabetes, heart disease and autoimmune
disorders, that have challenged medical science.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stowers research can be expected to produce many
technological spin-offs, the institute will not develop new drugs
or medical treatments. Nor will it treat sick people.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers plans to sell rights to its discoveries to businesses,
yielding hundreds of millions of dollars to swell the institute's
endowment, Stowers officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers intends the discoveries to be commercially developed
locally, with the researchers themselves sharing in the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowers Institute endowment now stands at $340 million and
is expected to grow to billions of dollars in the coming decades.
Nonetheless, institute officials say they will need to engage in
fund raising once scientific work begins, in order to operate at an
optimum level.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was announced in September 1994, the Stowers Institute
has generated a hopeful buzz among area leaders searching for the
next economic bandwagon. The local economy is strong, but the
possible loss of the Sprint headquarters and other losses have made
Kansas Citians hunger for an economic ticket into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Several area civic and business leaders see life sciences
research as that ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put our strengths together, we then reach a point where
we really start to have a critical amount of R and D going on that
would spin off enough ideas to attract enough companies to have a
significant economic impact on the region,'' said James Spigarelli,
executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Midwest
Research Institute. Spigarelli has played a key role on the life
sciences task force.
</P>
<P>
   The task force was formed by the Kansas City Area Development
Council and the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City. The $300
million that it has recommended be raised for research and
development would come from sources such as government, foundations
and private funders and would act as a catalyst for additional
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The task force said such an endeavor made sense in light of the
Stowers plans and ongoing work at entities such as Midwest Research
Institute, St. Luke's Hospital, Children's Mercy Hospital, the
University of Kansas Medical Center, the University of
Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Quintiles Transnational
Corp. and Bayer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if this strategy is successfully implemented,
Kansas City can be among the top 10 regions in the country for
expenditures in life sciences research, at $500 million a year,''
Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael F. Morrissey, the other co-chairman of the task force,
said a business plan on how to accomplish the goals of the task
force would be developed by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The goals of the Kansas City group mirror the thinking of
national experts.
</P>
<P>
   The Milken Institute, a nonpartisan economics think tank in
Santa Monica, Calif., reported in July that Kansas City ranked 29th
among the 315 metropolitan areas Milken studied in terms of the
percentage of the nation's high-tech output it produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research centers and institutions are undisputedly the most
important factor in incubating high-tech industries,'' the Milken
report said.

EDITORIAL: INVESTIGATING THE CRASH OF EGYPTAIR 990 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 remains a mystery.
Information from voice and flight data recorders raised suspicions
that a relief pilot, Gameel el-Batouty, deliberately sent the
Boeing 767 plunging into the ocean. But Egypt's government has
strongly protested the view that Batouty's recorded words suggest a
prayer before a suicidal act rather than a response to a problem in
the cockpit. Given differing cultural interpretations of his words
and the fact that much of the wreckage has not been recovered, it
is too early to draw conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, it is appropriate for the National
Transportation Safety Board, the lead investigator, to retain
jurisdiction for now rather than transfer the matter to the FBI,
which will take over if there is evidence that the disaster was the
result of a criminal act. It is also prudent for the NTSB to allow
Egyptian authorities to help analyze the words of the crew. That is
not just a diplomatic courtesy. Egyptian experts are in the best
position to grasp the import of the words spoken.
</P>
<P>
   In the voice recording, Batouty is heard uttering a common
Arabic expression that can mean ``I put my trust in God.'' Egyptian
officials insist that the words are said in response to danger
rather than as a prelude to suicide. About the time of that
comment, someone shut off the automatic pilot and the plane went
into a a dive from 33,000 feet to less than 17,000 feet. The
microphones also picked up the voice of the captain, Ahmed
el-Habashy, who may have briefly left the cockpit and then
returned, saying in Arabic, ``What's going on?'' Investigators also
say that during the rapid descent, the two flaps on the tail moved
in opposite directions, suggesting to American investigators that
two pilots were fighting for control of the plane as one of them
struggled to crash it.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, the safety board's chairman, says that so far
investigators have found no sign of a mechanical malfunction or a
weather condition that could have caused the accident. But they
have not yet retrieved the remains of the cockpit, which may
provide more clues.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB and the FBI have thus far avoided the bureaucratic
infighting that plagued the investigation of the crash of Trans
World Airlines Flight 800. In that case, the FBI took an early and
visible role. But by leaning toward a terrorism theory, critics
say, the FBI came into conflict with safety board investigators who
favored a theory of mechanical failure. In this new case, the
tension centers on a complex mix of safety concerns, national pride
and genuine puzzlement over a mystifying crash.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's cautious response on Tuesday was the correct one.
The FBI has an important role to play, but the NTSB should remain
in the lead until the Egyptians have had a chance to contribute
their judgments and until it seems clear that mechanical failures
cannot explain the disaster. Then the FBI would appropriately take
charge without ambiguity or bureaucratic conflict. The possibility
of a suicide crash of Flight 990 is a frightening scenario. But
since nothing can reclaim the lost lives, a careful, collaborative
inquiry is the proper course for the time being.

SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASE ENDS, BUT ACCREDITATION STRUGGLE
CONTINUES

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple on Wednesday
dismissed the 22-year-old Kansas City school-desegregation lawsuit
and refused to block a state decision to strip the district of
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple ruled that despite many remaining problems, the district
has done all that it can to eliminate segregation and should be
freed from court control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sole question in this case is whether the (district) is
currently providing an equal education to its students, regardless
of their race,'' Whipple wrote in a 42-page order. ``The court must
answer this question in the affirmative.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple's decision to end the long-running case stunned many.
Most had not expected a decision on whether the district should be
freed from the case until after a court hearing sometime next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic day for the Kansas City, Missouri, School
District,'' Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. said. ``Clearly, the
court believes that this administration is focused on the things
that need to be done to raise student academic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in more than 20 years, we control our own
destiny,'' Demps continued. ``This community has been given back
the responsibility for educating its children. Our success, or our
failure, will rest squarely on our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   But Demps didn't agree with Whipple's refusal to block the state
Board of Education's decision to declare the district unaccredited,
effective May 1, for failing to meet any of 11 Missouri performance
standards. District officials had argued that the loss of state
accreditation would make it impossible to meet court-ordered goals
to improve academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Demps said the state's action heightens the uncertainty and
anxiety for parents and students and will make it harder to attract
and retain high-quality staff.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple said his decision on accreditation stemmed from his
confidence that the state's standards mesh well with the court's
desegregation goals. He also argued that the state Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education might be better positioned than
the federal court to help the district implement the needed
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   District officials said they were still considering measures to
stop the state action.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Delaney, an attorney for the district, said Demps likely
will ask the state board to reconsider its accreditation decision,
or at least to postpone it until after graduation to reassure high
school seniors that their status won't be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   If the state board won't reconsider, Delaney said, the district
plans to challenge the accreditation action in state court. Delaney
said the district doesn't question the state's standards, but it
disputes the way the state measures the district's performance
against those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Should efforts to challenge the accreditation decision fail, the
district would have two years to improve performance or face the
possibility of a state takeover. Ultimately, the district could be
dissolved and its students attached to new or existing districts.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman said he was
pleased with Whipple's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful now we can spend the energy being eaten up by this
litigation on raising student performance in the Kansas City School
District,'' Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren,
said he disagreed that the district had done everything it could to
improve academic achievement. He said Whipple also failed to allow
the plaintiff schoolchildren to present evidence or legal arguments
before dismissing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he would not commit to an appeal, saying, ``We are genuinely
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the decision may be constitutionally insufficient,
educationally, the judge's argument merits careful consideration,''
Benson said. ``The court's argument that (the state department) is
finally, after 40 years of neglecting urban education, better
positioned to improve teaching and learning may be correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmark decision, should... MORE

IN BATTLE FOR SHOPPERS, MALLS EMPHASIZE SENSE OF PLACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Ohio)  (rk) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ If F.T.D. and the Tupi Indians of Brazil
joined forces to build a massive shopping center in the bleak,
industrial strip between Newark Airport and the hulking marine
docks here, it might look something like the Jersey Gardens Outlet
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-foot wall of ivy cascades near the neon signs in the food
court. Topiary gardens hang in steel-mesh cages high above the
entrances to stores like Neiman Marcus and the Gap. In the
Rainforest Cafe, customers sit under plastic banana leaves dining
on Mayan Meatloaf and Primal Steak to a safari soundtrack complete
with braying elephants, apocalyptic thunderstorms and the
percussive beating of digitally mastered conga drums.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the lengths that retailers in the mall-choked New York
region are driven to these days to attract shoppers. In New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut, where 324 malls offer more than 81
billion square feet of merchandising space, the message is clear:
You gotta have a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   So when Jersey Gardens opened last month, it placed itself in
competition with the region's outlet champion, a mall that wants to
evoke a homey Main Street appeal, Woodbury Common Premium Outlets
in Central Valley, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises a question: Restraint or razzmatazz? Which
do the shoppers prefer?
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, developers at both centers prefer their own mall.
Jersey Gardens, which is owned by Glimcher Realty Trust of
Columbus, Ohio, says its blend of theme-park architecture, retail
shops and entertainment (restaurants, game arcades and a 22-screen
cineplex opening in the spring) is the future of shopping malls.
Woodbury Common, on the other hand, is content to rely on its
stable of blue-blood outlet tenants and its bucolic setting at the
foot of the Catskill Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spend the entire day and enjoy everything we have to offer,
that's what we want our customers to do,'' said Crystal Stell,
Jersey Gardens' marketing director. ``We're about finding a nice
pair of jeans at a good price. But we're also about having lunch,
seeing a movie and spending time with your family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Rothstein, vice president for marketing at Woodbury
Common, which is owned by Chelsea GCA Realty Inc. of Roseland,
N.J., said shoppers at her mall ``don't get that sense of crazy,
frenetic mall life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what we believe is the finest outlet shopping
anywhere,'' Ms. Rothstein said. ``But even if you live 15 minutes
away, you still feel like you're on vacation when you come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, the two malls could not be more different. Jersey
Gardens is a carefully sculptured indoor idyll of Shinto arches,
leafy arbors and silent, glass-caged waterfalls. Surrounded by
sylvan slopes, Woodbury Common is an outdoor place, a collection of
white-washed clapboard buildings designed to resemble a quaint
Colonial town.
</P>
<P>
   The shoppers at Woodbury Common typically dress up to shop:
black-clad Manhattanites cooing at the Prada window and Japanese
tourists in Chanel snap pictures of the Gucci store. At Jersey
Gardens, the attitude is come as you are: carpenters in nylon union
jackets, elderly couples in matching cardigans, a few Wall Street
types playing hooky from work and die-hard mall rats in baggy
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Both malls place equal emphasis on customer service (shuttle
buses to and from New York, free pagers, help with dinner
reservations). Both are deluged with customers (10 million people a
year visit Woodbury Common; more than 100,000 visited Jersey
Gardens on its opening day, Oct. 21). And both are so busy that the
state police in both states have to direct traffic on the weekends
at the highway exits near their parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their similarities, the two have little to fear from
each other, experts say.
</P>

   ``Jersey Gardens is looking for the crossover shopper, someone
who will go see a movie or eat at the Rainforest Cafe then think,
`Hey, I need a pair of socks,''' said Malachy Kavanaugh, a
spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers.
``Woodbury Common is more of a true outlet mall, positioned 30 to
40 miles from its competition. Their customer makes a conscious
effort to go there and shop.''

SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASE ENDS, BUT ACCREDITATION STRUGGLE
CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...and learning may be correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmark decision, should it stand, would end what is
considered the most costly and ambitious desegregation remedy in
the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $2 billion was spent constructing or renovating nearly 80
buildings, improving teacher salaries, cutting class sizes and
introducing magnet programs designed to lure white suburban
students into the district.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the district abandoned many of the magnet
themes and returned to a system where the majority of students
attend neighborhood schools. Ironically, the number of racially
isolated schools _ those with more than 90 percent minority
populations _ has increased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the desegregation efforts also failed to improve
student performance. Whipple's ruling comes at a time when the
district has floundered educationally.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple said part of the lack of progress might stem from ``too
many chefs in the (district's) kitchen,'' a revolving door of
administrators and an overly political board.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the court's continued involvement was more
likely to impede Demps' progress.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple said the court's involvement has meant that too often,
educational policy differences that would normally be resolved by
the elected school board become mired in costly litigation. He also
said the court had become a convenient scapegoat and a shield for
the board against accepting responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``These byproducts of court oversight suggest that retention of
judicial control may be more disruptive than beneficial to the
(district),'' Whipple wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Whipple said the district had made significant progress
in recent years, including budget cuts, school closings and
progress toward eliminating the academic achievement gap between
black and white students.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that the district appears to have recently surmounted
the lack of administrative talent to carry out many of the needed
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple also ordered that his court-appointed Desegregation
Monitoring Committee remain in place until March 27, 2000, to
advise the district.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring committee Chairman John Murphy had recommended
against the loss of accreditation, but said he was optimistic about
the district under Demps' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``l feel confident, given appropriate support from the community
and Board of Education, Ben can take the school district in a
positive direction and implement the plans that have been designed
and put the school system back on its feet,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' union President Judy Morgan said that she and her
members were stunned and pleased by the judge's ruling to end the
desegregation case. They had expected the district would have to
participate in a hearing, projected to cost nearly $1 million in
legal fees, to get out from under court control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think it's good,'' she said. ``Our union went on
record....We felt the court had become an impediment, and there
were too many layers of bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan, who has been in the district for 29 years, said she
could not vouch for the assertion that the district has emerged
better than it was when the desegregation lawsuit was filed in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a period when things were better. But I
don't think they are now,'' she said. ``There's a lot of low morale
among staff....There's not much respect for the teachers.''

HACKETT COULD USE A TOLEDO TRANSFUSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The poll had to take its toll on Paul Hackett's
camp. So what if the demographics were small as a Whitman's Sampler
and less diverse? When 76 percent of Daily Trojan respondents say
you ought to throw in the towel, it's tough to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Hackett has spent the past few weeks picking at
pretexts like they were candies, searching for the most palatable
to obscure this season's bitter taste. Like George W. Bush, he's
trying to win over a constituency as spoiled and stubborn and rich
as the Republican right.
</P>
<P>
   Like Al Gore, he has a boss fighting public-image problems of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Bradley, he's often caught saying what he means
instead of what sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has huddled with a group of image-makers dubbed ``The
Crystal Group'' and is becoming a clear threat to Gore for the 2000
Democratic presidential nomination. Perhaps that's what Hackett
needs to close the gap with his primary nemesis, Bob Toledo: an
image makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Toledo, the fourth-year head coach of crosstown
rival UCLA, comes across as cashmere to Hackett's burlap.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is glib and warm. He is a natural-born schmoozer in
college football's cocktail-party climate. He is more
self-deprecating than defensive, more prone to public outbursts of
analysis than anger.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo jumps up and down on the sidelines and throws his arms in
the air and does almost as much cheerleading as the song girls.
People gravitate toward him for the same reason they do the
overstuffed chair in the living room; he looks snug.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett comes across as just plain smug.
</P>
<P>
   He's hard to read, what with his tinted glasses and impassive
expression. Pacing the sidelines on Saturdays, he exudes all the
warmth of freezer burn. The Trojans' second-year head coach is the
marble table in the living room, so austere people think twice
about putting a drink on it, much less their stocking feet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a 21-game winning streak goes a long way toward
establishing good will in our fair city. However, UCLA's
resplendent run the previous two seasons doesn't alone explain why
Toledo and Hackett both can awkwardly juggle their quarterbacks and
jiggle their seniors this fall and only Hackett gets raked over the
coals for it.
</P>
<P>
   If L.A. is slower to censure Toledo, it's partly because he is
as familiar to us as the friendly neighbor down the street. He
makes himself so accessible, we feel like we know him. He comes
across as one of us _ not anyone above us _ and so we're inclined
to ignore his blemishes as sure as we do our own.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett moved into Mr. Toledo's neighborhood and set the wrong
tone from the start. As the Bruins were piling one win on top of
another, Hackett lauded Oregon for having the best offense in the
conference and warned that the unbeaten Bruins were in for a bear
of a battle against Miami hours after Miami had been pummeled by
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered little that he turned out to be right about the
Hurricanes, who upended the Bruins' national-title hopes last
December. Hackett came off sounding petty, not unlike the neighbor
who disparages the guy's garden down the street after the guy's
roses have been named best on the block.
</P>
<P>
   We'll say this for Hackett: He seems to be learning from his
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, he roundly praised Toledo and his staff for
finding a way to win a tough game last week against Washington with
a back-up quarterback (a fourth-stringer, actually), ``something I
didn't do a good job of (after starting quarterback Carson Palmer
was lost for the season with a collarbone injury against Oregon in
Week 3). That's the criticism I have of me,'' Hackett said,
liberally applying salt to his open wound.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stanford loss in week seven, Hackett lashed out at
this reporter for pointing out the public perception was he wasn't
taking much responsibility for his team's sloppy play. Since then,
Hackett has blamed himself for everything but the white lines on
the Coliseum turf being drawn crooked.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the image makeover already is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing a (positive) public image is important to me,''
Hackett said. ``Being honest and out-front is a big part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So long as it's done in a glib, gallant way. Dour and defensive
won't get him very far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was telling me about John McKay and how after he
started 11-11 here, it changed his personality,'' Hackett said.
``He became glib, learned to give short answers. It can get too
painful laying yourself out there every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett understood that even before the injuries and losses
started mounting this year. In his first head-coaching stint, at
Pittsburgh, ``I put my feelings out there every week and it
backfired,'' said Hackett, who was fired after three seasons. ``I
got angry very quickly. The point is, I'm not going to let myself
get angry in my second year of developing this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley faces didn't go out of vogue with the 1970s. David
Gibson, a senior safety at USC, can see that, having watched the
way people react to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see his stony face and they don't know exactly what's
going on in his head,'' Gibson said. ``So they invent Paul Hackett
(in their own minds).'' All the more reason for Hackett to follow
Bradley's lead and subtly reinvent himself.

MORE AUCTION RECORDS IN CONTEMPORARY ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Greece)  (See also ART-AUCTION)

 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices soared at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art
Wednesday night, when works by blue-chip artists like Marcel
Duchamp and Mark Rothko, Alexander Calder and Sam Francis sold for
more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $56.2 million, $10 million more than its high
estimate. Of the 68 works offered, 63 found buyers. Nine records
were set.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's runaway success felt far more solid than Christie's
smaller sale of contemporary art on Tuesday night. Sotheby's
defines contemporary art as dating from 1945 to the present, so its
offerings were a classic mixture of artists. Christie's puts art
from 1945 to 1970 in its 20th-century sale; its contemporary-art
auction on Tuesday night featured artists working in the last 30
years. Christie's sale, which brought $13.2 million, was an almost
frightening feeding frenzy that set records for 18 artists,
including Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sotheby's sale had a little more quality,'' said Francis
Bowes, a San Francisco collector. ``There sure is a lot of money
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Work after work brought flurries of bidding, but most of the
biggest spenders were bidding by telephone. A majority of the works
came from some of America's most distinguished collectors, among
them S.I. Newhouse Jr., David Whitney, Barbara and Richard Lane,
Harry and Linda Macklowe, and Donald Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Four bidders were desperate to buy a 1952 Rothko, ``No. 15,'' in
bright yellow and red. Estimated at $4 million to $6 million, it
finally sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for $11 million after
a bloody battle. It became the star of the evening and set a record
for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Another bidding war ensued over a 1959 Cy Twombly, ``Untitled,''
one of the artist's abstract works with cloudlike forms and sweeps
of red. In the end, it was down to Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan
dealer, against a telephone bidder. The painting finally sold for
$4 million, almost twice its high estimate of $2.2 million, to the
telephone bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Some works were considered so rare and special that no one
flinched when they sailed right past their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was ``Brazilian Fish,'' a 1947 hanging fish mobile
by Alexander Calder. One of about a dozen he produced in the 1940s
and '50s, it is made of sheet metal, painted wire, wire rods,
broken pottery and glass. Five bidders went crazy for it, and it
finally sold to yet another unidentified telephone bidder for $3.9
million, more than three times its high estimate of $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   One bidder who was proud of his purchase was Dimitri
Daskalopolos, an Athens-based collector. He bought Duchamp's famous
urinal ``Fountain,'' an image that was barred from the 1917 New
York Armory show but prominently displayed on the cover of
Wednesday night's sale's catalog. Sotheby's was selling the fifth
in an edition of eight fabricated under Duchamp's supervision in
1964. Estimated at $1 million to $1.5 million, it sold to
Daskalopolos for $1.7 million. After the sale, he told Sotheby's
officials he had bought it because ``for me, it represents the
origins of contemporary art.''
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some prices were so high that they surprised even Sotheby's
experts. When Roy Lichtenstein's ``Still Life With Sculpture,'' a
1974 painting being sold by Newhouse, came on the block, two
bidders refused to give up. The painting eventually sold to Lucy
Mitchell-Innes, a dealer who formerly headed Sotheby's contemporary
art department worldwide, for $2.7 million, nearly four times its
high estimate of $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse was also selling a Brice Marden ink-and-gouache drawing
from the artist's famous ``Cold Mountain'' series. The work, a mass
of black and white spiral shapes, was estimated at $150,000 to
$200,000. Seven bidders tried to buy it before it ended up selling
to a telephone bidder for $629,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flag,'' a 1959 Jasper Johns drawing on notebook paper being
sold by Peter Brant, the newsprint manufacturer and collector, was
estimated at $800,000 to $1.2 million. Several people had fallen in
love with the work, which went to Simon de Pury, the Geneva dealer,
for $1.7 million, a record for a work on paper by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Another record was set Wednesday night for Sam Francis. His
``Toward Disappearance 1,'' a 1958 abstract painting with strong
blues throughout the canvas, was estimated at $1.5 million to $2
million but sold for $3.4 million to Andrew Fabrikant, who runs the
Richard Gray Gallery in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lucian Freud's ``Evening in the Studio'' (1993), estimated at
$2.5 million to $3.5 million, sold to an unidentified bidder for
$2.4 million. A triple portrait, it shows Nicola Bateman, the
former wife of Leigh Bowery, Freud's model, sitting in a chair,
working on a rich piece of embroidery, while a naked woman lies
asleep on the floor on the bottom half of the painting and the
artist's dog sleeps on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Warhol's work has been commanding high prices this season,
and Wednesday night was no exception. Warhol's ``Liz,'' a 1963
portrait of Elizabeth Taylor estimated at $1.5 million to $2
million, went to a telephone bidder for $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was very focused, rational bidding tonight,'' said the
auctioneer, Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department worldwide. ``It was a high-quality sale with
high-quality results.'' &QL;
