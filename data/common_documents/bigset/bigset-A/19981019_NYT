 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ After a loss, football players invariably wantto credit
the winners, since doing otherwise would indicate poor
sportsmanship. But they also feel the need to accept accountability
for their own failure.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys struggled with this dilemma after losing
13-12 Sunday to the Chicago Bears, who had lost five of their first
six games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough game to swallow, because in my mind we're a
better ballclub than the Chicago Bears,'' Cowboys running back
Emmitt Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders was more blunt about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play pretty good football when we play a good team,''
Sanders said. ``I think we play to the level of our opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they have yet to play well against a good team. The
only teams they have faced that have winning records _ Denver and
Oakland _ beat the Cowboys, who are 4-3 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders made his point. The Bears aren't very good, and yet
even they could beat the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming even more blunt, Sanders said: ``We're a team without a
personality, and I know that quote will go places. We need to find
ourselves. We need to play Dallas Cowboys football, and right now
we don't know what that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they're a team searching for identity. A new head coach
and a backup quarterback forced into a starting role make that
difficult at times. Neither the coach, Chan Gailey, nor the sub QB,
Jason Garrett, had a stellar performance Sunday afternoon at
chilly, windy Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, in his final start before Troy Aikman returns with his
broken collarbone healed, fumbled a couple of snaps from center and
gained only 136 yards on 26 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was curiously unwilling to commit himself to Smith's
power running. Smith carried just 16 times for 78 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And with Dallas leading 12-7 in the final minute of the third
quarter, Gailey gambled on a two-point conversion that failed. The
PAT he didn't get proved the difference in the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he never thought it would come to that. The Cowboys
kept waiting for the Bears to self-destruct, as they usually do.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an eight-turnover game last week, the Bears continued
their seasonal pattern. In the first quarter, they fumbled for the
16th time, as Cowboys safety Omar Stoutmire jarred the ball loose
from Edgar Bennett on the Chicago 13-yard line, with Randall
Godfrey recovering for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys failed to enter the end zone, with rookie guard
Flozell Adams penalized for a false start on a third down from the
one. Dallas had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Richie
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Garrett set up another 23-yard Cunningham
field goal with a 34-yard bomb to little-used tight end Eric
Bjornson. That was the only deep pass Garrett completed against a
Chicago secondary that was as bomb-conscious as an airport.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas outgained Chicago in the first half 138 yards to 67 but
led only 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to put them away and get way out in front, and
we didn't do it,'' Cowboys center Clay Shiver lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took a 7-6 lead by driving 84 yards in six plays in the
third quarter. The big gainer was a short pass to Bobby Engram that
turned into a 31-yarder when safety Kenny Wheaton missed a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown came on a 13-yard pass from Erik Kramer to Chris
Penn, who was sandwiched at the goal line between Stoutmire and
Kevin Smith. In fact, Smith, who is having one of those seasons
where everything goes wrong, almost intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the ball; we both had the ball,'' Smith said. ``I just
couldn't pull it away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   A tie goes to the receiver, so the Bears were able to put up
their first third-quarter points since November of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think finally scoring in the third quarter was the turning
point,'' Kramer said. ``That got us over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   But that lead was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   After an interception by linebacker Dexter Coakley, the Cowboys
drove 50 yards in seven plays, the last a one-yard reception by
tight end David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey then made his fateful decision on the two-point
conversion. Garrett missed his pass, so Dallas had to settle for a
12-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears came back with a 67-yard drive in which they
effectively mixed passes and runs. Jeff Jaeger kicked a 22-yard
field goal to close the gap to 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Kramer (18-for-30, 233 yards) exploited
holes in the Dallas secondary, working over the middle for two
passes for 41 yards to tight end Alonzo Mayes.
</P>
<P>
   In giving the embattled Kevin Smith help with strong safety
Darren Woodson, the Cowboys left the rookie tight end open in a
mismatch against linebackers Fred Strickland and Godfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayes made some big catches, and that was the difference in
the game,'' Godfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears drove for a 29-yard field goal by Jaeger with 15
seconds left, and that was the game.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey refused to second-guess himself for passing up the PAT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the third quarter, you might not do it,'' he said.
``But late in the game, that's the decision you make.''
</P>
<P>
   He was figuring the Bears would not get more than one more
chance to put points on the board. But he was underestimating the
other team. Or overestimating his own.

An outstanding year for Comets guard Cynthia Cooper will be capped
off tonight when the two-time WNBA Most Valuable Player is named
Sportswoman of the Year by the Women's Sports Foundation in New
York.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cooper will win the award in the category of team athlete;
sprinter Marion Jones is expected to win in the individual
category.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Sportswoman of the Year banquet and ceremonies at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel cap a year during which Cooper led the Comets
to a second WNBA championship and second consecutive regular-season
and championship MVP trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just taking it one day at a time, one event at a time, one
practice at a time, one game at a time,'' Cooper, 35, said from New
York on Sunday. ``The Lord has placed me in an extraordinary
position and given me an extraordinary talent and opportunity. It's
up to me to take advantage of it and obviously not let it get out
of hand where I think I'm God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to confront everything in a very humble way and
take advantage of a situation that I'm in and that women's
athletics is in right now. That's what I'm trying to do right now.
I'm just trying to savor every moment, enjoy every single moment
that's happening to me right now. Because I know that tomorrow is
promised to no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former standout basketball player at North Carolina,
bypassed her senior year of eligibility to concentrate on a career
in track and field. She ran the fastest times this year in the 100
and 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper over the past two years has helped elevate women's
basketball to unprecedented heights with her play in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Cooper was the centerpiece of a Comets team
that won a record 15 games in a row and finished 25-3. Along the
way, Cooper became the first player to reach 1,000 WNBA career
points. She holds the WNBA record for most points in a game (44)
and for the second straight year was the league's leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of the Southern Cal team that featured future
Hall of Famer Cheryl Miller and became the first to win
back-to-back NCAA championships. In 1988, Cooper was part of the
U.S. women's basketball team that claimed a gold medal at the
Olympics. She spent 11 years playing in Europe before coming home
to compete in the WNBA.

HOW TO RETAIN WORKERS WITHOUT RAISING THEIR PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:   My girlfriend has worked for the same company for a decade and
now is the senior manager of several of its downtown retail stores.
The problem is that the owner pays very low wages and my girlfriend
has a hard time hiring quality individuals because she cannot
compete with the competition's wages. When she does hire someone,
they usually move on to greener pastures pretty soon, and she has
to start all over again. The owner doesn't listen when she tries to
point out this and other problems. Other than leaving the company,
what can she do?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Your girlfriend's hands may be tied when it comes to doling
out raises, but there are other tactics that companies can use to
retain good employees.
</P>
<P>
   People stay at jobs where they feel appreciated. They stay at
jobs where they learn new skills. They stay at jobs where they see
a future _ where they can move up a ladder to positions with
greater pay and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sherwood, human resources director at the Stanford
University Bookstore, also suggests some inexpensive incentives to
help keep good employees on board:
</P>
<P>
   _ Extra time off as an occasional reward for super employees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Service awards such as key chains or store gift certificates
for workers who have been with the company for a certain amount of
time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quarterly lunches with the president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Handwritten thank-you notes from top management on the
anniversary of each employee's hire.
</P>
<P>
   _ Certificates of excellence for top performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certificates don't cost anything but paper and time, and they
make people feel good,'' Sherwood said.
</P>
<P>
   But frankly, if your girlfriend's firm is really under-paying
its workers, even her best efforts to make people feel appreciated
won't keep them around.
</P>
<P>
   Your description of her situation makes me suspect that it's
time for her to move on, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, the sales clerks aren't the only ones being
underpaid _ your girlfriend also may be getting less than she's
worth. And 10 years is a long time to be working for someone who
doesn't seem to take her suggestions and ideas seriously.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I currently work a 30-hour, four-day week at an
insurance company that is merging with another firm. The company is
offering severance packages to people whose jobs are cut or who
decline to take a new position that involves a ``significant
change'' in work schedule, workdays or location. My manager has
said I will have to switch to a five-day, 40-hour schedule but that
this isn't considered a ``significant change.'' So if I decline
this new job, I won't be eligible for severance. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Yes, it's almost certainly legal. Companies are under no
legal obligation to provide severance pay to most workers. So any
severance program they offer is discretionary _ meaning that
companies can set the rules any way they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really don't have to offer a severance package at all, so
they can &LR;   &LR; make the decision about what is a `significant change'
and what isn't a `significant change,' '' said Barbara Lawless, an
employment lawyer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of scenarios where you might have a legal
case, Lawless said. One would be if the company were offering
severance packages on a discriminatory basis _ for instance, if all
men were being given severance pay and all women were being denied
severance.
</P>
<P>
   Another would be if your old 30-hour schedule were an attempt to
accommodate a disability _ if your doctor had said you could only
work four days a week. In that case, you could argue that the
company still has a legal obligation under the Americans with
Disabilities Act to give you a reduced schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But neither seems to be the case here. So if you can't persuade
the company to maintain your 30-hour schedule, you've got a tough
choice _ take the new 40-hour job or look for work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I'm pregnant, and my baby is due next June. A friend told
me that I can get maternity leave payments from the state. Is this
true? And am I still eligible if I stop working before the due
date?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  California doesn't offer maternity leave payments. What it
does offer is a short-term disability insurance program that covers
the medical effects of pregnancy and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   State Disability Insurance is available to workers who are
disabled from performing their regular jobs for at least eight
days. It pays $50 to $336 per week, based on a percentage of your
normal salary, and is available for up to 52 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   How many weeks of SDI could you receive for pregnancy and
childbirth? It depends on your specific health condition, and how
long your doctor says you must stay away from work. For information
on SDI, contact your local office of the state Employment
Development Department or visit its Web site at
wwwedd.cahwnet.gov/fleclaim.htm. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Also note that there are several other state laws aimed at
helping pregnant workers by giving them unpaid time off.
</P>
<P>
   The California Pregnancy Disability Leave act gives most
expectant moms up to four months of unpaid leave for
pregnancy-related disabilities. And the California Family Rights
Act gives new dads and moms the right to 12 weeks of unpaid leave
for bonding with their new baby.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have questions on how these state-leave laws or the
federal Family &AMP; Medical Leave Act apply to you? Equal Rights
Advocates, a San Francisco nonprofit group, offers a free telephone
advice line in Spanish and English at (800) 839-4372.
</P>

San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or

COUPLE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST BULLIES IN THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anita Hill turned sexual harassment into a front-burner issue in
workplaces across America.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Ruth Namie want to do the same thing for harassment
that has nothing to do with sex or gender.
</P>
<P>
   The Namies, a husband-and-wife team of psychologists in Benicia,
are trying to ignite a national campaign against what they call
``workplace bullying'' _ hurtful and repeated mistreatment of
people by their bosses, co-workers or even subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workplace bullying damages people's self-esteem, just like
schoolyard bullying,'' said Gary Namie. ``But schoolyard bullying
doesn't impact your whole family, your livelihood, the course of
your career. The consequences are much more severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics deny that bullying is a widespread problem at work and
question how far companies should go in trying to police the
interactions of their staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even define sexual harassment: How are we going to
define what a bully is?'' asked Michael Lotito, a lawyer who
represents employers with Jackson Lewis in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But the Namies, who run a counseling and consulting business
called the Work Doctor, seem to be hitting a nerve with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Their Web site logs 40,000 hits a month. They've counseled more
than 2,000 people by phone, e-mail or in person since opening their
doors two years ago. They even got a call recently about appearing
on that barometer of the American zeitgeist _ ``The Oprah Winfrey
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a small but growing cadre of academic researchers
who are studying workplace bullying and how it affects both
employee well-being and corporate productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to define this as a social problem _ not merely
a case of two &LR;   &LR; people who can't get along,'' said Loraleigh
Keashly, an organizational psychologist at Wayne State University
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   What does workplace bullying look like?
</P>
<P>
   One Bay Area grocery worker who asked to remain anonymous
contacted the Namies because of a supervisor who constantly told
her she was a ``nothing'' and said things like, ``I could do your
job in two hours, but it takes you eight hours.''
</P>
<P>
   And Helen King, a federal employee from Orinda, turned to the
Namies because of a boss who she says constantly interrupted her,
berated her in public, set her up to fail, and once even threatened
to bring his gun to work and ``use it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd start work at 6:15 a.m., and by 7, I'd be in tears,'' said
King.
</P>
<P>
   Bullying can be a pattern of condescending remarks, arbitrary
rages or efforts to sabotage someone's work. It can include
physical acts _ slammed doors, raised fists _ but is more often
verbal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike sexual harassment or racial discrimination, bullying is
typically legal. The victim may have trouble convincing superiors
or co-workers that anything unusual is going on. But
psychologically, experts claim, it can still be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started sleeping less and less because of stress,''
recounted King, who ultimately changed jobs to get away from her
boss. ``I'd go to sleep and then after 45 minutes I'd be up _ bam!
_ wide awake and worried. I started getting asthma attacks and
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to believe that someone at work can make you
feel this bad,'' King said. ``So when I found Ruth and Gary, I was
so relieved. I said to myself, `My goodness, I'm not alone! I'm not
making this up!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``workplace bullying'' actually comes from Europe,
where psychologists and labor unions have sounded an alarm about
abusive managers for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, researchers use a variety of terms such as
``emotional abuse in the workplace'' or ``workplace aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no data available to show whether bullying is on the
rise or the decline. There are only a few limited studies on how
many people face workplace abuse _ but these studies indicate that
it's pretty common.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Hornstein, a psychology professor at Columbia University,
surveyed 1,000 people and found that nine out of 10 had at some
point worked for a ``brutal boss'' _ someone who did things like
humiliate them in public or blame them for his or her own failures.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, Hornstein said, about one in five Americans
have such a boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's suppose that one-in-five is a great exaggeration and
there are just a lot of whiny people out there,'' Hornstein said.
``Even if it's really just one in 20 or 30 who have a brutal boss,
we're still talking about several million people dealing with this
every day. It's an enormous problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers like Hornstein are careful to distinguish legitimate
work criticism from bullying, and tough-but-fair bosses from
bullying bosses.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest that workplace bullying can hurt companies as well
as individual employees.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Pearson, a management professor at the University of
North Carolina, surveyed 775 people who said they had been treated
rudely or disrespectfully at work. Her findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ 53 percent lost work time worrying about the incident or
future interactions.
</P>
<P>
   _ 28 percent lost work time avoiding the instigator.
</P>
<P>
   _ 10 percent decreased the amount of time they spent at work.
</P>
<P>
   _ 12 percent actually changed jobs to avoid the instigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication for corporate costs is a pretty powerful
one,'' Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Neuman, a management professor who studies workplace
aggression, said he found that bullying behavior is more commonly
directed at co-workers than at subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research has found that most aggression is between peers,
or people who work side by side _ not hierarchically,'' said
Neuman, at the State University of New York at New Paltz. ``Males
are a little more likely to be physically aggressive at work, while
women tend to be verbally aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Namies got involved in the issue of workplace bullying
through their own experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Namie was hired as a psychologist at a Bay Area health
clinic by a boss who, after a one-month honeymoon period, began
accusing her of doing everything wrong. Although Namie was an
experienced professional in her 40s, she gradually began to doubt
her own competency. The worst moment came when the boss screamed at
her in a hallway filled with co-workers and clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was female, and I was female; she was white, and I was
white,'' Ruth Namie recalled. ``So it wasn't discrimination or
sexual harassment. It was just horrific behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Namie found articles about bullying from England on the
Internet. The two decided to share the information with others and
launched their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people out there who are hurting, and who
need to know they didn't do anything wrong to bring this upon
themselves,'' Ruth Namie said.
</P>
<P>
   Today Ruth Namie does psychological counseling for people in
abusive work situations _ the ``Kleenex calls,'' as the couple
calls them. Gary Namie conducts strategy sessions with bullying
victims and their spouses, helping them come up with ways to defuse
the abusive behavior and keep their careers going.
</P>
<P>
   The couple lead anti-bullying workshops for groups of employees.
They're trying to forge ties with labor unions, with an eye toward
a national anti-bullying conference in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Namies also hope to be hired by employers who want to draft
anti-bullying policies _ but that may be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies see a pressing need for a new layer of personnel
policies aimed at bullying.
</P>
<P>
   And some management experts say that the tight labor market is
already forcing companies to treat workers better than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Silicon Valley, with the kind of unemployment figures we
have, you'd have to be nuts to be abusive to your employees,'' said
Lynn Hermle, a lawyer who represents employers with Orrick
Herrington &AMP; Sutcliffe in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already doing more training now in managerial skills
than ever before,'' said Jeffrey Tannenbaum, a management-side
lawyer with Littler Mendelson in San Francisco. ``If anything, I'd
say that abuses are decreasing. The workplace is probably nicer
than ever before.''

BATTING NINTH, A NEWLY MINTED HERO 
</HEADLINE>

 By JACK CURRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ricky Ledee was tired Sunday after half a day of
feeling more like a telephone operator than the left fielder for
the New York Yankees. From the time he wandered into his hotel room
in Manhattan at 3 a.m. until the moment he left for Yankee Stadium
near 3 p.m., Ledee said his phone rang 30 times. His bleary brown
eyes and droopy shoulders were evidence of his weariness.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee's mother called and cried. His girlfriend called and was
ready to weep. His brother called and congratulated him. His agent
called and did the same. His friends from Salinas, P.R., called and
told him they were ``going nuts'' watching his exploits in the
World Series. While Ledee appreciated the messages, he finally
stopped answering the phone and closed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so tired, I had to get some sleep,'' he said. ``I'm
still tired. But everyone is so happy for me. They were happy for
me even getting to the World Series. They called me because they
didn't really understand I had to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest will wait. How many more calls should Ledee expect after
rapping two more hits as the Yankees pummeled the Padres, 9-3, in
Game 2 on Sunday night? Ledee was operating with four or five hours
of sleep, but he studied videotape of Andy Ashby and then singled
to start a three-run splurge in the second inning and roped a
two-out double to drive in a run in the third. Ledee reached base
in his first seven plate appearances in the Series on four hits,
two walks and an outfield error before lining out to right in his
eighth trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose, this means nothing,'' Ledee said. ``This is about
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he vowed before Sunday night's game that he must
look ahead, he allowed himself to take a peek back to Game 1. He
clubbed a two-run double off Kevin Brown to stake the Yankees to a
2-0 lead in a game they won by 9-6. The double was not the most
important hit of the opener, but it made a giddy 24-year-old rookie
feel as if he really belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on second, I felt like screaming and just letting
it all out,'' said Ledee, who is 4 for 6 with three runs batted in
the Series. ``All the years, all the ups and downs, all the long
seasons, all the time I spent in the minors, it was finally all
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years in the minors, after a bunch of trade rumors
and after wondering if he would ever be the major leaguer that
Tonito, his father, had wanted him to be before dying in a car
accident in May 1986, Ledee made it to the Yankees for 79 at-bats
this year. Then he made it in a splashier way on Saturday night and
continued cruising on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Ledee, Ricky's mother, could barely utter two straight
words on Sunday because she was emotional about what he had
accomplished in baseball's marquee event. Ricky said his mother
frequently talks about Tonito, who was only 35 when he died, and
how proud he would be. But Ledee said that he cannot dwell on his
father's memory, especially in a delicate period like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really think about him like I used to,'' said Ledee.
``This year, things were tough with my mother losing her job and
with my baby being born. It's good to remember my father, but I
can't bring him back.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a draining season for Ledee. Theresa Kokinakos, his
girlfriend of three years, gave birth to a son, Ricardo Jr., in
Baltimore on Jan. 12 and Ledee did not see the baby until more than
a month later because he was playing winter baseball in Puerto
Rico. Ledee's decision to remain with the San Juan Senators and not
visit his son was dicey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this to make things better for us,'' Ledee said at
the time. ``I hope she understands.''
</P>
<P>
   She did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I had a baby and, of course, I want him here, but it
wouldn't be fair to put that pressure on him,'' Kokinakos said in
January.
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, Omar Ledee, Ricky's 17-year-old brother,
had a poor reaction to anesthesia, had his lungs fill with fluid
and fell into a coma. Ledee, frightened, left Tampa, Fla., for
Salinas without even telling anyone from the Yankees. But Omar
emerged from the coma after four days and grew stronger. Ricky
smiled as he said his brother was now healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long year for me and my family,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the long year has a chance to finish stylishly for Ledee.
``This is something that nobody can take away,'' he said.

 &HT;    Yanks roll 9-3, take control
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees moved one game closer Sunday
night to placing themselves among the greatest teams of all time.
They are two wins from a World Series title, and if Game 2 is any
indication this one may be over quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie starter Orlando Hernandez, staked to an early seven-run
lead, shut down the San Diego Padres and the Yankees had 16 hits in
a 9-3 win before 56,692 that might have seen their last game at
Yankee Stadium this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lead the series 2-0 and the Padres, since a
seventh-inning bullpen collapse in the opener Saturday night, in no
way resemble the club that ran roughshod over the Astros and
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   This game was over before the first inning ended, the Yankees
tearing into starter Andy Ashby for three runs, adding three more
in the second and forcing the right-hander out by the third.
</P>
<P>
   And Hernandez, getting a huge catch in the first from right
fielder Paul O'Neill to save two runs, just relaxed and threw
strikes. He made it through seven innings, limiting San Diego to
one run on six hits. Like his brother Livan last season for the
Marlins, ``El Duque'' is making a major impact in October.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Padres stop the bleeding? They hope a return home to
play in front of their fanatical fans will help. Left-hander
Sterling Hitchcock, the MVP in the National League Championship
Series, will face Yankees right-hander David Cone in Game 3
Tuesday. The Padres can take heart in the fact that in the 1996
World Series, the Yankees dropped their first two to the Braves but
came back and won four straight.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is this Yankee team is awfully good and
for the first time this postseason the lineup is producing from top
to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Their big bats Sunday were center fielder Bernie Williams, left
fielder Ricky Ledee and catcher Jorge Posda. Williams and Posada
hit home runs and the rookie Ledee is now 4-for-6 in the series and
has reached base on seven of eight plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Yankees are making the big plays, such as the
one O'Neill made in the first with Tony Gwynn at second and Greg
Vaughn at first. Wally Joyner lifted a Hernandez fastball deep into
right field. It appeared the ball would hit the top of the wall,
but O'Neill brought it down, crashing into the wall but remaining
on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was all pinstripes.
</P>

WEB ADVERTISERS GET NEW TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL EMERT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
A top consumer research firm is launching a service today designed
to give Web advertisers highly detailed, statistically significant
data about who is seeing their ads.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thus a bottled water company advertising on the Web will be able
to figure out how many of the ads it sent into cyberspace were
viewed by its target audience _ for example, women aged 35 to 44
who drink bottled water and live west of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The service, Millward Brown Interactive's Voyager Profile,
recruited 50,000 consumers who filled out a lengthy questionnaire
on the Web detailing their demographic information and consumption
habits.
</P>
<P>
   These volunteers received an electronic identification tag that
identifies them as Voyager panelists. When they visit a Web page,
ad servers _ companies that broadcast ads to various Web sites _
recognize them as Voyager panelists and keep track of which ads
they've seen.
</P>
<P>
   That information is sent back to Millward Brown, which can tell
the advertiser the demographic profile of all the panelists who've
seen their ads.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The servers are not privy to the personal information
disclosed by the panelists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something Internet advertisers have been crying out
for,'' said Michael Tann, a vice president with AdForce of
Cupertino. ``This fundamentally brings the same kind of credible
market research that's used in the established media into the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mracek, vice president of marketing for AdKnowledge, an ad
server in New York, said he sees the service as an adjunct to
ratings services such as New York's Media Metrix, which uses a
panel of 40,000 computer users to project the demographics of
visitors to different sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Media Metrix tracks visitors to sites, but they don't know
which ads every visitor sees because people visiting the same site
at the same time may see different ads.
</P>
<P>
   Voyager is designed to make up for that anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Once an ad campaign runs, planners can use Voyager to fine tune
the mix of sites where they buy ads.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if 60 percent of the people who viewed the campaign
are women and the advertiser was trying to reach 75 percent women,
planners will know to buy more ad space on female-oriented sites
the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   Millward Brown will charge advertisers $1,500 to $2,000 per
report.
</P>
<P>
   One other service, NetRatings of Milpitas, is attempting to
measure ad audiences. But that company, which also provides site
ratings a la Media Metrix, uses a panel of only 3,500 consumers,
which is not big enough to provide statistically valid data about
many Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Meadows, vice president of marketing for NetRatings, noted
that Voyager reports are largely limited to ads that have been
distributed by ad servers that are working with Millward Brown,
including AdKnowledge, AdForce and industry leader DoubleClick,
which serves about 30 percent of Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Briggs, a Millward Brown Interactive vice president, said
the sample of panelists is large enough to provide statistically
significant data on the vast majority of Web ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The panel represents about 1.5 percent of the total Web
population of 61 million, which is a larger percentage than most
samples used by ratings services in other media, Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Voyager panelists are recruited by random telephone calls and
don't receive anything except the chance to win free prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Millward Brown is based in Chicago; its interactive division is
based in San Francisco.

EAGLES' RHODES KEEPS GOING AND GOING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ He wasn't intercepted in the end zone to end the
third quarter, he didn't fumble away another scoring opportunity
late in the fourth quarter of a game his team would lose by a
margin thinner than his patience. Ray Rhodes is not to blame for
the Philadelphia Eagles' 13-10 loss to the Chargers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But because he is the one calling the shots, he'll continue
taking the bullets for his band of bumblers and he'll soldier on.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' job is probably safe for now, if only because there's no
obvious stand-in waiting in the wings. Who's going to take over,
offensive coordinator Dana Bible? He wasn't even calling the plays
Sunday; Rhodes entrusted that responsibility to ex-quarterback Bill
Musgrave, who was hired as an assistant coach in the second week of
the season after failing to stick as a player at the Indianapolis
Colts' training camp.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing wrong with Musgrave's play-calling that a
little execution couldn't have cured. Five times the Eagles
penetrated the Chargers' 35-yard line. And what happened? There was
a missed field goal, a made field goal, a Rodney Peete pass
intercepted in the end zone from the San Diego 4, a 12-yard scoring
run by Charlie Garner and a fumble on the San Diego 30 by receiver
Russell Copeland on the Eagles' final possession.
</P>
<P>
   Peete's second intercepted pass proved the more costly of his
miscues as it came midway through the final quarter when the Eagles
seemed to be gaining momentum. After Garner's score, the Eagles
defense held the Chargers to three plays and Philadelphia got the
ball back on its own 38. On the very next play, Peete's pass was
tipped at the line of scrimmage into the hands of Norman Hand.
Shortly thereafter John Carney kicked a 26-yard field goal for the
decisive points.
</P>
<P>
   That stung, as did the 10 penalties the Eagles accrued,
including an illegal-procedure call in the fourth quarter that
wiped out what would have been the Eagles' first touchdown
reception of the season by a wide receiver (in this case, Freddie
Solomon).
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute worth a crap,'' Rhodes said afterward, his
bloodshot eyes drifting downward. ``We did just enough things to
screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have grown accustomed to having their wings clipped
like a $5 haircut, especially on the road. They haven't won a game
outside the caustic confines of Veterans Stadium since Dec.14,
1996, their winless road streak now a bitter baker's dozen
(0-12-1). In Rhodes' three-plus seasons at the helm, Philadelphia
is 19-9 at home and 9-20-1 everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all daggers and darkness Sunday. Defensive end Hugh
Douglas ran around and over the Chargers' left tackle John Jackson
on his way to a career-high four-and-a-half sacks and linebacker
William Thomas made five unassisted tackles.
</P>
<P>
   But all the sparkling individual efforts were dimmed by the same
old end result. After losing six of their first seven games, the
Eagles won't even be able to enjoy their bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I get away from football now?'' Rhodes replied when it
was suggested the week off might do him and the team some good.
``How can I feel pretty decent about myself after we got our
(butts) kicked?''
</P>
<P>
   It has been weeks since Rhodes got a decent night's sleep. There
surely were people in the Qualcomm Stadium crowd of 56,967 who
caught more winks in the opening 30 minutes, which seemed to
stretch forever and ended 3-3, than Rhodes has had in three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as (the losing) eating at me, it's already driven me
beyond that,'' Rhodes said. Later, he would add wearily, ``This is
the profession I've chosen. I'm still a competitive person. So I'm
going to hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the game, Copeland was hanging his head in the
visitors' locker room. He looked as though he wanted to disappear
into the wood paneling of his assigned cubicle. Copeland had a
game-high six catches, but the only thing he could think about was
the last one that wound up in Junior Seau's hands, sealing the
Eagles' fate.
</P>
<P>
   Accentuating Copeland's pain was the fact he had tried to forge
ahead for an extra few yards on the fateful play expressly because
he had wanted so badly to rescue Rhodes from the wolves' door.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing he wanted to do was nail him down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fumbled at a crucial time and he's the one that's going to
take the blame for it,'' Copeland said. ``Ray's going to take the
blame for this game because he's our leader, but it's not his
fault. Hopefully, people will see that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Copeland said next is self-evident to anyone who has seen
Rhodes around his athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a father figure to me and a lot of the players on
this team,'' Copeland said. ``It's just a shame we're not winning
for him. It hurts us doubly.'' &UR; !dlim!!end!

SPORTS COLUMN: A FEELING OF DESTINY PERVADES THE SERIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes, these stories just seem preordained, and
it is up to someone _ Kirk Gibson comes to mind _ to step up and
dramatically alter destiny's plans. But no one has limped
heroically to the plate in the 1998 World Series for the San Diego
Padres, the way Gibson did for the Dodgers against Oakland a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one has fought off the flu bug or the assembly line of Yankee
bats on the mound. The Padres seem caught in the viselike grip of
inevitability, looking on Sunday night like the dot under the
exclamation point to a record Yankees season.
</P>
<P>
   After a rookie, Ricky Ledee, demythologized Kevin Brown in Game
1, the entire Yankees' lineup dismissed Andy Ashby, the Padres'
Game 2 starter, as an unsubstantiated rumor. Most of the familiar
Yankee subplots unfolded during Sunday night's blowout,
characterizing this series as more coronation than competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres came to Yankee Stadium and paid their proper
respects. Really, they did. Tony Gwynn said all the right things
after his first visit to Monument Park. Greg Vaughn didn't thumb
his nose at George Steinbrenner's baseball people and ask how many
Yankees hit 50 home runs this season. Jim Leyritz stepped right
back into place with his former teammates by scrawling Darryl
Strawberry's No. 39 onto his cap.
</P>
<P>
   These courteous men brought the low humidity from their weather
paradise in southern California, apparently figuring the best way
to compete with the Yankees was to create a climate of mutual
respect. Don't rock the team of destiny, just poke some holes and
see if it starts losing air. Then the Yankees deflated the Padres'
middle relief pitching late Saturday night, and all of New York
resumed making plans for a parade it knows will make Sammy Sosa's
look like a pack of Waveland Avenue kids chasing one of his
souvenir home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the narrow Stadium corridors on Sunday evening, you could
eavesdrop on the security guys saying everything but goodbye and
have a nice winter. By the third inning, the fans acted as if the
next Yankee event in New York would be along Broadway. In Joe
Torre's pre-game news conference, he offered warm gratitude for the
ticket-buyers, nearly 3 million strong this season, as he said:
``They have been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   What was it that Yogi Berra once said about the late-afternoon
October outfield shadows in the south Bronx? ``It gets late early
out here,'' is the quote, according to the Yogi legend, and that is
the predicament the Padres find themselves in now. They failed in
two tries to slow the Yankee steamroller early, and it appears they
are about to get rolled.
</P>
<P>
   Too many of those uplifting Yankee story lines _ beginning with
the unaffected Orlando Hernandez, front and center _ are running
parallel in the direction of the desired punctuation of this famous
franchise's most decorated season. There was the obsession to not
waste those 114 regular-season victories, the aching in their
hearts to win it for the ailing Strawberry, and the news that Joe
DiMaggio was rooting from his own hospital sickbed, as was Andy
Pettitte's father.
</P>
<P>
   In the year of major league baseball's reemergence, the year
that one man hit 70 home runs and another hit 66, who ever could
imagine the Padres as the last team standing? Only Bruce Bochy,
their manager, whose job on Sunday night was to look at his players
and tell them they did not have to accept what fate surely seems to
have in store for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen this club rebound too many times and I think it is
a very resilient club,'' he said. ``I just think they will be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Before one inning was complete, a series of plays screamed
otherwise. With two on and two out, Wally Joyner ripped a ball deep
to right, up against the fence _ Jeffrey Maier country _ on which
Paul O'Neill made a leaping grab. In the bottom of the inning, the
Game 1 story lines _ redemption for Chuck Knoblauch and Tino
Martinez _ carried over. Both reached base as the Yankees scored
three times. By the time they were done with Ashby, said to have
caught whatever Brown had the night before, the Yankees had seven
runs on 10 hits in two and two-third innings.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what an explosion of fury Knoblauch might have faced had
home-plate umpire Rich Garcia (of Maier fame two years ago) called
Martinez out on that 2-2, knee-high fastball, right before Martinez
struck the game-winning grand slam Saturday night. In the very next
inning, Knoblauch's error allowed the Padres' sixth run.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was just a footnote to two more victorious
Yankee box scores. The Padres got a bunch of late hits on Sunday
night, but there were no Series-turning moments. Leyritz, the
Yankees' Gibson in Atlanta two years ago, got up once as a
pinch-hitter. He struck out. By the time the fans were filing out
on Sunday night, they believed this was closing act of an amazing
baseball drama, a season in which the Yankees created their own
baseball paradise in the ball park that housed David Wells' perfect
game.
</P>
<P>
   Was it coincidence that the weather was cool and breezy, a San
Diego-like 68 degrees at game time on Sunday night? The Yankees'
dream summer continued, unchallenged, unlikely to return to New
York. If Kirk Gibson is out there, he'd better show soon.

DODGERS BRASS TO CONFER ON MANAGER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Los Angeles Dodgers' general manager Kevin Malone
said Sunday he will talk to Fox executives Peter Chernin and Chase
Carey before choosing a new manager, a decision which is expected
by midweek. Malone said he does not need a second meeting with
either Davey Johnson or Kevin Kennedy, who interviewed here over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Malone will fly back to Los Angeles today and speak with club
president Bob Graziano, who did not attend the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still examining the best fit,'' Malone said. ``Both
interviews went well. Both men are extremely qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone denied reports that he and Johnson, who is considered the
favorite, had a poor relationship in Baltimore, where in 1996-97
Johnson was manager and Malone was assistant GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got along fine,'' Malone said. ``But he did have some
problems with the owner (Peter Angelos).''
</P>
<P>
   A blackout of baseball news prohibits the Dodgers from making an
announcement until after the World Series is finished.

   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez had been in spring training with
the Yankees for only a few days in March when the Florida weather
turned raw and cold, but he continued to wear Bermuda shorts and a
cotton golf shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to get some warmer clothes,'' somebody suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the pitcher known as El Duque said. ``I must adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in those months before he joined the Yankees, this was a
thinking man's pitcher who knew that the weather in the United
States sometimes would not be anywhere near as warm as it was in
Cuba, that he had to learn to acclimate himself to the occasional
chill.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball's October weather, which in other years has been
known to dip into the 40s, if not the 30s, has been kind to El
Duque.
</P>
<P>
   When he rescued the Yankees in Cleveland a week ago Saturday
night, squaring the American League Championship Series at 2-2, the
game-time temperature was a comfortable 57 degrees, balmy for the
Lake Erie shore in October.
</P>
<P>
   And as El Duque dominated the Padres on Sunday night, scattering
six hits through his seven innings in the 9-3 Yankees victory for a
2-0 jump in the Series, the game-time temperature at the Stadium
was a friendly 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if the temperature had been 38 on Sunday night, the
Yankees would have expected El Duque to adjust, just as he has
adjusted so quickly to everything else _ American culture, Yankee
tradition, major league hitters.
</P>
<P>
   From the time El Duque joined the Yankees in early June, Manager
Joe Torre has talked about the calm that the now 29-year-old
right-hander has displayed, no matter what the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   If that calm wasn't in him, El Duque, who had been banned from
Cuba's national team, would not have climbed on a small boat in
February with seven others and a few cans of Spam and drifted
across the Caribbean to Anguila Cay and eventually to the Yankees
and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That calm was there when El Duque was asked whether his Cuban
companions on the boat were his guests at Saturday night's Series
opener. He handled that conversation as if he were pitching,
throwing his fastball from different angles, then busting his
curveball for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they come?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told they came,'' his questioner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who told you that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the broadcasters from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are here,'' he said. ``Now that you told me who told
you, we're even.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he was way ahead.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque didn't appear awed by the World Series. He had seen it
in Cuba on television. When his half-brother, Livan Hernandez,
pitched the Florida Marlins to the World Series title a year ago,
he watched the games in the CNN studios in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if, as a member of Cuba's national team, he
had ever pitched in a game similar to the magnitude of the Series,
his calm was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've pitched in three world championships, one
Olympics, also various other tournaments I don't remember,'' he
said through his interpreter, Leonardo Astacio. ``And in Cuba, I
pitched in many league championships and national titles, I don't
know if you could compare them to the magnitude of the World
Series, but they're pretty big.''
</P>
<P>
   And when El Duque was asked if he ever surprised himself when
pitching, his calm was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really surprise myself on the mound,'' he replied.
``Because if I did it, then there's no reason for me to be
surprised because it's something I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre called it a calm, but Brian Cashman, the Yankee general
manager, called it something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought El Duque into camp, he had a presence about
him even then,'' Cashman said, ``I remember Joe Torre watched him
throw in the outfield and he told me, `This guy is intriguing.'''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque had already intrigued Lin Garrett, the Yankee scouting
director, when put on display for scouts in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lin told me, `You've got to get this guy, he can be our No. 3
starter this year,' '' Cashman recalled. ``Anaheim and Cleveland
also were after him. Anaheim's offer supposedly included a movie
deal. Cleveland was offering good money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's offer was between $2 million and $3 million, but the
Yankees put together a four-year, $6.6 million offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some scouts for other clubs didn't think El Duque had enough
fastball, and they also wondered about his age,'' Cashman said.
``The way we figured it, if he signed with us, he's 28. If he
signed with somebody else, he's got wooden teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever El Duque's age, whatever his teeth, whatever the
weather, it's his calm that the Yankees like best.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ They talk to him about pressure, and Orlando Hernandez
just smiles.
</P>
<P>
   He knows pressure, and it is not the act of pitching a baseball,
no matter the time or the place or the situation, even if it is
Game 2 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Real pressure is waking up the morning after Christmas and going
to the ocean's edge, then climbing aboard a makeshift wooden
contraption with a band of countrymen and pushing off into the
deep, blue unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Loneliness is not standing by yourself on a mound inside one of
the most famous stadiums in all of sports and pitching a game that
will be watched in several hundred nations. It is drifting for days
with nothing but your thoughts and determination to keep you going.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 10 months ago, ``El Duque'' and his seven fellow
castaways from Cuba floated onto a beach in the Bahamas and there
began a raft-to-riches story.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez signed a three-year, $6.6 million contract with the
Yankees. As a 29-year-old rookie in the majors, he put together an
impressive debut season and Sunday night took his herky-jerky
motion and his devilish bag of tricks to center stage and cranked
out an easy 9-3 win over the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the way New York hitters turned Yankee Stadium into
the world's largest singles bar against San Diego starter Andy
Ashby _ 10 hits and seven runs in 2 innings _ winning the game was
nowhere near as impressive as the long route Hernandez took to get
here. The refugee settled into the Yankees tradition of October
success like a lifelong resident of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, the waiters and busboys in the posh
hotels that cater to the tourist crowd were the luckier ones on his
native island nation, because they had access to radio and
television reports that kept them up to date on the 1997 World
Series, when El Duque's half-brother, Livan, was the pitching hero
_ and Most Valuable Player _ for the Florida Marlins in their
victory over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque's background, as Cuba's most celebrated pitcher in more
than two decades, got him the extra privilege of being able to
watch those games live from the CNN studios in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think then that I would be here today,'' Hernandez
said. ``But I did think of finding a way to one day be here.''
</P>
<P>
   After all those years as the ace for the Cuban national team,
who pitched in three world championships, many national
championships and an Olympics, while facing the reality that the
Communist government had a stranglehold on his career and his
hopes, this, finally was his dream.
</P>
<P>
   With his uniform pants hiked up to his knees and the crowd of
56,692 raising his adrenalin level, El Duque baffled and bewildered
the Padres with his curveball that is delivered from an assortment
of twists and turns and odd, unhittable angles.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't as masterful a job as his seven shutout innings in
the Game 4 win over Cleveland in the American League Championship
Series. With Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada launching home runs
and everybody except George Steinbrenner reaching base, it didn't
have to be. El Duque gave up six hits in seven innings, struck out
seven and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   He picks apart the strike zone like a surgeon operating with a
laser. He is so calm, so cool, so sure of himself. He has the poise
and composure you might expect from a man who could hop into a
rickety craft with little food or water and sail blindly toward a
new life in a new world and a new career in the old game.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Duque always shows a terrific calm out there, no matter
what the situation,'' said Yankees manager Joe Torre. ``He has been
that way all year and has always been there when we've needed him.
There are times when you do forget that he's just arrived and this
is all still a strange place to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows few words of English, but one is Hooters, which happens
to be his favorite restaurant, and uses an interpreter for guarded
exchanges with the media. No, he hasn't talked to Livan for any
tips on how to deal with World Series pressure or National League
hitters. No, he is not surprised by anything he has done this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 10 months ago, he was living under a lone lightbulb in a
cinder-block house with a girlfriend, earning less than $9 a month
as a physical therapist in a hospital. The government suspected he
had helped Livan defect to the United States and banned him from
baseball for life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he was out there all alone pitching the Yankees to a 2-0
lead in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure?
</P>
<P>
   El Duque laughed.

HUSKIES FINALLY GETTING HEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The three-game October stretch of outmanned Washington
football opponents, ending Saturday with Oregon State, might not
have done much to titillate Husky fans. But it has served to help
UW players mend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we're going to be about as healthy as we've been
in quite awhile,'' UW coach Jim Lambright said Sunday night as his
4-2 team paced through a light workout at Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Huard, the junior quarterback recovering from a left
shoulder separation, vowed after Saturday's 21-13 victory over Cal
to be ready for Oregon State (4-3). Says Lambright, ``Brock's back
to 90-100 percent, and then we'll just watch and see how his
shoulder responds.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the Husky offensive players injured recently, Huard
was hurt against a physical, high-quality opponent, Arizona.
Fullback Pat Conniff, who might have helped a struggling run game,
injured a knee against Nebraska, and wide receiver Gerald Harris
was sandwiched painfully by two Huskers in the secondary, causing
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   But a non-challenge from Utah State helped the Huskies toward
health last week, and Washington apparently didn't sustain any
injury of consequence against Cal, either. Offensive guard Tony
Coats has a sore foot incurred against the Bears but is expected to
play against the Beavers, as are Harris and Conniff.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should also get back wideout Ja'Warren Hooker, whose
shoulder was hurt against Utah State. Of players injured recently,
only cornerback Jermaine Smith is certain to sit out this week; he
should return for the USC game Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said he would wait until later in the week to make a
determination on Huard's role in the game, as well as that of
Marques Tuiasosopo, who quarterbacked the Huskies to two victories
in Huard's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to wait and see,'' Lambright said. ``This is pushing
it. Last week was pushing it. It was still pushing it from the
original projection.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright did concede that Tuiasosopo, the Huskies' leading
rusher, ``has earned more playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Corvallis, second-year coach Mike Riley is trying to find two
more victories from among Washington, Cal, UCLA and Oregon. That
would give OSU its first winning season since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I do know,'' he said. ``We have a better team this
year than last. Realistically, to get a couple of more wins out of
this deal is possible. Then Oregon State has started to turn the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU fell to Arizona 28-7 Saturday, losing four fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when we played awesome defense,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   He could have used the same adjective to describe Washington's
13 sacks against Cal, making it 26 in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' he said. ``I've never heard of that. That's a
season for most teams.''

LEGACE MIGHT BE ON THE SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ With goalies Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr
sidelined indefinitely with groin strains suffered in Sunday
night's 5-5 tie with the Colorado Avalanche, the Kings now must
turn to a pair of goalies who have never appeared in an NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Fiset and Storr are unable to play Wednesday when the
Kings begin a five-game trip in Florida _ and assuming general
manager Dave Taylor doesn't sign a goalie with NHL experience
between now and then _ the starting goalie against the Panthers
probably will be Manny Legace. The 25-year-old Legace is the No. 1
goalie for the Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The backup would be Alexey Volkov, an 18-year-old from Russia
who was the Kings' third-round choice in this year's draft. He is
playing for the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Until earlier this month, the Kings had another goalie, Frederic
Chabot, who had some NHL experience. But the Kings lost Chabot to
the Montreal Canadiens in the waiver draft on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   __ Early departure: Even though the first game of their trip
isn't until Wednesday, the Kings will leave today, then practice
Tuesday in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to get in there and get acclimated,'' coach Larry
Robinson said. ``That's why I like going at least a couple of days
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were 6-2-2 last season against the teams they will
play on the trip. Their next home game is Oct. 30 against Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   __ Struggling Stumpel: Robinson has been critical of Jozef
Stumpel, and though he was happier after Sunday's game, he didn't
exactly give his No. 1 center a ringing endorsement, calling him
``very indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was guilty of turning the puck over on the fourth goal,''
Robinson said. ``He fooled around with the puck when it was 5-5 and
lost it at the blue line. Good players aren't supposed to do that.
When he puts his mind to it, he's a great player.''

UNDERDOG HITCHCOCK READY FOR HIS DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never mind that Sterling Hitchcock has already
outpitched Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine this
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   When Hitchcock starts on Tuesday night in San Diego against the
Yankees' ace, David Cone, he knows he will again be in the role of
underdog _ and that he will have to win if the Padres are to have a
realistic chance of getting back into the World Series after Sunday
night's 9-3 loss to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock doesn't seem to mind. As he said before his matchup
with Maddux in Game 3 of the National League Championship Series:
``There's no pressure on me. I'm not supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hitchcock actually believes that is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expects to win now after beating the guys he's beaten,''
the Padres' pitching coach, Dave Stewart, said on Sunday afternoon.
``So he can't fool me by saying he doesn't expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hitchcock's three playoff performances have demonstrated
anything, it is that the Yankees had better not take their former
teammate lightly.
</P>
<P>
   That was what Atlanta Braves Manager Bobby Cox seemed to feel
his team did before Game 6 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   When San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy's gamble of pitching Kevin
Brown in relief in Game 5 backfired, preventing Brown from starting
in Game 6, Cox later indicated he thought his team might have grown
a bit complacent knowing that they would be facing Hitchcock
instead of the San Diego ace.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock matched Glavine zero for zero for five innings and
ended up with his second victory of the series _ and the NLCS most
valuable player award _ after San Diego scratched out five
sixth-inning runs to win its first N.L. pennant in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to go out and give my team the chance to win,''
Hitchcock said on Sunday. ``I like to pitch. That's the bottom
line. I like to go out and compete. And whether I'm pitching or
playing Nintendo with my wife, I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Tracy Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``She accuses me of cheating at checkers,'' Sterling Hitchcock
said of his wife. ``But she's wrong. She just doesn't know all the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hitchcock doesn't know what the fuss is about his
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke,'' Hitchcock said of the attention surrounding his
next start. ``I haven't done anything differently all year. I won
three games in the post-season. It's hysterical. I'm still the same
person I was two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, though, Hitchcock was just a career 48-42
pitcher, one who had been with three organizations in the last four
years. He was in the bullpen at the start of the season, although
Stewart said the Padres needed a left-hander there.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy said Hitchcock gained something from the move. ``Being in
the bullpen woke him up,'' Bochy said. ``It got him to be
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has defeated three of the premier pitchers in the game.
And on Tuesday, he gets a chance at a little revenge against the
Yankees, the first team to trade him. He went to Seattle on Dec. 7,
1995, as part of the Tino Martinez deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said he couldn't handle the pressure in New York,'' said
Jim Leyritz, another former Yankee, after Game 6 in Atlanta.
``That's why they got rid of him. But he's done a pretty good job
of handling the pressure here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hitchcock says he won't have any extra motivation to beat
the Yankees. He is grateful that the Yankees gave him a chance to
pitch somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``And just who exactly traded me?'' he said. ``Stick Michael and
Bob Watson and Joe Torre. What do I care? They gave me a chance to
get a career. There is no revenge factor.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a little concern about Hitchcock's health. He
is suffering from the effects of either a flu or a virus, although
San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers said Hitchcock didn't seem
to feel all that bad when the two had breakfast on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock certainly should feel good about his pitching. In
addition to being 3-0 this post-season, he has a 1.13 earned run
average and 25 strikeouts in 16 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees are thinking of loading their lineup with
right-handed hitters against the left-handed Hitchcock _ as both
the Astros and the Braves tried _ they might keep in mind that he
fared better against right-handed batters than left-handers in the
regular season. Right-handers batted hit .249 against Hitchcock and
left-handers batted .256.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart believes Hitchcock's success against left-handers is
because of his forkball, which he is again throwing after
recovering from elbow problems in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he has got to throw that pitch to be successful,''
Stewart said. ``It's a neutralizer.''

PHEW, THIS STINKS  
 CARDS CAN DO NO RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They've got a quarterback playing as if
a pickpocket snatched his instincts.
</P>
<P>
   They've got a defensive line that was forcing a league-leading
number of turnovers and starting to scare people suddenly playing
about the way the air smells around here.
</P>
<P>
   Outplayed and out-coached, the Cardinals could rightly be taken
to task for everything from game-plan schemes to execution Sunday
after they were bombed by the New York Giants and their last-place
offense, 34-7, at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a lot more about getting that mental edge
than anything else,'' said Giants Coach Jim Fassel, who was the
Cardinals offensive coordinator two seasons ago, and who twice last
season administered similar shellackings to his former team.
</P>
<P>
   Correct, confirmed Eric Swann, the Cardinals Pro Bowl defensive
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a key guy, Fassel,'' Swann said. ``We had him, they
got him. He knows a lot, and he knows us. I feel right now like he
has our number. But we play him again. He has to come to the Valley
(on Dec. 6).
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change every week in this league. Rankings don't mean
anything. You've got to be prepared to play. When a team like the
Giants (3-4) gets rolling in their backyard, it's like trying to
stop a semitruck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (3-4) could have climbed above .500 for the first
time during Coach Vince Tobin's three seasons in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly felt it was an important game, one we needed to
be ready for from the opening get-go,'' Tobin said. ``Sometimes
when you have a young team and things are going fairly well, you
believe they'll continue to go well. But they only go well if you
make them go well. That's part of the maturation process, and today
it cost us a pretty good whipping.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to rationalize it away. Seventeen key players
came into the season with anywhere from three years to no previous
NFL experience. The Cardinals' uneven performances reflect that. It
has been particularly evident on the offensive line and in
quarterback Jake Plummer, who was sacked seven times, intercepted
twice, and finally benched with 6 minutes remaining and the
Cardinals hopelessly behind.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three weeks, Plummer's decision-making has become
shaky and his trademark play-making has all but vanished. He holds
the ball and takes sacks. He forces a pass into coverage and
suffers a pickoff. He has a clear path to scramble, but gets to the
line of scrimmage and stops, indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were limited to 194 total yards, scoring only on
the one drive in which Jake was Jake. He went 4 for 4 for 49 yards,
including a 14-yard touchdown pass to tight end Johnny McWilliams
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer doesn't seem the same as he did last season, when he
raised hopes with his flashes of brilliance. Offensive co-captain
Lomas Brown said that it's ``time one of us sits down and talks to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken some shots back there, and when that happens, you
start looking around. I mean, he was getting hit on some three-step
drops. That's unheard of. We can't allow that. That made me mad,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's struggle wasn't as stunning as the Cardinals' defense
going belly up against an offense that, despite ranking dead last
in the NFL, came within 10 yards of a 400-yard afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last thing I expected to happen,'' said defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis. ``The last.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had won three of their previous four largely by
forcing turnovers and giving Plummer and the young offense short
fields to negotiate for points.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Cardinals forced not a turnover and watched Gary
Brown become the latest Giants back to rough them up (24 carries,
108 yards, 4.5-yard average), just enough running game for the
Cardinals to have to honor. The Giants complemented that with
receiver Chris Calloway picking on backup cornerback J.B. Brown for
many of Calloway's 97 receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in his 10th NFL season, had played well the previous two
games in place of injured corner Tom Knight (inactive, strained
lower hamstring attachment). After Brown was twice called for pass
interference in a New York scoring drive and consistently beaten in
coverage, he was relieved by Ty Howard, who wasn't much more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Cardinals can be thankful this is their open
week, a period in which they can get healthy, flush this disaster
from their minds, and get ready for what appears to be a friendly
closing-half schedule. &QL;

`MAGIC' CHARMS WAY INTO TOP SPOT IN OPENING WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: correcting byline) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Practical Magic'' cast a winning spell at the
nation's box office with an estimated $13.6 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,652
theaters from Friday through Sunday, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. release, with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman
as New England sisters who inherit magical powers, performed in
line with industry expectations. The marketing took advantage of
Halloween's approach to lure customers during what is traditionally
a slow movie-going period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warner Bros. has to be pleased because this was something of a
high-risk picture,'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co.
``I think its star power and theme were enough to give it a
respectable opening.''
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `Practical Magic' was able to draw in women and the date
crowd,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Universal's ``Bride of Chucky'' finished a strong second with
an estimated $11.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,411 theaters as the horror-comedy,
the fourth in the Chucky series, benefited from a memorable
``Chucky gets lucky'' ad campaign, as well as the tie-in to the
Halloween season and the genre's ongoing appeal to teens and young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween is definitely on people's minds at this time of
year,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers continued marching to see ``Antz.'' The
computer-animated comedy came in a close third with $11.3 &UR;  &LR; million
at 2,903 sites in its third weekend, dropping only 23 percent from
its previous Friday through Sunday. The DreamWorks SKG release has
drawn $51.6 &UR;  &LR; million in 17 days after setting a record for an
October debut and soon will top the $63 &UR;  &LR; million record set by
``Beavis and Butt-head'' as the top non-Disney animated film.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Antz'' may wind up helping Disney's ``A Bug's
Life,'' another computer-animated comedy, scheduled for release
Nov. 20. Audiences appear to be responding well to trailers for ``A
Bug's Life'' when they run before screenings of ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, Disney's much-anticipated
roll-out of ``Beloved,'' finished fourth with a less-than-expected
$8.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,501 theaters. Bucksbaum pointed out that the
drama, starring Oprah Winfrey as a runaway slave, was unable to
draw a broad-based audience beyond women, despite strong reviews
and an extensive marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `Beloved' was not able to cross over to men,'' the analyst
said, also noting that the film's running time of nearly three
hours limits the number of daily showings. ``We still think it's
such a strong film that it will get an Academy Award Best Picture
nomination and it will take in about $80 &UR;  &LR; million. It's going to
take awhile, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, one of the producers on the film, acquired the rights
to Toni Morrison's novel and made many appearances to promote the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Holdover films took the remaining top 10 slots, led by New
Line's fifth weekend of ``Rush Hour'' with $7.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,724
theaters to eclipse the $109 &UR;  &LR; million mark and underscore the hit
comedy's profitability, given its $35 &UR;  &LR; million price tag.
PolyGram's third weekend of ``What Dreams May Come'' was next with
$6.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,506 sites to push its 24-day take to
$41.2 &UR;  &LR; million _ far short of the spiritual drama's $90 &UR;  &LR; million
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's third weekend of ``A Night at the Roxbury'' finished
seventh with $3.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,169 theaters. Next came Sony's
fourth weekend of ``Urban Legend'' with $2.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,063
screens, MGM's fourth weekend of ``Ronin'' with $2.7 &UR;  &LR; million at
1,982 locations and Disney's second weekend of Eddie Murphy's
``Holy Man'' with a disappointing $2.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,013 theaters.
``Holy Man'' generated less than half its opening weekend audience,
and the $60 &UR;  &LR; million project is certain to generate hefty amounts
of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in a still-strong 11th was ``There's Something About
Mary'' with $2.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,405 theaters in its first finish
outside the top 10 after 14 weekends. The comedy's 96-day total has
hit $164.8 &UR;  &LR; million for 20th Century Fox, making it the
48th-highest domestic grosser ever, placing just after ``The
Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' 12th weekend of ``Saving Private Ryan'' drew
$1 &UR;  &LR; million at 851 screens, raising its total to $187.8 &UR;  &LR; million,
28th-highest domestic gross after ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, business continued to defy the season's traditional
slowdown in moviegoing. The three-day gross of about $80 &UR;  &LR; million
was up 10 percent from the same weekend last year. Year-to-date
business has reached $5.3 &UR;  &LR; billion, 12 percent ahead of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Studios will release more high-profile movies next weekend,
including New Line's comedy ``Pleasantville,'' Warner's Kurt
Russell action-drama ``Soldier'' and Sony's thriller ``Apt Pupil.''
Bucksbaum said ``Pleasantville,'' in which two modern-day teens
wind up in a 1950s sitcom, has the strongest prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Miramax will go nationwide with ``The Mighty,''
and the family drama could break out because of high
audience-approval ratings. Second-weekend grosses were moderate
with $370,000 at 129 sites.

MOVE OVER, HOFFA: CARDI NALS OWN PLOT IN GIANT GRAVE YARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   East Rutherford, N.J. - Jimmy Hoffa isn't buried at Giants
Stadium. The Cardinals are.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year our heroes are exhumed and identified _ ``Yep,
that's them'' _ and planted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bury us,'' Larry Centers asked after his team lost in
the Meadowlands for the 14th time in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Too late, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals quietly returned to their subterranean resting
place Sunday after playing their worst game of the season, and
timing-wise, isn't it just like them?
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Cardinals show signs of making real progress and
earning a measure of respect, they invariably revert to form and
give an ashes-to-ashes performance like the one we witnessed
against the mediocre Giants, a 34-7 loss that was worse than the
score.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been 41-7 or 48-7 or 55-7. Embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals should have a marble headstone here. They haven't
looked this deceased since the season-opening loss to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   After winning three of their past four games and squaring their
record at 3-3, the Cards had an opportunity to silence critics and
turn heads around the league. Predictably, in the most important
game of the season, they played like a team with one foot on a
banana peel, the other in the grave.
</P>
<P>
   They were out-hit. Out-muscled. Out-played. Out-coached.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for an explanation, most players shrugged and heaved a
sigh. The post-game locker room was silent except for the sound of
pressurized water spraying against the tiles in the showers where
Jake Plummer and his teammates tried to wash off the residue of a
truly unproductive, uninspiring effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants wanted it more than we did,'' Centers suggested. If
true, there is no more damning indictment.
</P>
<P>
   How could the Cards not be ready for this game? Should we
question their desire? Vince Tobin's leadership?
</P>
<P>
   The road map to success in sports is as confusing as the New
Jersey Turnpike. To win consistently in the NFL, you first must get
over the hump. To do that, you need to make a statement. Before you
can make a statement, you have to see the light at the end of the
tunnel, which only can happen after you turn the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't turned the corner. They won't until the
defense plays consistently. They can't until their second-year
quarterback _ under siege every Sunday _ grows into the job, which
means making better decisions and eliminating rookie-like mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Cardinals defense played a game that inspires
readers to write odes and ballads, hoping to have them reprinted in
the newspaper. Against Chicago, the defense forced eight turnovers.
The Cardinals caused zero fumbles and intercepted zero passes
against the Giants. They sacked quarterback Danny Kanell once.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the Giants have the most anemic offense in the
NFL. But they pushed the Cardinals defensive line aside. Gary Brown
ran for 108 yards. Kanell exploited the secondary and exposed
cornerback J.(ust) B.(urned) Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer dropped back, ducked, went down. When he wasn't sacked,
he made decisions that raise the question: is the Cardinals present
and future quarterback regressing? Plummer threw a screen pass
intended for Centers _ after his target fell down. Interception.
</P>
<P>
   Running for his life, Plummer tried to go long downfield instead
of safely throwing the ball out of bounds. Another pick. ``I want
the big play to happen,'' Jake said, in honest self-critique.
</P>
<P>
   The game over, the Cardinals threw their gear into a truck
provided by a moving company called the Haul of Fame. They flew
home, in silence, pondering the bad news and unaware of the good.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: Jim Fassel's Giants have outscored the Cards,
80-30, in three games. The Cardinals still aren't very good.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Neither is anybody else in the NFC East. Check
the Dallas score. &QL;

GORDON NOW A LEGEND OF THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Wonder Boy has a new nickname. Call him Mr. October.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who seemingly can do no wrong, forced the
anti-Gordon legion to look for something else to criticize by
winning Saturday's NASCAR Winston Cup race at Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   While it wasn't the first time Gordon had won at Daytona, it was
the first time he'd won a race in October or November, the final
two months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't satisfy everybody,'' Gordon said in a telephone
interview prior to the race. ``Everybody has their own opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was referring to criticism that he's either won too much
during the first eight months of the season or won too little
during its waning stages.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's won in October, on the heels of a gritty runner-up
finish last week at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway. No one can
accuse him any longer of taking the conservative low road.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for the Dura Lube/Kmart 500 on Sunday at Phoenix
International Raceway is that Gordon has bled the event of most of
its drama. He now leads runner-up Mark Martin by 358 points and
needs to finish only 37th or better in each of the final three
races to capture a third driving championship in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, in third place and trailing by 620 points, is
mathematically eliminated from the title chase.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for PIR is that Gordon also can clinch the crown
by increasing his advantage by a measly 12 points. In NASCAR's
scoring system, that could mean the difference of only one position
in the finishing order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gordon has three top-five finishes in five prior starts
at PIR, Martin owns the better scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has finishes of 35th, fourth, fifth, fifth and 17th last
season for a 13.2 average.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has competed in all 10 PIR races, recording finishes of
36th, third, 10th, 19th, second, first in 1993, second, eighth,
second and sixth last year for an 8.7 average. Martin, however, has
a 3.5 average over the past six races.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gordon may have an advantage. With such a huge lead, crew
chief Ray Evernham may not have to worry about a conservative
setup, and Gordon won't have to worry about a poor finish seriously
damaging the points lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Martin should win and accumulate a maximum 10 bonus
points, Gordon still would have a 207-point lead entering the final
two races and need only a 27th place finish or better to win the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the story for us the past few years is I haven't
performed at the end of the season,'' Gordon said. ``And I think in
the past we've made mistakes where we tried to over-protect instead
of just going out and running the way we did all year long. And by
that I mean bring out more horsepower and bring out the things that
were proven.
</P>
<P>
   ``What some people don't realize is when you're battling for the
championship, it's as important to make sure you're finishing races
as much as it is to win races. (As before Saturday's race), it was
very important for us not to have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (Evernham) and I talked last year about this, and we told
ourselves that one of these days we're going to win the
championship when it's on the line at the final race of the season
at Atlanta. That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be Gordon's goal, but it's not going to happen this year.
And if he keeps on blazing a constant trail into victory lane, it's
not likely to happen anytime soon. &QL;

TRIPLE-THREAT TAILBACKS  
 TRIO HELPS ARIZONA SMASH OREGON ST., MOVE UP TO NO. 14 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Arizona, already known for two quarterbacks, is
poised to add another combination to its varied offense.
</P>
<P>
   If a double works, why not a triple?
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a rotation with three tailbacks emerged
Saturday with the Wildcats' 28-7 victory at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (6-1, 3-1 in the Pac-10 Conference) reimplemented a
running game by using the varied abilities of Kelvin Eafon, Trung
Canidate and Leon Callen at different times and points on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Eafon is a power runner who primarily is used near the goal line
or on third down and short yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate, a junior from Central High School, has great cutback
ability and appears to be at his most effective between the 20-yard
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Callen has world-class speed that could be useful against tiring
defenders. Callen, a highly prized prospect and a 1996 ``Parade''
prep All-American, broke loose for a 36-yard touchdown in the
fourth quarter against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy to see Leon get as much works as he did,''
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said Sunday of the 5-foot-9, 186-pound
sophomore, who led the Wildcats running game with 107 yards on 16
carries. ``He has been working very hard in practice but had just
not gotten much of a chance to run in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legs were a lot fresher, and he was able to give us that
added dimension of speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelvin's role is more in short-yardage situations. All of our
backs have specific roles. It appears we are going to be able to
keep fresh legs at our tailback position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats _ up two spots to No. 14 in Sunday's ``Associated
Press'' poll _ have an opportunity to work out any kinks in the
potential rotation next Saturday against Northeast Louisiana at
Arizona Stadium in an important tuneup for Oregon in a Pac-10 clash
with Rose Bowl implications.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 leader UCLA is on a track toward the Fiesta Bowl's
national championship game. Arizona and Oregon, both beaten by the
Bruins, are in the hunt for the league's second spot, which could
mean the Rose Bowl if Notre Dame and/or Wisconsin don't get the
nod.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Callen is happy to be back in the mix. He had been
relegated to spot duty through this season's first six game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a good feeling about myself all along,'' said Callen,
who underwent major knee surgery in April 1997. ``But this is even
better. I was able to contribute. This puts a lot of bad stuff
behind me.'' &QL;

A CRYSTAL FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since the salary cap was installed at USC,
professional football has been dead in this town.
</P>
<P>
   But there is reason for hope that goes far beyond the
limitations of any satellite dish:
</P>
<P>
   There is expansion.
</P>
<P>
   There also is Houston, a city that reportedly has its butt in
the catbird seat along the NFL's front row. We refused to accept
this (Houston?), but our mojo was weak. We required validation in
our belief that L.A. will land its own team by the year 2002. So we
visited Madame Futura, the foremost psychic on our HMO list.
</P>
<P>
   Madame Futura lives in L.A. From her living room, she can see
the downtown skyline; from her parlor she can see the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be L.A., dude, no problem,'' said Madame Futura between
puffs on a Turkish cigarette. ``Know how I know?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Tagliabue,'' she said, invoking the name of the NFL's
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue told her?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Madame Futura said. ``In the old country, Tag-li-a-bue
means `Man who refuses to host Super Bowl party in a dump like
Houston.' Loosely translated.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   So the next order of business was selecting a name. L.A.'s next
team requires a nickname that suggests a species indigenous to
Southern California ... something vicious, something relentless.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Agents.
</P>
<P>
   Good but not marketable.
</P>
<P>
   Our next move was to take it to the people, those of you who
phone this newspaper with inquiries into Saturday's late BYU-Hawaii
game and its point spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?'' said the first caller, who sounded happy to learn BYU
had covered.
</P>
<P>
   We repeated the question. When L.A. gets a team, what should it
be called?
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' said the caller, ``should be called an upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Good but not marketable.
</P>
<P>
   Next caller: ``Who cares?'' Click.
</P>
<P>
   The next caller: ``The Raiders. If Cleveland can lose its team
but get its name back, so should we.''
</P>
<P>
   We pointed out Oakland had the name ``Raiders'' first. Click.
</P>
<P>
   The next caller: ``The Cobras. L.A. Cobras. How's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad. But we already had a snake, a snake named Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is a color. You know, Browns, Blues, Reds.
So, in fighting L.A. spirit, we offer the Greens. No? How about
Dragons? Dragons definitely says ``L.A.,'' and if you don't think
so, you've never been to Venice Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The last order of business is attaching a corporate name to that
Hacienda place Michael Ovitz wants to build in Carson. Since
electronics peddlers are the rage in corporate sponsorship
(Qualcomm, Ericsson, etc.), and because a certain Lakers center has
involved himself in the Ovitz campaign, we have a natural:
</P>

<P>
   Snap judgments
</P>
<P>
   Anyone standing up on the turnip truck could miss something the
NFL doesn't want us to realize: The 1998 season, at least a whiff
from the first seven weeks, has a smell that might even make your
dog backpedal.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a recording.
</P>
<P>
   Submitted for your perusal is Exhibit A, the league's punishing
schedule for week 7.
</P>
<P>
   How about Carolina at Tampa Bay? The over-under was your stomach
in free fall.
</P>
<P>
   The only game involving two teams with winning records was New
Orleans at Atlanta. Quit waiting for the punch line. We're serious.
Mike Ditka's Saints, who have become the pawn shop of professional
quarterbacks, were involved in a Game-of-the-Day-styled scrimmage
with Dan Reeves' mighty Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler was damaged by a
fearsome pass rush. A stretcher was deployed, not to remove
Chandler, but to bring on 44-year-old backup, Steve DeBerg. DeBerg,
it has been rumored, threw for three TDs in a game televised by the
sports bar hosting the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, his unleashing resulted in 7 of 10 passing for 60
yards, including a touchdown flip to Bob Christian. The game itself
almost offered some intrigue, with the Falcons surviving one of
those storied Saints rallies for a 31-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Another pearl plucked from this sow's ear of a schedule featured
Doug Flutie's heroic effort in Buffalo's upset victory over
previously unbeaten Jacksonville. Flutie, who wore down the Jags'
pass rushers by firing passes into their stomachs, actually faked a
pass while jumping. He also managed to win the game on a
fourth-and-goal, broken-play bootleg; at 5-foot-9, Flutie is so
small the Jags defenders couldn't see him in the boot. But his
greatest move was leaping high enough to reach the loving arms of
Bills fans.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, those two games couldn't overcome the Cardinals (7) at
Giants (34), the Bengals (14) at the Oilers (44), the Redskins (17)
at the Vikings (41) and the Ravens (6) at the Steelers (16).
</P>
<P>
   The league is considering realignment.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the shocks on the ol' turnip truck aren't what
they used to be.

BATES A RAY OF LIGHT ON ANOTHER DIM DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 and STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ On a day when negatives were easy to
identify, the one bright spot for the Cardinals in a 34-7 reaming
by the New York Giants was the rushing of  &UR; Mario Bates in his first
start.
</P>
<P>
   Bates got the call because  &UR; Adrian Murrell strained a calf
muscle in Thursday's practice, although Murrell inexplicably was
sent into the game in the fourth quarter when the Cardinals
trailed, 27-7.
</P>
<P>
   Bates gained 45 yards with 13 carries (3.5-yard average) and was
especially effective on first down, often gaining four to six yards
and keeping the Cardinals out of long-yardage situations on third
down that have thwarted drives.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who attended Arizona State and Tucson Amphitheater High,
had not touched the ball through the opening five weeks until he
got three carries _ two for touchdowns _ in a win over Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran pretty well on first down, but you need all the areas
clicking, and that didn't happen,'' Bates said. ``When you get
second-and-short or third-and-short and don't convert, that's very
hard to deal with. New York really came after us.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, who played in Giants Stadium with the New York Jets
until he was traded to the Cardinals last spring, was the starter
and featured back in the first five games. He carried once in the
fourth quarter for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question why Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin would wait until
the Cardinals were down by 20 points in the final quarter to play
Murrell if his injury did not prevent him from playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian is our starter, and we put him in because we felt he
could give us something, and we had not given up on the game at
that point,'' Tobin said. ``His injury isn't the kind of thing
that's going to put him out for a month if we played him.'' &QL; 
Could've been worse &QL; 
The Giants weren't flawless, either, otherwise it would have been
over at halftime. The Cardinals were within one big play of getting
back into the game well into the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were with them step for step,'' said Cardinals Pro Bowl
tackle
 &UR; Eric Swann. ``They just out-schemed us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening half, the Giants frittered away 24 potential
points:
</P>
<P>
   A wide-open  &UR; Chris Calloway dropped what would have been 63-yard
scoring bomb over safety  &UR; Pat Tillman.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback &UR; Conrad Hamilton dropped an interception with nothing
but 55 yards of green carpet ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   A 91-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by  &UR; David
 &UR; Patten was called back because of a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   And Giants kicker  &UR; Brad Daluiso missed a chip-shot field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx cheer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Tobin sent backup quarterback  &UR; Dave Brown into the
game midway through the fourth quarter Sunday, the fans at Giants
Stadium started booing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans got their money's worth today,'' said Brown, who
spent six years with the Giants. ``They saw the Cardinals lose and
me get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brown's first appearance as a Cardinal. He completed 2 of
5 passes for 31 yards and was sacked once. &QL;

BYE-BYE BIRDIES: CARDINALS FOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   East Rutherford, N.J. - They knew the Giants were desperate.
They knew the Giants would come out flying. They knew the Giants
were committed to a war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   They knew all of this, and still they couldn't match the
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Pathetic. Cowardly. A waste of airline miles and a perfectly
good Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A good team wouldn't roll over like a meek puppy struck for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   And a good coach would not have let this happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the mind-numbing aftermath of a 27-point loss to a mediocre
football team, a game that could've easily ended 62-7, you could
place blame at nearly every locker.
</P>
<P>
   But there was only one obvious conclusion, and it's that Vince
Tobin is no Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after his team treated the Cardinals like a cat does a
scratching post, it's safe to assume Fassel knows the Cardinals
better than Mr. Beige.
</P>
<P>
   It took all of four plays for Fassel to isolate Pat Tillman in
single coverage on a deep route, a sure touchdown pass dropped by
Chris Calloway. It took two series for Fassel to expose J.B. Brown,
who produced two pass interference penalties and left a receiver
completely uncovered in the span of eight plays. It took three
quarters for Fassel to stretch the Cardinals' defense up and down,
left and right, until there was nothing left but surrender.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, there was a team that still can't move the
football after 11 games of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our backs against the wall,'' Fassel said. ``And there
would be no more losing, no more playing sloppy, no more anything.
Our team played very hard. They never lost their focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Cards feel no urgency &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you find solace in a 3-4 record and a division where
anything is still possible, remember that the Cardinals haven't
beaten a team worthy of its shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants entered the game with the worst offense in the NFL.
With a secondary depleted by injuries. With their confidence at a
dangerous level. They were a team that should've been disposed of,
even in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel knew all of this, and built his team up all week, capped
by a riveting speech on Saturday night. As a result, his team
played with a sense of urgency. Strangely, the opponent did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the mental preparedness was more important than the
game plan,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. And while Tobin might be able to game plan with the
best of them, his words will never make men run through a locker
room wall. That much was clear Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals did not play hard. The Cardinals were whipped
physically. The Cardinals looked as if they wanted to call it a day
after three quarters. And at some point _ I'm not sure when, but
I'll guarantee it came before the gun sounded _ the Cardinals
folded up their tents and retreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wore them down over the course of the game,'' Giants
running back Tiki Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like last season, when Fassel's troops rolled over the
Cardinals like a brigade of tanks, sending your heroes into a
tailspin that lasted the rest of the season, other teams will take
notice. They will use this film for medicinal purposes. &QL; 
Farewell to opportunity &QL; 
The Giants called it a must-win situation. But it's not like the
Cardinals had any margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   When you haven't had a winning season in 10 years, every week
should be a must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the Cardinals took their bye week seven days early. And
now it's the bye-bye week, as in farewell to a golden opportunity,
a chance to rise above .500, to put the Giants in the rearview
mirror for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played like the Giants of last year,'' linebacker Jesse
Armstead said. ``We got after it. We stepped it up. We made their
quarterback fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, a high-ranking member of the organization
walked alone up the tunnel. He spotted the media gathered like
sheep, informing the motley crew that they could've performed
better than the men in red.
</P>
<P>
   A good coach would never let that happen. Not in a game of this
magnitude. &QL;

SNAKE'S IN SACK, CAN'T GET OUT  
 PLUMMER `FRUSTRATED' WITH PLAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer wants
everyone who asks to know the aura isn't gone.
</P>
<P>
   Getting sacked seven times, throwing two interceptions and
losing a fumble hasn't beaten him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence has not gone down the tank,'' Plummer said. ``If
I do that, smack me and straighten me up.''
</P>
<P>
   He needs something after a dismal performance in Sunday's 34-7
loss to the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer clearly isn't playing like Jake the Snake, that slippery
daredevil who led Arizona State to the Rose Bowl, who directed the
Cardinals on a 98-yard scoring drive on his first possession in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I worry about with him is taking a little
bit too much responsibility on his shoulders,'' fullback Larry
Centers said. ``I think he wants to be Jake Plummer and wants to be
a little bit extra sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Receivers aren't open. Plummer used to avoid the rush and
slither for a first down. Now he ducks his head and takes the sack
or makes an errant throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a person who's really not confident in
his offensive line or a person who's trying to make a lot of things
happen, hit for the big play every play,'' offensive tackle Lomas
Brown said. ``It's not going to happen like that in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   On several of Plummer's sacks, he could have thrown the ball
away. Other times, he could have run out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated and disappointed with the way I'm playing,''
said Plummer, who completed 12 of 21 passes for 139 yards. ``I
didn't do any dang near what I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to remember not to try to force and make the big
play. If we're not making the big play, just live to fight another
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Never was that more evident than on a pass early in the third
quarter with the Cardinals trailing, 17-7. He scrambled out of the
pocket and then underthrew to wide receiver Eric Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Percy Ellsworth intercepted at the Cardinals' 40
to set up Brad Daluiso's 34-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be pushing too hard,'' Plummer said. ``Maybe I should
just tuck the ball and run for that yardage. Defensive coordinators
are telling (defensive backs) to hang with receivers, don't come
up. If they don't come up, I should run. Like the (interception)
that I threw toward Eric. I thought I'd slip it in, that I'm
bulletproof, Jake the Snake.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has thrown an NFC high 11 interceptions and only six
touchdown passes. A year ago, he threw for 388 yards, an NFL rookie
record, at Giants Stadium and had a 70-yard touchdown pass to wide
receiver Frank Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   He had only one completion more than 20 yards Sunday, and his
longest run was 7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't made those (big) plays this year,'' offensive
coordinator Marc Trestman said. ``We're open to giving him the
opportunities. We went with some more deep (pass) patterns today to
give him some running options if the patterns break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are asking why those big plays, scrambles,
aren't coming this year, and it's a legitimate question.''
</P>
<P>
   With 6:12 left in the game, Coach Vince Tobin pulled Plummer for
the first time this year, replacing him with former Giants
quarterback Dave Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake was just among a lot of people that did not play as well
as we needed to play today,'' Tobin said. &QL;

OH, TO BEE YOUNG AGAIN  
 THAT'S WHEN SOME COYOTES LOVED BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - They are not the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   To their loyal legions, they are simply known as the ``Bees.''
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly no different for several Phoenix Coyotes who
had eyes only for them while growing up in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   When they take the ice tonight at 7 p.m. and see the black and
gold game sweaters of the ``Bees,'' a few thoughts of their youth
no doubt will flash through their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always special to play against them now,'' said Coyotes
center Mike Sullivan, who hails from Marshfield, Mass., and played
for Boston last year before being acquired by Phoenix during the
summer. ``It's always a dream of a hometown kid growing up in a
city to play for the hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching the Bruins my whole life. I was a big fan,
and to have an opportunity to play for them was a dream come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's memories run deep, although he couldn't think of a
single moment about the Bruins that stands out in his mind. There
are too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there's nothing in particular,'' he said. ``I remember
growing up and sitting in front of the television a couple times a
week with my dad watching the Bees,'' he said. ``It was a special
part of my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any particular player that stands out for me. I
liked Gregg Sheppard when he was with them, and Jean Ratelle was a
guy who played with so much emotion that I liked the way he
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Coyotes from the Boston area include center Bob Corkum
(Salisbury, Mass.), Keith Tkachuk (Melrose, Mass.) and Jeremy
Roenick (Boston), who was unavailable because he was sitting at
home nursing a mouth where four wisdom teeth resided before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Deron Quint and Keith Carney also once qualified as
Bee Backers. Quint hails from Durham, N.H., and Carney from
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoy playing against them,'' Corkum said.
``Obviously, when I was younger, I followed the team, even back
when they had Stan Jonathan, John Wensink and Terry O'Reilly. It's
special when we play them because I know every one back home will
be watching on television, and it does give you some extra
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tkachuk and Carney, however, the thrill of facing the Bruins
has lost much of its glitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fan growing up and followed Ray Bourque,'' Carney
said. ``But it's not special to play against them anymore. Every
game I play is special to me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk adds, with a grin, ``It's nice to play them _ we only
play them twice if we're lucky now. It used to be a big, big thrill
when I first got into the league. Now it's just a regular game,
although I know a lot of people at home will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be better when they played in the old Garden, where
I grew up watching them. I didn't grow up watching in the Fleet
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Corkum, Tkachuk's fondest memory was watching his boyhood
hero, Cam Neely, and defenseman Bourque, who still plays for
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys I watched growing up were Cam and Bourque,'' Tkachuk
said. ``I don't want to say how old I was when I started watching
Ray Bourque because it might offend him. He's just a great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I played against them . . . we lost,
and it didn't go too well. But that was in the Garden, where they
won most of their games. It was tough for a visiting team to go in
and win at the Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending several years near the league's bottom feeders,
the rebuilt Bruins made the playoffs last year and are favored by
many to win the NHL's Northeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less what they do now,'' Tkachuk said. ``I'm not
worried about them. I'm worried about us. I'm not a Bruins fan
anymore. I was when I was growing up.'' &QL;

TKACHUK CITES CRISIS FOR BRUSHOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Keith Tkachuk says he's been trying this
season to comply with fans' requests, as well as working to live up
to the ``C'' on his sweater on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Since signing a contract extension after a summerlong dispute,
he has heard the boos and wants to make them go away.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Coyotes' star left wing said, he left practice
early to tend to a family emergency.
</P>
<P>
   He whisked by those seeking autographs, ignoring their requests
after Monday's practice. He was taken to task for his behavior in a
letter to the sports editor Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said Sunday that on the day in question, he hurriedly
left practice to be with his wife, Chantal, who had just been
rushed to the hospital. She was five weeks pregnant, and she lost
the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on except me,'' he said, ``and I
didn't even know how bad it was until I got there. All I know is, I
sign autographs for everyone after every practice and every game
and the one day I didn't do it, it was because my father-in-law
called me and said to get to the hospital quick because my wife's
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said he recognized that those at the rink didn't know
the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not me,'' he said. ``I always make sure I sign for the
fans. Always. When I was a kid, getting an autograph was a big
thrill, and that's why I sign stuff all the time, even if it's for
people who do nothing but sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to know I'm not like what the person said.
I care about kids. I care about the fans. I'm sorry, but hockey and
being a hockey player was the least on my mind that day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was important _ what ``is'' important _ is my family,
first and foremost. I just want people to realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tkachuks have a 10-month-old son, Matthew. &QL;

YANKEES TAKE 2-0 LEAD IN SERIES 9-3 VICTORY.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like so many before him in 1998, San Diego starter
Andy Ashby withered away on the Yankee Stadium mound Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Padres' chances in the 94th World Series,
along with Ashby's self-confidence, have probably evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego pitching coach Dave Stewart had a distressed look on
his face as he watched Ashby being pummeled during the second
inning, almost as though he wanted to somehow mystically send his
own ability to thrive in big games to his struggling starter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Stewart's want went unfulfilled. New York squashed
Asbhy and just about every reliever who followed him in the
Yankees' 9-3 victory in Game 2 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go by what I did as a pitcher,'' Stewart said. ``The
toughest part as a coach, and a teacher, you worry that you left
something out. I thought I had prepared my staff better than this.
I have to keep searching until I find the right answer. Hopefully,
I'll find it before Game 3.''
</P>
<P>
   After San Diego's humiliating offering, the Yankees now lead the
best-of-seven Series, two games to none.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it says the Yankees are halfway toward winning their
record 24th World Series. On the field Sunday night, it looked like
they could already set up the victory parade that will take place
in lower Manhattan if things continue down the same stretch of
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'd like to get another ring,'' said Yankees designated
hitter Chili Davis, who was a member of the 1991 championship
Minnesota Twins. ``I want one with an NY on it. Those are the most
special World Series rings there are.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling that only some kind of freaky development in
Game 3, which will take place in San Diego, can salvage the Padres
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's not fun when we're losing,'' Caminiti said.
``We get a fresh start in San Diego now, but we're down, 2-0, I
don't want to make it 4-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's final tally: Seven runs allowed while securing just
eight outs. The Yankees scored three, three and one run in the
three innings Ashby was out there. In seven career World Series
games, a Padres starter has now lasted less than three innings five
times.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby threw 66 pitches and watched New York's menacing lineup
mash 10 of them for hits, including a majestic two-run shot by
Bernie Williams that didn't stop until it disappeared over the
right-center field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give us a chance to win,'' Ashby said. ``It's
disappointing. I didn't pitch in any way to get in a rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Bronx Bombers baseball, the type of performance
the 1927 Yankees would have been proud of, if for no other reason
than it's what they did in beating Pittsburgh that year to become
the first American League club to sweep a National League team in a
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who jumped out to a 6-0 lead after two innings,
were laughing and having a ball in their dugout, almost as though
some of them were contemplating whether or not to return to New
York if the Series ends in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The game had a Yankee feel to it from the start. Leadoff hitter
Chuck Knoblauch walked, stole second and eventually scored on a
wild throw from third baseman Ken Caminiti on a sharp roller hit by
Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Three more singles followed, and San Diego found itself in a 3-0
hole after one inning. The way Cuban defector El Duque Herandez was
firing darts, it was more than he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez choked the Padres' bats, allowing just one run (which
angered him) on just four hits in seven innings. The man they're
calling ``The Duke'' appears to be on his way toward joining that
already crowded list of Yankees who have excelled in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Hernandez had his three-run lead in the bottom of
the first, he had already made Caminiti look silly in his
first-inning strikeout. Hernandez did the same thing to Steve
Finley the next inning and the Yankees locomotive was rolling down
the tracks toward an impressive victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the west coast 2-0, you can't be in a better
position,'' Yankee right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``But things
can change in a hurry and there is still a lot of baseball to be
played.'' &QL;

LAST HURRAH AT STADIUM? WILLIAMS ISN'T DWELLING ON IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was late, just past 11 p.m., and there were
parents trying to corral sugar-charged children in one aisle. And
there was a guy trying to balance an empty beer cup on his head
just a section away at Yankee Stadium on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the time Bernie Williams stepped to the plate.
There was a smattering of applause and a woman yelled out, ``We
love you, Bernie,'' but there was nothing dramatic to mark the
moment in the eighth inning of Game 2 in the World Series. Perhaps
no one was awake enough or sober enough to understand that this
could actually be the last at-bat for Williams as a Yankee in
Yankee Stadium. Perhaps people just didn't comprehend the reality
of it as the Yankees took a 2-0 lead in a World Series that could
be won in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not want to face the issue either. He had enjoyed
the thrill of hitting a home run in the second inning, and then
tipping his cap to fans as he trotted back into center field
afterward. But the player with a B.B. King tape in his locker was
as smooth as a blues tune as he dodged any question concerning the
possibility that last night was his last look at Yankee Stadium as
a member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a lot of fun right now,'' Williams said after
finishing the night 1 for 4 with two runs batted in and a walk in
his last at-bat of the Yankees' 9-3 victory. ``I don't want to
think about it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams may not want to get mired in the emotion that could
creep up and distract him if he allowed himself to say goodbye at
this point, even though he is almost certain to test the free-agent
market and seek a salary close to $12 million a year. Despite the
fact that Williams won the American League batting title by hitting
.339, that figure is most likely too high for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that situation distracted me in the season, and
I'd be a fool to let it distract me in the World Series,'' Williams
said. ``I should never be thinking about that. This is my future
right now. I'm living my future right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Williams has seemed aloof because of personal
problems, but he is trying to absorb every ounce of joy associated
with playing for a championship in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very exciting place to play, bar none,'' Williams
said. ``Nowhere in the world that I've ever been do you have the
kind of atmosphere that you have here, especially in games as
important as this. The fans' reaction is amazing. There's a way
people here get all excited. There's an electricity in the air. You
just can't help but feel pumped up.''

<P>
   NEW YORK - They chanted his name in the house of memories, just
as they did with Mickey and Reggie and Ruth. But this time, it
wasn't just the 57,000 wackos who ride trains and paint their
chests, the ones who call baseball a religion and Yankee Stadium
their church.
</P>
<P>
   This time, along with the fervor, there was perspective, cheers
from the people who shared something special with the man on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who risked their lives, paddling alongside Orlando
Hernandez on a leaky boat to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest game I've pitched,'' he said through an
interpreter last week, ``is jumping on the boat and leaving Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, for the 123rd time this season, the Yankees won. The
aura has returned, and so has the unmistakable swagger of
invincibility. And when the Padres walked off the field, they were
fully aware they've been outscored, 16-4, in the past 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Do they even belong on the same field? As the series moves west,
they must wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Yankees' current condition can be attributed to the
man they call El Duque. Not just for the stifling victory on
Sunday. But for re-establishing order, resetting the power for a
team that almost blew a major fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the Yankees arrived in Cleveland down, 2-1. Talk
of the great flame out filled the air. And then El Duque took the
mound, and in the only pivotal game the Yankees have played this
season, he shut out the Indians, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't lost since.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after El Duque's remarkable show of poise under duress,
the Yankees quit sputtering and started acting like the
cold-blooded machine that gobbled up victories from April to
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game he pitched against Cleveland in Cleveland really set
a standard for what I expect from him now,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said. ``And after that Game 4 in Cleveland, I felt like our
hitters have gotten a lot more quality at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not going to pitch a more important game in my mind than
that particular game. And he did it with such calm that I was very,
very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not many of Torre's men understand what pressure
really means.
</P>
<P>
   You know the story. How El Duque fled Cuba just nine months ago,
landing on the shores of the Bahamas. How food ran out before they
found land. How he is still hesitant to talk about the details,
fearful of further retribution back home.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't keep a good story down. Not when you go 12-4 in
the regular season and allow one run in two post-season starts.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who started the season in a Communist country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful story,'' Yankees catcher Jorge Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's victory, he wore a cream suit and puffed on a
cigar, proud owner of a $6.6 million contract. He wouldn't talk
about his special visitors, wondering aloud how the American media
gets so much information. But he did admit to getting some key
pointers from his brother, Livan Hernandez, on how to beat the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that one family has had a stranglehold on the story
line for two consecutive Octobers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, even though Moises Alou was the real MVP, Livan
somehow symbolized the struggle, the conquest, the ecstasy that
rang through south Florida when the Marlins won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, as his brother was becoming a hero, El Duque was
living with family members in a shack, banned from the Cuban
national team. He was punished for Livan's exodus, and for the
simple reason that Castro suspected that same from El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what this man has been through, he can handle the
pressure of a baseball game,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
said.
</P>
<P>
   And now that pressure is on the Padres, who are still alive, if
only in theory.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike El Duque, who is alive and well, lighting up his new
city.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where the flame of freedom burns in New York Harbor,
where Liberty Island is just a few miles away, it all makes sense. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ There is nothing unusual about a mugging in the Bronx,
but it's not every day that someone gets beaten down so badly while
more than 56,000 people watch and cheer for more.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres managed to get out of town with their money
and valuables, but they were robbed clean of any hopes of leaving
Yankee Stadium with a split. The New York Yankees ran over the
Padres like a runaway subway train Sunday night, leaving the
visitors for dead with a 9-3 victory in Game 2 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees turned Sunday's game into a laugher, and they are
threatening to do the same with the best-of-seven series. The
American League champions will take a 2-0 lead into Tuesday's Game
3 matchup at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backs are to the wall now,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy
said. ``We have to get back to San Diego and play better. This is
not the situation we were hoping for, but it has been overcome
before. We were hoping to at least win a ballgame here.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's customary Sunday-night game was moved up three days to
Thursday to avoid competing with the World Series. The Yankees did
their best to entertain fans of both sports, generating enough
offense to outscore four of the NFL teams that took the field
Sunday. The San Diego Chargers would have had a difficult time
keeping up with the Yankees' offense Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Every player in the Yankees' lineup contributed at least one hit
to their 16-hit attack; Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius set the
pace with three hits apiece. Rookie left fielder Ricky Ledee was
the only Yankees starter who didn't score a run, but he drove in
one, joining five of his teammates in that department. Bernie
Williams and Jorge Posada each belted two-run homers to highlight a
balanced assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everyone is swinging the bat well, it's sort of
catching,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   As glowing as the Yanks' offense was, it wasn't enough to
completely overshadow a flawless defensive effort behind a solid
pitching performance from Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who
should come equipped with a gear shift considering the way he
changes speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres no doubt will welcome today's break in the action to
get their swings back in working order after a night of flailing
aimlessly at a variety of offerings by El Duque, who held the
visitors to six hits in seven innings and struck out seven batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept the hitters off balance,'' said Posada, Hernandez's
personal catcher. ``He was impressive. He had a good fastball;
that's all I called at the end. We had a good plan, and he followed
it the whole way. He didn't know any of these hitters. He was just
going with instinct. The scouting reports helped, but he was going
with his trends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' starting pitching, which has been so good throughout
the playoffs, failed them at an inopportune time Sunday. After
using four relievers in Game 1, the Padres were hoping Andy Ashby
could work deep into Sunday's game despite cold symptoms. He didn't
make it out of the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt fine to pitch,'' Bochy said. ``If we thought he was
too sick to pitch, we wouldn't have pitched him. If he would've had
the flu, we wouldn't have had him out there. The bottom line is
that Ashby didn't have his best stuff. If he had been on, maybe it
would have been a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have allowed more runs (nine) in each of their two
World Series losses than they did in four games against the Astros
_ who scored eight runs _ in the NL Division Series. It took the
Braves six games to score 18 runs against the Padres in the
National League Championship Series; the Yankees have done it two.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill stole at least two runs from
the Padres in the top of the first when he made a leaping catch at
the wall to rob Wally Joyner of at least a double and possibly a
three-run homer. The catch loomed even larger in the bottom of the
inning when the Yankees scored three runs of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That catch ended up making a six-run difference, because we
were close to scoring three runs,'' Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby opened the door for trouble by issuing a leadoff walk to
Chuck Knoblauch. Gold Glove third baseman Ken Caminiti made things
worse with a throwing error that allowed Knoblauch to score from
second on a grounder by O'Neill. It was Caminiti's second error of
the postseason and his fifth in 15 career playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis and Brosius each contributed two-out RBI singles to
the early scoring spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees opened the second inning with three consecutive
singles off Ashby, including Derek Jeter's RBI base hit up the
middle. Williams' two-run homer pushed the Yankees' lead to 6-0
before the game was an hour old. Ledee doubled home another run in
the third to chase Ashby from the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short but laborious night for the Padres righthander,
who needed 66 pitches to get through his 2-inning stint. The
Yankees made the 17-game winner look like a batting-practice
pitcher, pounding Ashby for 10 hits and seven runs (three
unearned).
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some innings from Ashby,'' Bochy said. ``We tried to
stick with him for a little while to see if he could find it, but
he struggled from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hernandez retired 14 of the first 17 batters he
faced, including 10 in a row during one stretch. He took a shutout
into the fifth inning but lost it when Chris Gomez hit a two-out
triple and scored on a double by Quilvio Veras.
</P>
<P>
   Padres reliever Brian Boehringer held his former team scoreless
in the fourth inning, but he felt the sting of the Yankees'
quick-striking offense in the fifth when Posada tagged him for a
two-run homer. The Padres scored their only other runs in the
eighth on a pinch-hit double by Ruben Rivera and a single by Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking anything for granted,'' Torre said of the 2-0
lead. ``San Diego has a good team. They went through good teams in
Houston and Atlanta to get here, and now they're going home, where
they have a great following. You can't take them for granted.''

TIE PAINFUL FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It's not often a team loses two goalies to
groin strains on the same night. It's almost as rare for a team to
blow a two-goal lead in the last 50 seconds of a game and have to
settle for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Los Angeles Kings coach Larry Robinson,
however, because his team was the victim of both rare events Sunday
night at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-5 tie with the Colorado Avalanche _ the winless Colorado
Avalanche, which had scored five goals in four losses before Sunday
_ was bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   But rendering the night truly hideous from a Kings point of view
were the right groin strain suffered by Stephane Fiset early in the
third period and the left-groin strain suffered by his replacement,
Jamie Storr, with about eight minutes to play in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether either will be available Wednesday when
the Kings begin a five-game trip at Florida. But trainer Peter
Demers wasn't exactly bubbling over with optimism, particularly
when discussing Storr, who was injured five minutes after replacing
Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say how long they're going to be out,''
Demers said. ``If either had to play now, they couldn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Kings (2-1-1), the injuries overshadowed a wide-open
game _ played before an announced crowd of 11,294 _ featuring goals
by Matt Johnson and Mattias Norstrom, who entered the night with a
collective eight goals in 347 NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Avalanche (0-4-1, the worst start in franchise history)
battled back in the final minute, scoring twice with goalie Patrick
Roy pulled for an extra skater.
</P>
<P>
   First, rookie Chris Drury scored his second goal of the game,
deflecting home a shot from the left point by Sylvain Lefebvre with
49.8 seconds left. Two mistakes, one by Jozef Stumpel and the other
by Storr, made the goal doubly frustrating for Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made two bonehead plays,'' Robinson said. ``No.1, we turned
the puck over at their blue line instead of getting it deep. Then,
Jamie tried to clear it when he should have left it for the
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst was yet to come for the Kings, who allowed the tying
goal when Storr stopped a point-blank shot but couldn't get across
to stop Claude Lemieux from banging in the rebound with 24.7
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   During the break between regulation and overtime, Storr barely
was able to make it to the bench but somehow survived overtime,
stopping three Avalanche shots. Robinson said he did not know which
of his other players he would have put in goal had Storr been
unable to continue but joked about bringing 43-year-old goalie
coach Don Edwards down from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he even has his equipment with him,'' Robinson
said of Edwards, who retired 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much earlier, the Avalanche had taken a 1-0 lead on an Adam
Deadmarsh goal, but Johnson tied the score late in the first
period, finishing off a Russ Courtnall pass on a 3-on-1.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom then put the Kings in front with a shorthanded goal,
matching his output of last season with one swing of his stick.
Next, Drury and Rob Blake traded goals, and the Kings led 3-2 as
the second period wound down. The goals by Norstrom and Blake were
the first by Kings defensemen this season.
</P>
<P>
   But what would an NHL game be without a controversial goal? With
Colorado shorthanded, Joe Sakic took one shot that hit the left
post, then another that hit the right post. Finally, the puck hit
Fiset's blocker and headed for the goal line. Fiset covered it as
it headed into the net, and doubt ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Don Van Massenhoven wasn't sure the puck went in.
Neither was video goal judge John Pemberton. But the goal judge
behind the Kings' net was insistent that the puck had crossed the
line, and that was good enough for Van Massenhoven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond my comprehension how the video goal judge, at slow
motion, couldn't tell, and yet our own goal judge could,'' Robinson
said. ``If you can't even get a break in your own rink, something
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look as if it would matter. In the third period, goals
by Glen Murray (on a power play) and Yanic Perreault made it 5-3.
But Colorado's last-minute comeback added insult to the Kings'
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure blew that one,'' Murray said. ``You can't have a 5-3
lead and blow a game like that. It can't happen. Those are crucial
points.''

BRONX TALE: YANKEES TAKE TWO

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudy Guiliani was hanging out of the owners'
box Sunday night, cheering so loudly he embarrassed Billy Crystal.
Guiliani didn't care. He knows something about landslides.
</P>
<P>
   Right now his New York Yankees have that look, overwhelming the
San Diego Padres for the second consecutive game, this time 9-3 in
front of 56,692 at Yankee Stadium in Game 2 of the 1998 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Although the series moves to San Diego for the next three games,
beginning Tuesday night at Qualcomm Stadium, the majesty of
baseball's mightiest team left an imprint all over the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just glad it's a best-of-seven series,'' weary San Diego
manager Bruce Bochy said after his team gave up 18 runs in the
first two games. ``It will be good to go home, but we were hoping
to win at least one game here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with rookie right-hander Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez
dazzling the Padres with a variety of pitching deliveries that
never gave them a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Not with New York scoring seven runs in the first three innings
against Andy Ashby and giving San Diego no chance for a comeback.
The Padres 3-4-5 hitters went a combined 1 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, the 29-year-old Cuban refugee whose brother Livan was
last year's World Series MVP, allowed just one run in seven
innings, the only run he has given up in two postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt glad the people of Cuba were able to watch this game,''
said Hernandez, a member of the Cuban National team before
defecting last December. Even after Hernandez finally gave up a
run, his catcher, Jorge Posada, countered with a two-run homer. It
was that kind of weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a wonderful story and I hope he keeps this going,''
Posada said. ``My father came here from Cuba, so I know what he's
gone through. It's pretty amazing what he has done here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees put this one away without any of the suspense that
marked Game 1. They had 16 hits, including three apiece by Scott
Brosius and Tino Martinez _ who had Saturday's game-winning grand
slam.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Posada, Bernie Willims also hit a home run. It should be
noted that most of the Padres pitching staff has the flu, but the
Yankees also are making them sweat.
</P>
<P>
   They scored three in the first, three in the second and built
the lead to 7-0 after three innings. All three runs in the first
were unearned, scored after Ken Caminiti threw away Paul O'Neill's
grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was very big,'' Bochy said. ``It was only the first
inning, but we were forced to play catch-up the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball forced Caminiti to back up, and his flat-footed throw
sailed over the head of Wally Joyner at first. Second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch, who tied Game 1 in the seventh with a three-run homer,
scored on the play. O'Neill later scored on a single by Chili
Davis, who came around on a base hit by Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, who struggled after becoming the National League's first
16-game winner in August, didn't have much better luck in the
second. Rookie leftfielder Ricky Ledee, who replaced Darryl
Strawberry on the postseason roster, opened by getting his third
hit of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch reached base again on an infield hit. With Derek Jeter
at the plate, Ledee was thrown out trying to steal third, but
Knoblauch took second on the play and scored on a single by Jeter.
Ashby got the second out of the inning, but then gave up the home
run to Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six Yankee runs in the first two innings, five were
scored with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Yankees' offense chased Ashby out after 31/3
innings, Hernandez was brilliant for seven. Hernandez won 12 games
during the regular season, but was something of a postseason
afterthought behind the Yankees Big Three: David Wells, Andy
Pettitteand David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   But when Pettitte, who struggled late in the season, was hit
hard in a game 3 loss to Cleveland in the ALCS, Hernandez followed
by pitching perhaps the only critical game of this record Yankee
season. Like Sunday, Hernandez used his variety of deliveries to
hold the Indians scoreless for eight innings in the Yankees 4-0
victory that tied that series 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   New York won the next two games convincingly to reach the
Series, but Yankees manager Joe Torre had already decided to swap
Hernandez and Pettitte in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the big lead, Hernandez never lost concentration. He
threw strikes and kept San Diego off-balance the way he had done
with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez caught a break in the first, when O'Neill made a
leaping catch to rob Joyner of two RBI. After that, he rolled. It
wasn't until the fifth that San Diego finally got a run and ended
his postseason string of consecutive scoreless innings at 13.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Padres' shortstop Chris Gomez tripled to right
center and scored on a bloop single by Quilvio Veres. It happened
so quickly no one seemed to notice. The crowd was too busy cheering
the big Yankees lead.

THIS COLLAPSE IS FOR THE BIRDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Well, The Chicken wasn't there, dispensing his silly
antics that once brought such laughter to ballparks around America.
</P>
<P>
   But his old team, the San Diego Padres, was there at Yankee
Stadium Sunday evening giving a rousing impersonation of its fabled
one-time mascot, flopping all over the hallowed grounds, enhancing
the growing legend of Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and inspiring
haunting remembrances of the franchise's ignoble past.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, did the Padres leave 'em laughing in the aisles with
their wayward fielding and pitching, earning a sarcastic chorus of
Bronx cheers from 56,692 appreciative spectators on the way to
their 9-3 humiliation from the mighty Yankees in a frolic that
wasn't nearly as close as the final score insists.
</P>
<P>
   The real Padres, the team that for so many decades lived
haplessly in the shadows of the Los Angeles Dodgers, finally made
their first postseason appearance in Game 2 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It took a couple of weeks, but the club the oddsmakers thought
would lose to the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves in the National
League playoffs and didn't and predicted would lose to the Yankees
and will is now finally resembling the sad-sack Padres of
yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   After two games in which the Yankees asserted their superiority
in every vital area _ hitting, fielding, pitching, running and
managerial maneuvering _ this Fall Classic has become as one-sided
as the teams' October numbers, which show the Yankees having won 23
world titles and 115 World Series games to zero world titles and
one World Series victory for the beleaguered Padres.
</P>
<P>
   And, after watching the ghastly manner in which the Padres were
treated Sunday night, you have to be a person who believes in the
sanctity of the Tooth Fairy or a hopelessly provincial San Diego
resident to envision Bruce Bochy's sagging team being able to add
to these meager totals in the upcoming days.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, this is baseball, and anything can happen, as it
did only two years ago when the Yankees themselves were embarrassed
by the Braves in their first two World Series games, at home no
less.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees, you might remember, rebounded in Atlanta to win
three straight games and then returned to New York to wrap up the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But that team had a unique collection of players, many of whom
are members of this Yankees team that is even more unique with its
114 regular-season victories to go with nine more victories this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres haven't given even the faintest hint that they are
capable of such a rousing comeback, nor have the Yankees given even
the most remote indication that they're capable of committing a
Braves-type flameout.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after what the magnificent Cuban refugee El Duque
Hernandez did with his arm and what Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez,
Jorge Posada, Chuck Knoblauch, Chili Davis, Derek Jeter, Scott
Brosius and Ricky Ledee did with their bats to San Diego, I'll now
be surprised if these stumbling Padres will be able to extend their
purgatory to five games.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen teams fall apart before, but seldom as dramatically as
the Padres did Sunday evening after Paul O'Neill leaped up against
the right-field wall in the first inning to snag Wally Joyner's
lengthy two-out drive with two runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   Or were the Padres still in a state of shock over Kevin Brown's
inability Saturday night to hold on to a 5-2 lead going into the
seventh inning?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, after O'Neill's big play, the Padres turned into Mike
Tyson against Evander Holyfield without the bite, as the Yankees
quickly dispatched their starter, Andy Ashby, and had a 7-0 lead
after a mere three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti's misguided fielding aided the Yankees' cause, as
did booming home runs from Williams and Posada, as did Ashby's
awful pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Padre pitchers never have fared well in the World
Series. Ashby is the fifth of seven starters to not make it out of
the third inning. I think The Chicken was the only one to make it
into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After being given that early advantage, El Duque Hernandez, a
storybook saga if there ever was one, took command, as the
high-kicking right-hander frustrated the Padres with his array of
fastballs, curves and changeups often thrown with a side-armed
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, the half-brother of last year's World
Series MVP, Florida's Livan Hernandez, was living in his
girlfriend's one-room cinderblock house in Havana, earning $8.75 a
month as a physical therapist in a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He had been banned for life from playing baseball by Fidel
Castro's government because it thought he had helped Livan defect
and expected him to follow.
</P>
<P>
   He had been the top pitcher in Cuba throughout the early 1990s,
but hadn't played any organized baseball for two years.
</P>
<P>
   This caused such great frustration for Hernandez that the day
after last Christmas he and several companions got into a 20-foot
vessel and set sail from Cuba. They wound up landing on the
Caribbean island of Anguilla Cay, from where they were taken to
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   He would sign a three-year, $6.6 million contract with the
Yankees last March, would spend a couple of months in the minors,
and would make his major league debut on June 3 when he earned a
victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He would wind up 12-4 during the regular season, and would
become a favorite among the Yankee faithful, even before he pitched
seven shutout innings against the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS at
a juncture when the Yankees found themselves trailing 2-1 in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest win of the season for us and El Duque was
responsible for it,'' says Yankee manager Joe Torre. ``Nothing
bothers him. I guess what he goes through in a baseball game is
nothing compared to what he's gone through in life.''
</P>
<P>
   As one sage put it, Hernandez literally has gone from raft to
riches, and he continued the riveting drama against the Padres,
yielding only one run and six hits during his seven innings of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have games like this ... this wasn't the real
Padre team you saw out there tonight,'' said Bruce Bochy. ``We
definitely didn't play well. Our backs are now against the wall, no
doubt about it. We'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sterling Hitchcock Tuesday evening will baffle the Yankees
as thoroughly as he did the Braves last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe David Cone will be as vulnerable as he was in giving up
five runs to the Indians last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the San Diego Padres will get off the mat.
</P>
<P>
   Anything is possible, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   But these Yankees and El Duque are quite special.

YANKS CRUSH PADRES IN GAME 2 OF SERIES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The San Diego Padres are the National League
champions, conquerors of their domain. Facing the New York Yankees
in the World Series, the Padres look an awful lot like doormats.
But then, so does every other team the Yankees play.
</P>
<P>
   The post-season was supposed to provide the ultimate test of
greatness for the Yankees. Instead, they are treating the playoffs
and the World Series like extra credit, crushing San Diego, 9-3, in
Game 2 on Sunday night before 56,692 at Yankee Stadium, to take 2-0
advantage in the four-of-seven-game series. Orlando Hernandez, the
defector from Cuba, allowed a run in seven innings, and the only
run he has permitted in 14 innings in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Padres will resume the series on Tuesday night
in San Diego, with little reason to believe San Diego can mount a
comeback, other than the fact that they arrived on time for the
first two games. ``We've got two more games to win,'' said George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. ``And it ain't going to
be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it will, for the Padres are a mess. Sterling Hitchcock,
scheduled to start Game 3 against the Yankees' David Cone on
Tuesday, has flu-like symptoms. Kevin Brown, the Game 1 starter, is
suffering from a sinus infection and a bruised shin. Andy Ashby
started on Sunday night without a voice and with a sore throat and
head cold, and he would leave the field with this pitching line:
two and two-thirds innings, 10 hits, 7 runs (4 earned), 1 walk and
1 strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has looked bad against the Yankees this year. They
lost their first three games in April, then began careering down
the mountainside of the season. They won 114 games in the regular
season, compiling a .704 winning percentage; they have a .818
winning percentage since the playoffs began, winning 9 of 11 _ a
sweep of three games from Texas, four victories in six games
against Cleveland in the American League Championship Series, two
victories to open the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   They have nearly doubled their post-season opponents' run
production, 54-30. Manager Joe Torre believes they have won 123
games this year largely because they have respected all their
opponents, taken them all seriously. They beat up the expansion
Tampa Bay Devil Rays and now are beating up the Padres who appear
powerless against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach isn't different,'' Derek Jeter said. ``This team
doesn't like to lose. Everybody keeps the same approach and the
same intensity level against everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees wasted no time in attacking Andy Ashby and the
Padres, exploiting a gamble made by Manager Bruce Bochy. Knowing
that left-handed batters hit 109 points higher than right-handed
batters against Hernandez this year, Bochy inserted
left-handed-hitting Greg Myers into his lineup at catcher, in
Myers' first start since Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, Myers failed to catch a foul pop hit by the lead-off
batter Chuck Knoblauch, who walked. Myers throws poorly, so
Knoblauch swiped second and established that the Yankees would run
aggressively. O'Neill chopped a grounder to third, and when Ken
Caminiti threw high and wide, Knoblauch scored. Then O'Neill broke
for second on a ground ball back to the mound; if he had not been
running, if Myers had not been catching, the play might have led to
an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The came successive hits by Chili Davis, Tino Martinez and Scott
Brosius, and the Yankees led, 3-0. Ashby, nursing a head cold and
sore throat, needed quick innings. He needed a chance to retreat to
the clubhouse, to catch his breath, to review the innings past and
ahead. But the Yankees treated him the same way they treated Brown
in Game1, taking pitches, making him work, wearing him down.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees sent 14 batters to the plate in the first two
innings, and only O'Neill swung at the first pitch, in each of his
two at-bats. Ashby threw 29 pitches to get through that first
inning and needed almost as many in the second. ``He went back out
for the second,'' Bochy said, ``and he didn't have quite the same
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, who reached base in his first seven plate
appearances in this Series, led off the second with a single and
Knoblauch walked. Myers threw out Ledee at third on an attempted
double steal, but Jeter hit a run-scoring single. Two batters
later, Bernie Williams leaned on Ashby, fouling off three
two-strike pitches; it was like watching a cat toy with a
beleaguered mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ashby threw a sinking fastball, his 50th pitch of the
night and Williams drove it into the right-field stands, a two-run
home run _ in what could be Williams' last game as a Yankee at the
Stadium. (Williams is eligible for free agency after this season,
and he will entertain offers from other teams that are expected to
be higher than what the Yankees most likely will bid.)
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees applied the coup de grace to Ashby in the third,
Ledee driving in another run, and Bochy went out to get his
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball lore has it, the 1927 Yankees _ heretofore
considered by many to be the greatest team of all time _ all but
defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series when they took
batting practice. The burly sluggers Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig
smashed monstrous drives as the Pirates, diminutive in comparison,
supposedly stood nearby and gawked, psychologically beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Their expressions could not have been much different than that
on Ashby's face after Bochy replaced him in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 7-0, and Hernandez was in complete control,
throwing fastballs when it appeared the Padres were anticipating
his curveball, flipping changeups when batters were thinking
fastballs. Only three times in the first six innings did a Padres
base runner reach scoring position. By the seventh inning, this
felt nothing like a World Series game and every bit like a
midseason blowout against Detroit. Fans departed early, those who
stayed cheered the former Yankees catcher Jim Leyritz when he was
announced as a pinch-hitter, and Torre was using the last innings
to get work for his relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said that the Yankees' comeback in the 1996 World Series
will be a reminder that any Series can turn around quickly, that a
2-0 advantage does not necessarily translate into a title. But
there is a sense of inevitability about San Diego's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a fall classic. To be precise, this classic began in
the spring in Tampa and may reach its zenith this week in San
Diego. &QL;

EL DUQUE'S GREAT CALM EASES THE ADJUSTMENTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez turned to watch Paul O'Neill soar
against the right-field wall for a one-handed catch of Wally
Joyner's drive to end the Padres' threat in the first inning on
Sunday night, just as he had turned to watch O'Neill camp under Jim
Thome's deep drive to end the Indians' threat in the first inning a
week ago Saturday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Two long outs, two long moments for El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember much about what happened in Cleveland, the
past is in the past,'' he would say after scattering six hits over
seven innings in the Yankees' 9-3 triumph for a 2-0 jump in the
World Series. ``As for O'Neill's catch, that's why there's nine of
us. We help each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque was puffing on a cigar befitting his Series
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Costa Rican cigar,'' he said. ``I'm saving the Cuban
cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   And after that scary first inning, El Duque had smoked the
Padres' hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he tries to find the umpires' strike zone in the first
inning and he gets behind some batters; he doesn't make the quality
breaking ball that he makes later on,'' Joe Torre said in assessing
Hernandez's first-inning troubles. ``He wants to see what's a
strike and what isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For the year, El Duque, who has allowed only one run in 14
post-season innings, now has a 21-5 record: 1-0 in the World
Series, 1-0 in the American League Championship Series, 12-4 in the
regular season, 6-0 with the Columbus farm team, 1-1 with the Tampa
farm.
</P>
<P>
   From the time El Duque joined the Yankees in early June, Torre
has talked about the calm that the now 29-year-old right-hander has
displayed, as he did again on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   If that calm wasn't in him, El Duque, who had been banned from
Cuba's national team, would not have climbed on a small boat in
February with seven others and a few cans of Spam and drifted
across the Caribbean to Anguilla Cay and eventually to the Yankees
and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That calm was there when El Duque was asked if his Cuban
companions on the boat were his guests at Saturday night's Series
opener. He handled that conversation as if he were pitching,
throwing his fastball from different angles, then busting his
curveball for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they come?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told they came,'' his questioner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who told you that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the broadcasters from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are here,'' he said. ``Now that you told me who told
you, we're even.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he was way ahead.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque didn't appear awed by the World Series. He had seen it
in Cuba on television. When his half-brother, Livan Hernandez,
pitched the Florida Marlins to the World Series title a year ago,
he watched the games in the CNN studios in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if, as a member of Cuba's national team, he
had ever pitched in a game similar to the magnitude of the Series,
his calm was there again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've pitched in three World championships, one
Olympics, also various other tournaments I don't remember,'' he
said through his interpreter, Leonardo Astacio. ``And in Cuba, I
pitched in many league championships and national titles, I don't
know if you could compare them to the magnitude of the World
Series, but they're pretty big.''
</P>
<P>
   And when El Duque was asked if he ever surprised himself when
pitching, his calm was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really surprise myself on the mound,'' he replied.
``Because if I did it, then there's no reason for me to be
surprised because it's something I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre called it a calm, but Brian Cashman, the Yankee general
manager, called it something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought El Duque into camp, he had a presence about
him even then,'' Cashman said, ``I remember Joe Torre watched him
throw in the outfield and he told me, `This guy is intriguing.'''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque had already intrigued Lin Garrett, the Yankee scouting
director, when put on display for scouts in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lin told me, `You've got to get this guy, he can be our No. 3
starter this year,''' Cashman recalled. ``Anaheim and Cleveland
also were after him. Anaheim's offer supposedly included a movie
deal. Cleveland was offering good money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's offer was between $2 million and $3 million, but the
Yankees put together a four-year $6.6 million offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some scouts for other clubs didn't think El Duque had enough
fastball and they also wondered about his age,'' Cashman said.
``The way we figured it, if he signed with us, he's 28. If he
signed with somebody else, he's got wooden teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever El Duque's age, whatever his teeth, whatever
happens in the first inning, it's his calm that the Yankees like
best.

POSADA BOUND TO HERNANDEZ BY TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jorge Posada has been 60 feet 6 inches away from the
incredibly unfolding story of Orlando Hernandez all season.
Virtually every time Hernandez has hiked his left knee up around
his ear in his funky motion, Posada has been behind the plate
waiting to see what will transpire. Usually, Hernandez has produced
positive developments.
</P>
<P>
   The tandem worked splendidly again on Sunday night as Posada
belted a two-run homer and Hernandez followed the catcher's signals
to guide the Yankees to a 9-3 triumph over the San Diego Padres in
Game 2 of the World Series. Manager Joe Torre selected Hernandez to
give David Cone two extra days of rest before Game 3, but the
manager also did it because he trusts the Cuban pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Posada has trusted the pitcher known as El Duque since he
debuted with the team in June. From his amazing pitches to his
amazing poise, Hernandez has made Posada and everyone else
understand how dominant a pitcher he can be. But it took Hernandez
a little longer to show trust in Posada or any other Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to him and what he went through because my father
went through it,'' said Posada, whose father, Jorge Sr., left Cuba
for Puerto Rico. ``My Dad is Cuban. I know it's tough for him. In
the beginning, he didn't know what to do. It was tough so I tried
to help him. I tried to help him in every way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Hernandez did not need much help. He stopped
the Padres on one run and six hits, striking out seven in seven
innings. He is 2-0 with a 0.64 earned run average in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Posada if Hernandez had his best stuff,
the catcher said, ``What do you think?'' It was obvious what Posada
thought and it was obvious that Hernandez had a neat repertory,
including a strong fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres did not seem to be able to see his pitches sometimes
and looked lost against El Duque. ``That's pretty much the same El
Duque we have seen all season,'' said Joe Girardi, who caught
Hernandez twice during the regular season. ``People call him a
young pitcher, but he's not a young pitcher. When you pitch over
there, you're pitching for your life.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees leading, 7-1, in the fifth, Posada batted with
one out and Scott Brosius on first. The fans at the Stadium were
satisfied yet subdued because the Yankees seemingly had enough
offense to complete the night. But Posada turned the hysteria up a
little bit more by drilling a ball over the center field fence off
Brian Boehringer to extend the lead to 9-1. It was his second homer
of the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   While it was overlooked because Chuck Knoblauch blasted a
three-run homer and Tino Martinez had a grand slam, Posada started
the seven-run eruption in the seventh inning of Game 1 with a sharp
one-out single to right field. The inning that Posada initiated
helped ruin the Padres on Saturday and then he called the pitches
that helped destroy them on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten some clutch hits when we needed them,'' said
Posada. ``Hopefully, we can keep scoring and get as many runs as we
need to get in the next two games.'' &QL;

SEVEN-INNING STRETCH COULD BE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not the kind of stat you normally employ to
capture the essence of a baseball game, but let the record show
that by the middle of the Yankee fifth Sunday night the Bronx
Bombers were 17 for 28.
</P>
<P>
   That's 17 for 28, as in 17 of the first 28 batters reaching
base, 14 of them with base hits.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to go back to the seventh inning of Game 1,
you're looking at 10 of the last 16 men to bat reaching base in
that one. That makes 27 of 44 in a seven-inning stretch, and that
is staggering.
</P>
<P>
   During those seven innings, the end of one game and the
beginning of another could pretty much be summed up by noting that
San Diego pitchers would throw the ball and Yankee batters would
hit it _ often for long distances. You needn't be going for that
doctorate in Diamondology to realize that we were not witnessing so
much a World Series as we were a World's Slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   If this were basketball or hockey, Sunday night's 9-3 Yankee
victory signified the end of this series. I could state
categorically that the Yankee fans had seen their heroes in the
flesh for the last time in 1998. Those other sports have very much
to do with emotion, and when a team is humiliated twice in
succession it does not come back. But baseball is different.
Sterling Hitchcock could pitch a fourth consecutive strong game in
the postseason (notice I said ``could''), and Kevin Brown, feeling
good once again after being infused with antibiotics, could be
Kevin Brown, and that could mean we'll be back here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I don't believe any of it. I am going to state
categorically that the Padres have seen New York for the last time
in the 1998 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   If the Padres are coming back here, it will be to see ``The Lion
King,'' and they'll be flying here on their own. The Yankees won
two series without hitting very much. The bats are alive now. They
might lose one out there on the Left Coast, but they're not losing
two. This really is their year. I mean, how obvious can it be?
</P>
<P>
   And if you doubt that, consider the plight of the San Diego
pitching staff, which apparently has been hit with some sort of flu
bug, in addition to an ill-timed pollen situation for Brown, whose
physical weakness in Game 1 was attributed to a severe sinus
infection.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Bruce Bochy, Sunday night's starter Andy
Ashby was not his normal self because of some sort of flu deal.
Bochy also said that Game 3 starter Hitchcock ``had a touch'' of
this bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who our hosts are,'' said Bochy with a sigh.
``This timing is very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be some question as to whether we are seeing
the ``real'' Padres, what with the aforementioned problem with the
health of the starters and the general collapse of the setup men.
But there also appears to be no question that we are now starting
to see the ``real'' Yankees, the team that won 114 games during the
regular season before stumbling past both Texas and Cleveland,
especially in terms of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say offense? The Yankees have scored 18 runs in two
games, and the production has been spread throughout the order.
Ready for this? The Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 men in the Yankee order have
hit .500 (14 for 28) with seven runs scored and six runs batted in
during Games 1 and 2. Contrast that to the lineup submitted by Red
Sox manager Jimy Williams in the Indians series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really surprised to see that type of production,''
said Yankees skipper Joe Torre. ``If anything, I was more surprised
when we didn't hit in the first two series, even though the
pitching was pretty good. We weren't swinging the bats nice and
loose against Texas, the way we are now. Hitting is contagious.
When you're not going well, people put too much pressure on
themselves. But when you're going well, and everyone is swinging
the bat pretty well, relaxation means a lot there.''
</P>
<P>
   It starts at the top of the order, where Chuck Knoblauch, his
three-run homer in Game 1 notwithstanding, is once again playing
like the ``real'' Chuck Knoblauch. In the first two games of this
series, he has been on base seven times. ``When we got him as a
leadoff man,'' said Torre, ``this is what we anticipated. It makes
a real big difference on our club when he is able to get on base
that often.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 innings, getting runners has not been a problem.
The Yankees are, shall we say, Yankeeizing. They are running deep
counts and they are frustrating pitchers with their plate
discipline. They have hurt the Padres from every spot in the order,
getting home runs from a leadoff man, a cleanup hitter (Bernie
Williams) and a catcher who bats eighth (Jorge Posada), as well as
from a man who (Tino Martinez) who is back from The Land of the
Batting Dead with a grand slam and three solid hits in his last six
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are once again the complete package. They are the
clear Team of Destiny. Sorry, Bostonians. Don't fight them. Don't
hate them. Admire them. This is the way to play the game.
</P>

HERNANDEZ LEAVES PADRES BOTH IMPRESSED AND FRUSTRATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost everyone in a somber San Diego Padres
clubhouse seemed impressed with Orlando Hernandez on Sunday night.
Almost everyone except Wally Joyner, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner just seemed frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean he's a great pitcher and all,'' Joyner said after the
Padres had lost Game 2 of the World Series to the Yankees, 9-3.
``But I hit a line drive that Paul O'Neill caught to keep me from
getting extra bases, and I hit a hard grounder that Chuck Knoblauch
caught to keep me from getting a hit. Why should he impress me?''
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez impressed everybody else in his seven innings, as
he gave up just one run on six hits and helped give the Yankees a
2-0 lead in the series. He left most of the Padres longing for
home.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, who singled on the first pitch he saw from Hernandez
but did not get a hit against him in two more at-bats, said that
the pitcher's composure was what struck him most.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look rattled,'' said Gwynn, perhaps the finest
student of pitchers in the game. ``He got ahead. He changed speeds.
And there were the little subtle things, like how he moved from one
side of the rubber to the other. But you hope the next time you
face him, you have a 0-0 game instead of 6-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was referring to the six-run lead the Yankees had after
two innings. And things might have been drastically different had
O'Neill not made a leaping catch at the right field fence of
Joyner's drive with two on and two out in the top of the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it had a chance to go out,'' Joyner said. ``But it
had topspin, so I don't think it would have gone out.''
</P>
<P>
   If it had, the Padres would have had a 3-0 lead. Instead, the
Yankees jumped out to their big lead against Andy Ashby, and the
Padres never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Padre hitters talked about all the angles from
which Hernandez threw and about his ability to hit the spots he
wanted to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be more comfortable the next time we face him,''
said Greg Vaughn, who popped out to short with the bases loaded in
the seventh as Hernandez's last batter of the night.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the Padres win a couple of games in San Diego, where
Games 4, 5 and 6 will be played beginning Tuesday night, they will
not get that chance again. At least not this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres did not seem like a very confident team as they
prepared to board their charter back to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   After previous tough losses in the first two rounds of this
post-season, the music in their clubhouse would be blaring _ almost
as if the Padres were saying they had nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's Game 1 loss, for example, the Ohio Players'
1970s hit ``Love Rollercoaster'' was playing. On Sunday night,
however, there was silence from the stereos, and the San Diego
players speaking in muted tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they packed all their boxes because we were hitting
the road,'' San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy said. ``They'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But without two victories out West, the Padres _ who
have had such a great post-season thus far _ will also be staying
put at home.

YANKEES APPEAR PRIMED TO PUT SIGNATURE ON SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One inning is all it took for the Padres to feel the
weight of one of baseball's best teams ever to come bearing down on
them.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not even begin to address the extra help the
Yankees got Sunday night during their Game 2 rout of the Padres
from the adoring but not-quite-so-adorable fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed a little pressing,'' Padre third baseman Ken Caminiti
said after the 9-3 drubbing that makes a return to Gotham this
month seem less than likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard in this stadium. The crowd is on you all the time,
telling you you stink, or worse. They really work with their team.
The whole stadium is built right on you. Sometimes you don't hear
the crowd. Today I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they had a chance to save face, the Padres were shown up
for near imposters Sunday. Their misdeeds and shortcomings were
exposed by the Yankees as if the Padres had been caught on some
embarrassing, hidden camera.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the first, a Cuban refugee pitcher named Orlando
``El Duque'' Hernandez took the mound at Yankee Stadium and
promptly worked his sneaky magic past the meek and flailing Padre
batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what he had,'' Yankee catcher Jorge Posada said.
``Strike one. Strike two. Fastball. Change. It was a lineup full of
lefties, and he came at them basically with instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the pressure of pitching in the World Series for a man
who has pitched in front of Castro?
</P>
<P>
   And then, once Hernandez showed the Padres that their hits would
have to be well-earned against him, the Yankee hitters took over.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff man Chuck Knoblauch began the first inning against Andy
Ashby with an at-bat that seemed like Knoblauch was looking for the
keys to enlightenment. He fouled off pitch after pitch, working
Ashby like he wanted to break him.
</P>
<P>
   And when Knoblauch popped a foul back behind the plate, Padre
catcher Gary Myers twisted and turned and fell to the ground as he
hit the wall. The ball popped out of his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was still alive, working a walk that let him serve as
Yankee CIA agent. Everything Ashby had (no heat at all on the
inside corner), Knoblauch was able to share with his teammates. The
Yankees used everything Knoblauch learned in that first at-bat to
totally decode Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   And as Ashby sputtered, Myers flopped and Caminiti dove and
rolled and overthrew first base in that fateful first inning,
allowing the third and last of the Yankees' first-inning runs to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 was over and done before El Duque took the mound in the
top of the second.
</P>
<P>
   This could be one World Series in which it might be wise to
forget what the great Yankee Yogi Berra once said about it never
being over 'till it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Padres got here the hard way, bashing away against
the odds, against their infamous history _ Roseanne and the anthem
is all you need to know of that _ by winning the National League
West. They dumped on poor Randy Johnson and the Houston Astros in
the Division Series, and then, in a final blaze of self-possession
and clutch pitching, the Padres knocked off that
never-quite-a-dynasty team from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the hard part, especially since the Yankees have
officially awakened the juggernaut within. If anything, Game 2
widened the margin between the 114-win Yanks and Padres. Made it a
chasm.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Yankees' 16-hit explosion Sunday should re-open our
eyes to the distinct possibility that this 1998 Yankee club truly
is something special.
</P>
<P>
   All season, this club was cruising on waters barely chartered,
since the ambition to prove themselves a near flawless baseball
team put them two wins away from the all-time record of 116 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if this pelting of the Padres continues unabated, it will
be a fitting end to a sterling season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a 20-game lead on the Boston Red Sox at one point and
we did not let up. This shouldn't be any different,'' first baseman
Tino Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us had the pleasure of witnessing the exploits of the '27
Yankees. Murderer's Row is the stuff you read about in grand old
fussy prose or see in grainy film or photo reproductions _ all
detailing how Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig made Yankee baseball a
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Yankees of the Joe DiMaggio years, when the
Yankee Clipper brought class and Fall Classics to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the smashing '70s, when Reggie Jackson was
stirring the drink and blasting home runs by the fistful to bring
more jewels and crowns to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   What these '98 Yankees seem capable of accomplishing now, should
this march toward destiny continue, is engrave themselves on the
Yankee timeline of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   When Posada homered Sunday, pushing the Yankee lead to 9-1 in
the fifth inning, the he underscored the recurring theme of this
squad. There are no superstars. There are no heros. There is no
single player in whom these '98 Yanks solely depend.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, watching Knoblauch and Scott Brosius snare sharp
grounders with such aggressiveness, throwing to first without
missing a beat, made it feel like the Yankees were cranking into
machine-like efficiency. They have surely built a head of steam and
confidence that should let them finish this strike against the
Padres cleanly, surgically.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not, if for some Bermuda Triangle reason these
Yankees fail to make good on this powerful 2-0 lead, their failure
would surely be one of the greatest disappointments of all time.
They are that good, at least according to what they have
demonstrated in 114 wins this summer.

YANKEES TAKE 2-0 SERIES EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
 SERIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time the New York Yankees swept a World
Series, the clinching game was pitched by a 21-year-old rookie,
Whitey Ford, who grew up just across the Triboro Bridge from Yankee
Stadium, in Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1950, 48 years ago, when Joe DiMaggio was still in
center field, not in a Florida hospital ward.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees have swept nothin' yet, though they had that
unmistakable look Sunday night with another rookie on the mound,
29-year-old Orlando Hernandez, who had to cross shark-infested
waters from Cuba to get here.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees made Hernandez's course far less perilous Sunday
night, scoring early and often and banging out 16 hits in a 9-3 win
in Game 2 against the San Diego Padres, who so far appear to be
little more than a speed bump on the Yankees' fast track to
history.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees, who had hits from every starter, try to add a
final exclamation point to their campaign for best-team-ever
status, the Padres, who never recovered from a first-inning
throwing error by third baseman Ken Caminiti, might also want to
turn to their postseason past, however slim, for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days when their uniforms were mustard-and-brown and
Tony Gwynn was (almost) skinny, the Padres of 1984 made an even
worse spectacle of themselves in Chicago, losing their first-ever
postseason game, 13-0, to the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   When they also lost the second game in Wrigley Field, they were
dismissed from coast to coast as just another short-lived fad from
Southern California. But the Padres won the next three games to
eliminate the Cubs, who were last seen piling into a cab for
Tijuana while the Padres went to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Can that happen again against the Yankees? The wise guys _ and
we're not talking about the bleacherites who were chanting ``Padres
(expletive)'' almost from the first pitch _ would say not a chance,
based on the early returns.
</P>
<P>
   But Yankees manager Joe Torre isn't assuming anything, and he
can draw on experience, too. Just two years ago, the Yankees lost
the first two games to the Braves, at home, by a combined score of
16-1, and roared back to win the next four.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' Torre said, when asked if memories of
the '96 Series preclude any premature giddiness. ``And the fact we
won so many games this year, I heard so many questions about the
lead we had, blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys play one game at a time. That's a good feeling, on
my part, knowing they want to win every single game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And believe me, the San Diego Padres are a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't look like one Sunday night. The Yankees manhandled
Andy Ashby, who may not be a household name outside of Pittston,
Pa., where he lives, but actually was one of the better pitchers in
the National League this year, a winner of 17 games in the regular
season who held the Braves to just three earned runs in 13 innings
in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was in trouble from the moment his batterymate, catcher
Greg Myers, was unable to hold onto a popup near the screen by
Yankee leadoff man Chuck Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   No error was charged on Myers's attempt to make a catch while
sliding on his knees, but Knoblauch exploited the reprieve by
drawing a walk, stealing second, then scoring when Caminiti threw
one over the head of first baseman Wally Joyner for an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make an error in the first inning, a bad defensive play on
my part,'' said Caminiti, the team's best gloveman, ``you just hope
that it gets turned around, and tonight it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it snowballed for the Padres, who made just one error
in six games against the Braves. Bernie Williams tapped back to the
mound for the second out, but Chili Davis dribbled a grounder up
the middle to score Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez kicked up chalk
with his line single to right, and Scott Brosius singled through
the left side, scoring Davis to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Ashby was taken deep into the count by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no chance to get myself in any rhythm,'' Ashby said,
``because I was erratic, I was always falling behind hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees doubled that lead in the second when improbable
scene-stealer Ricky Ledee singled to right and Knoblauch beat out
an infield hit, a ground ball that struck a diving Caminiti on the
wrist of his glove hand. Ledee was tossed out after oversliding
third on the front end of a double steal, but Derek Jeter singled
home Knoblauch and scored ahead of Williams's home run into the
right-center-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Two more singles and a double by Ledee, the rookie leftfielder,
made it 7-0. Jorge Posada's two-run home run in the fifth finished
the Yankee scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, meanwhile, survived a first-inning scare, just as he
had in the ALCS against Cleveland, when O'Neill made a terrific
leaping catch against the right-field fence with two out and two
on.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Indians, Jim Thome's bid for a three-run home run
had died on the track, and Hernandez, with relief help, went on to
shut out the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were spared that indignity when they scored in the
fifth on a two-out triple by Chris Gomez and a broken-bat flare
double by Quilvio Veras over the head of first baseman Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez, the fifth Cuban to pitch in the World Series and
first from the American League since Luis Tiant for the Red Sox in
1975, was as dominant as his younger brother Livan, Series MVP last
fall when the expansion Marlins won.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out seven, walked three, and allowed six hits
in seven innings. Wielding a Costa Rican cigar after the game,
Hernandez said his little brother couldn't go because he had
``other obligations, like card shows,'' but they talked on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I think about my family,'' he said. ``Every day I
think about my friends, and about baseball, too. Believe me, I'm
thinking with my heart.''

US MEN'S EIGHT IS A LOCK 
</HEADLINE>
 OF CHARLES REGATTA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After the disappointments of the Olympic Games in
Atlanta two years ago, the US rowing program regrouped with a host
of new faces led by coach Mike Teti, and in Sunday's 34th Head of
the Charles Regatta before approximately 150,000 the men's eight
rowed to a second consecutive victory and showed why it has won the
World Championships the past two years in France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the unseasonably warm conditions became less inviting
for the competitors as the afternoon wore on, the US national team,
rowing with a new stroke, 1997 Harvard captain Wolf Moser of
Moultonboro, N.H., rowed virtually uncontested to win in 14:09.65.
It fell short of last year's record of 13:58.09.
</P>
<P>
   It was a splendid day to be a spectator on the banks of the
Charles River, and many basked in the sunshine and watched the
races of the world's largest regatta, which now stretches over two
days. After monsoon-like conditions blew away the entire event two
years ago, executive director Fred Schoch and the committee
deserved a day like this.
</P>
<P>
   The US men's eight has been coxed to its two World Championships
by Pete Cippilone out of Cal-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hit with a tailwind right around the final turn,'' he
said of the race that began by the Boston University Boathouse,
which is scheduled for demolition to make room for a new $5.8
million facility. ``We were hit by the wind at the Anderson Bridge,
so we just concentrated on moving the boat out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were a little bumpy. From an execution
standpoint, we really came nicely up the line. I thought that was
really good. We played it a little conservatively around Magazine
Beach (where they launched from) as far as not driving into the
buoys. We just concentrated on getting some good rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser, who rowed in the World Championships in the coxed fours
the last two years, is part of the national camp that trains out of
Princeton, N.J., where Teti coached for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mixed the boats in the early part of the summer, trying
to figure out the best combinations,'' said Moser. He rowed in all
kinds of weather in his years at Harvard on this river.
``Conditions weren't that bad,'' he said. ``There was a little
chop, the wind was swirling a little bit. They weren't fast
conditions, but they weren't that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have been a considerable presence in this regatta that
takes a twisting course under its seven bridges before the finish
line just shy of the Northeastern Boathouse. The Canadian women's
eight, which set the course record of 15:44.17 a year ago, was
beaten by the Danish Rowing Federation in 15:44.66. The Canadians
trailed in 15:50.48 and the US national team was third in 16:18.28.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same crew that finished third in the World
Championship in Cologne. It is coached by Al Morrow, who didn't
make the trip. The competitors train in two camps in Vancouver and
in London, Ontario, and their season is short. The constant is
coxswain Leslie Thompson, who first signed on in 1980 when the
Canadians joined the US boycott of the Olympic Games in Moscow and
she has been a part of the team for five Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a pretty good year so far,'' said Thompson. ``This
is our final regatta. We like the long head races. We like to find
ourselves a really challenging course where we can be a little
aggressive. We come down here, row very hard, and see what happens.
We like it here because you always have it in the back of your mind
you have someone there to push you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good race today, nice and aggressive. It was a
headwind coming into the finish line. I personally felt a little
better on the turns than I did last year. We didn't have a
tailwind, though, and it's kind of hard to break a course record
these days without a tailwind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danes were competing in their first race ever, having rowed
together only nine times. Not only that, but the women are all new
to sweep, in which each rower uses one oar instead of two, having
come from backgrounds in sculling.
</P>
<P>
   The men's eight from the US Naval Academy was seeded eighth
because of an act of unselfishness a year ago, and finished 16th.
They'd stopped to help a Wisconsin oarsman who was in trouble after
the Badgers boat turned over with about 2 miles to go. The
Midshipmen put aside their game plan to respond. ``There was about
5 feet of open water between our bow and their stern,'' recalled
coxswain Brett O'Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going around the buoys pretty hard, so I was watching
the port side. I saw their boat tip over. I had everyone stop. I
had the port side hold water so the bow would go to the side. If we
hadn't stopped our bow ball would have basically (hit) his head. It
could have gotten ugly. He went around to the side, went under a
couple of riggers, and one of our guys grabbed him and held onto
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to let go, but I grabbed him. He was fine for a little
while. The boats were now coming around the corner. He'd already
been hit. He started crawling around out stern, and then swam to
shore. We were stuck in the middle of the race course, so we
finished and told them to get a launch down there. Today? It was
uneventful.''

BLOWOUT IN BRONX GIVES YANKS 2-0 SERIES LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was time for Brian Boehringer by the third inning
Sunday night, and the New York Yankees know what that can mean.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of the 1996 World Series, when Boehringer was
pitching for New York, Manager Joe Torre called for him in the
third inning with the Yankees trailing by five runs. They would go
on to be blown out by the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer now pitches for the San Diego Padres, and he got the
call in the third inning of Game 2 of the World Series Sunday, with
San Diego trailing by seven runs. The Yankees' scoring outburst was
almost over, but they'd done enough damage by then to ensure their
eventual 9-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are wise enough to know another truth that came out
of that opening game two years ago. After losing 12-1 that night
and 4-0 in Game 2, the Yankees looked finished. But New York won
the next four games to capture an improbable World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Padres, trailing 2-0, capable of the same thing? They
may have history on their side. The Yankees have scored 18 runs so
far, and only one team in history has scored more runs in winning
the first two games of a Series. But that club, the 1956 Brooklyn
Dodgers, lost the Series in seven.
</P>
<P>
   All of which lends some credence to what the Padres said as they
packed for their flight to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not say never with this team, or any team I play on,''
said Padres third baseman Ken Caminiti. ``I believe we're going to
win. You have to believe, I don't care how good they are. If you
don't believe in your heart you can win, you're a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   But Game 2 may have been the last home game in a season that
attracted more fans to Yankee Stadium than any other. The 56,692 on
hand Sunday were merry, if a little bored by the 9-1 lead their
heroes held after five.
</P>
<P>
   In piling on the Padres, the New York fans were only following
their team. In the third inning, the stadium scoreboard noted that
the Yankees had 113 all-time World Series wins, while the Padres
had only one.
</P>
<P>
   In notching World Series win No. 114, the Yankees encountered a
familiar figure: Their 114 regular-season wins set an American
League record and have caused many to call them the greatest team
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win these two games before we can consider
ourselves the greatest,'' said designated hitter Chili Davis. ``And
even then, there will be some doubts. I don't think we care about
being the greatest. In spring training, all we wanted was to be in
the position we're in now.''
</P>
<P>
   They got to that position in a hurry, with 10 hits and seven
runs in 22/3 innings off Padres starter Andy Ashby. At one point,
six of seven Yankees singled, and New York also was aided by a rare
throwing error from the strong-armed Caminiti. But the singles were
stung _ even some of Ashby's outs were hit hard _ and a big blast
seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It came from Bernie Williams on what could have been Ashby's
last pitch of the second. But with a runner on first, two outs and
a 3-and-2 count, Ashby left a sinker up in the strike zone and
Williams took him over the wall in right-center, giving the Yankees
a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was typical of the way things are going for San
Diego. In Game 1, reliever Mark Langston nearly escaped the seventh
with a 5-5 tie when his 2-2 pitch came in just below the knees of
Tino Martinez for ball three. The next pitch landed in the third
deck for a decisive grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Williams' homer landed just out of reach for center
fielder Steve Finley. An inning earlier, a would-be three-run homer
by the Padres' Wally Joyner had landed just within reach for a
leaping Paul O'Neill, who caught it for the final out to help the
victorious Orlando Hernandez escape harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have given them a 3-0 lead right off the bat,''
Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said of Joyner's drive. ``We kind of
settled down after that.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to be about time. After scoring just nine runs in
the Division Series against Texas and batting .218 in the second
round against Cleveland, the Yankees, who led the majors in runs
this year, are pounding Padre pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we were swinging the bats as loose (in the
playoffs) as we are now,'' Torre said. ``It is sort of catchy. When
you are not hitting, that is catchy also, unfortunately, because
somebody tries to pick up the slack for the other guy. But when
everybody is swinging the bat well, relaxation means a lot here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees know they can't relax too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum can swing quick in the Series,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn acknowledged it's tough to beat
the Yankees when they score nine runs a game, and noted that New
York's Game 3 pitcher, David Cone, is another challenge. But in
assessing the Padres' chances, Gwynn sounded vaguely like a Hall of
Fame catcher who called Yankee Stadium home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win four of the next five,'' Gwynn said.
``Obviously it's going to be difficult, but it's not impossible. It
can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   It ain't over ...

PARCELLS AGAIN THE LURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ On Wednesday, Bill Parcells was in such a
funk that his voice at times barely could be heard. The Jets coach
once again had benched a quarterback, creating a situation so
familiar with Parcells, unhappiness with a quarterback. Has a
quarterback ever lived who would satisfy Parcells for more than a
play or a game or a week or Super Bowl or two?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him well enough yet,'' Vinny Testaverde, the
latest Jets quarterback, said in true candor about the QB carousel
in New York. ``I haven't been around Coach Parcells long enough to
know what his decisions will be.''
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells signed Testaverde, the coach told the QB that the
player who best gave the Jets a chance to win would play. Parcells
was envisioning that Testaverde might become another Jim Plunkett,
a beaten-down veteran but a gifted passer, the coach hoping to
repeat old pal Al Davis's trust in a veteran that revived Plunkett
and led the Raiders to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But in elevating Testaverde, Parcells benched Glenn Foley, the
QB who forever won a fond spot in Parcells's heart _ not to mention
the starting job _ by jumping off the bench in the second half last
October and virtually single-handedly bringing the Jets from behind
at Giants Stadium against the Patriots, Bob Kraft's Patriots. That
one half of football, that sweet defeat of Kraft's Patriots, was
the cause as much as anything of last year's QB turmoil on the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Parcells said he had looked at the tapes of the
Patriots-Chiefs game and said if New England played that way Monday
night against his Jets, ``I don't know if we can beat them; I don't
know if anybody can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, the coach reportedly walked off the practice
field in disgust after he saw general ineptitude and tight end Kyle
Brady jumping offside once too often. For almost an hour, the New
York media reported, the Jets were left to practice without
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   If a conclusion can be made about the three days, it may only be
this: This Patriots thing is very, very, very personal with
Parcells. They have been called the New York Jets for 35 years, but
for the last two they might as well have been dubbed, ``Bill
Parcells's Jets.'' It is his team and his way, but standing in his
way is the team he saved from ridicule and brought to the Super
Bowl, Bob Kraft's Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Seven former Patriots are in the New York locker room, some
brought there by Parcells as much to wound New England as to help
New York, and now the Patriots are the foe for the Jets. Meanwhile,
that corner of the locker room where Foley and Testaverde dress,
their lockers separated only by Ray Lucas _ yes, a former Patriot _
was in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   As if we didn't surmise, turmoil just before a Jets-Patriots
game.
</P>
<P>
   Every button was pushed last week by Parcells, the button-pusher
of all button-pushers, to get his team ready for a game it
absolutely cannot lose. If the Jets lose this game, they will be
three games behind the Patriots and the New York season of 1998 may
become the 1995 season of Parcells's Patriots _ a disaster made all
the more a disaster because so much had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a division game and they're already ahead of us,''
Parcells said of this Monday Nighter against the Patriots. Unlike
last week, when the Jets collapsed against a Rams team in St. Louis
``where we hadn't played and against a team we didn't know too
well,'' the opponent Monday night is all too well known to all.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened last week in St. Louis truly annoyed and irked
Parcells, and perhaps it might have been a reality check as well,
that this Jets team just may not be that good. He had warned his
Jets about the Rams, and his warnings brought no results.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the best teams I've had,'' said Parcells, ``when I would
warn them about a team like the Rams, they would just go out and
beat the (expletive) out of that team. And then the players would
tell me, `We told you that team wasn't any good.' It was like that
on the best teams we had ... if we'd warn them about a team and
those bad things would happen, players would say, `You know, he was
right.' And they'd respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, though, didn't respond to Parcells's warnings, folding
instead.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Parcells _ warnings notwithstanding _ had sent a
signal to his team that St. Louis could be beaten without New
York's best. Parcells, after all, did not dress Curtis Martin for
the game because of Martin's thigh bruise even though Martin
reportedly could have played in a more crucial game, such as the
playoffs. So Martin was saved for the Patriots ... ah, coaches can
have obsessions, too.
</P>
<P>
   So the next button had to be pushed, perhaps the last button _
walking off the practice field and leaving Pepper Johnson to run
the team. For sure, the Jets won't be lackadaisical Monday night
against New England, but the more pertinent question might be
whether they'll be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells pointedly noted that it was as much his veterans, as
well as the youngsters, who didn't respond last week. Keith Byars
was among those veterans who received special mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a good week to be asking about some of
these veterans,'' said Parcells when asked about the play of Byars.
``They didn't play too well last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is all-too-familiar Parcells terrain. The needle
is often out, Parcells pricking the hides of players he knows
respond to such motivation. What seemed overwhelming to Parcells,
though, was that his warnings accomplished nothing in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' said Byars, the former Patriot, when asked if he
had noticed any subtle changes in Parcells from the year away from
the coach. ``He's still grumpy when you lose and happy when you win
and that's the way it should be. When you lose, that'll stick with
you all the way till your next game and you can do something about
it. When you start taking losses too easily, something's wrong and
it's time for you to get into another profession. And I haven't
seen that side of Bill change one iota.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars said he certainly doesn't expect that to ever change with
Parcells ``because if he feels that's going to change, then he
knows he's got to hang 'em up. It's the same way with a player ...
we lose on Sunday and I want to play on Tuesday to get back in the
`W' column and Bill's the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in New England, Bob Kraft might be the first to point out
that Bill Parcells ``has been shopping for the groceries'' _ that
now-infamous phrase from Parcells's farewell press conference in
Foxborough _ in New York for two years now, and he still may not
have a quarterback. And no team gets to a Super Bowl without a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, not really,'' said Mike Gisler, the new Jet and former
Patriot, when asked if he had discerned any change in Parcells in
the one year away from the coach. ``He's basically very similar ...
just a change of address. He's still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Still quarreling with his quarterback, still pushing buttons,
still needling, still a coach who will do anything so that his team
will win, still with an ego, still one of the more fascinating
coaches ever seen, in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   This is even more fascinating than last year, for it has been
true point and counterpoint between Parcells's Jets and Kraft's
Patriots, check and checkmate. ``I don't know why so much was made
of last year's game,'' Parcells tried to spin. ``I really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Parcells has taken Curtis Martin from New
England, in an attempt to wound Kraft either in his wallet or on
the field, but the Patriots have taken more draft choices from the
Jets. Even more can be made of this game than Tuna Bowl I because
so much more than egos and obsessions are riding on it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Jets have a season and whether Bill Parcells's path
is heading toward the Super Bowl _ or away from it _ might be
decided Monday night before 60,000 maniacal fans, fans Parcells
himself brought back to what was once a virtually empty Foxboro
Stadium. The football gods are chuckling over their devilish
handiwork.

BRUINS TAKE TEETH OUT OF SHARK ATTACK

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Bruins reached the halfway mark of their
six-game trip out West Sunday night by crushing the Sharks at San
Jose Arena, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third shutout in the last four games for Boston,
which is 3-1-1 overall and 2-1-0 on this journey that continues
Monday night in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Rob Tallas, who was given his first start of the
season, earned his third career shutout with 22 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Khristich and Sergei Samsonov each had a goal and an
assist to pace the Bruins' attack against a Shark team that hadn't
played in a week because of its two-game trip to Japan. San Jose
looked seriously jet-lagged in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins posed big problems for the Sharks early on. Less than
three minutes in, Boston jumped out to a 1-0 lead. Don Sweeney
dished a backhand pass through San Jose defenseman Scott Hannan
down to Peter Ferraro. He fired the puck past goalie Mike Vernon
from the low edge of the left circle at 2:52. It was Ferraro's
first tally of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov earned his second goal of the season at 16:34, boosting
Boston's advantage to 2-0. Khristich made a terrific play to set up
Samsonov, after a give-and-go between the two that started at the
other end of the ice. Khristich took off down the left-wing boards,
pulled up, then waited as Samsonov scooted down the middle toward
the net.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich then threaded a perfect pass to Samsonov, who fired a
forehand shot past Vernon. It was the second goal for the Bruins on
just four shots.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the second, Sharks coach Darryl Sutter
substituted Steve Shields for Vernon in hopes of shaking some life
into his team. It was the first appearance of the year for Shields,
who had missed most of training camp and all of the preseason with
a broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   Shields didn't fare any better than Vernon had as he surrendered
a goal just 19 seconds in. With the Bruins on the power play,
center Jason Allison dished the puck from the right circle down to
Khristich in front. Khristich got two whacks at it, beating Shields
for the 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins seemed to sit back a bit after building up such a
substantial lead and the Sharks started putting some heat on them.
San Jose outshot Boston, 12-6, in the middle period and at one
point had nine shots to the Bruins' one.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more impressive Sharks was right wing Owen Nolan, who
along with left wing Jeff Friesen, was making his regular-season
debut. Nolan and Friesen were unsigned free agents until late
Friday night when they came to contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter said he wasn't sure how much he was going to be able to
play either of them because he didn't know how well-conditioned
they were going to be after missing all of training camp as well as
the club's first two games in Tokyo. Part of the problem, too, was
that Sutter didn't want them to play too much and risk injury but
the team has very few practice times available as a result of a
road trip to Philly, Chicago, and Dallas for which it departs
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan didn't seem bothered at all by the long layoff. He seemed
to get stronger as the game wore on. He tested Tallas on several
occasions, going hard to the net, but Tallas turned him back.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns elected to alter his lines somewhat as the game
wore on, promoting Ferraro to the second line with Ted Donato and
Steve Heinze and dropping Joe Thornton down to the fourth line with
Ken Baumgartner and Antti Laaksonen.

PATRIOTS MUST AVOID LETDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He held up his left hand and made a motion
to signify precisely the goal of his Patriots teammates in Monday
night's Tuna Bowl III against the Jets at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, mentally, and from a performance viewpoint we
need to be even-keeled, level,'' said Willie Clay. ``No ups. No
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be easier said than done as coach Pete Carroll began
the week by lashing back at Jets (and former Patriots) coach Bill
Parcells for accusing him of overusing Curtis Martin last season.
There was an animated Bruce Armstrong addressing teammates
Thursday, according to vice president of player personnel Bobby
Grier, warning them that Monday night's clash could be a ``trap
game'' because the Patriots had come off such a perfect win over
the Chiefs (40-10) last week, and somehow may lose their intensity.
</P>
<P>
   And, said special teams cover man Larry Whigham, ``I was
probably closer to (former Patriot) Corwin Brown than anybody on
this team ... but I haven't talked to him at all. He's the enemy
now.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly are those Patriots who want to beat the Jets
because of their disdain for their former coach, and those who want
to show Parcells how good they are because of their respect for
him.
</P>
<P>
   But a year removed from their first meeting against Parcells,
some of those emotions are fading.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Patriots are preaching the same message Clay was,
talking about not letting personal feelings enter into the game
against Parcells, as quarterback Drew Bledsoe and others may have
done at times in the two games last year, which the teams split.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's emphatic statement was an indication that he is trying
to level the coaching playing field. If there was a coaching
mismatch last year, the results of this season have seemed to
whittle, and perhaps even erase it. Carroll has not been
outcoached, and in fact has outcoached many of his rivals who have
resumes twice the length of his.
</P>
<P>
   There still is a reluctance to praise the work of Carroll and
his assistants, but if the Patriots can win Monday night, the
second-year coach may get his just due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete has done a great job for this team,'' said cornerback Ty
Law, who will match up against Keyshawn Johnson Monday night.
``He's a great coach. He's had to go through all of this Parcells
stuff and he hasn't let it get to him. We have a team that everyone
respects and the coach has a lot to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said Carroll worked the team extremely hard this week.
``It's been a long, hard week,'' he said. ``It was kind of
draining. Everybody was pretty sore, but we put a lot of emphasis
on different things. Once you win that big, you want to keep on
doing it. Everybody is doing a lot of extra running. So we have to
cool it here for a day or two and get our bodies ready to go
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Law agreed with Clay's assessment of what the Patriots are
trying to achieve and what Armstrong was trying to guard against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to tell you how great we are because of the
way we played against KC,'' he said. ``Everybody is expecting us to
do certain things now. That's why this game can be a trap. So
hopefully we can put that in the back of our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   And those who have been around Parcells know that the gloom and
doom coming from Hempstead, N.Y., this week may have been part
great acting job. At least nobody on the Patriots is buying it,
because there is a purpose to everything Parcells does, and this
week it may have been to lull New England into thinking he was down
on his team.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells even praised Bledsoe, saying, ``This is the best I've
ever seen him play.'' Bledsoe took that with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have good poise as a football team where we can
avoid this type of hype,'' said Bledsoe. ``Bill has always been
able to make a team that has their backs against the wall come out
and play well. We did it for him many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who had a 131.3 quarterback rating last week vs. the
Chiefs, the fourth-highest of his career, hopes for a similar game
against the Jets, in which the Patriots can run when they need to
and pass to get big chunks of yardage. Shawn Jefferson likely will
be featured more, especially because Otis Smith likely will cover
him most, and the Patriots believe he can be beaten deep.
</P>
<P>
   The offense will have to adjust to shifts to the 3-4 defense by
the Jets that will emphasize containment of rookie Robert Edwards.
Parcells surely would love to see his defense stuff Edwards,
especially after the coach tried to hurt the Patriots' running game
by taking Curtis Martin from them.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will be eyeing Martin, both as a runner and
receiver. The Jets have utilized screen passes to Martin extremely
well, enabling him to get going in the open field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding bounce and cutback runner,'' said New
England defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell. ``He can bend it all
the way back on the cutback. In my opinion what he does best is he
gets guys to underestimate his speed and not get him hemmed in and
then he runs away from everybody. You just have to make sure your
techniques are solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Todd Collins will have to be aware of
possible screens, and there's also been an emphasis on defensing
trick plays, which Parcells has been known to use. Most of the time
the plays don't work well, but the Patriots don't want to take
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parcells has a history of checking you out on those things,''
said Sidwell. ``We have been preparing for something different and
unusual that might come up. That's usual preparation for us, but
this week there's a little more emphasis on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell is obviously concerned about the Jets' receivers, and he
said he'll try to get creative with the coverage, hoping to get
help for those covering either Johnson, Wayne Chrebet, or Dedric
Ward, depending on the down and distance.
</P>
<P>
   He's also worried about quarterback Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had some tremendous years and they're 2-0 with him,''
said Sidwell. ``He's a top-flight NFL quarterback and he's proved
that. We anticipate no dropoff in having him in there. Our guys
know we need to get after him and make sure he doesn't hurt us down
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   One area the Jets haven't done much in yet is on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the personnel to be able to break one,'' said
Whigham. ``We're looking for that.''

 FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Call it a bizarro weekend that maybe only the folks
from Seinfeld could appreciate, where the opposite of what should
have happened, happened. How else to explain Rutgers and Temple
winning, on the road no less, Saturday? How else to explain hapless
Northern Illinois finally winning a game?
</P>
<P>
   Temple's win was the most amazing result of the season and
perhaps the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --The game was played at Virginia Tech, and the Owls were 0-26
in Big East road games.
</P>
<P>
   --Virginia Tech, previously unbeaten, seemed to be a legitimate
Top 10 team (ranked 14th).
</P>
<P>
   --Temple trailed by 17 points early in the game against a team
that had the fourth-ranked defense in the country.
</P>
<P>
   --It was Temple's first win over a ranked team in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   --Ten Owls were making their first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   --Temple was using a fourth-string freshman quarterback, Devin
Scott, an 18-year-old who said he was simply ``having fun out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. After throwing a pair of touchdown passes and running
for the winner in a 28-24 victory, Scott was having more fun than
anyone associated with Temple football had had in years.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Corey Moore said it best for the Hokies. ``I've
never been so embarrassed in my life,'' he said. ``I'm
shellshocked. We're the laughingstock of college football right now
and deservedly so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls now get a week off before facing Rutgers in a battle of
teams with one-game winning streaks.
</P>
<P>
   And a word of advice for Virginia Tech officials. Forget about
this homecoming business. The loss to Temple was the second
consecutive year the Hokies have dropped their homecoming game.
Last year, Miami of Ohio beat Frank Beamer's team on homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   At Pittsburgh, Rutgers ended a 13-game road losing streak with a
25-21 win over the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The joy of Temple and Rutgers probably was matched by that of
Northern Illinois, which ended a 23-game losing streak by beating
Central Michigan, 16-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one thing to say,'' said Northern Illinois coach Joe
Novak. ``I will answer all questions about our current winning
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple, Rutgers, and Northern Illinois all winning on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarro.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oregon running back  &UR; Reuben Droughns  &LR; had what seemed to be a
solid afternoon in the Ducks' 41-38 overtime loss to UCLA, picking
up 172 yards rushing. Two problems: Droughns lost three fumbles,
including one that allowed UCLA to set up its last touchdown in
regulation, causing him to go back to the Oregon sideline and
head-butt the bench with his bare head, and X-rays taken
 &UR; yesterday &LR;  on what was thought to be a sprained right ankle
revealed a season-ending broken right fibula ... Wisconsin running
back  &UR; Ron Dayne  &LR; is hitting his stride. In a 37-3 win over
Illinois, Dayne ran for three touchdowns and picked up 190 yards
rushing on 39 carries. It marked the sixth straight game Dayne has
gone over the 100-yard mark. Illinois coach  &UR; Ron Turner  &LR; minced no
words in evaluating his team's performance. ``We didn't block
anybody. We didn't throw. We didn't catch. We didn't do a thing,''
he said. ``The offense stunk. It was totally disgusting.'' Tell us
how you really feel, Ron.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's going on at Ohio State? The Buckeyes are throwing the
ball like a WAC team. In pounding Minnesota, 45-15, Saturday,
Buckeyes quarterback  &UR; Joe Germaine  &LR; passed for two touchdowns and
compiled 339 yards in the air. It marked the first time Germaine
has had back-to-back 300-yard passing games. In addition, wide
receiver  &UR; David Boston  &LR; had 10 catches for 191 yards. Here's how
much things have changed at Ohio State. In 1973, the Buckeyes'
leading receiver was tight end  &UR; Fred Pagac &LR; , who had 10 for the
season ... Now that Temple, Rutgers, and Northern Illinois all have
won, Vanderbilt may have claimed the Most Hapless Team award. After
getting pounded by Georgia, 31-6, Saturday, the Commodores have
lost 11 straight games and 22 straight times in the SEC. Vandy has
not had a winning season since 1982 ... So much for the experts.
Arkansas was picked to finish last in the SEC, but is now 6-0 and
moving up in the polls (15th in the Associated Press rankings). The
Hogs are off to their best start ever in the conference ... Florida
beat Auburn, 24-3, which is no big deal, since everyone is beating
Auburn. But the Gators failed to score a point in the second half,
and that hasn't happened since 1996, which prompted some boos from
the Florida Field fans. Of course, they may be a bit spoiled by 26
consecutive victories at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Got to love Texas Tech coach  &UR; Spike Dykes's  &LR; take on his team's
first loss of the season, a 19-17 decision to Colorado. ``We were
either going to be contenders or pretenders,'' Dykes said. ``So I
guess we were pretenders  &UR; today &LR; . We certainly have a hickey by our
name now.'' Colorado continues to get banged up. The Buffs lost two
more starters _ offensive guard  &UR; Victor Rogers  &LR; and linebacker
 &UR; Albus Brooks &LR;  _ to injuries, which means that 13 first- or
second-team players have missed games because of injuries ...
Things get tougher at Oklahoma, which lost to Missouri, 20-6, for
the first time since 1983. The Sooners (2-4) have scored only three
field goals in their last two games, which is not good news for
embattled coach  &UR; John Blake &LR;  ... Kansas State broke an 88-year-old
school record with its 14th straight victory (against Oklahoma
State). It was also the 44th straight time the Wildcats have beaten
an unranked opponent at home ... Purdue was held to minus-12 yards
rushing against Penn State, which is the fewest rushing yards the
Nittany Lions have allowed since holding Maryland to minus-32 in
1978 ... Go figure: Georgia Tech has scored 40 or more points
against everyone it has played since its opening loss of the season
_ to Boston College ... Tough guy of the week award goes to Tulane
quarterback  &UR; Shaun King &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who played his second consecutive game
with a broken left wrist. All King did was throw three touchdown
passes in a 28-22 win over Louisville. At 5-0, Tulane is off to its
best start in 24 seasons. King is righthanded, in case you were
wondering ... Clemson got pounded by Florida State, 48-0, Saturday,
which should not have come as a surprise. Not only is Clemson
mediocre at best this season, but the Tigers have not scored a
touchdown in games played in Tallahassee this decade ... Kentucky's
39-36 win over LSU was the Wildcats' first against a ranked team on
the road since 1977, when it also beat LSU.

NO OCTOBERFEST FOR BOSTON COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They started out with so much promise, winning their
first three games of the season. But the euphoria Boston College
experienced in September has given way to the cold, sobering
reality of October after three consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who went 0-4 last October, were pushed to the brink
of yet another winless October by Saturday's 42-25 loss to No. 23
Syracuse before 43,413 at Alumni Stadium. It was BC's second
consecutive Big East loss at home after a 17-0 shutout against
Virginia Tech Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   BC, now 3-3 overall and 2-2 in the conference, will host Navy in
a nonconference game Saturday. If they are unable to beat coach Tom
O'Brien's alma mater, the Eagles will be staring down the barrel of
yet another 0-fer October with a tough conference road game at
Miami on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played two good football teams the last two weeks who
were playing well,'' O'Brien said, referring to Virginia Tech's
rock-solid defense that pinned BC with its first shutout since a
21-0 loss to Navy in 1980, and Syracuse's awesome offense, led by
Heisman Trophy candidate Donovan McNabb. He accounted for 220 of
his team's 400 yards of total offense by passing for 182 yards and
a pair of touchdowns and rushing for 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is where we go from here,'' O'Brien said. ``We
have to go back to the old one-game-at-a-time. We've practiced well
the last two weeks and we have to continue to practice well and we
have to focus. The season comes down to the next game against Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our season right now. We've got to concentrate and come
out of that game with a win and be 4-3 going into Miami. That's
what this team needs to do. We've got to start winning some games
in October around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The crossroad the Eagles find themselves at has raised questions
about what direction O'Brien will take with his quarterbacks. Does
he stay the course with senior starter Scott Mutryn or plot a
course for the future with sophomore backup Tim Hasselbeck? Asked
if he believed a change was in order, O'Brien responded with a
terse ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not directly to blame for the Syracuse loss,
Mutryn had another inconsistent performance, completing 11 of 20
passes for 199 yards. He had a 32-yard TD pass to Anthony DiCosmo
that cut Syracuse's lead to 28-18 with 12:51 to go, but was
intercepted by Quentin Harris on a pair of flutter balls.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was considering expanding Hasselbeck's involvement
in the offense, O'Brien said, ``I don't know that yet. Those are
things we have to talk about as a staff and look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy, however, poses a more pressing matter.
</P>
<P>
   With two injured starters in its secondary, BC will have to
prepare this week for a Navy option attack that amassed 680 yards
total offense (515 rushing) in a 42-35 victory Saturday over
Division 1-AA Colgate. The Eagles likely will be without sophomore
cornerback D.J. Sutton, who sprained his right knee and was listed
as questionable Sunday, and junior free safety Pedro Cirino, who
sat out the Syracuse game with a left shoulder burner suffered
against Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost three in a row and we can't have a repeat of last
October when we lost all our games,'' said senior running back Mike
Cloud, who gained 104 yards on 25 carries with a 1-yard TD and
moved into second place on BC's all-time rushing list with 2,837
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come out and start thinking Navy. We definitely
have to start all over again. We have to get in that same frame of
mind that we did against Georgia Tech at the beginning of the
season,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough coming off three losses in a row, but we've got to
be in that same mind frame. I don't know how we're going to do it,
but we've got to get it done this week.''

DAY A COMPLETE SUCCESS FOR ARKANSAS ROWER 
</HEADLINE>
 OF CHARLES-PHILLIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Barnet Phillips finally made it to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Phillips entered the Head of the Charles, two
years ago, the regatta was washed out by a vicious rainstorm. Last
year, the weather cooperated but the Larz Anderson Bridge did not.
Sunday, with no mishaps under the sunny autumn skies, an elated
Phillips finished ninth in the senior veteran singles division of
rowers 70 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better when I got to the 1-mile mark, and even better
when I got to the 2-mile mark, and even better when I got to this
(last) bridge,'' beamed the Fort Smith, Ark., competitor in
recapping his race, the first of the day at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a half mile to go, the 81-year-old started sprinting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tiring at the end,'' he said. ``I was really pulling
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was won for the second year by Ted Sprague, 74, of
Corning, N.Y. In this division, each rower gets 12 seconds deducted
from his time for every year of age over 70; given the handicap,
Sprague barely beat his partner in the double, 78-year-old David
Challinor of Washington, D.C., by 7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the oldest competitors in the regatta, Phillips, a native
of Rye, N.Y., began rowing in the 1930s as an undergraduate at
Yale, then rowed out of the Cambridge Boat Club for a spell after
the Navy sent him to MIT in 1941. He hung up his oars for almost 50
years while he traveled extensively as a sales executive, but found
himself living on the Arkansas River after he retired to Fort
Smith. So, now that he had time on his hands and a river at his
doorstep, he bought a shell and put in a dock.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the amazement of his fellow river navigators, given that
Arkansas is hardly a hotbed of rowing. ``Most of them have never
seen a rowing shell before, so they don't know quite what it is,''
said Phillips, who laughed when asked if he belonged to a boat
club. ``I am the boat club,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he had little chance to be lonely Sunday, given his cheering
squad of 13 family members and a few added friends who variously
watched, ran, skated, or biked along the 3-mile course. ``What a
wonderful excuse for everyone to come together,'' said Maria
O'Donnell of Boston, the oldest granddaughter, as grandpa changed
into his hand-painted and lovingly-autographed Phillips family crew
T-shirt before posing for photos on the porch of the Cambridge Boat
Club, which honored his long-ago membership by lending him a boat
for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Things were a bit more tense last year, when Phillips caught an
oar on the side of the Larz Anderson Bridge and capsized. O'Donnell
saw the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just panicked,'' she remembered, calling, ``Grandpa,
grandpa, grandpa,'' and pleading with him to say he was OK. (When
Phillips's son, Barnet IV, came along seconds later on his bike, he
asked a spectator who tipped. ``Somebody named grandpa,'' he was
told.)
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was not only fine _ also a competitive master's
swimmer, he was having no trouble in the water _ he very much
wanted to just empty his shell and climb back in to finish the
race. But the crew that came to his aid (``A Yale man rescued by a
Harvard boat club,'' he muttered Sunday) wouldn't hear of it, and
his day ended early.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the family held its collective breath as grandpa came
through the same spot. ``Make it under the bridge, make it under
the bridge,'' was all granddaughter Stephanie Muylaert could think.
He did, thanks in part to several days of careful practice last
week, as the grandchildren made a mad dash to the finish line for
the final, proud salute.
</P>
<P>
   With his 12-year-old granddaughter Cricket insisting on carrying
his bag, Phillips left the boat club for a celebratory family
brunch back at the Holiday Inn in Brookline, after which he would
start looking forward to next weekend, when Yale celebrates its
100th anniversary of swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to take your suit and swim instead of
hauling your shell,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot more common in Arkansas.

D.C. ROWER EQUAL TO TASK 
</HEADLINE>
 OF CHARLES-AMENT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Bruce Spitzer struck up a conversation on his
flight from Washington, D.C., the other day with a blind woman who
was with her guide dog, Regis, he nonchalantly asked why she was
coming to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``To row in the Head of the Charles,'' answered Tina Ament.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, director of media relations at BankBoston (one of the
regatta's sponsors), said he was dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been part of this for nine years, and I've met a lot of
rowers, young, old, tall, short,'' said Spitzer. ``But this is the
first time I've ever met a blind rower.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, said Ament Sunday morning, it's no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfectly do-able sport, because you're not supposed to
look around, the coxswain's supposed to do all that,'' said Ament,
36. ``It's one of the few things in life where I can actually
compete on really equal terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's had much trouble accomplishing other things in
life. Ament, who graduated from Yale, went on to Stanford Law
School, and is now an assistant US attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Ament, who started rowing when she was an undergrad, joined the
Capitol Rowing Club in D.C. in 1991, and has rowed the Head of the
Charles twice with Capitol. Two years ago, she attended a Row As
One camp at Mount Holyoke College, and raced with that club Sunday
in the Masters Eights division.
</P>
<P>
   The boat finished 12th in a field of 21 with a time of 19:24.32.
The 1980 Rowing Club, comprised of former national champions, was
first in 17:56.37.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great race, it's sort of what we live for,'' Ament
said of the regatta that draws almost 5,800 participants and an
estimated 300,000 spectators over two days. ``The most fun about
this boat is seeing the people who've never done it before. They
might be experienced rowers, but this race is different, because of
the crowds, and there are so many boats, compared to all the local
things we do where maybe there's 20 boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the women in the Row As One boat are with the Riverside
Club in Cambridge; the others are from New Jersey, Connecticut, and
California, in addition to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who never had raced together before, were coached by
Holly Metcalf of Boston. The former national team member and gold
medal champion in the 1984 Olympics decided to teach and coach
rowing after her racing days were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd decided that 1988 was going to be my last year, but
unfortunately I had to have back surgery so it really was my last
year,'' said Metcalf, 40. ``So I tried to figure out who I was, now
that I couldn't do this competition. I had to think about how am I
going to transfer this into something that I can use in a really
effective way.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf founded the Row As One Institute, a week-long rowing
camp for older women held twice a year at Mount Holyoke in South
Hadley. She felt like it filled a void, ``because it was hard to
find coaches at any level who would take women seriously. A lot of
women who are picking up rowing are in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and
70s; a lot of pre-Title IX women.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf also travels around the country giving three-day clinics
to rowing clubs, and with Community Rowing has begun a program
called G-ROW for girls in Boston public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf had no experience coaching rowers with disabilities, but
had no qualms when Ament asked to come to the Row As One camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely not a problem,'' said Metcalf, who calls
Ament one of her best rowers now. ``Her timing is amazing, and she
has a heightened sense of sound and how her body feels. There's no
reason why she shouldn't row.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course you'll get only a shrug from Ament, who is more
critical of her lack of height than her lack of sight. ``My size is
a lot more of a hindrance to me being a good rower,'' said Ament,
who is 5 feet 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   But she definitely gives new meaning to the term Row As One.

EPIC COURT FIGHT BEGINS BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND JUSTICE DEPT. 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ The Department of Justice and Microsoft Corp. _ it
remains an open question which is more powerful _ clash head to
head Monday as the antitrust ``trial of the 21st century'' opens in
federal court in Washington.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not just the biggest antitrust case in decades. Like a
high-noon showdown on the high frontier, it pits billionaire
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates against the nation's top law
enforcement officials and a posse of Silicon Valley's own nouveau
tycoons in a battle that will shape the American economy's leading
industrial edge.
</P>
<P>
   The government accuses Microsoft of unfairly using its Windows
monopoly in computer operating systems to drive out competitors and
lock up control of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from more than 3 million pages of internal company
e-mails and other documents, the government charges Microsoft with
``a pattern of anti-competitive conduct that has illegally
preserved its dominance of the PC operating system and that
threatens illegally to extend that dominance to other markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust law does not forbid monopolies, but it does forbid a
monopolist from predatory business tactics that stifle competition
and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant is fighting back hard, denying that its
Windows operating system is a monopoly and accusing the government
of conspiring with its competitors to crush its phenomenal success
and stifle its freedom to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has not behaved like a monopolist, and America's
antitrust laws do not exist to protect companies from
competition,'' the company declared in a 43-page public rebuttal
called ``Setting the Record Straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The case will be heard by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, whose earlier ruling against Microsoft in a prior
government action was overturned on appeal. It was after the
appeals court loss that the the government, joined by 20 state
attorneys general, filed its full-scale antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends that Microsoft used its
estimated 90 percent market share to thwart two major software
innovations that threatened to undermine Windows: Internet
browsers, specifically Netscape Navigator and Sun Microsystem's
Java programming language, which can run on any operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Both Navigator and Java, the government charges, could
potentially undermine Microsoft's dominance. The government cites
internal Microsoft documents where executives threaten to ``cut off
Netscape's air supply'' and ``pollute'' Java so that it only works
with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The government broadened its case since its May filing _
illegally, Microsoft charges _ because the appeals court denied the
government's key charge: that Microsoft illegally ``bundled'' its
Internet Explorer browser with Windows to force consumers to use
its browser and obliterate Netscape's market share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued, and the appeals court agreed, that the
Internet browser was an integral part of Windows that enhanced
consumer benefit, not a separate product.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to establish a pattern of predatory conduct, the
government has brought in additional evidence of alleged illegal
exclusive contracts and other maneuvers by Microsoft involving
Intel Corp., America Online Inc. and Apple Computer Co. The
government alleges that Microsoft used its market dominance to
``bully'' other companies into promoting its product and
suppressing competing products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case will look almost nothing like'' the original Justice
lawsuit, Microsoft complained in its public rebuttal. ``Rather than
proceed on the case they filed, the DOJ spent the summer looking
for new stories that could be transformed into allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bork, a free-market antitrust scholar and a former judge
now consulting for Netscape, scoffed at the claim in a press
conference Friday. ``The government clearly is allowed to show
there's a pattern here,'' Bork said, adding that the company's
internal documents are damning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will have no difficulty showing that the
integration (of Internet Explorer) was designed to put Netscape out
of the market,'' Bork said. To Microsoft's contention that the
government's evidence amounts to e-mail ``snippets'' taken out of
context, Bork countered, ``The documents here make it plain'' that
Microsoft executives were planning illegal predation. ``They meant
it and they did it,'' Bork said.
</P>
<P>
   Bork and others contend that the appeals court ruling is
irrelevant to the wider antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is allowed to include any new application in
Windows that benefits consumers, as the appeals court implied,
``You'd put Microsoft in a position to inboard everything, to
integrate into a single operating system every function you can
conceive of that a computer might do,'' said Lawrence Sullivan, a
professor at Southwestern University law school in Los Angeles.
``Because they have a monopoly, they could comprehend the whole
software universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the government's argument remains weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is going to try in part to rely on the
cumulative weight of criticism _ you pick up a rock and there's
somebody there who hates Bill Gates,'' said John Lopatka, a law
professor at the University of South Carolina and a former Reagan
administration antitrust official. ``But when you disintegrate the
mass of complaints into discrete allegations, then I think the case
becomes weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is drawing the line between conduct that injures a
competitor and conduct that is an illegal use of monopoly power. In
recent years, courts have taken a highly skeptical view of monopoly
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement before the trial ends remains a possibility, given
the stakes. But if the trial goes to completion _ it is expected to
last up to eight weeks _ it will almost certainly be appealed,
probably to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers worry _ and indeed Microsoft argues _
that the cures are worse than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to determine what Microsoft can and cannot add to Windows
might freeze operating system technology, and in any event would be
``very hard to police,'' said Peter Huber, a senior fellow with the
Manhattan Institute think tank. ``There was a day when if you
wanted a printer driver, you bought a driver; if you wanted fonts,
you bought fonts; if you wanted a CD-ROM, you would buy a special
CD-ROM. That was not convenient and nobody wants that. Today, if
you want speech recognition, you buy a $1,000 program from IBM. Be
assured that five years from now, that will be in the operating
system.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are many other less extreme remedies, Huber notes,
such as preventing Microsoft from writing exclusionary contracts
and allowing computer manufacturers to determine what appears on a
computer's first screen.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the trial will be how well the two sides lay out
their facts, because no new evidence can be introduced on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Top Silicon Valley players will be called as witnesses, which
are limited to 14 for each side. The government plans to call
executives at Netscape, Apple, Sun Microsystems, America Online,
IBM, Intel and Intuit Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to counter largely with its own executives,
although it also will call John Rose, a senior vice president with
Houston-based Compaq Computer. To save time, initial testimony will
be presented in writing, with witnesses called to the stand only
for cross examination.
</P>
<P>
   Gates himself is unlikely to appear at the trial, although his
videotaped pretrial testimony will probably be heard.

RUSSIAN FARMLAND WITHERS ON THE VINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAVSK, Russia _ Undulating gently through pastoral hills 150
miles south of Moscow, the Plava River Valley is a farmer's dream
come true. This is the gateway to what Russians call ``Chernozym''
_ ``Black Earth country'' _ which boasts some of the most fertile
soil in Europe, within three hours' drive of a giant, hungry
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The valley should be an agricultural paradise, a cornucopia on
the scale of California's Central Valley or the south of France.
Instead, it's a rural version of purgatory, where tractors are
vastly outnumbered by mules and crops are harvested by stoop
laborers who work 15-hour days under drenching autumn rains.
</P>
<P>
   The harvesters earn the equivalent of $10 per week, often paid
out in sacks of potatoes or cucumbers rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the Dark Ages at the dawn of the 21st century, the Plava
valley is a microcosm of Russia's larger crisis in the bitter
harvest season of 1998. It is a land caught between limitless
potential and endless failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be rich,'' says farmer Valery Belozyorov, the
mayor of Plavsk, a town of 17,000 people that serves as the
valley's administrative center. ``We have wonderful soil. We have
the scientific know-how. We have qualified people. But what does it
add up to?''
</P>
<P>
   In Plavsk and across the agricultural heartland of Russia, it
adds up to unpaved roads so rutted and muddy that crops are often
left to rot in the fields, a level of productivity less than
one-fourth that of peasants in China _ and a farm economy that
barely acknowledges the existence of money, much less the needs and
tastes of a consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Black Earth country has the natural wealth to feed an entire
nation. But it can barely feed itself.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that consumers in Moscow and other large cities
are heavily dependent on imported food and deeply worried that
their country's spiraling economic crisis will cut off the lifeline
abroad and lead to famine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to stop imports,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik reassured the public last week. ``They account for
almost 50 percent of Russia's food market.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia spent $15 billion buying foreign grain, produce, meat and
poultry in 1997. Two-thirds of all processed sausages, which
account for most of the nation's protein consumption, are made from
imported pork and beef.
</P>
<P>
   Few consumer items are more familiar to urban dwellers than
``Bush legs,'' frozen American chicken drumsticks. Their name
alludes to former President George Bush, whose administration
oversaw a huge increase in agricultural exports to the then-Soviet
Union in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Kulik's assertion, the crisis and the collapse of
the ruble _ which has fallen by more than 40 percent against the
dollar _ threaten to make Bush legs an endangered species here,
along with fresh Central American bananas, canned Italian tomatoes
and frozen Brussels sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Without prepayment in dollars or German marks, foreign
agribusiness firms are increasingly reluctant to ship their
products to Russia. Food imports dropped by 83 percent in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic meats and produce cannot fill the gap, even though
Russia is physically the world's largest nation, twice the size of
the United States with only half its population. This year, the
harvest is even smaller than normal, with grain production down
48.2 percent from 1997 due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast Russian heartland, where a barter system has always
been far more common than cash purchases, many farmers produce
largely for their own tables and exchange what's left over with
other rural families.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the the Moscow-based Institute of Social-Economic
Problems say that an astounding 80 percent of the rural population
lives outside the money economy.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 50 percent of all Russian-raised meat and 34 percent
of dairy products come from personal garden plots measuring roughly
650 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes make up the bulk of the national diet; nearly 280
pounds per year per person, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture. More than half of Russia's potatoes are eaten by the
people who grew them.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Soviet Union has dramatically transformed
other areas of the economy, for better or worse, as private
enterprise ballooned in the cities. But change has made virtually
no dent in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of rural Russia in 1998 is scarcely different from
the one that Josef Stalin created between 1929 and 1933, when
private farms were seized by the state and combined into
``kolkhozy,'' mammoth collectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government thought that most peasants would want to
control production themselves, if only they were given land of
their own,'' said Belozyorov, who himself maintains a small private
dairy operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, it turned out that we lacked the right economic
conditions, the financial backing and market support, for that kind
of autonomy. There are very few of us left among those who tried to
go private,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis might have been expected to improve sales of local
produce, such as the milk, corn, cabbage and potatoes that are
Plavsk's staple crops. In fact, it has had the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a fair amount of trade with people who came up
the highway from Belarus and Ukraine,'' said Belozyorov. ``But with
the ruble so unstable, they've disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The two countries' borders with Russia are only a few hours'
drive to the west.
</P>
<P>
   By grim happenstance, however, the proximity to Ukraine is still
responsible for a small cash flow into Plavsk. The town is just 220
miles downwind from Chernobyl, where a Ukrainian nuclear power
plant blew up in 1986, spewing nine tons of radioactive material
into the air. Hundreds of Plavsk residents were victims of
radiation poisoning and receive government disability checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Plava Valley's struggling agricultural private sector _ and
its miserable infrastructure of potholed roads, 50-year-old
electrification grids and leaky irrigation systems _ reflects a
nationwide pattern.
</P>
<P>
   More than 280,000 experiments in private farming were undertaken
in Russia between 1991 and 1996. All but 4 percent of them wound up
in bankruptcy. Most arable Russian land remains in the possession
of 27,000 giant kolkhozy and state-run farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present, there just aren't any financial resources
available to pay for the transition to private farming,'' said
General Roman Popkovich, deputy leader of Our Home is Russia, the
nation's second-largest political party. ``On top of that, no one
really knows what farmland should cost in Russia. So how can it be
sold?''
</P>
<P>
   A belated effort is being made to improve rural roads, with 600
miles of new federal highways scheduled to open by the end of the
year. But officials concede that this is a tiny drop in a very big
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia needs a minimum of 1.5 million kilometers (900,000
miles) of roads, while the total length of existing roads is only
554,000 kilometers (332,000 miles),'' according to the Federal Road
Service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A modern infrastructure alone won't improve the farm picture,
Popkovich believes. The more intractable problem, he says, is
psychological.
</P>
<P>
   ``A farmer in the West thinks of himself as his own boss _ he
uses his own labor, on his own property, for his own profit. But
here, peasants are simply agricultural workers, factory workers in
the fields, and nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentina Zhuravleva, a leader of the liberal Yabloko Party in
the lower Volga region, cites an experiment in which investors
helped establish one local family, with generations of agricultural
experience and seven children to help out, on a private farm. They
were also provided with a herd of sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they had no machinery and no business plan, and in the
end, what they did was sell off the sheep and rent the land out to
a collective,'' Zhuravleva said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a real change in mentality, as well as a support
system, to make private farming work. And we have neither.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet surprisingly, agricultural issues play little direct role in
the fierce political debates that now swirl around Russia's future.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few legislators such as Popkovich and Zhuravleva,
who have studied the farm problem, the only politicians who address
agricultural questions regularly are members of the Agrarian Party
_ a rural ally of the Communist Party which shares its opposition
to the privatization of land.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists have very little else to say on the matter. In a
12-point manifesto on resolving the economic crisis, issued
September 8, Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov made no mention at
all of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, new Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov addressed
the State Duma, Russia's lower house of Parliament, offering his
own crisis package. It too made no mention of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The Agrarian Party itself is dubious about the ability of
Russian farms to meet national demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov government should act to prop up ailing state
poultry and hog-breeding complexes as soon as possible, party
chairman Mikhail Lapshin said at a Moscow press conference on
October 11. But even with such subsidies, ``food imports should
continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to our problem won't come from our politicians.
They are only interested in making themselves rich,'' said a mother
of two in the Plavsk farmer's market, who refused to give her name
and said she didn't bother voting anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can see,'' she angrily snapped, ``the only answer
is for us to give all this land away to America.''

ENTHUSIASM, INTRIGUE HIGH AS NEW COLLEGE BASKETBALL SEASON BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Best things about college basketball: No labor-related lockout
(are you paying attention, NBA knuckleheads?) and March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   As practices begin this weekend, the thoughts of 310 Division I
teams turn to that glorious Sunday afternoon in March when they
hope to be one of 64 teams on the road to the Tropicana Field in
St. Petersburg, Fla., for the 1999 Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Among the story lines that figure to add intrigue to this
season:
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Kentucky returns only two starters, but could
be a dark-horse favorite. Another Final Four trip would firmly
establish the Wildcats as the team of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is a favorite preseason No. 1 selection. But the
Huskies have a history of bad luck in the tournament and have never
reached the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Temple coach John Chaney probably has the best collection of
talent since his 1988 team lost in the East Regional final. Will
this be a breakthrough season for one of the nation's best and most
intense coaches?
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has most of its team back from an inspiring Final Four
run. But the Cardinal could win 30 games and lose in the second
round. Why? Speed kills. Stanford is susceptible to teams loaded
with quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa coach Tom Davis has announced his retirement _ after this
season. How will his lame-duck status affect the Hawkeyes?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Tarkanian was supposed to be a savior at Fresno State. But
in three seasons, the Bulldogs still have zero NCAA Tournament
appearances. So far, the Tarkanian Era has produced more news off
the court than on.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic departments figure to be frugal. The NCAA must pay an
$80 million settlement after losing a lawsuit brought by former
assistant coaches over a restricted earnings coaching position
established earlier this decade. Member schools probably will have
to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the problems faced by the NCAA, as long as the
NBA's labor deadlock continues, college basketball should bask in
the spotlight.
10 PLAYERS TO WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton, Connecticut: The best player on perhaps the
nation's best team. The 6-5 Hamilton could get serious
player-of-the-year attention if the Huskies, as expected, spend the
season in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Trajan Langdon, Duke: The Blue Devils are deeper than Barry
White's voice. But to return to the Final Four, Duke needs a go-to
leader. Langdon is the team's only senior who will get significant
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Nailon, TCU: The Frogs maintained their national profile
when Nailon, a preseason first-team All-American, decided to return
to school. Now, he's under the gun to match last year's numbers
while playing with a new backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves, Michigan State: When healthy, Cleaves is one of
the nation's top point guards. The Spartans' NCAA Tournament
success last season was due largely to Cleaves' all-around play.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Miller, Utah: Like TCU's Lee Nailon, Miller passed on the
NBA to return for his final season. His play and leadership will
determine how close the Utes come to matching last year's run to
the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cardinal, Purdue: A rough-and-tumble power forward,
Cardinal is loved by Boilermakers fans and despised by opponents'
fans. However, he'll need to raise his game to help Purdue win a
mediocre Big Ten Conference.
</P>
<P>
   LaRon Profit, Maryland: The Terps are expected to challenge Duke
in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Profit is 6-5 and can play
effectively on the front court or at guard.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Szczerbiak, Miami (Ohio): Who? Well, at Miami, they call
him Wally World. The 6-8 senior forward missed much of last season
with a broken wrist. But he's regarded as the best shooter in the
college game.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Herren, Fresno State: A fiery competitor with a checkered
past, Herren will move from shooting guard to point guard. If he
can make the transition effectively, Fresno State might finally
reach the NCAA Tournament under Jerry Tarkanian.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Lee, Stanford: For the Cardinal to return to the Final
Four, they'll need Lee to play like he did in last year's NCAAs.
And, as a senior point guard, leadership and big play-making is
expected.
</P>
<P>
   FIVE IMPACT ROOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen who should have the biggest effect on their teams:
Quentin Richardson, DePaul Ron Curry, North Carolina Eric Barkley,
St. John's Vincent Yarbrough, Tennessee JaRon Rush, UCLA
</P>
<P>
   FIVE IMPACT NEWCOMERS
</P>
<P>
   Players who are transfers or who are now eligible to play: Mark
Karcher, Temple Lamar Odom, Rhode Island Jason Collier, Georgia
Tech Scoonie Penn, Ohio State Damion Walker, New Mexico
</P>
<P>
   FIVE TEAMS ON THE RISE Maryland California Tennessee Memphis SMU
FIVE TEAMS ON THE DECLINE Louisville Clemson Virginia Mississippi
St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   TOP FIVE PLAYERS UNDER 6-FOOT Khalid El Amin, Connecticut/5-9
Shawnta Rogers, George Washington/5-4 Kareem Reid, Arkansas/5-10
Prince Fowler, TCU/5-10 LaDrell Whitehead, Ohio/5-9

<P>
   WOMEN AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   Five players to watch
</P>
<P>
   1. Chamique Holdsclaw, Tennessee, F, 6-2, Sr., Just try keeping
your eyes off her when she's on the court.
</P>
<P>
   2. Tamika Catchings, Tennessee, F, 6-1, Sr., Believe it or not,
she might be better than Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lynn Pride, Kansas, F, 6-2, Jr., Counted on to carry Jayhawks
to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   4. Dominique Canty, Alabama, G, 5-10, Sr., Can and will take the
ball to the hole on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   5. Ruth Riley, C, Notre Dame, C, 6-5, So., All but unstoppable
when she's not in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Five teams on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers
</P>
<P>
   Duke
</P>
<P>
   Kansas
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State
</P>
<P>
   Five things to watch
</P>
<P>
   1. Attendance on the rise. NCAA Tournament drew record crowds;
three teams topped 10,000 a game.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dunking in games. 6-5 Tennessee freshman Michelle Snow and
Barry's Scooby Roach are top candidates.
</P>
<P>
   3. NCAA moving away from home courts in tournament. Home-court
advantage didn't help Texas Tech or Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   4. Going pro early. Georgia Tech's Niesha Butler is considering
testing ABL, WNBA rules.
</P>
<P>
   5. Tennessee domination. With everyone back and a top recruiting
class, nobody beats the Vols. \Nname:_ Andy Friedlander
</P>
<P>
   BIG 12 AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   Five players to watch
</P>
<P>
   Men: 1. Chris Mihm-Kris Clack, Texas; 2. Desmond Mason, Oklahoma
State; 3. Ryan Humphrey, Oklahoma; 4. Venson Hamilton, Nebraska; 5.
Shanne Jones, Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Women: 1. Lynn Pride, Kansas; 2. Phylesha Whaley, Oklahoma; 3.
Stacy Frese, Iowa State; 4. Angie Braziel, Texas Tech; 5. Lara
Webb, Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Top team
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State: The Cowboys were the Big 12's most impressive
team in the NCAA Tournament, which isn't saying much. But the
memory of a 79-73 loss to Duke in the South Regional finals is
fresh. If the Cowboys find a center to replace Brett Robisch, they
could well go nose-to-nose with Kansas for conference supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Top coach
</P>
<P>
   Harry Miller, Baylor: Miller is one of college athletics' best
citizens _ a good guy, very quotable, and last season should have
proven to any detractors that he can coach at this level. But the
fact remains the Bears will take a big dip minus Brian Skinner and
Patrick Hunter and his future is open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Top program
</P>
<P>
   Baylor women: Coach Sonja Hogg guided last season's team to the
championship game of the Women's NIT, where more than 10,000 fans
in the Ferrell Center watched a 59-56 loss to Penn State. Leaders
Lara Webb and Kacy Moffitt return, and Hogg expects a large
contribution from perhaps the Big 12's top recruiting class. The
Lady Bears are ready for an NCAA Tournament berth behind the best
hire Baylor has made since Grant Teaff.  &LR; name:_ Mike Jones
</P>
<P>
   WAC AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   Five players to watch
</P>
<P>
   Men
</P>
<P>
   1. Lee Nailon, TCU (6-9, 235, Sr.) _ All-America candidate who
led Frogs to 27-6 season, averaging 24.9 points and 8.9 rebounds.
Last season's WAC scoring leader decided to return for his senior
year rather than enter NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kenny Thomas, New Mexico (6-8, 259, Sr.) _ Returning
All-American averaged 16.8 points and 9.3 rebounds. Has lost 19
pounds. Ineligible until Dec. 19 due to NCAA academic ruling.
</P>
<P>
   3. Andre Miller, Utah (6-2, 203, Sr.) _ Named to the Final Four
all-tournament team after averaging 16.7 points, 7.5 rebounds and
6.8 assists in six tournament games. Averaged 14.2 points for the
season. Named WAC Defender of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   4. Chris Herren, Fresno State (6-3, 185, Sr.) _ Moves from
shooting guard (15.6 points, 36.2 three-point percentage) to point
guard and will be counted on to lead Bulldogs past last year's NIT
finish. Gained notoriety last year for battle with drug and alcohol
addiction. Has recently married.
</P>
<P>
   5. Michael Ruffin, Tulsa (6-8, 230, Sr.) _ Excellent student and
the school's career leader in rebounds and blocked shots. Tough
defender who averaged 10.4 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.5 blocks last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Women
</P>
<P>
   1. Becky Hammon, Colorado State (5-6, Sr.) _ Three-time All-WAC
selection and the league's marquee player returns for her senior
year as an All-American candidate (honorable mention in '98).
Averaged 23.5 points _ hitting 50.9 per cent of her shots and 40.2
from three-point range last season.
</P>
<P>
   2. Katie Cronin, Colorado State (6-0, Sr.) _ Honorable mention
All-American averaged 18.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and shot 38.4 per
cent from three-point range. Has started every game for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   3. Marla Brumfield, Rice (5-9, Jr.) _ All-WAC as freshman and
sophomore. Averaged 13.6 points. 4.7 rebounds and 2.5 steals last
year as Owls' floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   4. B.J. Itomen, Hawaii (5-5, Sr.) _ Tenacious defender and point
guard who runs Rainbows attack that includes high-scoring
Australians Kylie Page and Raylene Howard.
</P>
<P>
   5. Karlin Kennedy, SMU (6-1, Jr.) _ Leads a talented returning
cast from 21-8 team a season ago. Averaged 15.8 points and 8.6
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   New coaches
</P>
<P>
   Men
</P>
<P>
   Phil Johnson, San Jose State
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie McKay, Colorado State
</P>
<P>
   Steve McClain, Wyoming
</P>
<P>
   Women
</P>
<P>
   Britt King, Fresno State
</P>
<P>
   Sue Darling, Air Force
</P>
<P>
   Regina Miller, UNLV
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Fisher, Wyoming
</P>
<P>
   Bits and pieces
</P>
<P>
   FOX Sports Southwest will again offer coverage of the four-team
Mountain Division ``quadrant'' composed of TCU, SMU, Rice and
Tulsa. With four appearances in 10 dates, TCU gets the lion's share
_ including the opener, Dec. 8 (7 p.m.) when the Frogs host Texas
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Both new coaches at Wyoming plan a new up-tempo game that will
be a slight departure from past tradition. Men's coach Steve
McClain is a former Billy Tubbs assistant at TCU and plans a faster
pace for the Cowboys. Women's coach Cindy Fisher also will have her
team running, in the style of Old Dominion, where she was an
assistant for three years.
</P>
<P>
   UTEP assistant G. Ray Johnson represented the Miners at the
basketball media day and was asked how head coach Don Haskins felt
about the WAC split. Before he could answer, New Mexico coach Dave
Bliss quipped, ``We haven't told him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the glow of a Final Four appearance, portly Utah
coach Rick Majerus told media members he would buy any extra photos
of the Utes' tournament run for an upcoming book. ``We don't seem
to have any with me in there,'' he said. ``Evidently, we don't own
a wide-angle lens.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's Kenny Thomas, on his weight-loss program: ``I don't
eat any good stuff, like sweets or fried foods. I just eat bad
stuff, like fruit.''  &LR; name:_ Whit Canning

FAMILY RETURNS TO COLLECT BELONGINGS SOAKED IN FLOODING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Gene and Gwen Burnell and their three
teen-agers spend much of Sunday clearing what used to be furniture
and keepsakes from their two-story home in New Braunfels along the
Guadalupe River.
</P>
<P>
   The river, renowned in Central Texas for tubing and canoeing,
rose over the 18-foot bluff that normally protects New Braunfels'
fashionable Summerwood Addition almost without warning Saturday
afternoon, the Burnells said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the river reached the street (between the neighborhood
and the Guadalupe channel), we got out,'' said Gene Burnell, an
information systems manager for a building supply company. ``We
didn't take anything with us. We didn't think we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   When the family returned Sunday morning, a waterline was visible
on the red bricks above the second-story window shutters.
Everything inside was a jumble. In the garage, their month-old Kia
rested beneath a rubbish pile that included the families' spare
refrigerator.

   ``Everything can be replaced,'' said Gwen Burnell, who has lived
in the home appraised at $180,000 with her family for six years.
``But we're the type that videoed everything _ every baseball game,
every birthday party, every visit by the grandparents. They're all
gone now, and they can't be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of homes in New Braunfels were left in the same shape
as the Burnells'. The Comal River, which joins the Guadalupe near
the center of the city, tore through the Inverness Condominiums,
carrying away cars from covered parking areas and uprooting dozens
of once-sturdy oaks and mesquites.
</P>
<P>
   The current, and the debris it ferried downstream, ripped the
concrete guardrails from a central city bridge over the river and
washed away inner tubes and other water toys from the Schlitterbahn
water theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area flooded in 1972. It was pretty bad, but nowhere near
this bad,'' said Bill Karnau, a retired middle school principal in
New Braunfels whose condominium 100 yards from the channel was
soaked.
</P>
<P>
   The home Karnau and his daughter share was caught between the
two rivers. They were among hundreds of New Braunfels residents who
escaped to neighborhood shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-moving waters, which receded somewhat despite steady
rains Sunday afternoon, swept away a riverside recreational vehicle
camp near Interstate 35 and served as a horrific conversation piece
for the city about 20 miles north of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this, and I've lived here since
1986,'' said Eileen Koch, a registered nurse who watched the
swirling brown water from the bridge at I-35 Business. ``So far,
I've seen parts of houses go floating by, a pickup truck and a
whole lot of junk.''

FAMILY RETURNS TO COLLECT BELONGINGS SOAKED IN FLOODING

<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Gene and Gwen Burnell and their three
teen-agers spend much of Sunday clearing what used to be furniture
and keepsakes from their two-story home in New Braunfels along the
Guadalupe River.
</P>
<P>
   The river, renowned in Central Texas for tubing and canoeing,
rose over the 18-foot bluff that normally protects New Braunfels'
fashionable Summerwood Addition almost without warning Saturday
afternoon, the Burnells said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the river reached the street (between the neighborhood
and the Guadalupe channel), we got out,'' said Gene Burnell, an
information systems manager for a building supply company. ``We
didn't take anything with us. We didn't think we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   When the family returned Sunday morning, a waterline was visible
on the red bricks above the second-story window shutters.
Everything inside was a jumble. In the garage, their month-old Kia
rested beneath a rubbish pile that included the families' spare
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything can be replaced,'' said Gwen Burnell, who has lived
in the home appraised at $180,000 with her family for six years.
``But we're the type that videoed everything _ every baseball game,
every birthday party, every visit by the grandparents. They're all

COWBOYS CAN'T STOP CHICAGO'S LATE DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ All season, Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey has
appealed to his team for more consistency. And at least his
Jekyll-Hyde club followed through Sunday on one aspect. Having lost
to one of the league's best teams _ Denver in Week 2 _ the Cowboys
fell to one of the league's worst, dropping a 13-12 decision to the
hapless Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were done in by a defense that could not stop big
plays in the clutch; by an offense that failed to make enough plays
in the shadow of the Bears' goal line; and by a coaching decision
to go for a two-point conversion, which failed.
</P>
<P>
   Given new life by the friendly visitors from the South, the
Bears converted pass plays of 19 and 22 yards on a last-gasp drive.
Jeff Jaeger came on to kick the game-winning, 29-yard field goal
with 11 seconds remaining to give the Bears (2-5) an upset victory
against the Cowboys (4-3) at blustery Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, in the losers' locker room, Deion Sanders stood
before the news media and tried to make sense of why the Cowboys
struggled for a second consecutive week against a team with a
losing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``... We can't play to the level of our opponents,'' Sanders
said. ``Right now we're a team without a personality. I don't know
what to expect week to week. We need to really find ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we are right now,'' Gailey said. ``We're
fighting our rears off every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing, the Cowboys maintained a one-game edge in the
NFC East on the Giants (3-4) and Cardinals (3-4).
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys have two weeks before playing again to think
about the missed opportunities on offense. They were 2-of-12 on
third down, and settled for field goals on two of three trips
inside the Bears' 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a second-half meltdown by the defense, which
allowed the Bears to gain 232 yards in the second half despite
limiting Chicago to 67 yards in the first. The Bears also scored a
third-quarter touchdown for the first time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet through all this, the Cowboys led, 12-10, when the Bears
took over at their 20 with 5:01 remaining. But the lead did not
last.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears drove 69 yards in 11 plays to set up the game-winner
from Jaeger. Forced to throw inside because the Cowboys doubled the
outside wide receivers, Bears quarterback Erik Kramer hit rookie
tight end Alonzo Mayes on two big pass plays down the middle. One
was for 22 yards over middle linebacker Fred Strickland, the other
for 19 over outside linebacker Dexter Coakley.
</P>
<P>
   Mayes ``just ran to a spot, got down and he was open,''
Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys know it should not have come down to how well their
linebackers play pass defense. Offensively, the Cowboys were inside
the Bears' 20 twice in the first half. Yet they mustered only 12
yards and a penalty on eight plays. Despite dominating the first
half, the Cowboys settled for a 6-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't (execute), that's the place where it jumps up
and bites you the hardest and the worst _ right there in the red
zone,'' Gailey said. ``... We took a step backwards today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears scored on their second drive of the first half as
Chris Penn beat Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith for a 13-yard
touchdown reception. But the Cowboys regained the momentum on the
Bears' next drive when Coakley picked off Kramer in the flat.
</P>
<P>
   That set up Jason Garrett's 1-yard scoring pass to tight end
David LaFleur, giving the Cowboys a 12-7 lead. Gailey tried to put
more pressure on the Bears by going for the two-point conversion,
but Garrett's pass to Michael Irvin fell incomplete in the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by five points instead of seven, the Bears were content
to drive for field goals on their final two drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just try to make more good decisions than bad ones,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys expect to have Troy Aikman back for their next game,
Nov. 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles. But they'll probably be
kicking themselves for not giving Aikman more of a lead in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Or will they?
</P>
<P>
   ``We better do more than kick yourself,'' Strickland said. ``We
better wake up, or our plans are not going to work out the way we
want them to.''

COWBOYS CORNERBACK DRAWS IRE FOR DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Cornerback Kevin Smith, targeted by Chicago Bears
quarterback Erik Kramer late in Sunday's 13-12 loss, said all he
can do is keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears completed seven passes for 96 yards against Smith on
their three scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the game,'' Smith said. ``They are going to
throw at me. Some plays I made, some plays I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys gave Smith some double coverage help during
the game. But Cowboys defense coordinator Dave Campo said there was
nothing more they could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to live with (his play),'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Chad Hennings said the rest of the defense
still supports Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great player and we know he can do the job,'' Hennings
said. ``He is a professional and he's going to continue working.''
GOING FOR TWO
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey explained that he went by the book in
going for two points after the Cowboys' third-quarter touchdown
that put them up 12-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you kick the extra point, it's 13-7 and you lose if they
score a touchdown,'' Gailey said. ``If it's the second quarter or
early in the third quarter, you may not do it. But late in the game
that's the decision you make. It puts them in a situation where
they have to go for two after a touchdown if they are going to win
in regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys failed on the two-point try and the Bears won the
game with two late field goals, meaning that Gailey's decision was
the difference in the game. COACH SENT TO HOSPITAL
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys running-backs coach Clarence Shelmon, who has been
suffering with flu symptoms, was taken from the game to the
Northwestern University Medical Center. Cowboys spokesman Brett
Daniels said Shelmon would be kept overnight. Offensive-line coach
Hudson Houck stayed in Chicago with Shelmon. Both are expected to
return to Texas today. NOTHING DEEP
</P>
<P>
   The Bears took the deep pass away from quarterback Jason Garrett
and the big play out of the Cowboys offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' cornerbacks played soft, allowing short passes but
nothing long.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin caught a team-high five passes
for 62 yards. Big-play receiver Ernie Mills was held to three
catches for 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played their corners very deep and then had somebody over
the top,'' Cowboys quarterbacks coach Buddy Geis said of the Bears'
coverage. PRACTICE PAYS OFF
</P>
<P>
   All week the Cowboys defense worked on stripping the ball,
batting down passes and tipping passes because of the Bears'
tendency to turn over the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The practice paid off Sunday. Safety Omar Stoutmire caused a
first-quarter fumble when he stripped the ball from running back
Edgar Bennett. Defensive tackle Chad Hennings batted down an Erik
Kramer pass. And safety Kenny Wheaton knocked a pass loose from
Bears receiver Bobby Engram that linebacker Dexter Coakley caught
and returned it 57 yards for a touchdown. However, Coakley's
touchdown was nullified because of an illegal block on the return.
It was Coakley's second career interception. JEFFERS INACTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Former Country Day School star Patrick Jeffers' hopes of getting
action at wide receiver were dashed before Sunday's game when Billy
Davis, bothered all week by a left foot strain, was cleared to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers was made inactive for the sixth time in seven games
since coming from the Denver Broncos before the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Other Cowboys inactives were linebacker Myron Smith, tackle
Oliver Ross, tight end Hayward Clay, quarterback Troy Aikman, guard
Everett McIver, defensive tackle Nathan Davis and tackle Antonio
Anderson. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin, with five catches for 62
yards, became the 10th player in NFL history to catch at least 700
passes. Irvin has 704 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tight end Eric Bjornson caught a career-long 34-yard
reception.

   MIDEAST-ECON-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli business community

<P>
   HATE-CRIMES-REVIEW (Houston) _ Laws against hate crimes raise a

   SACRILEGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The play ``Corpus Christi'' has

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The crime was horrific enough; cunningly cruel, brutal
and utterly senseless. But it was the way the victim was chosen _
singled out because he was part of a despised minority _ that
aroused the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The murder in June of James Byrd Jr., a black man torn to pieces
when he was dragged behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas, spurred
demands for toughening the state's broadly worded hate-crime law
and for passage of federal hate-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the brutal and equally senseless death last week of
Matthew Shepard, slashed, bludgeoned and tied to a fence post in
rural Wyoming, apparently because he was homosexual, is spurring
new demands for a hate-crime law in Wyoming, one of 10 states that
has none, and for passage of federal hate-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument for hate-crime laws, especially as they relate
to capital crimes like the murders of Byrd and Shepard, is not so
clear, prosecutors and others say. In the case of Byrd, for
example, the prosecutor does not intend to invoke the Texas
hate-crime law against the three white men charged with the murder.
He says it would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, our hate-crimes statute works by elevating the
punishment,'' said Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray.
``But this one is already as high as you can go. It's a capital
case. There's no room to elevate it any higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The same would probably be true in the Shepard case if Wyoming
had a hate-crime law. And that's the paradox: The very cases that
cause a national outcry for hate-crime laws are cases in which the
laws are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hate-crime laws make a statement about how we feel about
hate crimes and, in some respects, it will probably help,'' said
Kelly Anders, a policy associate for the National Conference of
State Legislatures in Denver. ``Unfortunately, for the worst of
these crimes, the kind that we all hear about, it probably wouldn't
have any effect. If something is egregious enough, like what
happened to that poor guy in Wyoming, that surpasses any kind of
penalty on the books. That's the death penalty right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an argument can be made that such laws are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   They probably have some deterrent effect, Ms. Anders said. And
there are certainly some cases involving misdemeanors or other
lesser crimes, she added, where those convicted have faced harsher
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to determine the effectiveness of hate-crime laws are
hampered by the lack of statistics. The Hate Crime Statistics Act,
enacted in 1990, called on the FBI to compile data from local
law-enforcement agencies about crimes that ``manifest prejudice
based on race, religious, sexual orientation or ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reported 4,558 hate crimes in 1991 and 7,587 in 1993,
for example. But the accuracy of those numbers is in doubt because
the number of agencies reporting hate crimes has fluctuated from
year to year. Only about 60 percent of the 16,000 law-enforcement
agencies in the country regularly report hate crimes to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and the National
Gay and Lesbian Task Force say the laws are valuable because they
shape the way society thinks about itself and draw boundaries of
what society will tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   And advocates argue that society's speaking out, clearly and
specifically, against crimes directed at members of a minority
group can make the members of that group feel less isolated and
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they argue, people convicted of hate crimes, especially
the young, could be helped if they are given counseling. And, they
say, police officers might become more vigilant about such crimes
if the laws require training on the issue, as the laws in eight
states do.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of these laws say they are a sneaky way of
restricting political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law historically has gone against punishing people for
their thoughts, and that is what hate-crimes laws do,'' Ms. Anders
said. ``That's what makes it so delicate. You have to make sure
when you're drafting legislation that you're not punishing people
for their thoughts. And that's a very difficult thing, because
that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been two significant legal challenges to hate-crimes
laws, both involving free-speech issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a
Minnesota statute used in the case of a white man who burned a
cross in a black family's back yard. Minnesota's highest court had
ruled that the statute was constitutional because it was proper to
criminalize ``fighting words,'' or speech that would almost
inevitably result in a violent response. But the Supreme Court
disagreed, saying that Minnesota had not criminalized all such
``fighting words,'' and to single out only some for special
treatment was improper.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, however, the Supreme Court upheld a Wisconsin
statute that imposed higher penalties for hate crimes. This
approach has since been adopted by all but 10 states, to varying
degrees and in accordance with the Supreme Court's view that it is
proper to add penalties for existing crimes, but not to create a
new category of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, including Texas, aren't explicit about which groups
are covered by their hate-crimes statutes. Of those that do
specify, 20 states mention race, religion or ethnicity, 11 mention
sexual orientation, 11 mention gender and 12 mention other
categories, like mental or physical disability.
</P>
<P>
   And some states have penalties that vary with the severity of
the crime. In Wisconsin, for instance, a simple fine might be added
to the penalty for a misdemeanor conviction, while five years could
be added to a felony sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the prosecutor in Texas, said his decision not to use a
hate-crime law in the murder of Byrd should not be viewed as a lack
of support for such laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does have an impact,'' he said. ``It's one more tool that a
prosecutor can use.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another case underway in Jasper County, he said, a case
involving the firing of a weapon in which no one was injured. It
happened for racial reasons, he said, and the use of the hate-crime
law led to tougher punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you present hate-crime evidence in a courtroom, the jury
normally becomes angry over some offense that is, in effect,
senseless and they impose a stronger punishment,'' he said. ``What
the legislation does is give the jury the opportunity to increase
the level of punishment, and they do take advantage of it.''

ADDING TO THE MYSTERIES OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time, it has always seemed to me, is a hoax perpetuated upon us
by greedy clock makers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have never been able to prove this theory to everyone's
satisfaction. Nonetheless, it has been a reliable guide for me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I tend dismiss news from so-called official
timekeepers as unworthy of my time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet I know most of you are eagerly awaiting New Year's Eve
this year because, at 5:59:59 p.m. Central Standard Time on that
day a ``leap second'' will be added to the world's clocks. The U.S.
Naval Observatory, which is in charge of determining exactly what
time it is and letting Americans know, will be one of the world's
timing agencies adding the extra second. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'll explain all this before I run out of time here, but first
we need to review the nature of time itself because. . .well, just
because. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time, as you may know, was invented in ancient Egypt by the
business agent for the United Pyramid Workers Union to allow a more
accurate way for the pharaohs to pay the help. Naturally, being
pharaohs, they scoffed at the idea and continued employing people
for $0.00 an hour plus time and a half for overtime. But the idea
of time was born, and we've been behind ever since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This explains why so many people have spent way too much time
since then trying to define time. To Lord Byron, for instance, time
was ``the beautifier of the dead, adorner of the ruin, comforter
and the only healer when the heart hath bled.'' (Odd. I thought
morticians were the beautifier of the dead.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, by contrast, called time ``the king of men,''
though perhaps a more sensitive editor might have broadened his
gender-exclusive language to say time is the ``monarch of people.''
Or perhaps not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And though there are many other people I could waste time
quoting about time, I will leave off with Oliver Wendell Holmes,
who said time ``is a miser who always wants guineas for groats.''
And I will leave it to you to discover what, exactly, he meant. The
first person to e-mail me with the answer will, uh, be the first
person to e-mail me with the answer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, wait. My lackluster research has just stumbled across a
pretty fair quote from St. Augustine _ the man, not the city, silly
_ who is said to have said in the 5th century: ``What then is time?
If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to
him who asks me, I do not know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This explains why Augustine is the patron saint of high school
students. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, whatever time is, measuring it (By the way, would time
exist if it were not measured?) has proven to be more complicated
than anyone first imagined back when all we needed to know was
whether it's day or night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, in fact, the ability to measure time more
accurately has gotten almost ridiculous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Observatory, which took the time to issue an actual
press release about the upcoming leap second addition, says the
Earth itself is a pretty fair clock, and accurate to about
one-thousandth of a second a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Earth's rotation is slowing down, and that is messing up
far-more-accurate atomic clocks that can measure time to accuracies
exceeding one-billionth of a second a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So as the Earth's natural time and the official atomic-clock
times get more and more separated from one another, timekeepers
compensate by occasionally adjusting the only one of the two clocks
they can _ their atomic clocks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is why we'll add a leap second on New Year's Eve. The
really awful part of this, of course, is that it will extend the
impeachment process. But with so many of you partying hard that
night, who will notice? &QL;
</P>
<P>

 ISRAELI BUSINESS FLIES LIKE A DOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A few hours before boarding the plane that would
take him to Washington for the peace talks that started last week,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood on a stage here and
handed out etched glass trophies to 53 foreign businessmen whose
companies had each sunk $50 million or more into the Israeli
economy.
</P>
<P>
   As the executives filed by, each exchanged a greeting with the
prime minister that was drowned out by a big band blasting ``Blue
Moon'' and ``I Did It My Way.'' Netanyahu turned to the audience,
composed mostly of Israeli business executives, to relay the
comments as if they were an informal poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a third said, `Do everything you can to bring peace,'
and another third said, `Don't give away the store,' '' Netanyahu
reported. ``The rest just said, `Good luck.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli business leaders responded by giving Netanyahu an
unsolicited poll of their own. They interrupted his tally to
applaud the sentiment for peace, then clapped only politely through
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat have been wrangling in
Maryland over land, guns and limits on sovereignty. Back home, it
is striking how the business community not only has accepted what
it sees as the inevitability of an independent Palestinian state,
but is already preparing to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli executives are hardly peaceniks. The military industry
is still at the technological heart of the economy, and corporate
leaders tend disproportionately to be former high-ranking military
officers. But they have clearly concluded that a settlement with
Arafat is in their interest. And they voice rising impatience with
a peace process that, as one leading industrialist grumbled last
week, has so far produced ``too much process and not enough
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is ultimately governed by his own conceptions of
Israeli security as well as his partisan political constraints. But
he cannot be unmoved by the business consensus that a peace deal
would provide an economic boon to his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli CEOs, in fact, say that beyond a negotiating
breakthrough at the Wye Plantation summit, what they really are
waiting for is a final accord with a sovereign Palestinian state,
because that would remove remaining regional barriers to Israeli
exports and investments. Globalized though the Israeli economy
might now be, they say, its greatest opportunity for further growth
is here in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony that Netanyahu took part in was at a two-day
international business conference organized by the prime minister's
office to commemorate Israel's 50th anniversary. There was much
bold talk of ``privatizing peace'' through joint ventures with Arab
partners, including a Gaza industrial park, a $60 million
Israeli-Palestinian investment fund backed by the World Bank, and
two bi-national projects with Jordan _ a tourist airport on the Red
Sea and a duty-free industrial zone straddling the Jordan River.
``This kind of cross-border cooperation costs a lot less than an
F-16, and it offers a much better return on investment,'' said Omar
Salah, a Jordanian investor in the free zone project.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly strong business consensus for a peace settlement
does not necessarily translate into direct pressure to cut a deal,
however. Israeli corporate leaders are cautious about overt
intervention in politics and diplomacy, and most are not natural
allies of Netanyahu and his Likud bloc. They are closer to the
political and military leadership that governed under the Labor
Party. ``My fear is that business criticizing the government will
help them, not us,'' said Dov Lautman, chairman of Delta Galil
Industries and board chairman of the Peres Peace Center, an
institute that promotes joint Israeli-Palestinian business
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Israeli economic officials talk about potential
peace dividends. ``We hope that the peace process is successful,
because then we will be able to do what all other countries in the
world do, which is trade with our neighbors,'' said Max Livnat,
senior deputy director general of the Trade and Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no dispute that a peace process will be good for
the Israeli economy,'' said Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Central
Bank. ``This is not a political statement, it is a factual
statement. Our ratings agencies, our investors, all look at the
geopolitical situation, and they vote with their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the signing of the Oslo accords five years
ago, business leaders within and outside the region began holding
conferences on the brave new business world of a peaceful Middle
East. Multilateral lenders and money-center bankers drew up plans
for regional investment funds and a Middle Eastern Development
Bank. But momentum flagged as the peace process stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with talks resuming, some of the optimism is
returning. Israeli executives were talking confidently last week of
a free trade bloc that would include Israel, Jordan and an
independent Palestine as an almost immediate byproduct of a peace
settlement; under this vision, broader regional trading
arrangements could eventually extend west through Islamic Africa,
east to the Persian Gulf states and north into Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel as the hub of a Middle Eastern free trade area no longer
seems so improbable here. The Israelis like to note that theirs is
the only country with free trade agreements with both the United
States and the European Union. This is true technically, as the
West Bank and Gaza is not a country. But the Palestinian Authority
has free trade privileges from both Washington and Brussels. It
also has open trade with Egypt and Jordan, and a de facto customs
union with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For potential Middle Eastern trading partners, disentangling the
Palestinian-Israeli interrelationship would be more difficult than
simply embracing it as a single market.
</P>
<P>
   And any regional trade arrangement that included the
Palestinians but omitted the Israelis would be like NAFTA without
the United States, or the European Union without Germany. Israel's
economy is now far larger than that of all its contiguous neighbors
_ Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt _ combined. Per capita gross
domestic product stands at $17,000, well within European norms, and
some 20 times greater than Jordan's and Egypt's average incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has already been good for business, Israeli
executives say. The Arab boycott of Israel _ and of multinationals
that did business here _ began to fracture after the Oslo accords
were signed. Foreign investment climbed dramatically from $400
million yearly before 1993 to a reported $2.4 billion in 1996, as
dramatized by last week's parade of CEOs from Boeing, Unilever,
Nestle, Cable &AMP; Wireless, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Motorola, and other
multinational heavyweights. Israeli businessmen are penetrating
markets in Asia, Africa and the former Soviet bloc, and Japan, long
conspicuously absent from the Israeli business scene, opened a
trade promotion office here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo may get more credit than it deserves. The Israeli expansion
of the 1990s was also fueled by the worldwide growth of investment
in emerging markets. And most of the high-tech companies nurtured
by this capital influx have their origins in the Israeli defense
industry, not in the peace process; their natural markets are in
the United States and Europe, not the Middle East. But the impact
of expanded international opportunities should not be
underestimated, Israeli business leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic benefits of the peace process are irrefutable,''
said Benjamin Gaon, an industrialist. ``Our diplomatic
relationships have doubled, and we have open business relationships
around the world. Gone are the days of secret dealings through
intermediaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community should not just reap the rewards of the
peace process, but should assist it, even lead it,'' he added.
``Peace is too precious a thing to be left in the hands of
politicians, or even generals.''

 BLASPHEMY? AGAIN? SOMEBODY'S PRAYING FOR A HIT. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a good month for blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi,'' playwright Terence McNally's retelling of
the story of Jesus with a gay savior and disciples, has sold out
its New York run despite furious picketers and dismissive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese author Jose Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize for
Literature despite the offense caused by his 1992 novel ``The
Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' presenting a lustful Jesus used
as a pawn in God's plan to expand his influence.
</P>
<P>
   And Salman Rushdie was finally freed, more or less, from the
death sentence imposed by Iran's mullahs nine years ago for
insulting the Koran in ``The Satanic Verses.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of works deemed sacrilegious goes on and on, from
Andres Serrano's notorious crucifix in a jar of urine to Martin
Scorsese's 1988 film ``The Last Temptation of Christ.'' And the
ecclesiastical mud fights they seem to spawn with monotonous
regularity, regardless of their quality, are a revealing window on
the convoluted politics of impiety in art.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of ``Corpus Christi'' in particular offers at
least two lessons. The first is that when it comes to religion,
controversy _ even recycled controversy _ still sells. The second
is that sometimes your friends can never do as much for you as your
enemies can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes authors must hope and pray someone will
condemn their work, because it's the greatest thing that could
happen to it,'' said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of America, a
magazine published by the Jesuit order. ``It's like the old `Banned
in Boston' ad for pornographic films.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi'' was canceled and then reinstated by the
Manhattan Theater Club last summer after the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights condemned it and the theater received
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic League and others said they objected to both the
play's content and what they saw as a continuing double standard.
They say that in artistic expression there are protected groups
(blacks, Jews, gays) about whom anything remotely offensive rarely
sees the light of day, while others (Christians, WASPs, lower-class
whites) are considered fair game for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   When the furor over ``Corpus Christi'' erupted last summer,
columnist Patrick J. Buchanan termed it ``nothing less than a hate
crime of modernity directed against Christians, the moral
equivalent of Nazis marching through Skokie.''
</P>
<P>
   William Donahue of the Catholic League said, ``The need to
offend Catholics is so deep and so sick it can only be described as
pathological.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the liberal leanings of many dramatists and other artists
and those who sponsor them, the charge of a double standard is not
without merit. It's hard to imagine, for example, jokes about poor
whites stirring quite the same outrage as virtually identical ones
about poor blacks.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's conceivable that Saramago could have won the
Nobel if he were a gay-bashing fascist instead of a committed
communist critical of the Catholic Church, it doesn't seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   But the double-standard argument only goes so far, as some
Catholic intellectuals concede. There are far uglier things than
negative portrayals, as was made clear last week when a gay college
student in Wyoming died after being kidnapped, robbed,
pistol-whipped and left tied to a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some anti-Catholic sentiment that runs deep in the
culture, but you don't see Catholics being targets of violence,''
said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit deacon and associate editor of
America. ``You can't compare it to virulent racism or
anti-Semitism. I think it trivializes your argument when you try to
put everyone on the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin added that the notion of Christians as a free-strike zone
in art and popular culture is an outdated one at a time when
fundamentalist organizations and groups like Donahue's now play the
game of victimhood with all the zeal of other special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Catholic League is that they cry wolf too
frequently,'' he said. ``I don't think every criticism of the
church is de facto anti-Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper and more complicated issue is what is fair and what
goes over the line in dealing with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more resonant story in the Western world than that
of Jesus' life, so it inspires many retellings, with the Jesus
figure being appropriated by Latinos, blacks, gays _ you name it.
The ultimate tribute to the power of the story is that so many
groups want to reinterpret it 2,000 years later.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that makes the story of Jesus a target for
cheap shots and tiresome, ritualistic debates like the one over
``Corpus Christi.'' Indeed, when the play opened, the general
critical reaction was not that it was so offensive but that it was
so lame. The Philadelphia Inquirer dismissed it as ``a terrible
play, a hopeless jumble of juvenile humor and mawkish
sentimentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``Corpus Christi'' has sold lots of tickets, no
doubt a side effect if not an aim of all the controversy. Which
perhaps offers a final lesson about raising such a ruckus before
the first curtain rises: It probably makes sense to see a play
before waging a holy war against it.

 TAILORING THE S&AMP;L CRISIS TO SAVE JAPAN'S BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A good portion of the financial system was buried
under a mountain of bad debts that was growing bigger with each
passing day. Yet politicians, pressed by powerful interests and
afraid of committing huge sums of taxpayer money to the problem,
were dithering about how to respond. Other nations looked on with
concern and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   There are striking parallels between the United States in 1988
as it struggled to address its savings and loan crisis and Japan in
1998 as it grapples with a banking system so burdened with sour
loans that it has virtually stopped lending.
</P>
<P>
   In those similarities are many lessons about mistakes to be
avoided. And given that the United States eventually dealt with the
near-collapse of its savings and loan industry _ decisively if
belatedly _ there may also be a road map in the American experience
toward a solution for Japan and other nations where a recovery from
the global economic crisis depends on resuscitating their enfeebled
banking systems.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is still in the process of recognizing the severity of its
banking problems and that any solution will be expensive and
painful. It took a big step down that path Friday when the
Parliament agreed on major elements of a plan to spend around $500
billion of taxpayer money to shore up ailing banks and make it
easier for the government to take over insolvent ones.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Japanese government, which has allowed the problem to
fester for years, has to prove to a skeptical world that it has the
resolve to use those tools. The Clinton administration, in
particular, is convinced that Japan cannot pull itself out of
recession and help address the rest of Asia's woes until it has
dealt with the problem. It has grown increasingly impatient with
Tokyo for not moving more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   It maybe worth remembering, however, that it took the United
States years to face up to the damage done to the economy by the
wholesale failures that swept the savings and loan industry during
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Much like their Japanese counterparts now, U.S. regulators and
industry executives initially bet that they could wait out the
problem, that depressed prices for the real estate they had
foreclosed on would bounce back, that a stronger economy would
eventually strengthen their borrowers and enable them to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is getting a consensus that you have a
problem that can't be solved by conventional means,'' said John
Ryan, a former head of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set
up to sell off real estate and other assets of failed savings
institutions. ``It's a very difficult consensus to achieve and we
were a long time in achieving it. You can remember the time we
spent in this country kidding ourselves and believing that the
markets would bail us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was only in 1989, after hundreds of savings
institutions had failed and economists began frightening
politicians into action by estimating that the problems would cost
hundreds of billions of dollars to fix, that Congress and the Bush
administration became serious about dealing with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1989, Congress passed legislation intended to make it
easier for regulators to seize control of insolvent or failing
savings institutions and sell off their component parts. The idea
was that the financial system's problems and the depressive effect
they were having on the real estate market and the general economy
were best solved by taking a painful hit in a concentrated period.
</P>
<P>
   The key to making it work was the RTC, which quickly became the
repository of all the repossessed office buildings, strip malls and
houses accumulated by unwise or unlucky or crooked savings and loan
managers around the country, as well as their money-losing
portfolios of high-risk junk bonds and other questionable assets.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much of a market for many of the properties. To
get things moving, the agency sold some real estate and other
assets for bargain prices. The sales drew more buyers for other
properties, generating more competition and higher prices. The
agency packaged some properties together to make them more
attractive to investors, and spruced up others.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 through the early 1990s, the government shut down 747
savings institutions with assets of $455 billion. By the time they
had all been picked apart and sold off by the RTC, the gap between
what they owed depositors and what all their assets were worth was
$84.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the $70 billion in losses run up by the several
hundred additional savings institutions that had failed between
1986 and 1989, the total bill to the taxpayer and the
industry-financed deposit insurance program was nearly $155
billion. But the problem was dealt with in just a few years _ the
agency, its job completed, was disbanded in 1995 _ and the country
and the economy could move on.
</P>
<P>
   Now governments in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan,
among other countries, are trying to adopt big portions of the U.S.
approach. Officials from Japan in particular have spent
considerable time with officials at the Office of Thrift
Supervision and other regulatory agencies in Washington. The main
message they hear from the United States is the necessity of moving
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RTC made the very tough decision just to sell at market
regardless of what market was,'' said Jonathan Fiechter, the former
top savings and loan regulator in America, who now works for the
World Bank advising developing nations how to clean up financial
messes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Asia they're running into great trouble with criticism
about fire sale prices, since you're often selling assets of people
who are friends of very senior people,'' he said. ``The lesson of
the RTC was that eventually you get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means clear that Japan, whose problems dwarf
those of other nations, has accepted that lesson. Banks are
reluctant to seek help from the government voluntarily, since doing
so involves a loss of face for the managers, if not the loss of
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Big borrowers, especially construction companies that are major
contributors to the governing Liberal Democratic Party, are
pressing the government to give banks more time. Troubled banks
continue to hide their losses from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has cleared a big hurdle in proving willing in principle
to spend huge sums of money on the problem. But Bert Ely, a
consultant who tracked the savings and loan crisis here, said the
Japanese plan so far has been nothing more than a facade, since the
government has been unwilling to force banks to prove they can
survive or shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks almost entirely like what we were doing before 1989
in the sense of delaying the inevitable, postponing a resolution of
the banking problems and of the bad loans,'' Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that the hole in fact kept getting deeper,'' he
added. ``It's like a credit card balance. It doesn't peak and then
subside, the problem just keeps getting bigger.''

 &HT;    ``I have here in my hand a list of 205 _ a list of names that
were made known to the secretary of state as being members of the
Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping
policy in the State Department.''
 &HT;    _ Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Feb. 9, 1950, Wheeling, W.Va.
 &HT;    
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the most infamous speeches in U.S. politics.
Delivered just months after the Soviet Union detonated its first
atomic device _ a replica of the U.S. bomb right down to the bolts
_ and months before the communist North invaded South Korea and
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with selling nuclear
secrets to Moscow, McCarthy's words set off a period of political
hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   It would be some time before the nation grasped that he not only
had no scruples but that he also had no list. By then, many
honorable Americans whose sentiments leaned to the left _ among
them, teachers and actors, journalists and government functionaries
_ had lost their jobs in a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But half a century later, with Soviet-era archives open, it
turns out there was a list. Not the fake one brandished by McCarthy
before a group of Republican women, but a real one, with code names
and salary receipts and carbons of sensitive messages on the
Manhattan Project and U.S. diplomatic strategy that were passed to
the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the Soviet evidence starting in the early
1990s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the 1995-1996
declassification of U.S. intelligence files on the interception of
Soviet spy cables _ now widely known as the Venona decryptions _
has unleashed a flood of scholarship. In a replay of old battles,
it is a debate over U.S. communism and McCarthyism with two
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   One side is asking: If the left was so wrong so recently, why
should it be listened to at all? The other side counters that when
the right is given a chance, as it was in the early 1950's, it
becomes vicious. And with the Cold War won, it argues, there is a
whiff of right-wing triumphalism in the air that must not go
unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   The new documents certainly sully many icons of the old left.
Julius Rosenberg, it is now clear, was guilty (though there is
still debate about his wife's complicity). Alger Hiss, according to
respected new scholarship, was probably a Soviet agent and the U.S.
government in the 1930s and '40s harbored hundreds of communist
spies and even more fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to come. Next year, Ronald Radosh, a senior
research associate at George Washington University, will publish
what he says is a devastating picture of the Spanish Civil War _ as
a gruesome example of Soviet imperialism dressed up as
anti-fascism, rather than as the epic, noble battle the left has
always said it was.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that, given the ferocity of the political
struggle at the time, the scholarly struggle over the new data is
raw and impassioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand you have scholars showing that many members of
the Communist Party were motivated by a legitimate desire to fight
social injustice,'' said Jonathan Brent, editorial director of Yale
University Press, which is publishing 25 volumes on the new
material titled ``Annals of Communism.'' ``But at the top of the
party they were controlled by Moscow. How do you reconcile the
two?''
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence has appeared so quickly and so forcefully, and
at a time when communism is so bereft of defenders and intellectual
capital, that some have flirted with the rehabilitation of McCarthy
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, The Observer of London stated: ``McCarthy has gone down
as one of the most reviled men in U.S. history, but historians are
now facing the unpleasant truth that he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   In The Washington Post, Nicholas von Hoffman wrote, ``Point by
point, Joe McCarthy got it all wrong and yet was still closer to
the truth than those who ridiculed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assertions send chills down the spine of Ellen Schrecker, a
historian at Yeshiva University, whose new book, ``Many Are the
Crimes: McCarthyism in America'' (Little, Brown), argues that
whatever harm may have come to the country from Soviet-sponsored
spies is dwarfed by McCarthy's wave of terror, which crushed
livelihoods as well as any alternative political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   She said social developments like government-provided health
care and strong labor unions _ things commonplace elsewhere in the
West _ were stymied in America. And, she added, the China hands in
the State Department who could have fended off the disaster of the
Vietnam War had been purged for suspected communist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the gush of new scholarship from the archives is less
rigorous than it appears, say Professor Schrecker and others,
including Victor Navasky, publisher of The Nation, who wrote
``Naming Names'' (Viking, 1980), a book about Hollywood
blacklisting. The scholarship relies heavily on the boasts of
Soviet-paid agents in America eager to impress their Moscow
masters. And, they say, it is scholarship with an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening today is an effort to deny the legitimacy
not just of those who favored the Communist Party but the entire
left-wing political movement in the post-Berlin Wall moment,'' said
Nelson Lichtenstein, a history professor at the University of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole anti-racist, anti-capitalist impulse in American
life, which reached its apogee in the 1930s and '40s, is on the
line. If it turns out these movements were the results of
communists advancing their goals, are they still legitimate? People
like Ron Radosh want to discredit not only that historical episode
but the moral legitimacy of the left in the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   Radosh says he has little patience for these arguments. ``I deal
with issues of historical truth,'' he said. ``The left's inability
to accept this truth is what discredits the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, too, something more personal is at stake. Many of the
most passionate advocates on both sides of this struggle, including
Radosh and Professor Schrecker, were ``red diaper'' babies, weaned
on the left. The debate pits those upholding the honor of their
idealistic parents against those who believe their own honor
requires them to expose the deceptions on which they were raised.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Buckley Jr., whose new novel on McCarthy is due out
next summer, said many Americans looking back on the espionage
dismiss its significance because there is so little threat from
Moscow today that to them it is hard to remember how serious the
peril was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of stealing secrets is seen today as a kind of
misjudgment, a form of eccentric behavior,'' said Buckley, who was
an early friend and defender of McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much damage was done is a matter of some contention.
No one suggests that a communist coup was afoot or that the nation
was in existential danger. But the Soviets did build the bomb a
year or two earlier than they would have _ no small feat _ and it
is not hard to imagine other damage that might have resulted from
unchecked spying.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Klehr, a historian at Emory University and co-author of
the new book ``The Soviet World of American Communism'' (Yale
University Press), has mused that if Franklin D. Roosevelt had died
earlier, his vice president during the third term, Henry Wallace,
would have become president. Wallace had once said that as
president he would make Laurence Duggan his secretary of state and
Harry Dexter White his Treasury secretary. Evidence in the Venona
messages suggests that both were Soviet agents, Professor Klehr
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why people like Buckley argue that McCarthy has been
maligned by history. ``McCarthy's excesses have to be taken in the
context of other work he did,'' Buckley said. ``For example, his
concentration on security loyalty practices was absolutely
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Naftali, a senior fellow at the Miller Center of the
University of Virginia, said McCarthy gave anti-communism a bad
name, but that a fair examination of communist activity during and
after World War II would show that anti-communist paranoia was
understandable and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI and military officials had lists of hundreds of
unidentified code names that appeared in Soviet intelligence
traffic and had every reason to believe that many of those names
belonged to agents still operating,'' he said. Many of the code
names have yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets became aware of U.S. interceptions by the end of the
1940s _ thanks to Kim Philby, then a Washington-based double agent
of British intelligence _ and shut down their operation just as
McCarthy was coming on the scene and U.S. counter-intelligence was
swinging into action.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time McCarthy was hunting communists, most of the
agents were gone. It is a quirk of history, but one apparent only
through the perspective of the archives.
</P>
<P>
   As the century draws to a close, communism and Nazism are being
increasingly grouped as 20th-century paradigms of totalitarian
horror. But once the Soviets were seen for what they were, were
those who insisted on waiting for ``true'' communism fools? Or
knaves?
</P>
<P>
   It was Hitler who said people prefer a big lie to a small truth,
and the proponents of Soviet communism certainly understood that.
It was the very depth of their betrayal that made it so hard for
American communists to grasp the deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we realized that what we thought was heaven really was
hell, we fell into silence,'' said Robert Schrank, a former
communist and union leader who has just published a memoir titled,
``Wasn't That a Time? Growing Up Radical and Red in America'' (MIT
Press). ``We were overwhelmed with shame.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains, in part, the uncivil nature of today's dialogue
and why it will likely be some time before a full accounting can be
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these first documents come out, we are having a debate,''
said Brent of Yale University Press. ``But it is a slow historical
process, something involving our national consciousness, and I
think it will be at least five to 10 years before a historian
arises who can really put this all in perspective.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept of a trillion has shifted in recent weeks from a
fuzzy, imprecise and somewhat abstract notion into a hard-edged
number like, say, 47 or 254 or 7,453.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because of the Long-Term Capital Management fiasco,
trillion has become the next big thing. (Of course, the federal
budget passed $1 trillion several years ago, but nobody pays
attention to it.)
</P>
<P>
   Before this recent shift in consciousness, a trillion, at least
in everyday usage, was an expression more akin to zillion,
gazillion and jillion. It was a way of connoting scads, heaps,
plenitude and humongosity. In this it was like a light year. No one
ever experienced a light year and no one ever saw a trillion
anything. It was a poetic concept like all the stars in the heavens
and all the grains of sand on the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   But when Long-Term Capital Management's troubles became
newsworthy in early October, it was reported that the firm had
entered into ``exotic financial transactions'' valued at $1.25
trillion. Derivatives and forward contracts might not be
universally comprehensible, but the basic image conveyed by the
news stories was not at all meant as an abstract concept, like
stars in the Milky Way. Anyone who plays poker could understand it;
a group of people, a very finite group of people, were sitting
around a table and making bets trying to win a pot worth $1.25
trillion, a figure even more impressive when it is represented like
this: $1,250,000,000,000. That is quite real. It is so real it is
scary.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, it may be useful to note that if somebody
wanted to distribute $1 trillion equally among all 240 million
Americans, he would have to dispense more than $4,000 to every man,
woman and child.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a dollar sign in front of very big numbers tends to make
them real, though this does not always work for other units of
wealth. For example, one can go to the Numismatic Museum in New
York and gaze at the quintillion pengo note that circulated in
Hungary during a period of hyperinflation after World War II.
Despite its 18 zeros, six more than those of a trillion, it is not
really awe-inspiring. Even in the heyday of the pengo, one probably
couldn't get much for a trillion, or quartillion or quintillion of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a lesson here. Dollars, like pengos, fluctuate over
time. And just as there are forces of inflation and devaluation
affecting currencies, so there are semantic shifts in the numbers
that come to be associated with money. Take millions and billions,
which were as mythical as trillions were before Long-Term Capital
helped make them a household concept.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a million dollars was a pretty high
standard. Telling somebody they looked like a million was
considered a high compliment. Similarly, a millionaire was a rare
species, generally depicted in cartoons as a cigar-smoking person
in a top hat. Now, according to ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' a
best seller since it appeared in 1997, there are 3.5 million of
them. That's 3,500,000, households. Though this is not exactly a
dime a dozen, it is not one in a million either.
</P>
<P>
   And within the last decade, some people began to be designated
as billionaires. This has led to some confusion between the
categories, notably the assumption that millionaires and
billionaires are related subspecies who graze together. This is a
fallacy that may be made clear by the following facts: A person
with the net worth of $1 is closer in wealth to a person with a net
worth of $50 million than the person with $50 million is to the
person with $1 billion. Much, much closer. After all, the person
with $1 is only $49,999,999 behind the millionaire, while the
millionaire is $950,000,000 behind the billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   This co-mingling of truly fat cats and the merely plump has long
bothered John Allen Paulos, a Temple University mathematician who
has written entertainingly about mathematics in everyday life. He
advocates using scientific notation to describe the rich instead of
the indistinct millionaire or multimillionaire, which could mean
anyone who possessed more than a million or less than a billion
(which the British refer to quite correctly as a thousand million).
</P>
<P>
   Paulos thinks exponents would help put the very rich in their
appropriate places. For example, if one were to read about a 6 x
107 centerfielder, one could immediately determine that this was a
$60 million variety of millionaire. A 3 x 106 adolescent baby
sitter would be established as a $3-million member of the phylum.
And so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Greater precision could also be achieved by borrowing from
Indian usage. Indians, who number at least 8 x 108, have an
increasingly useful word _ crore _ which means 10 million. And
should the time come when the currently awesome trillion turns out
to be small potatoes, there is the googol, which is the number 1
followed by 100 zeros, or 10100. And if that's not enough, there is
the googolplex which is 10 to the power googol.

<P>
   With congressional elections just around the corner and the
House impeachment inquiry of President Clinton set to start shortly
afterward, public opinion polls are more numerous, more important
and possibly more confusing than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In any election year, pollsters try to predict which voters will
go to the polls and what they will do when they get there. Turnout
is important, but issues and circumstances like the state of the
economy are what often drive the result.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the conventional wisdom has it, turnout is
everything. If the presidential sex scandal galvanizes Clinton
opponents, Republicans win. If the widespread public distaste for
impeachment proceedings mobilizes a backlash vote, Democrats may
gain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   So pollsters are focusing even more than usual this year on
figuring out who will really take the trouble to vote, searching
for that mythical beast known as the ``likely voter.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing pre-election polls, here are some things to look
for:
</P>
<P>
   Accurate Sampling
</P>
<P>
   Good polls start with good samples of the population from all
geographical areas and segments of society. In recent decades, this
has been accomplished by ``random digit dialing,'' in which a
computer selects area codes and exchanges and then makes up the
last four digits at random to form complete telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades pollsters have demonstrated how 1,000 or so people
can accurately represent all adults in the entire nation _ plus or
minus a few percentage points, the potential fluctuation that is
inherent in every poll because it is a sampling rather than a
census.
</P>
<P>
   Likely Voters
</P>
<P>
   In the period leading up to any election, pollsters make a big
mistake if they try to represent all adults in their polls. In the
1996 presidential election, only about 49 percent of all adults
actually voted. In the 1994 midterm election, about 39 percent
voted.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is critical to screen for likely voters by discarding
the opinions of half to two-thirds of all adults polled.
</P>
<P>
   Each polling organization has its own screening method. The
Gallup Organization, which polls for USA Today and CNN, has one of
the most elaborate and well-tested systems. It gives respondents
points for voting in past elections, their current intention to
vote and their knowledge of where to go to vote, among other
factors. Respondents score from zero to seven points; Gallup then
picks those respondents with the most points, working down until
they reach a percentage of the total group that is equal to the
expected nationwide turnout (expected to be 39 percent this year).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News Poll, by comparison, screens in
several ways. ``Likely voters'' in this year's polls are those who
say they voted in either 1996 or 1994, who say they are paying
attention to this year's campaign, and who say they will definitely
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``More likely voters'' differ by saying they voted in both 1996
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Times has found that its polling results become more
pro-Republican when the focus is limited to likely and more likely
voters, suggesting that if turnout is lower than usual this year,
it will help Republicans. But Gallup does not find nearly so strong
a pattern, suggesting that the contest remains very close at all
levels of turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup vice president David Moore maintains that the
organization's standard ``likely voter'' questions should still be
adequate even in this unusual year. Moore says a person who shows
little history of voting in past elections but who becomes
motivated to vote this year by the presidential scandal or the
impeachment hearings might well be overlooked as a likely voter.
But he added that he thought the people most likely to be roused to
vote by the scandal or hearings would probably be strong
Republicans or strong Democrats who are already frequent past
voters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phrasing of Questions
</P>
<P>
   Even though the latest Gallup and Times/CBS News polls issued
last week agree in many areas, Gallup found that most Americans
believe their incumbent Representatives deserve re-election. The
Times/CBS News poll, on the other hand, found Americans to be
narrowly split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Closer examination suggests that the discrepancy may be due to
the different wording of the questions. Gallup asked: ``Please tell
me whether or not you think each of the following political
officeholders deserves to be re-elected. First, most members of the
House of Representatives; second, your own representative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll linked re-election to job performance,
and also asked whether it is time to give new candidates a chance,
thus offering a potential reason why a respondent might prefer not
to re-elect an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of questions clearly show that people like their own
Representative better than they like Congress in the aggregate, and
both organizations find, each using its own questions, that
willingness to re-elect incumbents is higher now than it was in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple Polls
</P>
<P>
   It is a pollster's maxim that the truth lies not in any one poll
but at the center of gravity of several polls. When polls agree, it
often means the findings are solid. But when they disagree, it
often means the findings are more fragile or tentative.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice, therefore, is to track the findings of several
organizations.

   Hey, does this ring a bell? Dogged by an aggressive prosecution,
a political leader denies an illicit affair _ ``I did not have sex
with her!'' _ although one of his own associates swears to it. In
addition, the leader is accused of hitting up constituents for
illicit contributions, of using government employees and resources
for his own purposes and even of sending operatives out to threaten
people.

<P>
   In a coincidence confirming that sex in politics is truly
ancient news, the Semitic Museum of Harvard University is
exhibiting cuneiform tablets from a corruption-and-sex
investigation about as old as Moses.
</P>
<P>
   You might even call these tablets the original Starr
transcripts. They were unearthed in northern Iraq in the late 1920s
thanks largely to years of digging by Richard F.S. Starr, an
archaeologist from the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard. Could he and

   The exhibition, ``Nuzi and the Hurrians: Fragments From a

was planned well before the news broke in January of the
presidential sex scandal involving President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky. But the parallels soon became clear.

<P>
   The tablets, from the museum's collection, record a judicial
panel's impeachment proceedings against Mayor Kushshiharbe of Nuzi,
a regional center of the ancient Mittani empire, near present-day
Kirkuk in Iraq.

<P>
   Alas, not all of the impeachment tablets are on display, since
some were left behind in Baghdad _ including the testimony covering
the illicit affair. But not to worry: Those and others, many having
a lot to do with sheep, were previously translated, and are
excerpted here.

modernity, this scandal has no clear resolution _ not, however,
because the investigation continued interminably. Rather, because

never been found.(END ITALICS HERE)

 DEMOCRATS AND STARR: BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ASK FOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are salivating over the prospect of
making Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr their star witness in next
month's House impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that by criticizing the special prosecutor and putting
his tactics in the spotlight, they may deflect some attention from
President Clinton's legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   But would Starr accept an invitation, or a summons, to appear
before the Judiciary Committee? It is not clear that he has to, but
he almost certainly would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Starr will continue to cooperate with and respond to the
Congress,'' said Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for the independent
counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for having an independent counsel testify
before Congress. In 1997 Donald Smaltz, the independent counsel who
has been investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy,
appeared before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee
to complain that the Justice Department had undermined his
investigation by opposing its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   After complaining about White House delaying tactics and
stonewalling, it would be difficult for Starr to avoid testifying.
And after more than four years of keeping largely mum as he
investigated President Clinton and faced mounting attacks from
White House allies, Starr might actually welcome the opportunity to
introduce himself to the American public in his own words. Even
some Democrats are worried that Starr, a former federal judge and
solicitor general, might give a strong performance as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats planned an expansive inquisition of Starr, House
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde was talking of streamlining the 15
separate impeachment charges outlined by his committee's chief
counsel, David Schippers, and of trying to wrap up the proceedings
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde and his Republican colleagues would be hard-pressed to
oppose Democratic moves to put Starr on the witness stand, even if
they had the votes to do so. (The 21 Republicans on the committee
can overrule the 16 Democrats, but Hyde has said he hopes there can
be bipartisan agreement on witnesses.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that they'd be clobbered politically if they
didn't call Kenneth Starr,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently recognizing that reality, Hyde has said that an
appearance by Starr is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Judiciary Committee allies have put Starr at the top
of their wish list of witnesses. ``Kenneth Starr deserves to be
before the Judiciary Committee for many, many things,'' said Rep.
John Conyers Jr., the panel's senior Democrat, who also served
during the Watergate hearings two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats on the committee have said they may also want to
summon some of Starr's deputies, as well as a group of conservative
lawyers, including a one-time law partner of Starr. These lawyers
advised the legal team working on Paula Corbin Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president and helped steer Linda
Tripp to Starr last January, launching the sex-and-perjury probe of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first meeting between White House lawyers and the
committee lawyers will not begin until later this week, the
president's allies are already mapping out the areas on which they
would like to grill Starr.
</P>
<P>
   A major focus for the Democrats will be to pursue allegations of
collusion between the Jones lawyers and Starr's office. Democrats
have reviewed an Oct. 5 letter from David Kendall, one of Clinton's
private attorneys, to Attorney General Janet Reno in which Kendall
raised questions about communications between Starr's office and
the Jones team.
</P>
<P>
   One issue raised in the letter is a report in The New York Times
about Starr's office having received, through intermediaries, a tip
about Ms. Tripp before she contacted the independent counsel's
office. Democrats have also seized on a National Public Radio
report about Starr's conversations with one of Ms. Jones' former
lawyers before he was appointed independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr did not disclose these consultations to the Justice
Department before requesting an expansion of the investigation into
matters relating to Monica Lewinsky and the Jones case, lawyers
familiar with the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may also question Starr about whether his office
leaked confidential information to the news media, a matter that is
already under investigation on the orders of a federal judge in
Washington. Starr has denied any improper contacts with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas the Democrats plan to pursue, according to several
committee aides, include the grounds on which Starr sought to
expand his Whitewater inquiry into the Lewinsky case; his office's
treatment of Ms. Lewinsky during early immunity talks last January,
and the independent counsel's dealings with Ms. Tripp in the days
before he received permission to expand his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to show that Starr is the most overzealous
prosecutor ever,'' said a strategist with close ties to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for such a strategy to backfire is not
insignificant. The fanatical prosecutor Democrats hope to introduce
in televised hearings is a polished lawyer whose testimony could
deflate the caricature of a pursed-lipped chief of the nation's sex
police. Though his White House critics have portrayed him as having
a tin ear when it comes to public relations, Starr could use his
turn as a witness to lay out a compelling case against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to come off the way James Carville portrays
him,'' said Theodore Olson, a Washington lawyer and friend of
Starr. ``He doesn't drool. He doesn't have two heads or pointed
teeth.'' Olson said he expected Starr to be a sympathetic witness
who would not lose his cool no matter how hostile the questions
get. ``I don't think I've ever seen Ken get mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats are so nervous that Starr's appearance could
boomerang that they want to take his deposition behind closed
doors, a proposal Republicans would probably reject.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic strategist fretted that a Starr appearance at
impeachment hearings might wind up like Clinton's videotaped
testimony before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans kept saying how devastating the tape would
be,'' said the Democrat, ``but the public sympathized with him.
It's natural to sympathize with the person in the hot seat.''

 ALMOST, BUT NOT QUITE, DEJA BLUE ALL OVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, it's not your imagination. New York really does
seem to be living through 1987 all over again. Just look at the
calendar: Monday is Oct. 19, the very date that will live in
financial infamy as Black Monday, when the stock market plunged 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other, creepier parallels, as a glance over some
old and new headlines will attest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Donald Trump was bent on gracing the city's
skyline with a new ``world-class'' tower _ although back then it
was the West Side (``Celebrities Open Wallets to Fight Trump's
Project''), while this time it's the East Side (``Trump Starts New
Tower Near the U.N.'').
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, scandal rocked Wall Street's elite _ except then
it was insider trading starring Ivan Boesky, not hedge-fund havoc
with John Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as now, George Steinbrenner was threatening to move
the Yankees to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As they do today, tourists thronged the streets, to the
increasing annoyance of the natives. In the city, prices of luxury
co-ops were in the stratosphere, as they are now, and new office
towers were sprouting in midtown, a little to the north and west of
today's hot spot, Times Square. Unemployment dropped to levels
unseen in years, like nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market began falling from its peak in the summer,
just as it did this year. Worrywarts brooded about the city's
growing dependence on Wall Street. And, as if to confirm those
fears, Salomon Brothers on Oct. 12, 1987, announced big layoffs _
much as Merrill Lynch announced last week (on Oct. 13, to be
precise) that it was eliminating thousands of jobs, including 1,000
employees and outside consultants in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are differences, and not merely the Land Rovers in
place of Jaguars as status symbols. Investment in the stock market
is more pervasive, thanks to mutual funds and retirement plans, but
investors seem less likely to be spooked _ at least so far. After
all, they still have the gains they made during three years of
astonishingly high returns.
</P>
<P>
   And most important, interest rates are far lower than they were
in 1987; in fact, they are lower now than they were just last week,
thanks to the Federal Reserve's actions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Crash of 1987, there were some immediate forecasts of
gloom and doom, but many in the city pooh-poohed the notion that
Wall Street's troubles would have a broad effect on most New
Yorkers. For a time they seemed to be right.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the following year, New York City government
revenues had fallen sharply, including toll collections, since
there were fewer commuters into Manhattan. The jobless rate began
to climb. By the spring of 1989 many who had bought apartments at
the peak found that they could not sell them for enough to cover
their mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The real recession had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that axing all those fat cats on Wall Street had
an effect on other people _ restaurant owners, accountants,
lawyers, bicycle messengers, real estate agents, panhandlers. It
just takes a while for the economic effects of any change to filter
out into the broader society.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that a similar recession is just around the
corner in the city that considers itself the world's financial
capital. This time around, the national economy is in much better
shape: The federal government is not running a deficit, inflation
is not a worry, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan isn't
raising interest rates as he was in 1987. The city's finances are
in far better shape too, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has already
budgeted for lower tax receipts from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But those who forget history _ well, you know. Or, as they say
on Wall Street, ``The most dangerous words in the English language
are, `It's different this time.' ''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 19. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Today, the New York Times and Los Angeles Times lead with
the continuance of the deadlocked Middle East talks in Queenstown,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post carries that story inside and goes instead
with another struggle between sworn enemies _ the Department of
Justice antitrust suit against Microsoft, which goes to trial
today.
</P>
<P>
   The three Middle East leads all quote a State Department
spokesman's information-free comment that the Queenstown atmosphere
``justifies continuing these discussions.'' The main issue is
whether Israel will cede a further parcel of land in the West Bank
to the Palestinian Authority in return for various security
guarantees, but there's no clear sense in the reporting of where
things stand.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT quotes an official saying real bargaining is taking
place, while the LAT and USAT state that right now, U.S. officials
are just anxious to find some sort of an agreement that all sides
could declare a success. The NYT says that failure to reach an
agreement would be a ``devastating blow to Clinton's prestige and
to the search for a Middle East peace.'' The paper is alone in
pointing out another source of pressure: the Oslo accords, which
govern the entire Palestinian/Israeli peace process, require a
final settlement of Palestine's borders by May 4.
</P>
<P>
   The three papers report that Arafat and Netanyahu, while
remaining at the conference compound, have not met face-to-face for
several days. The LAT communicates the dimmest view of what's
behind this, referring to ``once-bright hopes'' for the summit, and
saying there are ``ominous signs that things were not going as well
as the U.S. mediators implied.'' Citing Israeli press reports, the
paper says when the two leaders did last meet in person, the
atmosphere was ``tense and at times insulting.'' In particular,
Netanyahu was adamant about using the biblical terms for the West
Bank preferred by Israeli settlers, and he complained to Arafat
about the region's Arab car thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Like last Friday's USAT story on DOJ vs. Microsoft, the WP's
lead surveys the case from both sides and says that a key issue
will be just what happened at a 1995 meeting between Netscape and
MS officials. But also like that USAT story, the Post effort
doesn't explain why if the case pits Bill Gates against the feds
and 20 states, Gates won't be present in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   (A story in the Post's Style section essays to compare the
antagonists' cultures, claiming along the way that the DOJ has
large, drab offices while MS has large, cheery offices. Well, at
Slate at least, most of the offices are small and cheery. Slate is
owned by Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports that Wal-Mart has sued
Amazon.com over what the Arkansas-based retailer says is an attempt
to obtain the trade secrets of its computer system for identifying
and mining customer preference data. Besides the online book
retailer, personally named in the suit is Amazon's chief
information officer, whose previous job was at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The off-lead at the NYT follows up on the paper's earlier
reporting on the transfer of satellite technology to China during
the Clinton administration. The paper describes how quite
generally, liberalized trading rules worked for by Clinton, not
only generated increased sales for America's high tech companies
but also may have allowed China to obtain a wide range of
sophisticated technology that has already been put to military use.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's LAT led with an enterprise piece about how the
California prison system is unique in the entire country in using
deadly force to break up inmate fights. Since 1994, state guards
have killed 12 inmates who were fighting. This is the latest
installment in the paper's repeated looks in the past year into the
dark corners of California's penal system, all the more commendable
because this degree of follow-up is so unusual. In a profession
obsessed with scoops, it's nice to see some digging instead.
Pulitzer committee, take note.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the LAT dedicates 30 column-inches to a
Column One story about widespread plagiarism in political speeches.
The story points to instances of word theft involving FDR, JFK,
Reagan, Bush and a host of California politicians. The piece
retells in some detail for the umpteenth time the story of how Sen.
Joseph Biden was ridden out of the 1988 presidential election for
what the paper calls ``burglary.'' Yet the LAT never mentions any
of the well-documented instances of plagiarism by journalists, even
though many of them are more recent and at least as flagrant as
Biden's.
</P>
<P>
   Absence-minded. The NYT runs the following correction: ``An
article on Friday about the New York Senate race misstated the
congressional voting record of the Democratic candidate, Charles E.
Schumer. He was present for about 77 percent of the votes this
campaign year; he did not miss 77 percent of the votes.''

   &UR; Burning the Days: Recollection &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By James Salter. Vintage International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist recalls his many careers -- fighter pilot,
expatriate in Paris, screenwriter -- as if they were a series of
love affairs bound by masculine energy and a fondness for women. In
1997 our reviewer, Samuel Hynes, said this memoir gives ``eloquent
witness to the ... power of the human imagination to re-create in
language the feeling of being, with all its elations and
despairs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The History of the Siege of Lisbon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jos Saramago. Translated by Giovanni Pontiero.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this ingenious novel is a humble proofreader who in
a flash of creative lunacy alters the national saga of Portugal by
inserting a single word into a standard history text. His
publishing house is outraged, but his boss is intrigued by his
subversiveness and urges him to follow up on his impulse to rewrite
the past. In recounting their highbrow courtship, the Portuguese
author, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature earlier this
month, ``has a sure sense of the pleasurable danger of seduction,
the fear of offending, the wild hope of wooing,'' Edmund White
wrote in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Franchise: A History of Sports Illustrated Magazine &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael MacCambridge. Hyperion, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This exhaustively researched book tracks the symbiotic rise of
big-time sports and one of the world's most successful magazines,
focusing on the combustible mix of raging egos, talent, crushing
pressures and Time Inc. cash that redefined sportswriting. Last
year our reviewer, Bruce McCall, called the author ``scrupulously
objective and fair-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The World is the Home of Love and Death: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Harold Brodkey. Metropolitan/Holt, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This posthumously published collection revisits the author's
childhood and his obsession with the many haunted voices of the
past. The characters -- like the tales -- are constantly changing,
by turns angry and gentle, crazy and sane. ``Brodkey's style is a
magnificent achievement,'' Jonathan Rosen wrote here in 1997. ``He
captured the child's world spinning inside the adult mind.'' Holt
has reissued  &UR; First Love and Other Sorrows: Stories &LR; , ($14), which
follows the lives of educated, middle-class people in the 1950s and
includes three new stories. In 1958 in The New York Times, William
Goyen said, ``Brodkey shows ... an uncommon perception of the
secret glow within the trivialities of our poor human majesty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing
Debate Over Science and Religion &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Edward J. Larson. Harvard University, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   Long before O.J., there was another trial of the century, the
Scopes ``monkey trial'' of 1925, which had everything a media
circus could ask for: faith versus reason, biology versus the Bible
and colorful lawyers jousting over the role of religion in public
life. This Pulitzer Prize-winning account is ``an excellent
cultural history of the case,'' Rodney A. Smolla said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lightning Song &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lewis Nordan. Algonquin, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Dearman is a goofy 12-year-old living on a Mississippi
llama farm who is driven to distraction by the women around him,
notably his mother and a seductive teen-age baton twirler. ``I love
this boy,'' Valerie Sayers wrote here in 1997. ``I also love the
excesses of this novel's language.''  &UR; The Starlite Drive-In &LR; , by
Marjorie Reynolds (Berkley, $6.99), also features an anxious
12-year-old hero: a tomboy who tells what happens when a brooding
stranger turns up to help her father run a drive-in theater in
Indiana. ``Reynolds tidily explores the gap between fantasy and
reality in her surely told first novel,'' Megan Harlan wrote in
these pages last year.

<P>
   &UR; Space Is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John F. Szwed. Da Capo, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Poole Blount, a k a Sun Ra, was the wildly eccentric
leader of an influential jazz ensemble that baffled and enchanted
listeners for more than 40 years until his death in 1993. ``Szwed
has produced a rare jazz biography -- one that takes full account
of the history that shaped the music and its central
personalities,'' Brent Staples wrote here in 1997. The same
publisher has issued  &UR; Milestones: The Music and Times of Miles
Davis &LR; , by Jack Chambers ($21.95), which combines both volumes of
the author's earlier biography of the trumpeter and includes a new
introduction detailing Davis's final years. Reviewing the second
volume here in 1985, Francis Davis said, ``Chambers deserves praise
for his assiduous research as well as for his insightful
criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Black Jacks: African American Seamen in the Age of Sail &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By W. Jeffrey Bolster. Harvard University, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   A historian pulls together two centuries of rousing nautical
lore, showing how seafaring commerce not only offered
African-Americans a sense of the wider world but allowed them to
bring back word of blacks in other countries. ``The book crackles
with enough drama for many novels or plays,'' Carla Davidson said
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; All Around Atlantis: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Eisenberg. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protagonists in this collection are affluent,
neglected children whose precocious perceptions are offset by an
inability to articulate them. Last year our reviewer, Jim Shepard,
found the stories to be ``spirited and masterly road maps through
sad and forbidding and desolate terrain.''

 Includes a color slide of Roberto Benigni with Giorgio Cantarini in
a scene from ``Life Is Beautiful.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The comedian is telling a story, and nobody's laughing.
 &HT;    ``Two years in a Nazi concentration camp,'' Roberto Benigni's
father would begin his stories, and his young son and daughter
would shudder with fear in their Tuscan villa.
 &HT;    The senior Benigni, an Italian farmer of Albanian descent,
fought for Italy in World War II. He was captured by the Nazis
after Italy changed sides in 1943, and spent the next two years in
a concentration camp in northern Germany.
 &HT;    By day, he was forced to build weapons for the Nazi army.
 &HT;    ``At night, he would watch his friends die,'' Benigni says.
``You see, the conditions were the same as a concentration camp for
Jews, except there was no gas chamber.''
 &HT;    The story always ended the same way, with the children's father
muttering about ``the 35 skeletons in the bunks near me. All my
friends, they die.''
 &HT;    Naturally, the children had nightmares, until one day their
mother put her foot down. She told her husband that he could no
longer speak of the war years unless he could do it with humor.
 &HT;    ``That night, my father started telling a different story,''
Benigni recalls. ``One with levity, about the captain in the camp
and the time he falls down. I know it sounds impossible, but the
stories were funny.
 &HT;    ``We started to laugh, and the nightmares ended.''
 &HT;    The young boy grew up to be Italy's favorite comedian, and those
stories sowed the seeds of what is being hailed as his greatest
film, ``La Vita E Bella,'' a.k.a. ``Life Is Beautiful.'' The film,
which opens Oct. 30 nationwide, is as much one man's creation as
any film can be: Benigni wrote it, directed it and stars in it,
with his real-life wife playing his on-screen wife.
 &HT;    It's the tale of Guido, an Italian Jew who has grand dreams of
owning his own bookstore until the Nazis take over. Only three
months before the war's end, he and his 5-year-old son are deported
to a German concentration camp. In order to save his son's life,
Guido uses his bold imagination and physical comedy to convince the
boy that they are just there to play a game.
 &HT;    It may sound unlikely, but it's hardly unlikable: ``Life is
Beautiful'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1988 Cannes Film
Festival, and is being touted as a candidate for multiple Oscars.
 &HT;    It represents a new level of fame for the 45-year-old Benigni,
previously best known outside of Italy for Jim Jarmusch's cult
classic ``Down by Law'' (1986) and Blake Edwards' ``Son of the Pink
Panther'' (1993).
 &HT;    But according to Benigni, as he sits down to talk about his film
at a Toronto hotel, he's already won the biggest prize he could
ask.
 &HT;    ``I screen the movie for my father in Florence,'' he says,
laughing. ``At the end, he screamed, `Son, you finally did good
movie! First time! Good movie!'''
 &HT;    Italians generally think Benigni has made good movies before,
but not movies like this.
 &HT;    ``In Italy, I'm so well known as a popular comedian. I am like
Donald Duck,'' he says. ``So Donald Duck making a movie about
Holocaust was hard for people to understand.''
 &HT;    The idea for the film came to him, Benigni says, when he came
across a line attributed to the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky.
Trapped in a bunker, waiting for Stalin's assassins to kill him _
as they ultimately did _ the Russian supposedly nevertheless wrote,
``Life is beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``The message to me is that, no matter what happens, there is
beauty in this life,'' the comedian says. ``You can find the
goodness.''
 &HT;    At core, he adds, ``Life is Beautiful'' isn't about the
Holocaust at all _ it's a love story between father and son.
 &HT;    ``What is more simple than a father protecting his son?'' he
asks. ``That is true love, with a real purity and innocence.''
 &HT;    Casting the role of the young boy was a challenge. Even when
Giorgio Cantarini won the part, problems continued.
 &HT;    ``I test hundreds of boys. When he entered, I stopped with
everything,'' Benigni recalls. ``This boy looks like me _ big nose!
His face is not right for TV!''
 &HT;    But young Cantarini couldn't read at the time.
 &HT;    ``He had to learn his lines by sheer memorization, which seemed
impossible,'' the director says. ``But he did it.''
 &HT;    Benigni filmed in Tuscany, where he was born and raised, and
where he could work closely with Milan's Center for Contemporary
Jewish Documentation. Camp survivors reviewed the script and gave
advice, but Benigni admits that he approached test screenings with
trepidation.
 &HT;    ``I was afraid I could hurt or offend someone because I am a
comedian,'' he admits. ``I didn't want to offend, because I respect
these survivors so much.''
 &HT;    To his delight, Milanese Jewish groups welcomed the film.
 &HT;    ``They loved the movie very much,'' he says, relief still
evident in his voice. ``There is no problem. Some survivors did
talk to me about it and said, `This not right. This could not have
happened this way.' I told them I am an artist. I needed to take
some license. I must be free.
 &HT;    ``Then I asked, `Are you offended or hurt by the script?' They
told me the script was wonderful.''
 &HT;    Even so, he admits that he found the screenings disconcerting.
 &HT;    ``As a comedian, I'm used to hearing people laugh,'' he says.
``In this movie, everybody was crying. I was confused, but happy.''
 &HT;    The film was already big before Miramax Films picked it up. Now
Benigni hears rumors of Oscars, not only for Best Foreign Film but
possibly also for Best Actor, Best Director, even Best Picture.
 &HT;    Not that he's short on prizes, mind you.
 &HT;    ``In Italy, they give me hundred prizes for this movie,'' he
says. ``In each town, Jewish community give me prizes. Now people
stop me on the street and say, `Hey, Benigni, here is a prize. Do
you want this?'
 &HT;    ``Every week, I have something new for the mantel. It's nice.''
 &HT;    It's a nice change for a comedian who has often talked his way
into trouble. Some jokes about Pope John Paul earned him a one-year
suspended prison sentence, while his sarcastic mockery of former
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have been credited with
contributing to the politician's downfall.
 &HT;    Even with the occasional controversy, Benigni says, he loves
being a comedian.
 &HT;    ``All men in Italy like to talk so much,'' he says, laughing.
``Every bum in Italy is a comedian except for our serious actors.
People like good laughter there, which always made me happy.''
 &HT;    Making movies is just an extension of his comedy act, he adds.
 &HT;    ``When I make movies, the crew becomes my audience,'' Benigni
says. ``I don't imagine that in six months people will be watching
in the theater. To be alive as an actor, you must act for someone.
You need someone to look at you in that moment.''
 &HT;    Comedy has its spiritual side, the comedian adds, which is part
of the appeal of ``Life Is Beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``When you laugh at something bad, it gives you a strange
power,'' he says. ``I think if you have the power to laugh, you
have the power to say, `I will not die.'
 &HT;    ``When we laugh, we are naked _ we are vulnerable,'' Benigni
says. ``But I think sometimes the biggest act of resistance is a
smile. If you turn your cry to a laugh, it is a triumph of the
human spirit.''

JAMES WOODS, VAMPIRE FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of James Woods in a scene from ``John
Carpenter's Vampires.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    James Woods as a vampire. Now, there's casting.
 &HT;    But that's not what you'll see when ``John Carpenter's
Vampires'' opens on Oct. 28. Instead, Woods has _ as usual _ chosen
the quirkier, less obvious role, in this case that of vampire
slayer Jack Crow, who leads a Vatican-sponsored team sent to hunt
down the merciless, 600-year-old Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).
 &HT;    Not that Crow is any knight in shining armor, of course.
 &HT;    ``I told John, `I want to make this hero the baddest guy
ever,''' Woods says, calling by cellular telephone from a Los
Angeles horror/sci-fi convention. ``I wanted to make a thin, thin
membrane between Jack Crow and Valek.
 &HT;    ``They're both really bad guys,'' he says, ``except one has a
sense of honor that he has to stop evil. Other than that, they
operate the same way. They're both absolute killer hunters.''
 &HT;    Actually, Woods says, he considers ``Vampires'' more of a
Western than a horror movie. Think ``The Wild Bunch'' (1969) meets
``Nosferatu'' (1922).
 &HT;    ``Whenever you take a great genre and do it again and again, it
sadly becomes a cliche,'' he says. ``When you reinvent it with a
new environment, all of a sudden it becomes great again.
 &HT;    ``So `Vampires' is a reinvented piece that combines genres, the
Western and horror genres, and that works like both genres do when
they're at their best.''
 &HT;    Woods performed his own stunts, he says, including standing 30
feet in front of a motel as 100 barrels of gasoline exploded
inside, and improvised most of his dialogue. He also sought to play
Crow straight, he adds, without the winks, nods and puns so often
supplied by veteran action stars as Bruce Willis and Sylvester
Stallone.
 &HT;    ``Vampires'' comes on the bloody heels of ``Blade,'' the Wesley
Snipes vampire thriller that has scared up nearly $70 million at
American theaters. Woods professes no fear of ``Blade,'' however.
 &HT;    ```Blade' will absolutely help us, more than you can imagine,''
he says.
 &HT;    He even thinks ``Vampires'' might outperform ``Blade.''
 &HT;    ``I love `Vampires,''' he says. ``I just had a great time doing
it, a great time watching it ... It was just a ball. To do a movie
that was exciting, to be heroic and work with all the weapons, it
was like being a kid again.''
 &HT;    Woods is already a hero to many actors, having shaped the kind
of rounded career that most others can only dream of. At 51, he's
equally likely to play heroes or villains, to turn up in major
features, independent films or television movies, and to try his
hand at comedy, adventure, horror or drama.
 &HT;    ``My attitude is that it's all work,'' he says. ``I don't care
what it is or where it goes. If it's something that I want to see _
say a sophisticated movie like `Ghosts of Mississippi' (1996) or
`Salvador' (1986) or `Citizen Cohn' (1992), a kids' movie like
`Hercules' (1997) or just a great, entertaining movie like
`Vampires' _ I do it.''
 &HT;    To general audiences, however, Woods is better known for his
volcanic turns in such films as ``Casino'' (1995) and ``Contact''
(1997) than for his subtle work in ``Immediate Family'' (1989) or
the television movie, ``My Name Is Bill W'' (1989).
 &HT;    Still, he says, he doesn't feel underappreciated.
 &HT;    ``I don't,'' he says. ``People still come up to me about `Bill
W.' Last Thanksgiving, a guy at a supermarket walked up to me in
tears and said, `Because of you I became sober. You saved my life.'
 &HT;    ``I said, `You saved your own life, God saved your life, but I'm
glad I was a little part of it, an instrument.'
 &HT;    ``I never feel underrated,'' he adds, ``though I wish some
movies I did, that had performances I really liked, had done
better. I did one, `Killer: A Journal of Murder' (1997), they
didn't bother to release very well, but people who see it tell me
it's so powerful.
 &HT;    ``It's happened a few times where I've given performances I'm
proud of that not a lot of people got to see,'' the actor says.
``That's bad distribution, bad luck or whatever.''
 &HT;    Perhaps Hollywood just doesn't know what to do with Woods, who's
twice divorced and lives in Los Angeles. He's handsome enough to
play lead roles, which he does, but quirky enough that he's rarely
anyone's first thought. He can play colorful villains with the best
of them, but has so many other aspects of his talent that he's not
at the top of anyone's list of villains.
 &HT;    ``I seem to be doing pretty well now,'' he says. ``The nature of
the business is such that you're either Bruce Willis or Steve
Buscemi _ and that's a compliment to Bruce and Steve _ and I've
been able to be sort of both.
 &HT;    ``One's a big action star and one's a very good character actor.
I've been lucky enough to do it all.''
 &HT;    Woods' current slate of films proves his point: He stars in
writer/director Sofia Coppola's independent feature, ``Virgin
Suicides,'' a black comedy in which he plays the father of a
teen-age girl who commits suicide. Then there's ``The General's
Daughter,'' with John Travolta, and ``True Crime,'' in which he
plays the fast-talking editor of renegade journalist Clint
Eastwood.
 &HT;    Right now Woods is filming ``Redstone,'' about the first days of
the space program, when chimps were put in orbit, and early next
year he'll co-star in the football-themed ``On Any Given Sunday.''
It's his third film for Oliver Stone, who also directed Woods in
``Salvador'' and ``Nixon'' (1995).
 &HT;    ``I think Oliver is a one-of-a-kind director and he thinks I'm a
one-of-a-kind actor,'' Woods says. ``We admire each other on that
level, and he's a really good friend.
 &HT;    ``Everybody gives him a hard time and thinks he's an odd
character,'' the actor adds, ``but if you call him and say, `I
haven't worked in a year, I need a job,' he'll give you a job.
 &HT;    ``In Hollywood, that's the best kind of friend you can have.''
 &HT;    There are plenty of people who think of Woods himself as an odd
character, he admits with a laugh.
 &HT;    ``I'm on the outside of Hollywood, and I'm on the inside of
it,'' he says. ``A lot of Hollywood icons are very good friends of
mine. Clint Eastwood and I are friends as well as colleagues. John
Travolta and I are friends. Sherry Lansing is a studio executive,
and she's a friend of mine.
 &HT;    ``But I also like to do independent films,'' the actor adds,
``because I find that work invigorating and cutting edge. People
get old and tired in this business if they don't avail themselves
of fresh opportunities.
 &HT;    ``I also don't have a problem calling up the Pate brothers and
saying, `What are you up to?''' he says. ``I like working with new
and exciting people.''
 &HT;    As he's aged, Woods has continued to work with some of the best
rising young talent, and he doesn't see any reason why that
shouldn't continue.
 &HT;    ``I am the coolest guy on the planet with the under-5 set
because of `Hercules,''' says Woods, who provided the voice of the
deliciously villainous Hades in Disney's hit animated feature.
``I'll be 70 and those kids, my fan base, will be the directors and
writers of the future.
 &HT;    ``I'm telling you, when these kids grow up I'll have a job
forever.''

 Includes a color slide of actor/director Orson Welles as he
appeared during his days with CBS radio. 
 By LIGE RUSHING  
 c.1998 Diversion magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Nelson Eddy had been funnier, America might not have
panicked.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing started on Halloween Eve _ Oct. 30, 1938, 60
years ago this year. Eddy was guesting on NBC's top-rated radio
comedy series, ``The Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show.'' When
the movie baritone began to croon, many among the listening
audience of 60 million decided to indulge in the 1930s equivalent
of channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping to CBS, they were stunned to hear a program of dance
music interrupted by newsman Carl Phillips' on-the-spot broadcast
from Grovers Mill, N.J., where a strange object had crashed to
earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's wriggling out of the shadow like a gray snake,''
Phillips reported. ``Now it's another one ... They look like
tentacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, screams filled the airwaves as scores of people _
including Phillips himself _ were instantly incinerated by rays
from the alien craft.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Brigadier Gen. Montgomery Smith of the state
militia took to the air to announce that New Jersey's governor had
declared martial law in Mercer and Middlesex counties. Broadcasting
facilities were turned over to the authorities just in time for
listeners to hear an army captain, commanding 7,000 troops freshly
deployed at the Grovers Mill beachhead, describe ``a kind of a
shieldlike affair rising up out of the cylinder ... standing on
legs ... actually rearing up'' _ before being cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, at 8:25, came the report that there were
only 120 known survivors of the first battle with ``the vanguard of
an invading army from the planet Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30, Martian war machines had been reported from Virginia to
Long Island. Two minutes later, an announcer atop Manhattan's
Broadcasting Building was describing the scene as the invaders
crossed the Hudson River and blanketed New York in poison gas.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a lone ham-radio operator was heard calling, ``Isn't
there anyone on the air?''
</P>
<P>
   By 8:40, silence reigned.
</P>
<P>
   And then, out of the silence, came a voice: ``You are listening
to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre on
the Air in an original dramatization of ``The War of the Worlds''
by H.G. Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance will continue after a brief intermission. This
is the Columbia Broadcasting System.''
 &UR; CHAIN REACTION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The CBS studio in New York may have been the calmest place in
the United States that night. Some 6 million people across the
country were listening to the program, and more than a million of
them thought the nightmare was real.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified listeners throughout New York and New Jersey, Martian
ground zero, gathered their families, pets and belongings to flee
on roads clogged with other would-be refugees. Others searched for
gas masks left over from World War I or, convinced the end was at
hand, simply stayed at home and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital emergency rooms saw dozens of cases of shock and
hysteria, and one premature birth. In Newark, N.J., physicians and
nurses called the police to volunteer for emergency duty, while
elsewhere in Newark more than 20 families seeking safety from the
approaching poison gas swathed their heads in wet towels before
abandoning their entire block.
</P>
<P>
   Harlem residents packed their valuables and reported to local
police headquarters for evacuation instructions. Precinct houses in
Manhattan received dozens of calls from people reporting smoke and
flames rising across the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The number of telephone calls in the region jumped by as much as
39 percent as police, radio and newspaper switchboards were
flooded. The overloaded phone lines crashed, which many callers
took as confirmation that hostile forces had indeed destroyed
communications.
</P>
<P>
   One listener calling to ask if the world was coming to an end
was told by a CBS operator, ``I'm sorry, we haven't that
information here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities as far flung as San Francisco, Indianapolis, Providence,
Kansas City, Richmond, Atlanta and Reno all witnessed some panic,
causing the Associated Press to issue a bulletin of reassurance
even before the broadcast had ended.
</P>
<P>
   When the electricity failed in Concrete, Wash., just as the
Martians were heard destroying power plants on the radio, entire
families ran screaming into the night. And, miraculously, a man in
Pittsburgh returned home during the show just in time to prevent
his wife from swallowing poison.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the panic, the 23-year-old Welles, already a
prodigy as a stage and radio actor/director, was denounced as a
malicious hoaxster. Pundits called for government censorship of
radio, and CBS, facing several lawsuits, pledged never again to
``use the technique of a simulated news broadcast within a
dramatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a part of the program's success was its very lack of
success. Welles and his crew had been presenting adaptations of
literary classics every week since July, and the Bergen/McCarthy
show was swamping them, drawing 10 times as many listeners. As a
result, advertisers had migrated there, leaving ``The War of the
Worlds'' to be presented without ads and, hence, without commercial
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion began to turn in Welles' favor only when liberal
columnists praised the broadcast for harmlessly exposing America's
vulnerability to media manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler managed to scare all Europe to its knees a month ago,
but at least he had an army ... to back up his shrieking words,''
wrote the New York Tribune's influential Dorothy Thompson. ``But
Mr. Welles scared thousands into demoralization with nothing at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The invasion that never happened quickly turned into a coup for
Welles and his Mercury stock company.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the Campbell Soup Company signed on to sponsor the
series. Even better, RKO Pictures offered Welles a Hollywood
contract, complete with an unprecedented guarantee of total
artistic control. The studio was hoping for a film version of ``The
War of the Worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in 1941 it got an offbeat film called ``Citizen Kane''
_ though one which, true to the spirit of '38, began with a fake
newsreel.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the question of what America's most memorable radio
broadcast really meant is up for grabs. But perhaps the last word
should belong to Welles himself:
</P>
<P>
   ```The War of the Worlds' has no further significance,'' the
director said in closing the show, ``than as the holiday offering
it was intended to be _ the Mercury Theatre's own radio version of
dressing up in a sheet ... and saying `Boo!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, please, for the next day or so, the terrible lesson
you learned tonight: That grinning, glowing, globular invader of
your living room is an inhabitant of the pumpkin patch, and if your
doorbell rings and nobody's there, that was no Martian ... it's
Halloween.''
 &UR; SIDEBAR: ECHOES OF A PANIC &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six years after invading New Jersey, the Martians tried again,
when the Mercury Theatre broadcast was recreated by a radio station
in Santiago, Chile. The Martians landed 15 miles from the city,
decimated the army and destroyed a good chunk of downtown Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chileans ran in panic into the streets, while others at home
were reported to have suffered nervous upsets and heart seizures,''
The New York Times said. ``Some time was needed to restore calm.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were less benign in 1949, when broadcasters in
Quito, Ecuador, reported an interplanetary invasion without any
notice that it was a dramatization. Terror turned to rage when
listeners learned of the hoax, and a mob converged on the station,
setting it afire. Twenty people died.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1938 broadcast still makes for good listening. It
is available on the Internet at
earthstation1.simplenet.com/wotw.html, or on CD or cassette from
Adventures in Cassettes at (800) 328-0108.

CHRISTINA APPLEGATE'S `JESSE': UNMARRIED WITH CHILD

 Includes a color slide of Christina Applegate in a scene from
``Jesse.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good things come to those who wait.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Christina Applegate. After 10 seasons as tarty bimbo
Kelly Bundy on ``Married ... with Children,'' she now has a role
more worthy of her talents in NBC's new Thursday-night entry
``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   This time out, Applegate plays Jesse Warner, a sensible single
mom whose sorrows and pleasures are distinctly of the real-world
variety. And the move from fantasy to reality suits Applegate just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse couldn't possibly be more different than Kelly Bundy,''
Applegate says firmly. ``Not that Kelly was a bad person _ there
just wasn't much to her. Jesse has more on the ball, and a lot more
responsibility. I'd like to think I'm a lot more like Jesse my own
self.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two television roles is striking. On
``Married ... with Children,'' Kelly was primarily interested in
figuring out ways to sneak cute boys into her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Jesse,'' the only cute boy is Jesse's 10-year-old son (Eric
Lloyd). Also dependent on Jesse are her older brother (John Lehr),
who refuses to speak, her scamming younger brother (David DeLuise)
and her brusque but lovable father (George Dzundza), who owns the
German-themed restaurant where she works.
</P>
<P>
   The way Applegate sees it, every family has an anchor, and
that's where Jesse Warner comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse is this wise, strong, steady figure in this kind of
strange family,'' she says. ``She's raised a child on her own.
She's got these three great guys around to help raise her child,
which is great. She's strong, but we don't really know where she's
going yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One way the show won't be going, at least not right away, is to
plunge Jesse into the dating scene. Viewers may have been misled by
the pilot, in which Jesse is attracted to her drop-dead-gorgeous,
Chilean neighbour, Diego (Bruno Campos). But don't expect the show
to become a date-of-the-week series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to show the struggles of a single mother,''
Applegate says. ``She can't just go out and date a bunch of
different guys. She has to be responsible as to who she brings into
her life and her son's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such attention to political correctness is light
years from Applegate's previous persona. But then, life didn't
begin for her as Kelly Bundy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at 26 Applegate is a grizzled veteran of more than a
quarter-century on the small screen: Her first television job came
at 3 months old, when she played an infant on ``Days of Our
Lives.'' A few years later she was a child actor, snagging brief
roles on shows such as ``21 Jump Street'' and ``Family Ties.''
</P>
<P>
   However, her big break came at 15, when she was picked for the
lowbrow sitcom ``Married ... with Children.'' The show was an
instant hit, and Applegate was immediately thrust into the public
eye and locked into 60-hour work weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she shakes off the notion that she had a lost childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' she says with a chuckle. ``I'm having
a lost adulthood right now, though.''
</P>
<P>
   What helped keep Applegate sane throughout ``Married ... with
Children,'' she says, was the fact she's never been remotely
attracted to the whole show-biz scene. Her earnings from the show
bought her a modest home in the Hollywood Hills, and on most
weekends she's either attending the multicultural church near her
home or hanging out with her working-class buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had normal friends, and I still have them,'' she
says. ``I don't hang out with people in the business. My friends
are hairdressers and bartenders.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation with Applegate, what comes across strongest is
her positive, sincere attitude toward almost anything. She's also
oddly wise for a 26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when talking about her estranged father, who
divorced her mother shortly after his daughter was born, Applegate
seems utterly devoid of resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very much part of my life,'' she says. ``Fortunately,
they didn't stick together, because their relationship wasn't
working, and I wouldn't want to grow up in that situation anyway.
This way, my father remarried and I have two wonderful siblings, so
it worked out beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, while Applegate is thrilled that NBC scheduled
``Jesse'' on the hottest night on television _ Thursdays between
megahits ``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' _ she seems more excited about
a subplot in which Jesse's enduring goal is to someday go to
nursing school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has very simple dreams, which is something I love about
her,'' Applegate says. ``I love the fact she wants to be a nurse.
She's going to take that caretaking part of her personality and
make it a vocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets even better for Applegate: For the past several
months, she's been dating actor Johnathon Schaech, the handsome
co-star of ``That Thing You Do'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   All told, the only thing Applegate can find to complain about
these days are the dorky-fraulein waitress outfits she has to wear
during work scenes on ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ugh,'' she says, rolling her big, blue eyes. ``The worst thing
is you have to wear fishnet stockings with them, and when you take
the stockings off, you have these fishnet marks on your legs for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work on that, but I guess things could be a lot
worse for me.''

JAPANESE BUREAUCRACY The way the Japanese bureaucracy is now
tackling - or, rather not tackling - the Japanese banking system's

especially by official Washington : the U.S. Treasury, the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But to Tokyo's ruling
coterie, procrastination and delay appear the only rational
policies. No-one knows yet how much Japanese financial institutions

Orson Welles' 'The War of the Worlds' Martian ``invasion'' panic

HMOs, do make decisions every day about how medical dollars are

and doctors and of putting profits ahead of people's lives. Here is

 &HT;    It's a snap to convert figures on Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Wide Web has made the world smaller and friendlier.
And, nowadays, it is certainly easier to chat with friends from
Brazil in the morning and acquaintances from Australia at night.
But all this worldwide chat and e-mail has also added some
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when your friend in Sao Paulo tells you it is a
lovely day with temperatures hovering around 30 degrees, you may
feel a little shivery here in the land where the Fahrenheit
standard for expressing temperatures reigns. But in Brazil (as they
do in Europe), temperatures are most commonly expressed on the
Celsius scale. So, if you can remember the formula and have a
calculator, you'll know that it was a lovely 86 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, just one example of the conversions that are
necessary to keep in tune with people from around the world. You
can buy reference books, or even computer programs, that will help
you perform the calculations. But since you have access to the Web,
you don't need them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with temperatures. You'll find a page at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .valdosta.peachnet.edu/vsu
</P>
<P>
   /dept/aux/animation/degree.html that will do all the math for
you. Just enter the temperature in either F. or C. and click on the
page. In fractions of a second, you'll have the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful conversion page is called Measurement Units
Translation at http://www.ur.ru/(tilde)sg/transl/. Lets say you
want to convert 1,000 square yards into acres. Just fill in the
blank and click. Before long you'll know, perhaps with a degree of
accuracy that surpasses your needs, that figures out to be
0.20657991628077077 of an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A matter of time
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about time. Suppose you have been working at a
project for three weeks and you'd like to express this fact to your
boss in more graphic and impressive terms. Just mosey on over to a
page called Measurements Units _ Time at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .text-trieve.com/products/
</P>
<P>
   references/timeconv.htm. Then type the numeral ``3'' into the
correct box and click. Now you can brag that you've been working
for 30,390 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the cars measure speed in kilometers an hour, instead
of miles an hour. So you may want to bookmark the conversion page
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .text-trieve.com/products/
</P>
<P>
   references/speedconv.htm. That way, when a friend explains they
drove to grandmother's house at an average speed of 120, you'll
know that they were traveling at 74.5643262 miles an hour. Still
pretty fast but a lot safer than 120 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The next conversion table has nothing at all to do with foreign
relations. It's more domestic. Now that interest rates are lower
than they've been in years, you may be thinking of buying a house,
or financing some other big purchase. But you'll want to know what
the mortgage payments will be.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of resources for this on the Web, but one good
one is the Mortgage Calculator at http://www.by-owner-ol.com/
</P>
<P>
   mortgage.html. Let's say you are borrowing $100,000 at 6.5
percent interest for a term of 30 years. Just fill in the blanks,
and soon you'll know that your payments (for the loan amount, not
including insurance and taxes that probably will be added in) will
be $632.07.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I cannot find a single site on the Web that will
transfer the money you need for a down payment at the click of a
mouse.

 &HT;    Commentary: Don't restrict imports to protect steelworkers
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capitalism is a simple, fair economic system: It rewards good
companies and crushes bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   But freewheeling capitalism also can be brutal. Good people who
work hard, make excellent products and sell them at fair prices can
get pulverized in the unforgiving marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any American steelworker. Today they are being threatened by
vicious competition from foreign steel makers. Hundreds, maybe
thousands, of steelworkers in the South could get laid off next
year; in the states surrounding the Great Lakes, the toll could be
much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Because these workers are so sympathetic, the temptation will be
great to try to protect them by restricting imports. Steel makers
already have filed trade complaints against competitors from
Russia, Japan and Brazil, and now are seeking legislation to stop
foreigners from continuing to ship record amounts of steel to the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and Congress must not give in to the urge
to cut off imports. As cruel as that might seem to steelworkers,
lawmakers have to consider the good of all U.S. workers and
consumers. If we try to curb global trade now, we could get snared
in a depression as severe as the one that crippled the world in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Resisting the desire to meddle in the marketplace will be tough,
because U.S. steel makers are in real trouble. For example,
Birmingham Steel Corp. earned only $1.02 million in the most recent
quarter, compared with $7.25 million in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Profits are plunging for U.S. steel makers because their
competitors in depressed countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and
Latin America are slashing prices to stay alive. At the same time,
currency values in those countries are falling. Bottom line:
Foreign steel is really cheap for us to buy.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad for U.S. steel makers but good for the other U.S.
companies that need cheap steel to make cars, appliances, pipes and
other products to be sold in the global marketplace. If Ford, for
example, has to pay more for protected American steel, it won't be
able to match the prices on Japanese cars.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, low-priced foreign steel could end up hurting people
who want to work at Birmingham Steel's new rolling mill in
Cartersville. But workers who make the Taurus in Ford's Hapeville
plant need low prices for materials so they can compete with the
Camry. Do those autoworkers deserve to have their jobs threatened
to protect steel jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission finds that for every
dollar some employees gain from protection legislation, other U.S.
workers and consumers lose $3. If Congress and Clinton give in to
the demands of all companies that want protection from competition,
foreigners will retaliate by closing their markets to U.S.
manufacturers. If that happened, millions of American jobs could be
lost and consumers would start paying much higher prices for cars,
refrigerators and other goods. Would it be fair to people on fixed
incomes to stir up inflation again?
</P>
<P>
   It would be heartbreaking to see this country's highly
productive steelworkers lose their jobs because of currency
fluctuations and overcapacity in foreign countries. But even more
misery would result if we try to stop the free market from
functioning. Steel-consuming companies must be free to seek out the
best prices for materials, and consumers must be free to shop for
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than turn to protectionist legislation, Congress ought to
help steelworkers by making sure they can get decent health care,
tuition credits and job-placement help if they do lose their mill
jobs in the continuing global turmoil.

 &HT;    Let your Mac do the Windows
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtual PC is one of the most amazing pieces of software I've
ever seen. Apple Computer should include it on every G3 model it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   Why the enthusiasm? Because Virtual PC delivers as advertised.
It seamlessly simulates a Windows computer on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though this hasn't been tried before. Insignia
Solutions still sells its Windows emulator called SoftWindows. But
SoftWindows is a clunker compared with Virtual PC.
</P>
<P>
   With Virtual PC, you can run anything from Microsoft Office to
the latest multimedia game on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Virtual PC will run PC games. I tested it with a
very demanding one called ``Sid Meier's Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, a real-time simulation of the famous Civil War battle,
ran fine. There was a slight loss of speed, and the video and sound
were jumpy at times. But I played the game on a G3 PowerBook for
hours without a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual PC is easy to install and use. Switching back and forth
between operating systems is a breeze. Just click on the desktop,
and you jump back to the Apple Computer's operating system. You
click inside the Virtual PC window to go back to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, running Windows 95 and Apple Computer's operating
system side by side really showcases the Mac. Windows 95 seemed
awkward and unintuitive compared to the Mac operating system. But
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   What's amazing about Virtual PC is it's all software. In effect,
Virtual PC is tricking the Mac into believing it's a PC. Virtual PC
emulates not only Windows 95 but Windows 3.1 and DOS. You can also
buy a version that handles Windows 98, Microsoft's latest operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   While Virtual PC emulates any PC operating system, it won't work
on just any Mac. You need one with a powerful microprocessor.
Developer Connectix, for example, recommends Apple Computer's new
G3 models.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but Virtual PC will not work on Macs with chips
pre-dating the PowerPC microprocessor. Its performance is sluggish
on early models of the PowerPC.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual PC is a storage and memory hog. You need at least 32
megabytes of RAM and 150 megabytes of storage to run Windows 95.
Despite its requirements, Virtual PC is worth the money. It retails
for $149.

 &HT;    Hip sites add to luster of top television shows
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think merely watching hip TV shows makes you hip, think
again. These days, even the most minor of shows has its own Web
site complete with episode summaries, chat rooms, games and enough
trivia about your favorite characters and the actors who play them
to stump even the most devoted fan.
</P>
<P>
   NBC built the outstanding site for ``Homicide: Life on the
Street,'' which originally set the standard for TV Web sites. Be
sure to check out ``Second Shift,'' an online-only component to the
show, where users can play detective and solve crimes.
``Homicide's'' Web site takes the show's premise to a new level and
illustrates ways TV and the Web can create complimentary
entertainment experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek,'' the hit teen melodrama, has more than 60
sites devoted to the show, but Columbia Tri-Star, the production
company, offers ``Dawson's desktop'' on its Web site
(http://www.dawsonscreek.com). At first glance, this inside peek
into the world of lead character Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek)
sounds pretty cool. The site promises a peek at notes from Dawson's
journal, screenplay excerpts, e-mail messages and even a peek into
his wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   But all this nifty information doesn't come easily. In order to
see everything, users must readjust the color resolution on their
monitors, download a variety of plug-ins and then wait, wait and
wait some more for the desktop to set up. And while you're waiting,
you have to look at a full-screen advertisement for Dep hair care
products. Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   But if you stick it out and wait for the desktop to load, you'll
find a clever site that looks as if it might really be Dawson's
computer desktop. The site changes daily, and on a recent visit
there was a ``chat'' in progress debating the merits of ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' directed by Dawson's hero, Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get to read the script for the budding filmmaker's
opus ``Sea Creature.'' If you've been keeping up with the show,
you'll love reading girlfriend Joey's (Katie Holmes) diary online
for yourself. It's fun, but be warned, it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's medical drama ``ER'' has 53 sites lovingly built by
devoted fans, which is a good thing since there's no official site.
Die-hard fans will want to check out the Alt.TV.ER
(http://www.digiserve
</P>
<P>
   .com/er/erdex.html) page. The site includes one of the most
astonishingly complete lists of frequently asked questions ever
assembled. All of your questions _ from what happened last week (or
last year) to the show's medical accuracy to why Carter (Noah Wyle)
decided to sport a beard this season _ are answered.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``The Practice'' won an Emmy for Best Drama this year, and
the Web site for the show is equally imaginative (http://www

<P>
   Fire ants have been a nearly exclusive Southern phenomenon for
decades, but a 5-pound version of the stinging critter is making
its way down from South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker Gateway is introducing a new line of portable

 &HT;    COLUMN: Avoiding terminal problems with your PC not hard
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are at least 12 ways to kill your computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of PCs, I spent a lot of time urging people to
be experimental and reassuring them that nothing they could do to
their PC _ short of giving it the 10-foot drop test _ could wreck
it. Reassurances like that were needed because, in those days,
operating a PC was something akin to being the first on your block
to have an automobile back in the days of the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Now that computers are so much a part of the family, we may have
gotten too comfortable with them. While PCs are fairly sturdy
beasts these days _ certainly more so than they were five or six
years ago _ there is a limit to the abuse a PC can take. So today
we'll look at some of the fairly common mistakes that can destroy
your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most common way to ruin a computer is through
voltage surges. If you don't have a good voltage surge protector,
get one. And if you do have one, please don't rely on it during an
electrical storm. Unplug your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Heat can also kill a computer. And there are several simple
precautions that you can take to avoid overcooking your machine.
For one, make sure the covering for the exhaust fan is not clogged
with dirt and dust. It is fairly easy to remove the cover and
gently vacuum the dust away (I avoid using compressed air to blow
it away since you're likely to blow all the dirt onto the
motherboard, where it can do even more damage). Also check to make
sure there is at least four inches of clearance on all sides of
your machine, especially at the rear, where the exhaust fan is
located.
</P>
<P>
   While we're talking about heat, let's cover one of your most
expensive computer accessories, the monitor. Not too long ago I was
sitting in the newsroom, typing happily away when I smelled smoke.
I looked down the row of desks and saw a monitor smoking like a
cowboy with a hand-rolled cigarette. The reporter at that desk had
used the top of the monitor as a shelf _ loaded it down with old
newspapers and magazines. That blocked the air circulation from the
vent holes at the top and, over time, generated enough heat to
actually start a fire. If you want a fire, rub two sticks together.
Monitors make expensive kindling. Obviously the same rule applies
to your computer itself: Don't use it as a place to pile stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The next mistake won't immediately wreck your computer. Instead
think of the harm it does as similar to what smoking cigarettes
does to humans. It slowly destroys.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about turning your computer on and off many times a
day. Each time you do that, the components inside the computer get
a little jolt of electricity. I couldn't get technical about this
if I tried, but several bad things can happen to the components _
including your processor chip _ as they receive this jolt.
Eventually you can destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take this advice to mean you should never turn your
computer off. Instead, it's a good idea to turn it on when you
start using it after work and then turn it off before going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most of us are comfortable performing small tasks under
the hood of a computer _ changing the modem card, adding memory or
changing some other plug-in component. You probably already know to
turn off the power before you do this. But you also need to know
that static electricity is a real killer when chips and other
delicate components are involved.
</P>
<P>
   _ So make sure you're not carrying a static charge before you
open that package with the new memory chips, or touch any component
inside the computer. It's easy to do that. Simply touch the metal
exterior of the computer case before getting started on your work.
And if you are working over a carpeted surface, especially in the
winter (not a good idea), discharge any static repeatedly as you
work.
</P>
<P>
   _ These tips should help you keep your computer running at least
as dependably as a Model T.

 &HT;    Itty-bitty video great for enclosing in e-mail
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A company called AVerMedia has given me a new way to bedevil my
friends. Now I can send them little movies of my dog, my guinea
pigs, my wife or myself (I may be mean but I'm not a sadist).
</P>
<P>
   The AVerMedia InterCam kit consists of a peripheral card, a
microphone and stand, and a little camera the size and shape of a
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up this little video system is about as easy as it can
get. The card requires a PCI slot. If you have a Pentium computer
of fairly recent vintage, it will have plenty of available PCI
slots unless you have been buying some very sophisticated stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Once the card is installed, all that remains is to plug the
camera into it and the microphone. If you want talkies, plug into
the mike input on your sound card, and install the software, which
is automatic.
</P>
<P>
   One does not expect much from a video camera the size of a
baseball that comes in a $120 package. The key to enjoying InterCam
is having fun.
</P>
<P>
   The InterCam camera has two controls: an on-off switch and a
focusing ring that surrounds the lens. When you call up the
InterCam program, it presents you with a video box about 2 inches
wide and an inch and a half high. You can enlarge this all the way
to full screen, but you don't want to. It becomes extremely fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the camera is its shape. It sits in a
depression in a soft plastic support, and the cable tying it to the
capture card is annoyingly stiff, fighting you every time you
adjust the camera's position.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn the camera on, it gives you a view of what it
sees, but it doesn't begin recording until you click the record
button in the software. When you turn off recording, you can view
the video you just recorded. Once you save it to disk, however, you
can no longer view it through the AVerMedia software.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The video is saved as an AVI file, and you can
view it just fine through the Video for Windows or the Active Movie
feature found in Media Device in the Accessories group of Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no experience with digital video, you need to know
that these files can be huge. They have to be compressed, and the
software allows a selection from among a number of video
compression formats. I chose the Microsoft decompressor, on the
theory that everybody to whom I would send a video would have it,
and set the quality to 75 percent. Choosing 100 percent quality
greatly increases file size.
</P>
<P>
   I also selected 50 frames per minute in the software, rather
than the default 20, which tends to be rather jerky.
</P>
<P>
   A video 10 or 15 seconds long is going to be about 10 megabytes
in size. You won't make any friends sending 10-megabyte e-mails.
But trying to make two- to three-second videos is extremely
difficult in some cases, such as making videos of my piggies. I put
the camera down in their enclosure and waited for them to come
around.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to handle this, since the AVerMedia software has no
editing features, is to keep your videos to a reasonable length _
15 seconds or so _ save them to disk, and then call them up in the
Video for Windows feature mentioned above. Using this, you can make
a selection of a few seconds from anywhere in the video and copy it
into a file.
</P>
<P>
   This way you can get a file down into the 200K range, attach it
to an e-mail message and send it out without becoming Attila the
Geek.
</P>
<P>
   As these things go, $120 is pretty cheap, and AVerMedia's
InterCam is the best cheap thrill I've had in a long time.

 &HT;    Executives make ultimate 'temps'
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ After 27 years as chief financial officer at
Levitz Furniture Inc., Patrick Nolan found himself out of a job not
long after the retail giant filed for bankruptcy protection last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off that marathon career, Nolan had no interest in
another full-time job. But the flexibility and challenge of working
on temporary projects for a variety of companies appealed to him.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he joined the ranks of Tatum CFO Partners LLP _ an
Atlanta-based outfit that brings together experienced CFOs and
companies that need them on a short-term basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the stress and uncertainty of being a (full-time)
CFO,'' Nolan said, ``especially at a troubled company.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal suits corporations as well, allowing them access to
top-flight expertise without committing to long-term, costly
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of corporate cutbacks and consolidations, the
average tenure of a chief financial officer is less than three
years, said Neil Hamilton, the regional Tatum partner who opened
the firm's Boca Raton office in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get merged out or downsized out or the company's
management changes,'' said Hamilton, former CFO at consulting firm
Alexander Proudfoot PLC in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Companies often can't afford to pay the $250,000 a year that an
experienced CFO commands, but they are willing to pay for that
financial expertise on a project-by-project basis.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Nolan, many seasoned executives have no desire to pick
up and move for another job.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged is a growing supply of and demand for nomadic
senior executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call it a transitional corporate landscape,'' said
Lynn Taylor, vice president and research director at the giant
temporary employment firm, Robert Half International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With mergers rampant and technology exploding, ``there emerged
this whole new area that was not temporary or full-time,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Menlo Park, Calif.,-based company, founded by
Palm Beach resident Robert Half, last year launched a new division
that places high-level financial executives on short-term projects.
</P>
<P>
   RHI Management Resources puts workers _ mostly controllers and
CFOs _ in assignments that typically last six months to a year,
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one has taken off like a rocket,'' Taylor said of the
division, which has Florida offices in Miami and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a July report from a Merrill Lynch analyst said the
division's second-quarter revenue soared 38 percent above her
estimate, with expected annual revenue of nearly $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum CFO is a private company and does not release revenue or
income. But the firm has grown from a two-man operation six years
ago to about 100 partners in 10 offices in Florida, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   While the company maintains regional offices, most of the
partners work from their homes or at the client companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum CFO negotiates workers' salaries, five-sixths of which
goes to the employee and one-sixth to the company to cover
expenses. After expenses are paid, the Tatum partners share
whatever is left over.
</P>
<P>
   A Tatum partner typically makes between $100,000 and $250,000 a
year, depending on the market and the size of the company employing
the CFO, said Hamilton, the regional partner.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum's clients range from established companies needing extra
help _ perhaps with a new financial software system or evaluating a
takeover target _ to emerging firms that need expertise in their
growth phase.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new South Florida office is drumming up business
and has a handful of clients, including Miami-based Sunrise
Community Inc., which provides group homes and other residential
services for the developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit corporation, which operates in six states, has
grown quickly. Revenue is expected to hit $80 million this year,
compared with $45 million three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Leslie W. Leech Jr. said the rapid expansion has created the
need for expert financial skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, as CEO of the corporation, I have neglected some of
the logistics that need to be in place to support the kind of
growth we've accomplished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise, which has clients in Palm Beach County and throughout
the state, needs help with things such as information systems,
budgeting and spending controls, Leech said.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, he went to Tatum for help. A contract CFO works
from the Sunrise headquarters three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tatum is ideal for a certain window in time,'' he said.
``While Rome may be burning, you have someone in there while you're
contemplating how to get a permanent fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Leech anticipates maintaining the Tatum contract until the
company's financial year ends in June.
</P>
<P>
   While some of Tatum's projects last only a few months, many
stretch into years. That could be the case for Nolan, who recently
began his first project for Tatum.
</P>
<P>
   He's evaluating a company a retail client wants to buy. The
firms are not local, but Nolan knew the players from his days at
Boca Raton-based Levitz.
</P>
<P>
   If the Tatum client buys the company Nolan is helping it
evaluate, his first contract could end up lasting a few years. If
not, he'll move to the next project.
</P>
<P>
   Said Nolan: ``This seemed to be exactly the situation I wanted
at this point in my life.''

 &HT;    Man sues company for unauthorized publication and invansion of
privacy
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla._Paul Facchina isn't homosexual. But his
face has been seen in gay bars all over South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't dying of AIDS, either. But his face has been used to
make money off those who are.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's taking that face _ and his case _ to court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Facchina was an aspiring model living in Pompano Beach.
He'd done some shoots for Martini &AMP; Rossi vermouth and Sundown
suntan lotion. He'd had some extra work in movies.
</P>
<P>
   That November, Facchina signed over the rights to his picture to
a Broward County company called Mutual Benefits Corp. for $100. He
says he was told only that the photos _ inoffensive portraits of an
attractive young man of 24 _ would be used in ads for insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Then Facchina's picture started showing up in several magazines
aimed at gay men, including Hotspots and Scoop. The magazines are
distributed free in South Florida gay bars and feature male nudity
and graphic promotions for wet jockey-shorts contests, drag shows
and sado-masochistic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of conventional insurance policies, the ads were touting
Viatical Benefits Foundation, a subsidiary of Mutual Benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient Rome, viatica were traveling expenses given to
soldiers embarking on a journey. Viatical Benefits Foundation
brokers deals between AIDS patients who want to sell their life
insurance policies for ready money _ at a price sometimes well
below the policy's face value _ and investors who get the full
policy amount when the patient dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If You Are Ill And Money Has Become A Concern ...'' the ads
read, above a brooding picture of Facchina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local Gay Owned and Operated,'' they say beneath the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was, I was shocked,'' Facchina recalled in a
recent telephone interview. ``I grew up in southern Maryland. I'm a
country boy, born and raised that way, so I had never in my life
seen anything like this. I didn't know publications like this
existed. So first off, the shock value hit me, and then the anger
hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Facchina hit Mutual Benefits Corp., Viatical Benefits
Foundation, Hotspots, Scoop and several other publications where
the ads had appeared with a suit charging unauthorized publication,
defamation and invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   He was so upset, he charged, that he'd suffered gastrointestinal
problems and ground his teeth so badly his caps were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   To Facchina and his attorney, Dave Connor of Winter Haven, the
argument is simple. Facchina was portrayed, without his knowledge
or consent, as a homosexual man with a terminal disease. He is
neither gay nor dying; therefore, he has been wronged.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was thrown out of circuit court in Broward County three
times, but last month the Fourth District Court of Appeal in West
Palm Beach reinstated the case. Just because Facchina signed a
release, the court concluded, does not necessarily mean that his
privacy rights cannot be violated.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ziegler, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing Mutual
Benefits Corp. and Viatical Benefits Foundation, declined to
discuss the case in detail but said more appeals will be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit is groundless,'' said Norman Kent, who represents
Hotspots and Scoop. ``Just like the grinding of his teeth that he
put into the complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Paul Facchina a victim, a cynic trying to cash in on
prejudice against gay men and people with AIDS, or simply a naive
young man who should have asked more questions before he signed a
model's release?
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight,'' Facchina conceded, ``I look back, and I guess
I should have asked more questions. But it was some freelance work
and easy money so I figured, `No problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The route that took Facchina's photograph from his home to
Hotspots was not a road usually traveled by professional models.
</P>
<P>
   According to Facchina's recollections and the written complaint,
he was working as a salesman at a Circuit City in Fort Lauderdale
while simultaneously nurturing his modeling career. A colleague at
the electronics store happened to be a freelance photographer, so
Facchina mentioned that he was seeking work as a model.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the suit claims, the photographer asked Facchina
if he would be interested in working for a gay magazine, but he
declined. A couple of weeks later, the same photographer approached
him again with a job for a friend's insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Facchina passed along a copy of his composite card _ four
photographs with his height, weight, eye color, hair color and
phone number attached.
</P>
<P>
   Again, a couple of weeks passed, Facchina said, before the
photographer called to say he wouldn't even have to pose. The
insurance company would use one of the photos off his composite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy money. I don't even have to do anything,'' Facchina
remembered thinking. ``So at that point I got the negatives, and we
wrote a release, and that was what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor, his lawyer, declined to let Facchina discuss the
release. The photographer is not a party to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Facchina first saw the ad in December 1994, he said, when the
photographer showed him the magazine, folded open to the page with
his picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truthfully didn't even read the ad at that point,'' he
recalled. But he flipped through the publication enough to realize
what it was. ``I definitely made sure I expressed my
dissatisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned the ad was for viaticals only later, after another
acquaintance read the ad and pointed it out to him, Facchina said.
Since then, he said, he's been embarrassed by acquaintances who've
heard about the ads.
</P>
<P>
   In a later edition of Hotspots, Facchina's face appeared on the
cover under the Hotspots logo and above a small ad for Viatical
Benefits Foundation. His complaint also states that Mutual Benefits
falsely notarized the release out of his presence and copied it
onto letterhead for the viaticals subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   To professionals familiar with the modeling business, Facchina's
story is a textbook case in what not to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was foolish,'' says Darryl Cohen, an Atlanta attorney and
former model who now represents both individual models and modeling
agencies. ``But that's unfortunately paramount in a business
fraught with danger.''
</P>
<P>
   A legitimate agency would have asked specific questions, said
Cohen, who noted that nothing in the release prevents Facchina's
image from being distorted or used on television, film or the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so general it presents a tremendous problem,'' he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Parker has run a West Palm Beach modeling agency for 26
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call those blankets,'' she said, after being read the
release Facchina signed, which is included in the court file. ``A
blanket release. It gives them the right to just go do, and they
went and did. You know, Miss America signed a little release just
like he did, and it dethroned her.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Vanessa Williams was forced to step down as Miss
America after Penthouse magazine published nude photographs she'd
posed for while working as a receptionist in a modeling agency.
Williams sued for $400 million but dropped the case after the
photographer produced a signed release.
</P>
<P>
   When the paperback edition of A Boy's Own Story was published
that same year, Edmund White's widely praised novel of a gay
adolescent's coming of age featured a clearly recognizable cover
photograph of Robert Rosen, a 16-year-old Coral Gables high school
student. Two years earlier, Rosen had been approached on the beach
at Cape Canaveral by a photographer, who asked to take his picture
and had him sign a release.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen's father sued the publisher for $30 million and settled
out of court. But in that case, the model was a minor and, his
lawyer argued, unable to give legal consent.
</P>
<P>
   To activists for homosexuals and people with AIDS, Facchina's
complaint is not about law, but prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would find it troubling if any court in this country agreed
that being portrayed as a gay man or a person with HIV is to be
defamed,'' said Cornelius Baker, executive director of the National
Association of People With AIDS in Washington, D.C. ``Maybe some
people do believe he's gay or even fantasize about him, but it's
not substantially different from picking up Vanity Fair and seeing
an ad that portrays a man being seduced by a woman, and the reality
is that male model is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Facchina said he's not prejudiced against either gay people or
people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way is this case about slapping or demeaning the
homosexual community,'' he said. ``It's not about bashing any type
of people at all. It's completely about defending my
heterosexuality and who I am as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Since filing the suit, Facchina, 29 now, has returned to
Maryland, where he works for his father's construction company.
He's been approached about modeling again, he said, but isn't ready
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream and the hope are still there,'' he said, ``but I
need this complete disaster to get by me before I can open up a new
page.''

 &HT;    Welcome home, Rip Torn
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For a guy remembered for eating blades of grass
and other personality quirks, Taylor High School Class of 1948
graduate Elmore ``Skip'' Torn did pretty well for himself.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the kid who 50 years ago didn't get a part in the
senior play and now goes by the name Rip came home to add a new
honor to his list of achievements that includes an Emmy award and
Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old veteran character actor, whose face and name are
immediately recognizable, though difficult for some to put
together, joined an orthopaedic surgeon and a nationally renowned
historian as inductees to the Taylor High School Duck Hall of Fame.
The school's mascot is a duck.
</P>
<P>
   Torn took a break from filming an Al Pacino movie in Kentucky to
fly into town to take part in the induction ceremony at the packed
Taylor Municipal Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell the movie I'm working on I was coming here,''
Torn said between hugs and back slaps from his former classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Torn told the movie crew he was going fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly thought it was important to be here,'' he said.
``I haven't always been to the Oscars or Emmys, but I certainly
wasn't going to miss this. This is a great honor for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Torn stayed to mingle and autograph old
yearbooks with the Taylor alumni. He seemed to recognize many of
the former students, calling them by their first names. Even those
who attended the school long after Torn acted as though they had
known him for years.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was born in Temple, Torn said Taylor will always be
a special place for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our class was known as the wildest class,'' Torn said. ``I
think it's because we were all highly individualistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his impressive resume as an author and historian, Class
of 1963 member Randall Woods said his teaching colleagues at the
University of Arkansas in Fayetteville were initially unexcited to
hear about his most recent honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was impressed when I mentioned I was going to be in the
Duck Hall of Fame until I told them I was going in with Rip Torn,''
said Woods, a historian and author.
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted was Dr. Steve Burkhart, a San Antonio surgeon who
graduated in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Torn's movie career _ more than 100, including television movies
_ dates to the mid-1950s, and includes co-starring with the likes
of Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Paul Newman, David Bowie and Willie
Nelson. His roles have ranged from presidents, including Lyndon
Johnson, to Judas to the voice of Zeus in the Disney animation film
``Hercules.''
</P>
<P>
   Torn, whose most recent work includes HBO's Larry Sanders Show
and a role as Zed in the 1997 film Men in Black, was an odd, but
friendly teen, according to some of his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Eineigl, a Class of 1948 member, remembers when Torn
brought a fistful of green pills his father developed to school to
share, which were made from condensed grass leaves. Demand for the
pills in the ham-and-eggs community was not high.
</P>
<P>
   And when the other Taylor youths headed to a local creek for a
day of fishing armed with tree branches with a string and hook tied
to the end, Torn brought a fly rod.
</P>
<P>
   Eineigl said, ``I don't recall ever seeing a catfish go after a
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of a little bit different,'' said Fred Buzan,
Torn's high school basketball teammate, who now lives in Fort
Worth. ``I liked him, but yet he was different.''
</P>

Texas.

 &HT;    `Being 100 isn't such a big deal'
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An American rite of passage is turning into a logistical
nightmare for Willard Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The jovial weatherman who has faithfully broadcast birthday
greetings to America's handful of centenarians on the ``Today''
show for more than a decade now turns down 95 percent of the
requests he receives. It's not that he's getting pickier, a
spokeswoman says, there just isn't enough air time for all the
seniors tripping the triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Centenarians are no longer the rarities they used to be. At 106,
Frances Beoninger of Delray Beach is quick to point that out when
congratulated on her longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty like me,'' she says with a aw-shucks smile.
``Being 100 isn't such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be positively passe down the road. Some of the thousands
of geneticists, immunologists, gerontologists and molecular
biologists trying to push the envelope of longevity project that
one in three children born today will reach 100. Some even think
the oldest of the old will one day live to be 130, 140 _ perhaps
150.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the search for the fountain of youth is racing ahead
faster now than at any other time in human history. Andrew Monjan,
the chief neurobiologist at the National Institute on Aging,
compares progress in the field to the rate of change in the
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate between 2,000 and 3,000 scientists are studying
how to increase life expectancy on dozens of fronts that generally
fall into three areas of research. subhed: Curing diseases, probing
genetics
</P>
<P>
   The most concentrated is efforts to cure diabetes, heart
disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease _ the leading causes of
death among older people.
</P>
<P>
   Not as promising in the near term but potentially more dramatic
are efforts by scientists to isolate the genes that control the
biological clocks that regulate our bodies. It is generally
accepted that our genetic code controls between 20 and 35 percent
of our life expectancy _ though the importance of genetics seems to
increase into very old age. But a breakthrough at the genetic
level, some scientists say, could stop the aging process altogether
and open the threshold to immortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason people shouldn't one day live to be 150,''
said James Mortimer, the director of the Institute on Aging at the
University of South Florida. ``It is the fulfillment of our natural
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the road to immortality is already laid out. About 25
years ago it was discovered that if cells are taken from the body
of a fetus, they will multiply and divide a finite number of times.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, researchers learned why: A small piece of
genetic material inside cells decreased every time the cell
divided. When that DNA was exhausted, cell division ceased. The DNA
provided what appeared to be a built-in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   This process, however, is circumvented by a recently-identified
compound which enables cells to reproduce indefinitely. The catch?
The process has only been found in cancerous tumors. subhed:
Understanding cancer key to 150-year lives
</P>
<P>
   ``At the cellular level, immortality is cancer,'' said Dr.
Richard Sprott, a former director of the National Institute on
Aging and now the executive director of the Ellison Medical
Foundation, which pays for aging research in this third broad area
of study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer cells will grow forever and we're beginning to
understand how that works,'' he said. ``When we do, we could
control . . . cancer. We're also beginning to understand which
genes control which parts of this (aging) process. If we can . . .
walk this genetic tightrope, we will dramatically increase life
expectancy.''
</P>
<P>
   That breakthrough, Sprott says, is the key that scientists refer
to when they theorize that life spans could one day exceed 150. It
is, he adds, nowhere on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the absolute length to which humans may one day live is
a fiercely debated question in the scientific community. One camp
believes that a wall exists beyond which human life cannot extend.
The other contends that there is an as-yet-to-be-discovered magic
bullet that may one day challenge the notion of mortality
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference of about 75 leading age-research scientists last
weekend in San Francisco, the question took center stage. subhed:
`Why should there be a limit on life span?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was highly divided,'' said Rudolph Tanzi, the director of
the Genetics Aging Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. ``Some
people were showing pictures of Methuselah from the bible and
saying, as long as we preserve enough tissue, why should there be a
limit on our life span. Others say, after a while organs are going
to (age), and since nerve cells don't divide, how could they last
past 200 years without conking out?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a subject Michal Jazwinski, a professor of biochemistry
and molecular biology at Louisiana State University, is addressing.
Jazwinski is working to isolate longevity genes in yeast. There are
specific genes commonly found in centenarians, but present in just
5 to 10 percent of the general population. If those genes can be
isolated, and the products that they instruct the body to build
duplicated, an anti-aging pill could be made.
</P>
<P>
   More realistically, Jazwinski said, genes that help control
aging in particular systems of the body _ like the
muscular-skeletal or nervous system _ will be isolated first. At
the earliest, a drug like that could be on the market in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what sort of makes your juices flow,'' Jazwinski said.
``You'd like to have something that makes a significant difference
for the baby boomer population, especially since I'm one.'' subhed:
Will life be better as well as longer?
</P>
<P>
   While scientists debate the probability of extreme longevity, an
increase in life expectancy is already predicted. The U.S. Census
projects that by 2050, when the 75 million strong baby-boom
generation arrives, the number of centenarians will have increased
from the approximately 30,000 alive today to 834,000.
</P>
<P>
   What society looks like in 50 years will partly be determined by
how this new generation of elderly feels. Only 30 percent of the
centenarians alive today live independently, begging the question:
Will researchers be able to improve quality of life at the end of
this prolonged life cycle?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't,'' said Sprott, of the Ellison Foundation, ``then
what we've created is a huge disaster. If we dramatically increase
lifespan without increasing health span, then what we've done is
dramatically increase human misery, not decrease it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Perls, a Harvard University-based geriatrician who has
headed a five-year study of 169 centenarians, said the vast
majority of them were exceptionally healthy for most of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get to 100 you have to have excellent health,''
Perls said. ``My guess is that the human body is built for about
100 years and you're not going to extend life much beyond that. But
what we will do is compress (sickness at the end of life) if we can
get people to pay much closer attention to their health.'' subhed:
In next century, you work to 80
</P>
<P>
   How society copes with this massive wave of the very, very old
is a critical question. People will almost certainly work for more
years. Kenneth Manton, a demographer from Duke University who
believes the average life span for children born today will be 95,
guesses by 2098, the federal retirement age will be 80.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one suggests the 100-year-olds of the future will
supply the timber industry with its lumberjacks, the less
physically taxing areas of teaching and technology will likely be
filled by older and older men and women, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Said Monjan, of the NIA: ``I think it's foreseeable that people
could one day be living to 120 and acting like they are in their
70s. I think Senator John Glenn is an excellent role model today
for successful aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Bortz, a gerontologist at Stanford University and author
of the book Dare to Be 100, said baby boomers will change society's
attitudes, but it will be the generations that follow that will
really benefit from their trailblazing. The most basic change,
Bortz said, is that the definition of old and the role of older
people will have to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is going to have ask itself if old people are a
resource or a liability,'' Bortz said. ``If they are a resource,
then they are going to have to have tasks to perform. . . . We can
achieve justification for being alive only if we matter.''

 &HT;    HOW THEY DRESS `ALLY MCBEAL'
 &HT;    By CARA ANNA
 &HT;    c. 1998 Palm Beach Post/Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hit the mute button for a sec.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell these Ally McBeal characters' characters just by
looking at their clothes?
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to. Dressing an ensemble cast isn't an
afterthought, with actors grabbing whatever fits and taking their
places. There are people _ costume designers _ considering details
viewers take for granted: Do the actors clash with each other? Do
they clash with their surroundings?
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most important, do the clothes give viewers a quick
sense of who each person is?
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Stanley is the costume designer for the popular
television show, which centers on a Boston law firm and the trials
(literally) and tribulations of a love-starved female attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Ally McBeal has nine main characters bouncing around the screen,
so each needs a look that's a quick read.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Georgia, the most staid (and repressed) of the women,
gets stuck with the safe and solid-colored ``career corner''
get-ups. That's why Fish, the office clown, gets the goofy ties.
</P>
<P>
   And Ally McBeal herself? Her hemlines make headlines as they
creep ever upward, revealing legs that some say are getting way too
thin. (The 5-foot-5 Calista Flockhart, the actress who plays
McBeal, denies that she has an eating disorder, instead saying she
has a fast metabolism.)
</P>
<P>
   Stanley (Sisters, Falcon Crest, ``five Danielle Steele
movies-of-the-week'') joined the show this season and is making a
few wardrobe changes.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't talk sizes for any character _ that's too personal,
she said _ but she would talk skirts.
</P>
<P>
   While Ally's famously short skirts (said by some to be size 0;
others, size 2) rise from 15 to 14 inches for the first few shows,
some knee-length looks follow. Flockhart asked for it, Stanley
says. ``She wanted a change.''
</P>
<P>
   How, by the way, did she move in those things? ``Actually, she's
pretty agile,'' Stanley said. (Tonight's story line addresses short
skirts and their place in a courtroom.)
</P>
<P>
   But Stanley's biggest change is in colors. Last season, they
stuck with classic corporate colors _ grays and blues _ for the
cast. But the show is getting funnier, Stanley said, so she's
brightening everything to contrast with The Practice, the other
lawyer show by McBeal producer David Kelley. She'll put pocket
squares in Fish's suits for a jolt of color. And his shy law
partner, John, will get punchier ties.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see stark white (light bounces off it),
yellow (Stanley's not fond of it) and orangey-reds (they tend to
flare on TV screens).
</P>
<P>
   Stanley expects some complaint mail. ``What's difficult about TV
is that people don't like to see characters go through change,''
she says. ``But characters on every show eventually have to
evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart gets seven or eight outfits an episode. The other
characters, four to six. The men get two of each shirt because each
episode takes eight days of taping. It takes about half a season,
or 11 episodes, before they can wear the same outfit again.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley spends about two days shopping per episode, scouring
local malls and boutiques. Then come the alterations. With Ally,
most of those short skirts don't come that way.
</P>
<P>
   But rumor has it, a line of Ally-inspired clothes is being
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing about it,'' Stanley says.
</P>
<P>
   ZEROING IN ON MEANING OF WOMEN'S SIZES
</P>
<P>
   Some say Calista Flockhart, the star of Ally McBeal, is a size
2. Others say a size 0.
</P>
<P>
   Zero? What the heck does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means you're really tiny,'' muses Cheryl Potter, operations
manager at Jo-Ann's Fabrics in Greenacres. ``Anybody who wears a
size 0 in women's wear could wear children's clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   They carry no size 0 patterns. Neither does the Lantana Sewing
Center, and neither does Simplicity, the New York-based pattern
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart could, however, pop into Petite Sophisticate at the
Palm Beach Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, a size 0 has a 23-inch waist,'' says supervisor
Bonnie Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the store's clients come in looking for 0s, she
says. Otherwise, you'll have to search the petites sections of
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   But 0 means nothing. Zip. Doesn't math apply?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. ``I suspect that size 0 is an attempt to appeal to what is
sometimes called `vanity sizing,' '' says Jack Morgan, director of
communications for the American Apparel Manufacturers Association.
``The idea being that women are going to feel more confident in a
smaller size.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you are too small for size 0?
</P>
<P>
   He chuckles. ``Maybe they can come up with a minus 1.''

 &HT;    Adopted hometown lets pop star enjoy celebrity without
complications _ except when driving
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_On Oct. 7, Atlantans finally had the chance to show
Elton John exactly what they thought of him.
</P>
<P>
   During an introduction before the world premiere of ``Elaborate
Lives: The Legend of Aida'' at the Alliance Theatre, the audience
suddenly rose to its feet. Turning en masse toward the show's
composer, who was seated toward the back of the theater, the crowd
gave John a loud, lengthy standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The public display of affection caught him off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborly outpourings of love are something Elton John seldom
experiences in his native England, where he's more often the target
of tabloid scorn.
</P>
<P>
   So, the ovation helped the outwardly composed, Versace-attired
pop star get through the most nail-biting night of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been that nervous,'' John says. ``I was a nightmare
during the day. When everyone stood up, it was totally unexpected.
I was very touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me, `Why do you have a place in Atlanta?'
It's because people here have always been that nice to me. ... I've
always been welcomed. I feel at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday after ``Aida's'' premiere, in the clubhouse of the
Atlanta high-rise where John lives, cables snake across the floor
and a video camera, microphones and hot lights dangle overhead.
This interview is being recorded for use by foreign TV and on
John's upcoming Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Before he arrives, assistants and managers mill about, deciding
whether a garish pink-and-green parrot painting should be used as
background and going over the singer's daily schedule.
</P>
<P>
   After a week that's included a recording session in New York
with Janet Jackson, live performances in Orlando and Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and overseeing ``Aida,'' John should be
exhausted. His people caution that the star's demeanor might be
sour and he might bolt the interview after just a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But John, 51, bounds into the room five minutes early, full of
smiles and handshakes. Wearing a warm-up suit and Nikes, the singer
appears as placid as the water in the pool outside. There's not a
tantrum in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Q&AMP;A, John videotapes a message to Beatles producer
and friend George Martin, who's receiving a British music industry
award this fall. He botches half a dozen attempts. After discarding
a seventh try, John looks wryly across the room and announces, ``I
hope everyone brought a lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the interview, which could be John's what _ 10
millionth? _ he's easily engaged and funny. He's here to talk about
his projects, including ``Elaborate Lives,'' but the subject of
Atlanta occupies much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' he says simply. ``Atlanta's a young city.
I've been here for eight years, and I've seen it grow at an
enormous rate _ maybe too quickly for the road system.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the locals give their biggest celebrity in
residence respectful room to breathe, too. John is able to drive
himself around town, casually shopping for CDs, groceries or art,
without the aid of a big floppy hat and sunglasses _ and without
being mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much time John spends here fluctuates with his
touring schedule. With homes in London and Windsor, England, and in
Nice, France, he has plenty of places to light. If he's playing the
United States, he prefers jetting back to Atlanta and his own bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very loyal person,'' he says of his attachment to
Georgia's capital city. ``Once I've got my feet down and I like
something, I'll promote something.''
</P>
<P>
   John successfully lobbied Disney Chairman Michael Eisner to have
Disney's first original for-the-stage musical premiere at the
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important to me,'' John says. ``It gives the show
a sense of continuity. `Aida' was conceived in Hollywood but
written in Atlanta. (``Elaborate Lives'' lyricist) Tim Rice even
wrote a lot of his stuff in Atlanta as well. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone flew in here to hear the songs as they were written.
I'm very proud of having `Aida' here.''
</P>
<P>
   To John, premiering ``Aida'' at the relatively small (800-seat)
Alliance made good theatrical sense as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a smaller theater,'' he says. ``We didn't want to go
to some 1,500-seat theater for a preview. The Alliance is actually
better equipped than most Broadway theatres and has a bigger,
deeper stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The show runs through Nov. 8. John says he's happy with the
performances he's attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it four times and each time, its grown by leaps and
bounds. ... The book has been changed, the scenery's changed. The
only thing that hasn't been changed is the music.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest concern with the show, he says, is a balky,
multimillion-dollar prop: a morphing Egyptian pyramid, the setting
for much of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else, I just wait for the pyramid to break down!
I'm just sitting there looking at my watch, going, `Hmm, well, it's
been ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``It only breaks down when I'm in the audience, you know. That's
the only thing I've been worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   So why, sitting in the audience on opening night, did he get a
case of nerves?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no control,'' he says. ``When I went to the first
run-through at the Alliance, I thought, `Oh my God, these people
are singing my stuff now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell myself, `Do not be too critical.' You have to
put your ego at the door and realize that you've given them the
material and now it's their chance to interpret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have been nervous. Everyone's done a sensational
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening-night jitters even distracted John from the rain-delayed
playoff game between the Braves and the San Diego Padres. He's a
fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually forgot about the Braves'' until leaving the
theater, he recalls. ``They were one up when I was in the car going
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to bed and got up and they had lost. And then they lost
again! I thought, `Oh my God, it's a repeat of last year, and I
can't bear it.''
</P>
<P>
   John maintains a fan's perspective in music, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a fan,'' he says. ``As a kid, I found solace
in music. When my parents were arguing, I was in my room listening
to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always bought my own records from 78s to 45s to
eight-tracks to albums to CDs. Every Tuesday, I'm at Tower Records
because it's release day. I still have that joy. In a way, I still
can't believe what's happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many of his contemporaries have seen their
careers flame out, John last week played four sold-out shows at
Madison Square Garden. He begins a European leg of his current
13-month tour in November. And while some of his peers pay the
mortgage by hauling out their greatest hits for the casino crowd,
John continues to seek out new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King,'' his first Disney project with Tim Rice, was a
theatrical film, Broadway show and the best-selling video of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Lion King' opened a lot of doors for me,'' he says. ``I
was included as a team player. ... When they came to Atlanta and
showed me the finished thing, `Can You Feel the Love Tonight'
wasn't in it. And I said: `Are you (expletive) crazy? You can't
have a Disney movie without a love song! Put it back in!'
</P>
<P>
   ``To their credit, they went and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The song went on to win the 1994 Oscar for best song, an
achievement that John still has a small quibble with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it deserved to win the Oscar,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ```Circle of Life' was a better song, and it had
more to do with the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Aida,'' John and Rice have written the music to
``El Dorado,'' an upcoming DreamWorks SKG animated feature set for
release in fall 1999. John is writing the score for a live-action
feature film as well, and he's brainstorming another animated
feature for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the music business, John uses his clout and celebrity to
call attention to the global AIDS crisis. He acts as a hands-on
chairman for the Elton John AIDS Foundation, based in Atlanta, Los
Angeles and London, which he founded in 1992. He also served again
as honorary chairman of Sunday's AIDS Walk Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While the final tallies aren't yet in on the AIDS Walk, John is
troubled that similar events in other cities seem to be drawing
fewer participants and making less money than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the success of protease inhibitors and the cocktail
drugs, people assume that the AIDS crisis is over,'' he says. ``It
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``These protease inhibitors, these drug cocktails are making
people well but for how long? The search for the vaccine continues.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought is that maybe the AIDS crisis is going away when,
in fact, it's increasing all over the world with different
permutations. Other strains are beginning to form.''
</P>
<P>
   John is changing the focus of the foundation to include more
education efforts, while continuing direct care of AIDS patients.
``It's very hard,'' he says. ``The schools won't let us in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they wouldn't even let the Indigo Girls in to do a
concert because they're lesbians,'' John says, referring to several
school administrators' reaction to the Decatur duo's public school
tour last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, hello, this is the 20th century. Hello!
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to keep on. This is not the time to be complacent.
There is hope out there now and that's great, but with hope
sometimes comes complacency and that's a dangerous thing.''

 &HT;    Elton John on:
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- Atlanta: There's art, music, entertainment and people I
really like here.
</P>
<P>
   -- Driving in Atlanta: Of course I drive here. You think I go
around by MARTA (buses and subway)? Please! ...
</P>
<P>
   The drivers here are hopeless, by the way. They really are the
worst! They go from one lane to the next with no signal. I'm
sitting there behind the wheel yelling, ``Come on!'' They're a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   -- Criticisms that his music has gotten softer: The music has
mellowed over the years, but then I'm 51. I've changed personally,
and the music probably has gotten a little softer.
</P>
<P>
   -- His approach to the music for ``The Lion King'': It's usually
very Broadwayish kind of music. We said, ``We're going to write
simple pop songs that kids can identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   -- His inspiration for ``The Lion King'': I wanted to model what
we did on ``The Jungle Book,'' which for me is the best Disney
movie for music ever, and also one of the best animated movies
they've ever done. The music for ``The Jungle Book'' is so terrific
with ``I'm the king of the jungle'' and all that.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Aida's'' route to Broadway: It needs technical work, it
needs scenery work, it needs book work. But the actual core of the
thing is the music, and that's pretty much there. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for me, because I'm an impatient kind of guy. I
want to get it done now. We may take it to Chicago or some place
first. There's talk of taking it to England, but I don't want that
to happen. I wrote it for Broadway, and I want it to go to
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   -- How the musical ``Aida'' contrasts with the opera: It's meant
to be flippant, it's meant to be a direct opposite of the Verdi
opera, which is very serious and tragic. This is more of a campy
approach, and it tells the story much simpler.
</P>
<P>
   -- The social effects of better AIDS treatments: There's a
certain element of people that have been _ how can I say _ not
behaving themselves in the right manner, because they think they
can go out and do whatever they want again. And so, you find the
rate among young people rising, and the rate among women is rising.
There's a cooling off of people giving money.
</P>
<P>
   -- His goals in music: It'd be nice to win a Tony for best score
or best song.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm still in search of the perfect melody, that perfect
song. Of course, you never find it. But as long as it's out there
and that Holy Grail is in sight, you have to chase it.

   TEACHER-RECRUITING (Albany, N.Y.) _ Upstate New York and other
parts of the Northeast are prime hunting grounds for school systems
in booming Sun Belt cities that need teachers. There aren't many
teaching jobs in upstate New York because the population isn't
growing and there is little turnover. But universities here churn
out lots of teachers. Most of them head west and south, where
opportunities abound. By RICK KARLIN.

   CALIF-EDUC (San Francisco) _ When California Gov. Pete Wilson
returned from England last October, he brought back two central

   DRAG-WIGS (San Francisco) _ The overlapping interests of cancer

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Justice system's flaws are ingrained and obvious
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amnesty International's recent rip on the U.S. criminal justice
system has put American backs up. Don't we provide legal counsel,
civil liberties, open trials, appeals? Wouldn't the world's
criminal-justice average jump way up if no nation did worse at it
than we do?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. But ...
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Amnesty has caught our not inconsiderable
shortfalls and lapses. Many are now built into what passes for the
system, secured there by a crude politics that, claiming to protect
us from crime, in fact wastes money on practices that in their
injustice and inhumanity actually produce more crime _ at the
willful neglect of policies that would be less pricey and more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what is amiss in the U.S. system came together in the
execution in Virginia last week of Dwayne Allen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   First, we executed. No other industrialized nation still does
that. The death penalty deters no crime, is hugely expensive and
sets a state-sanctioned example that killing is an OK way to solve
problems. It is borne in gross disproportion by the poor,
compounding class angers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Wright was black, and the residue of racial prejudice
that fouls every level of the criminal justice system piles up on
our death rows in a final grotesque racial disparity and rankling
social irritant.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Wright committed the murder for which he was killed at
17. Few other nations permit executions for juvenile crime _ at
last count, only Yemen, Saudi Arabia, lran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Wright was borderline retarded and was diagnosed at 13
with severe mental illness and brain damage. He never received the
treatment doctors recommended for him in juvenile facilities. (As
governor, Bill Clinton permitted the execution of a man so
profoundly retarded he wanted to save his last-meal dessert for
later.)
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Wright's trial attorney, in a performance common to
indigent cases, failed to mention those mitigations at the
sentencing hearing, leading two jurors to swear later they would
have voted for life imprisonment if they had known.
</P>
<P>
   We are building ever more prisons to house mainly nonviolent
offenders, most sentenced for drug crimes. Alternative sentencing
is both cheaper and less likely to create repeat offenders. And
those who must be incarcerated are now largely denied the jailhouse
education programs that also cut recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   We emphasize imprisonment and cruelty _ and cruelty it is: We
leave all other prisoners pretty much at the mercy of any prison's
worst _ and disdain crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
   We stint on drug treatment. We fail to provide most new, poor
mothers the home visits by parenting counselors that pay off in far
lower eventual crime. We fund few after-school programs _ when most
juvenile crime occurs, not at night as curfews assume. We wink at
police and prison excess

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ During the months of the great Clinton debacle,
we have been subjected to an array of opinions on both sides, from
the astute to the obtuse. The weakest of the lot involve the
opinions of people from foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these arguments come from reputable news sources. Others
can be traced to tourists who have talked with a cab driver and a
waiter and offer their opinions as indisputable truths. Whatever
the source, the message is the same. ``They'' _ the foreigners _
cannot understand what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we are portrayed as unsophisticated bumpkins when
compared with the innate wisdom of the people in France (or
Britain, Bolivia, China, Ghana, Pakistan, Lapland or Outer
Mongolia). These people obviously see the whole sex-scandal
business in the proper perspective _ while we stand eyeball-deep in
the cornfields and make misguided judgments. At this point, we
usually hear the word ``puritanical'' as a one-size-fits-all
blanket over the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the return of our massive inferiority complex, which
has plagued us throughout our history. We are the first to believe
that other cultures do it ``right,'' as we flounder in our own
ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time to take a good look at those foreign
societies and ask ourselves why it is that they have so much to
teach us. Maybe our self-appointed mentor is from one of those
countries that came to us on the verge of bankruptcy and begged us
to bail them out. Or perhaps it was invaded, couldn't defend
itself, and asked for American military assistance.
</P>
<P>
   We might be looking at a society that has never been able to
feed itself and stays alive on American handouts. One of these
know-it-alls might have called upon us twice in a quarter-century
to save it from humiliating defeat or even extinction as a culture.
Another might be a chaotic mess that requires American peacekeeping
forces to keep it from destroying itself.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries accept blatant corruption, gross mismanagement
and periodic upheavals as a way of life. These nations, however,
presume to have the answers for our problems.
</P>
<P>
   We accept these international put-downs and wonder if we have
the right to confront a leader who has exhibited the moral conduct
of a prairie dog. Why do we listen to these losers? Why do we care
what they have to say? If they are willing to tolerate such moral
and ethical conduct in their own leaders, that is their business,
but they should refrain from denigrating a value system that has
worked well for us.
</P>
<P>
   These critics would be well advised to follow an axiom that is
as old as civilization itself. When you hit up your brother-in-law
for a loan, don't laugh at his haircut.

THE DECLINE AND FALL OF RADICALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back in the 1970s when the comedy-magic team of
Penn and Teller was first breaking in, Penn (the tall one) would
deliver a wonderful, withering line to his partner during their
routine. I forget what Teller (the short one) did to prompt the
remark, but Penn would fix him with a disdainful look and say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Teller, hasn't anybody told you? The '60s are over _ and we
lost?''
</P>
<P>
   That succinct summation came back to me a few days ago when I
read a comment about San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano.
According to a Republican activist named Adam Sparks, Ammiano ``is
a radical in the most extreme sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   (Granted, Sparks was identified as a ``conservative
Republican,'' but I assume that's by San Francisco standards. In
any other U.S. city he'd probably pass for a New Deal Democrat.)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano, a radical? In the most extreme sense of the word?
Lordy, I knew that times had changed, that the '60s were over and
that we who embraced its make-love-not-war philosophy had indeed
lost. I just didn't realize how far over and how badly.
</P>
<P>
   As one who came into adulthood via the student protest movement
of the late '60s and early '70s, ``radical'' means to me something
very specific and exclusive. Something exciting, often
unpredictable, probably dangerous and occasionally insane.
</P>
<P>
   If you're my definition of a radical, you wouldn't be caught
dead in electoral politics. Period. (In the basement of what's left
of a secret bomb factory in Madison, Wis. _ yes.) True radicals
despise mainstream politics because they believe they are a sham, a
charade, a racist and sexist lie that is perpetrated on the masses
to give us the illusion of control over our sorry, sheep-like fate.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of radicals, I see John Reed and Louise Bryant,
Emma Goldman and Harry Bridges. From my anti-Vietnam War era, I see
the Black Panthers and the Weathermen. Until it got diluted by too
many drop-outs from the student senate and the Chi Omega house, I
see Students for a Democratic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Eldridge Cleaver was a radical for years after he was released
from prison. For awhile, all of the Chicago 7 were radicals. But
only one of them, Abbie Hoffman, remained a radical to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Back when radicals were actually radical, they didn't just wear
Mao caps, quote Marx and live in communal apartments. They truly
saw ``the state'' or ``the establishment'' as a threat (usually a
``Fascist'' one) to humankind's heart, mind and soul. They got
themselves arrested and beaten with billy clubs. They rallied and
screamed through bullhorns even when there were only five of them
at ``an action.'' They disrupted class, traffic and Wall Street and
barely tolerated us liberals because they saw us as intellectual
and moral weenies.
</P>
<P>
   Radicals were ever prepared to fall on their swords for some
cause, especially a utopian future. A few of them were willing to
kill for it. All of them were true believers; some were stark
raving mad.
</P>
<P>
   That a former school board member and current supervisor could
now be labeled a radical _ even by a Republican _ speaks a lot more
about the narrow, unimaginative, reactionary political landscape of
our times than it does about Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Ammiano. I hope he gets enough
votes in next month's election to be the board president.
Principled and consistent, he's an unapologetic champion of all
human rights _ especially those humans who lack the power and money
to champion their own. If some of those humans happen to live, not
in the China Basin of San Francisco but Burma, what of it?
</P>
<P>
   In the current nasty, anti-union climate, Ammiano is unashamed
and unequivocal in his support for organized labor. A tireless gay
advocate and a regular rider of mass transit, he is a noisy,
outspoken enemy of school vouchers, privatization and corporate
America's scorched-earth mentality.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Ammiano is a classic liberal. Maybe even what
once was termed a ``loudmouth liberal.'' Only by the stultified
political standards of the late 1990s could he be thought of as a
radical, let alone a radical in the most extreme sense of the word.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The brutal death of University of Wyoming student
Matthew Shepard outraged many in this nation. But we shouldn't be
so surprised that Shepard was singled out for brutality just
because he was different.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exercise too many practice daily. Most of us don't carry
it to the point that Shepard's tormentors did, but retreating into
insular worlds or, worse, pushing others out because they're cut of
a different cloth, inflicts as much damage to the social fabric as
Shepard's murder.
</P>
<P>
   We get away with it because we practice it subtly. But the walls
are there whenever we look at the brown woman in the power suit and
assume she is a sellout. Or when we meet the kid from the suburbs
and assume he's privileged or, conversely, meet the kid from the
public housing projects and figure her for a gang member.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the not-so-subtle divisions that some are only too
ready to reinforce, often for dubious reasons. Others aren't so
easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Take the readers who responded to a column I wrote about the
dearth of Hispanic Americans, when compared to Latin American
players, in major league baseball. Some objected to my
characterization of Chicago Cubs' right fielder Sammy Sosa as a
bearer of ``brown power.''
</P>
<P>
   Only by virtue of a slave ship's voyage to the island that now
includes the Dominican Republic is Sosa a Latino, one reader
asserted. The reader is right about the history. So it is for many
Puerto Ricans, Cubans and even some Mexicans, whose ancestry is
speckled with the genes of forcibly imported Africans.
</P>
<P>
   But, really. There's plenty of Sammy for those who wish to claim
fraternity. He looks like his African ancestors and speaks the
mother tongue of Latinos. And he's more than proved he has the
all-American game down pat.
</P>
<P>
   What more could we ask for?
</P>
<P>
   In a despicable effort to inflict division, the prize goes to
former San Antonio City Councilman Bernardo Eureste, who reportedly
was behind an attempt to oust ``island'' Puerto Ricans from
membership in the League of United Latin American Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Eureste told the online political magazine Politico that Puerto
Ricans are ``citizens by statute, not by constitutional right. They
don't vote in this country, and shouldn't be voting in LULAC
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a method to Eureste's madness, albeit a twisted one.
The Politico, which is based in San Antonio, reports that a bloc of
Puerto Ricans from the island was enough to twice swing the LULAC
president's election away from Rosa Rosales, a labor organizer who
is Eureste's friend.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the reins of the nation's oldest Latino civil-rights
organization isn't quite 12 pieces of silver, but this is
wall-building of the most onerous kind: shoving out members of a
group because it's politically expedient to do so.
</P>
<P>
   No, Eureste and those who would play King Solomon with Sammy
Sosa haven't killed anyone. But their attitudes are no less brutal.
They foster intolerance and promote indifference.
</P>
<P>
   That's what killed Matthew Shepard.

WHEN BASEBALL MEANT MORE THAN YANKEES VS. PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The World Series is about to bring down the
curtain on a baseball season that saw old fans reawaken to this
gentle, pastoral game while new fans beat the tomtoms for more
powerful blasts from big home-run hitters.
</P>
<P>
   But even in its resurgence, baseball doesn't enjoy the wide
national awareness it did 50-odd years ago _ before other
professional sports sapped its fan base, when ballplayers were
American icons.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't a baseball story. It's a war story. Better, it's
an American story about one winter when our summer game helped beat
Adolf Hitler and win World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1944, at 5:30 a.m., a half-million German soldiers,
supported by tanks and artillery, attacked along an 85-mile U.S.
front in the Ardennes forest region of Belgium and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis would penetrate 50 miles into Allied territory before
they were stopped some 10 days later, giving the campaign a name it
would carry throughout history, the Battle of the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, back home, it was announced that Dixie Walker of
the Brooklyn Dodgers had won the 1944 National League batting
title.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the latter and the former is that baseball was
then so positively and purely American that it became part of
battlefield strategy in the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was so vital to American morale that a month after
Pearl Harbor was attacked, President Roosevelt wrote baseball
Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, urging him to ``keep baseball
going'' in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 300 teams use 5,000 or 6,000 players, these players are a
definite recreational asset to at least 20 million of their
fellow-citizens _ and that in my judgment is thoroughly
worthwhile,'' Roosevelt said.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1944, major league baseball had survived, though many of
its stars joined the services. The Free World, too, had survived,
but Hitler had one last card up his sleeve and he played it in the
Ardennes.
</P>
<P>
   Personally planning the counterattack, Hitler exhorted his
commanders to fight ``with brutality,'' and assembled a commando
force to infiltrate the American lines.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Hitler prodigy, Lt. Col. Otto Skorzeny, they wore
captured U.S. Army uniforms, carried false IDs and spoke literal
American English. Some had even lived in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal, reports TimeLife Books on World War II, was to
``commit sabotage and generally create consternation in the
Americans' rear areas.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably wasn't difficult. The Germans had resurrected the
blitzkrieg and were slaughtering American units at the front and
recapturing territory from which they had previously retreated.
</P>
<P>
   John Hamilton, 76, is president of the Alamo Chapter of the
Battle of the Bulge Veterans in San Antonio. He was a 22-year-old
buck sergeant who had just been sent to the front when the Germans
attacked. He calls himself ``one of the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew you were in a war, then, boy. We were really green,''
he says of his Company K, 346th Infantry Regiment, 87th Infantry
Division, half of whom, he estimates, were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of the Bulge lasted six weeks. It was a bloody
struggle in frigid conditions. U.S. forces suffered 81,000
casualties (19,000 killed) and Hitler lost 210,000 men, killed,
wounded or taken prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Skorzeny's bold commandos did their best to create
chaos, switching road signs, marking off safe areas with white tape
_ the GIs' warning of minefields ahead _ and even concocting rumors
intended to foment terror among the already scared troops.
</P>
<P>
   The American counterstrategy was simple: ``Out'' the spies by
asking them questions only a true American could answer, such as:
``Who are `Dem Bums'?'' (Brooklyn Dodgers) ``Who won the World
Series this year?'' (St. Louis Cardinals)
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd now, but it was thought then that any real American
would know the answers.
</P>
<P>
   However, a U.S. general, who wrongfully told a sentry the
Chicago Cubs were in the American League, was held for five hours
by troops who'd been warned about a ``Kraut posing as a one-star
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the interrogators asked the right questions, but
didn't know the right answers.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Omar Bradley was challenged by a guard who thought the
capital of Illinois was Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley couldn't identify World War II pinup girl Betty
Grable's husband for another guard, who recognized Bradley but
decided to harass him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Harry James,'' the smug sentry sarcastically told the no
doubt furious general.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, retired Maj. Gen. George Ruhlen, was a
34-year-old lieutenant colonel commanding the 3rd Armored Field
Artillery Battalion on Dec. 16, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhlen remembers riding in his Jeep one day on a lonely road in
the Ardennes with Cpl. John Swan and Sgt. Frederic Rudi when ``a
scared-looking young American soldier suddenly barred our way
flourishing a loaded rifle and demanding the password.'' Swan was
at the wheel. Here's Ruhlen's account:
</P>
<P>
   Sentry: ``If you're Americans, where are you from?''
</P>
<P>
   Swan (a Missourian): ``Missourah.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentry: ``Yeah, what's its capital?''
</P>
<P>
   Rudi (an Iowan): ``Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentry: ``Pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Ruhlen told Rudi: ``Listen, smart ass, the next
time some guy asks you the capital of Missouri, you let Swan answer
or else tell the guy Jefferson City, before you get us all killed.
The next sentry might be from Missouri.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of January 1945, the Battle of the Bulge was over and
the Allies were driving toward the wide, mighty Rhine River. German
troops destroyed bridges as they retreated and it was expected that
crossing the Rhine would be another bloody confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Ruhlen, they found the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen,
Germany, intact and used it to pour tanks and troops across the
Rhine and establish a pontoon bridgehead until the bridge collapsed
after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to a final baseball story. One of the Army engineers
working to shore up the Remagen bridge was a young GI named Warren
Spahn, who in 1942 had played for the Boston Braves.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, 1945, one of Ruhlen's men recognized Spahn and
engaged him in conversation. As they parted, Spahn was walking
toward the bridge when it fell down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dying on that bridge or in that war, fate had better
things in store for the southpaw. Spahn went on to lead the Braves
to the 1948 World Series, win 363 games and be elected to the
baseball Hall of Fame.

`BRIDE OF CHUCKY': SCARE IT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the exhortations of all those born-again preachers. ``The
Bride of Chucky,'' a loathsome, quite unterrifying and mercifully
brief entry in the ongoing series about that homicidal doll, is the
best argument I could cite for planned puppethood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Chucky. Wanna play?'' again comes the invitation from Old
Stitchmouth; and this time (the fourth for the series, which began
with ``Child's Play'' in 1988), it's easier than ever to respond,
``Not with you, buster. Eat Krazy Glue and die.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept runs down completely with this latest film, which
may explain why Universal was far too embarrassed to screen it for
the press. The flick deserves to be gone from theaters soon.
</P>
<P>
   To be concise about the plot: Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) is
revived by ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), thanks to a
paperback copy of ``Voodoo for Dummies.'' Through procedures too
tiresome to recount and lenses too bloodied to perceive it all
clearly, Tiffany's soul and motor mouth enter the body of another
doll. The twosome launch a search for the amulet worn by the mass
murderer whose soul has found a resting place within Chucky's
rubbery confines (I feel like an idiot even relating such a
preposterous premise).
</P>
<P>
   The pair proceed to wreak mayhem on a defiant young couple
(Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile), their gay friend (Gordon Michael
Woolvett) and the local police chief (John Ritter, whose receding
hairline and prominent paunch make him a double for Beau Bridges).
Sundry bystanders are also punctured, stabbed, defingered and
incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Don Mancini's script or Ronny Yu's direction is, in
the slightest, scary or clever. They must know it, too. Instead,
they opt for a tone of smirking postmodernism. Tilly watches James
Whale's classic ``Bride of Frankenstein'' in the bathtub. Chucky is
told eviscerations went out with ``Bundy and Daumer.'' And the
script is larded with so many references to Martha Stewart that
you'd think she's getting a share of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   What's depressing about this time waster is the implicit
admission that horror movies aren't capable of delivering genuine
chills any longer; self-referential gags _ in the ``Scream'' manner
_ are all we can hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows what a talented performer like Tilly is doing in
this rubbish. And the sight of Alexis Arquette (the least gifted
member of his clan) as an Alice Cooper clone suggests he couldn't
find anything else.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the intricate animation and puppetry will compel the
interest for a couple of minutes. But honestly, I found the
overweening wholesomeness of Howdy Doody much scarier than anything
in this contrived thriller. And compared to this crew, Barney will
give you nightmares.

ROCKEFELLER'S LATIN ART COLLECTION TO OPEN IN SAN ANTONIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost 20 years after Nelson A. Rockefeller's death, the former
New York governor's artistic vision continues to influence the art
world.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic collecting habits that led Rockefeller to create
Albany's Empire State Plaza Art Collection, an impressive
assemblage by New York-based Abstract Expressionists, are also
responsible for one of the nation's finest collections of Latin
American art.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Latin American Art, a new
wing of the San Antonio Museum of Art, will open this week in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which will celebrate its grand opening Thursday
through Saturday, is named after Rockefeller for his large
collection of Mexican folk art _ the museum has 2,500 pieces _ and
for the Rockefeller family's financial support of the $11 million
project.
</P>
<P>
   The center's four galleries _ one each for pre-Columbian art,
Spanish colonial art, folk art (the Rockefeller collection) and
modern Latin American art _ house 3,000 years' worth of art, from
1,000 B.C. to the present. The 30,000-square-foot addition
increases the museum's size by 40 percent, and Museum of Art
officials hope the new center will help double the museum's
attendance, to 150,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major event for the museum and for San Antonio,''
said Dan Goddard, art critic for the San Antonio Express-News, who
has toured and written about the new center. Despite San Antonio's
large Hispanic community, which makes up more than 60 percent of
the city's population, the museum in the past has been criticized
for not dedicating enough space and resources to Latin American
art, Goddard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller center changes that, said its curator, Marion
Oettinger. ``This facility (is) the most comprehensive statement
about Latin American art in the United States,'' Oettinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller first went to Mexico in 1933, on a trip related to
his family's oil interests in Central and South America. He
returned to the region frequently during the next 45 years. He
served in several Latin American-related posts in the federal
government during the 1940s and '50s, before becoming New York's
governor _ and he amassed a collection of many thousands of pieces
of Latin American art, especially Mexican folk art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of the major (art) collectors of the time,
(Rockefeller) collected a lot of diverse material,'' said Dennis
Anderson, curator of the Empire State Art Collection. In addition
to Latin art, Rockefeller collected Renaissance art, American
glass, America silver, Tiffany pieces, African art and work by
20th-century European artists such as Picasso and Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   After Rockefeller's death in 1979, his daughter, Ann Rockefeller
Roberts, gained from his estate most of the pieces of Latin
American art. A nationwide search over several years resulted in
the San Antonio Museum of Art and the Mexican Museum in San
Francisco being named the recipients of the Rockefeller collection.
In 1985, Roberts gave the Museum of Art 2,500 pieces, five times as
many as went to the San Francisco museum.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, only a fraction of the Rockefeller collection has
been seen by the public, according to Oettinger. Even after the new
center opens, its collection is so large that only 20 percent of it
will be on view at any one time. The rest of it remains in storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``His daughter really felt it was important for the collection
to be in a place where people of Latino descent would be able to
see it,'' Goddard said. The southernmost of Texas' major
metropolitan centers was the ideal place for the Rockefeller
collection, he said, because ``San Antonio is the gateway to Latin
America.''

FLASH IN THE DARK: VARIETY OF ELECTRIC TORCHES LIGHT THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lighting our way is nothing new. In prehistoric
times, there was the primitive torch, which centuries later was
followed by candles and kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are myriad high-tech styles of flashlights to
choose from, which can shed the precise light on any task.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the first patented flashlight model in 1898 by
Conrad Hubert, founder of the American Ever-Ready Co., was
extremely crude in its design. It consisted of a paper tube with
metal fittings, a spring contact switch, bulb and brass reflector.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``electric hand torch,'' that first model could
produce only brief flashes of light, which is how the name
flashlight derived.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, flashlights have become sophisticated. They are
now manufactured in colorful plastics and a variety of sizes, with
bright beams, unlike the dull yellow glow emitted from flashlights
of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Today's flashlights use halogen, xenon or krypton bulbs to emit
everything from a sharp penlight beam to a that of an expansive
floodlight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new models are also tougher, rendering them
water-resistant, nearly unbreakable and rechargeable. Some of the
disposable flashlights even have batteries that last up to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Flashlights come in small disposable sizes and there are large
lanterns for camping or power outages. Nielsen statistics show that
most flashlights are purchased in December.
</P>
<P>
   On the small end, there are handy penlights for reading road
maps or theater playbills, and a flat model for under $3, called
the Flash Card, which is the size of a credit card and can slip
into a pocket or evening bag. Black &AMP; Decker even makes a
Snakelight Mini, which is 14 inc &QL; Fi1Wj}F g &Cx1f; 6

ANTI-GAY VIRULENCE IS . . . WELL, UN-AMERICAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's anything I can't tolerate, it's intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   I was sickened this past week to read of the savage and cowardly
killing of a young gay man in Wyoming in what was a hate crime of
the worst order. And I've been repulsed by the anti-gay rantings of
the Christian Coalition, the American Family Association and the
Center for Reclaiming America, as well as Republican leaders such
as Sen. Trent Lott and Rep. Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be a growing national obsession with picking on
gay people. It's cruel. It's un-American. It's grounded in
ignorance. And it's way past time for it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   I'm mystified as to why so many Americans harbor hatred and
contempt for gays. I can't fathom why right-wing religious groups
feel so threatened by gays and are obsessed with relegating them to
second-class citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   I've known a number of gay people, particularly through work.
Most whom I've known have been thoughtful, bright, open-minded,
live-and-let-live people. I've never felt threatened by them.
</P>
<P>
   I have at least one gay relative. All the complimentary
adjectives I mentioned above would fit him. Yet he has suffered
completely unwarranted verbal abuse and even physical attacks
merely because he is gay. He deserves far better.
</P>
<P>
   I have found certain common denominators among people who are
the most intensely anti-gay.
</P>
<P>
   First, they tend to be ignorant of any viewpoint other than
their own. They naively talk of ``the gay lifestyle,'' while being
oblivious to the fact that there are many differing lifestyles
among gays. Some gays are extroverted swingers, and others are
introverted, stay-at-home types; some like pro football, and others
enjoy needlework; some dig Steinbeck, and others crave comic books.
These same things are true of heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Virulently anti-gay people generally don't know any gay people
really well. They've never sat down with a gay person and had a
long, sincere talk about the emotional hardships and personal
attacks they have faced because they are gay. I have had such talks
with my gay relative and have learned greatly from them. Similarly,
I have known parents who gained an understanding and compassion for
gays only after learning that they had a homosexual son or
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Rabidly anti-gay groups often clamor that gay people are wanting
``special rights.'' On the contrary, most yearn just to be treated
like anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Some gay couples, for example, would like to have the legal
right to marry. How would a heterosexual couple feel if they were
told they had no right to marry? Many gays also want legal
protection against being fired from a job merely because of their
sexual orientation. If you're not gay, how would you feel about
being fired from a job just because you're heterosexual?
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Christian Coalition and other religious groups
mounted an ad campaign saying that homosexuals should change their
sexual orientation through conversion therapy. Indeed, anti-gay
groups often talk of gays ``choosing'' a homosexual lifestyle, as
if one could simply shop at Wal-Mart for a sexual preference. The
overwhelming weight of evidence indicates, however, that sexual
orientation is primarily innate, not freely ``chosen.'' Common
sense dictates that anyone who had a ``choice'' would choose to be
heterosexual because of the social stigma against gays.
</P>
<P>
   I can't claim to be an expert on being gay. I am a heterosexual
who has been married 27 years to a wonderful woman. But that
doesn't mean I should be intolerant of others who have a different
sexual orientation. Gay people always have been among us and always
will be.
</P>
<P>
   There's a magical place that for more than 200 years has been
known for tolerating cultural differences among its people. It's
called America. When we show tolerance, we reveal America in all
its glory.

   ISRAEL-BOMBING _ BE'ER SHEVA, Israel _ Six thousand miles away
from peace talks in the tranquil Maryland woods, the mercurial
dangers of the Mideast landed at Shali Ben Tal's feet Monday in the
form of a live hand grenade. The doe-eyed 19-year-old woman,
hospitalized with shrapnel injuries, was one of dozens of young
Israeli soldiers waiting for morning buses to their base when two
grenades were thrown into the crowd. No one was killed in the
attack. More than 60 were injured, two seriously. A group of
soldiers near the explosions pursued the attacker, beat him and
turned him over to police. He was reportedly a 25-year-old
Palestinian from a town about 20 minutes away in the West Bank,
land occupied by Israeli troops. The attack sent a shiver through
the country as all eyes were focused on the peace talks hosted by
President Bill Clinton at the Wye Plantation. Though it has been a
year since Israel faced its last horrific suicide bombing, this has
been the third small-arms attack in less than two weeks. (Kaplow,

   MAKAH-MEMORIES (Neah Bay, Wash.) _ To the outside world, where
the black and white images captured by photographer Edward S.
Curtis became renowned for their haunting, frozen moments, the
young girl was known simply as ``Makah Maiden.'' To her own people,
the child's identity remained a mystery for more than 60 years. It
wasn't until the 1970s, when 15 tribal elders were asked by the
University of Washington to review archival photos, that the little
girl got a name.

FLASH IN THE DARK: VARIETY OF ELECTRIC TORCHES LIGHT THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lighting our way is nothing new. In prehistoric
times, there was the primitive torch, which centuries later was
followed by candles and kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are myriad high-tech styles of flashlights to
choose from, which can shed the precise light on any task.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the first patented flashlight model in 1898 by
Conrad Hubert, founder of the American Ever-Ready Co., was
extremely crude in its design. It consisted of a paper tube with
metal fittings, a spring contact switch, bulb and brass reflector.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``electric hand torch,'' that first model could
produce only brief flashes of light, which is how the name
flashlight derived.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, flashlights have become sophisticated. They are
now manufactured in colorful plastics and a variety of sizes, with
bright beams, unlike the dull yellow glow emitted from flashlights
of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Today's flashlights use halogen, xenon or krypton bulbs to emit
everything from a sharp penlight beam to a that of an expansive
floodlight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new models are also tougher, rendering them
water-resistant, nearly unbreakable and rechargeable. Some of the
disposable flashlights even have batteries that last up to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Flashlights come in small disposable sizes and there are large
lanterns for camping or power outages. Nielsen statistics show that
most flashlights are purchased in December.
</P>
<P>
   On the small end, there are handy penlights for reading road
maps or theater playbills, and a flat model for under $3, called
the Flash Card, which is the size of a credit card and can slip
into a pocket or evening bag. Black &AMP; Decker even makes a
Snakelight Mini, which is 14 inches long and can fit into small
spaces, available for $18.
</P>
<P>
   Energizer makes a double-barrel flashlight, which switches from
a spotlight to a floodlight by twisting the lens, for $15 and up;
Rayovac has a swivel-lite with a 180-degree pivoting lamp for $10
and up, depending on the size.
</P>
<P>
   Among the novelty flashlights are L.L. Bean's Lightsource
Headlamp, which slips onto the head like a coal miner's lamp for
$28, and Sharper Image's headlight, with a swiveling fluorescent
bulb, AM-FM radio, emergency siren and flashing light for $28.
Brookstone makes a flashing light and radio combo for $25. Black &AMP;
Decker Leashlight will keep your hands free when walking the dog,
as it is attached to a retractable 18-foot dog leash for $50.
</P>
<P>
   Flashlights are found at any hardware store, home center,
sporting goods and discount store.

`CORPUS CHRISTI' NOT GREAT, BUT ITS MESSAGE IS PALPABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hate the sin, love the sinner. It's the official
Roman Catholic position on homosexuality, and it would also seem to
be the lesson of Terrence McNally's new play about Jesus, ``Corpus
Christi.''
</P>
<P>
   The play opened last week to a noisy demonstration by an
estimated 2,000 right-wing Catholics and a quieter but equally
well-attended counter-demonstration organized by free-speech
activists and attended by dozens of luminaries of the New York
theater world, including the actor Wallace Shawn, the producer
Norman Lear and the playwright Tony Kushner.
</P>
<P>
   But there were two very different ideas about the nature of sin
competing on 55th Street, and they seem as powerful an indicator as
any of the American cultural divide. For the play's defenders and
for McNally himself, the great evil is intolerance, along with its
twin, hypocrisy. At one point in the play, McNally's Jesus
lambastes a late 20th century homophobic priest in tones his
Biblical counterpart reserved for the religious hierarchs of his
own day: ``You are hypocrites and liars. You have perverted my
father's words to serve your own ends. I despise you.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells his followers: ``All who do not love all men are
against me.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Catholics, the significant sin was homosexuality.
They had heard, thanks to a cynically provocative article that ran
in the New York Post at the end of April, that McNally's new play
featured a gay Jesus engaging in unmentionable acts with his
apostles. The poor Manhattan Theatre Club, a small house known for
its dedication to the production of new work, was deluged with hate
mail and death threats. It canceled the play and was promptly
pilloried by its own constituents, theater artists and patrons, for
cowardice.
</P>
<P>
   So the theater hired a private security firm, installed the kind
of X-ray equipment usually found in airport boarding areas and
announced that it would, after all, present the play as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi'' has been attended by a chorus of protesters,
some dressed as Jesus hauling his cross on wheels, some kneeling on
the filthy, often wet pavement and chanting the rosary, ever since
previews began Sept. 22. The overwhelming majority of the
protesters on both sides had not seen the play _ the Catholics
because they don't want to (``why would I drink something if I knew
it was poison?'' said a demonstrator who would identify himself
only as Nereus), the free-speech activists because, thanks to the
Catholics, they can't get tickets. The play is sold out through its
final performance, Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Foley, a retired Long Island elementary school teacher,
attended a preview performance and said she bought her tickets as
soon as she heard about the play ``because I wanted to see what all
the fuss was about.'' Her husband said he felt sorry for the
protesters. ``But they said they'd pray for me,'' he added kindly.
``You can't ask much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights and the man who organized the
demonstration, has said repeatedly that his objection to the play
is that it is anti-Catholic. ``You are the real authoritarians at
heart,'' he shouted through a bullhorn at the counter-protesters.
``We're the ones that believe in tolerance, not you phonies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the play is neither a denunciation of Catholics, nor of
Catholicism _ unless you believe, as do many of the protesting
Catholics, that Jesus (and not just Jesus, but a certain version of
Jesus) belongs to Catholics. It is, rather, McNally's vision of a
Christianity that might include and bless homosexuals and
homosexual love, as Jesus blessed adulterers and tax collectors and
other outcasts of his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi'' is the story of a young man named Joshua
growing up gay in the Texas city of the same name (McNally's
hometown), his life a kind of surreal parallel to the Biblical
story of Jesus. It is a reverent, almost prayerful play, an
allegory about the persecution of gays _ horribly resonant in
aftermath of the death of Matthew Shepard, the gay student who was
beaten and hung from a fence, crucifixion style, in Laramie, Wyo.
Joshua/Jesus encourages his followers to love even the most
despised among them. And his is not the condescending love of
noblesse oblige. McNally's point (a point long made by liberal
theologians) is that Jesus not only defended and forgave the
sinners, the unclean, he consorted with them as his equals.
</P>
<P>
   Over the protests of his disciples, Joshua makes love to a young
hustler, cures him of AIDS and recruits him to his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi'' is not a great play. It is, at times, both
powerful and disturbing, but it is less eloquent as drama than
polemic. Some of the humor is sophomoric (Jesus and his Apostles
spend Saturday nights in a disco; Satan is James Dean), and so are
some of the ideas (the belief that free love is about love has long
been discredited). And the play rests too heavily on the power of
the Biblical story without convincingly evoking its contemporary
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of the Passion Plays of my childhood, the naive
renderings of the life and death of Jesus enacted in Catholic
churches and schools for Easter. And I wonder whether this was not
the form McNally meant to appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Because, ironically, ``Corpus Christi'' is most effective as a
devotional tableau. I have never seen such a moving, powerfully
enacted crucifixion. And then there is the scene in which
Jesus/Joshua calls the dead Lazarus to life and the awakened man
falls to his knees, humble in his gratitude, to pray. No, Jesus
admonishes him, ``this is how you pray.'' And he jumps up on a
bench, all life and good health, lifts his hands and his head to
the light, and begins, joyously, the old recitation: ``Our Father,
who art in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The sighs from the audience were palpable.

HERE'S A CHANCE TO INVEST $190,000 IN STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Later this year I will get stock worth approximately $190,000
and I am very uncertain as to my best option on investing this
money. Taxes are a consideration here. I am 43 and my wife is 38
and we have a 3-year-old daughter. My wife and I earn $70,000
combined and are contributing the maximum allowed _ 15 percent _ to
401(k) plans where we currently have $300,000, with half in an
equity index fund and 15 percent each in a small-cap stock index
and a non-US equity fund. We would both like to retire at about age
55, and at the same time to ensure that our daughter has the
opportunity to attend the college of her choice.
</P>
<P>
   D.B., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since your daughter will reach college age at about the time
you plan to retire, it occurs to me that a significant piece of
this money might be tucked aside now to meet those costs.
</P>
<P>
   Since you've held this stock for many years, you might be well
served by giving some of the stock to your daughter. This should
allow her to sell it and pay the taxes at a lower rate that you
would face.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you might give $30,000 worth of the stock to your
wife, which would not be a taxable event. Then you and she could
each begin a program of giving your daughter $10,000 a year for
three years. The net effect would be that after 14 years of this
program, she would accumulate $217,633, presuming that she held on
to the investments (and thus paid no taxes) and achieved average 10
percent annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   That $217,633 might seem like an awful lot of money for college
right now, but if education costs escalate as predicted that amount
will probably be fairly close for a private college in the year
2014.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course still leaves you with $130,000 worth of the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   If you are determined to sell it, you would probably be best
served by spreading the transactions out over the tax years 1998,
1999, 2000, and perhaps later, depending on your overall tax
situation. You would probably find it worth your while to hire a
tax expert to guide you in this. (Now is also a great time to scour
your assets for a potential capital loss, which would be used to
offset some of the gains.)
</P>
<P>
   However the taxes work out, I would view that $130,000 as money
to be used in two ways. First, since the lion's share of your
current savings are in those tax-deferred 401(k) accounts, I would
begin by building tax-free retirement savings, drawing $2,000 a
year from this money to fund Roth IRAs for both yourself and your
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder I would earmark as a pool that you might draw on
during the 4 1/2-year period after you retire and before you can
begin to withdraw from your tax-deferred accounts without penalty
or committing yourself to a plan of set withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you were to put this money into a balanced fund such as
Vanguard Balanced Index or Fidelity Puritan, withdrawing only the
money to fund the Roth IRAs. After a dozen years, the pool would be
$281,84, presuming average annual returns of 9 percent from your
investment. Those figures don't reflect any money you might have to
withdraw to pay taxes, but the pool still should be more than ample
to get you through that 4 1/2-year gap.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a question about the requirements to begin withdrawals
from tax-deferred accounts after a person reaches age 70 1/2. If
you are still working past that age, are you allowed to delay your
distribution until after you stop working?
</P>
<P>
   R.F., Hingham &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. The only way you could avoid the minimum distribution
rules for an IRA account would be to convert it to a Roth IRA,
paying the taxes now (or over the course of four years if the
transfer is made before the end of this year). Otherwise your first
withdrawal must be made by April 1 of the year following the year
in which you reach age 70 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My asset-allocation strategy includes having a modest portion
of my portfolio in domestic small caps. Currently the money is in
the Heartland Value fund, but I'm concerned about its recent
decision to reopen the fund to new investors. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds, Heartland Value is significantly larger
than any of its small-cap peers. While I don't doubt (fund manager)
Bill Nasgovitz's stock-picking skills, isn't that large size going
to make it difficult to perform well when small caps finally take
off again? Isn't reopening the fund only going to exacerbate the
problem? If I dump the fund, I'm thinking of replacing it with
something in the small-cap blend category, such as Nicholas Limited
Edition or T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock.
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Brighton &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm with you most of the way. The fairly lame argument
Heartland Value made to Morningstar on the subject is that the
managers don't ``see much danger in the near term of the fund
growing rapidly, given the recent market slide.''
</P>
<P>
   But from my point of view, and probably yours, the goal is not
maintaining the assets, but shrinking them. Only one entity _ the
managing company _ is likely to enjoy maintenance or growth of
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The fund already holds a portfolio of 317 issues, more than
double the 148 average for its small-cap value peers. Any
substantial additional growth in assets under management can only
have one of two results _ spreading the portfolio even further, or
forcing it to invest in ever-larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the migration of Kaufmann fund, of which I am a
stockholder, from a small-cap growth portfolio to a mid-cap blend,
and watched as the fund performance steadily declined under the
burden of assets, which exceeded $6 billion entering this year.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand the reason for ``growing'' the fund _ after
all, the more assets under management, the more money the managers
can earn. But perhaps growing assets isn't everything. This year,
as Kaufmann's performance has remained subpar, assets have shrunk
by nearly $2 billion. Some growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland Value seems to be following a similar track; its great
years came from 1991 to 1995; entering '91 the assets stood at less
than $20 million and it entered '95 with $339 million under
management. The next year it topped $1 billion, and that was its
last year of superior, or even above-average, performance.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the last Morningstar report, dated June 30,
Heartland Value has $1.92 billion under management; apparently
other owners are following your thinking, because assets stood at
$1.55 billion as of the Oct. 8 report from Lipper Analytical
Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not sure I agree with your thinking about moving from
small-cap value to small-cap blend. In every period ranging from
one month to five years, the average for small-cap value funds has
beat that of the small-cap value or growth peers. The only
small-cap blend fund that Morningstar accords above-average grades
to is Fasciano fund (although Lipper puts it in the mid-cap
category). No small-cap growth fund wins above-average grades.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertain market, I suggest you stay in the value end
of the small-cap arena.

TRUMPET THE HOLIDAYS BY FORCING AMARYLLIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amaryllis are foolproof candidates for holiday blooms. The
trumpet-shaped flowers are big, bold and cheerful. Even the bulbs
are round and plump, like Santa himself.
</P>
<P>
   Coaxing the large lilylike flowers into bloom for winter
celebrations is an easy gardening feat. It's simply a matter of:
Plant. Water. Watch them grow.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good year for amaryllis. The exotic flowers are
available in rich, traditional red; soft shades of pink; salmon;
elegant white; pale yellow; and bicolors. Blooms may be single or
double. And there are the miniatures _ tall plants with smaller
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   It has become tradition to coax, or force, large Dutch hybrid
amaryllis into bloom to decorate windowsills or use as centerpieces
during the holidays. We pop a bulb into a pot, and in six to eight
weeks the blooms unfold. The big flowers are popular gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners should note, however, that there are African bulbs on
the market, too, says Charles Prasek, president of the Greater
Houston Amaryllis Club and the Houston Amaryllis Society. The
African amaryllis are as easy as the Dutch. But they are quick. The
African bulbs will flower three to five weeks after planting, large
beautiful blooms on shorter stalks that do not require staking.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your nurseryman to identify the bulbs if they are not
labeled.
</P>
<P>
   To force amaryllis for winter color, select large, firm bulbs.
Bigger bulbs generate more flower stalks, therefore more blooms.
Stay away from bruised or discolored bulbs and/or those that lack
roots. Clean the bulbs by removing dried scales and any dried
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis bulbs do not require pre-chilling, as do tulips,
Prasek says. But African bulbs are so quick they may bloom in the
bag. If you want to delay the flowers for the holidays, hold the
bulbs in the refrigerator until you're ready to plant. Do not
freeze. Do not store with vegetables or fruit.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to refrigerate the Dutch bulbs, but you can do
so to delay blooms or you can simply store them in a cool, dry
place until potting time.
</P>
<P>
   Before potting any amaryllis bulb to coax into holiday bloom, it
is important to soak the roots and the bottom of the bulb in
lukewarm water for at least four hours. Keep the upper half of the
bulb dry.
</P>
<P>
   Pot Dutch bulbs six to eight weeks before you want flowers.
Bloom time varies a little among varieties. Many potted the first
of November should bloom mid-December. Pot African amaryllis bulbs
three to five weeks before desired bloom time. For an extended
flowering period, start a new pot every few weeks for blooms all
winter and into spring.
</P>
<P>
   Use a clean clay pot with a drainage hole. Prasek recommends a
pot large enough to allow an inch of space between the bulb and the
inside wall of the pot. Amaryllis bloom best when the succulent
roots are restricted, or pot-bound. (For an extra-dramatic punch,
pot three bulbs in a 12-inch container.)
</P>
<P>
   Fill the container with a rich, well-draining potting mix. The
ideal pH range is 6.0 to 6.8.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the roots over a small mound of soil in the pot, then add
more potting mix and gently firm to eliminate air pockets and
secure the bulb. Leave the upper third of the bulb above the soil
line. The soil line should be about an inch down from the top of
the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Water well with tepid water, and do not water again for two
weeks, Prasek says. Then water sparingly until the flower stalk and
the foliage are growing well.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the pot in a place where the temperature is above 68
degrees. Avoid drafts and areas where there are great swings
between night and day temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   For years, we've been told to store freshly potted bulbs in a
dark area. But there's no need to worry about finding room for the
bulbs in that crowded closet. Place the pot in indirect light for
the first three weeks, Prasek says, then move the amaryllis into
bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Stake the flower stalk of Dutch bulbs to support the future
large and heavy blooms. The stalks can be 2 feet tall, the blooms
as much as 8 inches across. Tie the flower stalk loosely to the
stake. Do not allow the stake to touch petals or bulb. Rotate the
container to avoid a permanently leaning flower stalk.
</P>
<P>
   Heat initiates the amaryllis bloom, Prasek explains, while light
affects the quality of the bloom. Bright light is good, but direct
rays can lower the quality of the flowers. Under good conditions,
amaryllis flowers retain quality for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the flower stalk two inches above the neck of the bulb
once the blooms have withered, but leave the straplike foliage to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   You can continue to grow the holiday amaryllis in its container
or transplant the bulb in the garden with half of the bulb above
the soil in a fertile, well-draining bed, ideally with morning sun
and afternoon shade. Prasek recommends waiting until April when
there is no threat of frost to leave amaryllis outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners simply sink the bulb, pot and all, into a raised
bed. The roots will eventually grow into the bed. Should extremely
harsh weather hit, the pot can be lifted and the bulb moved
temporarily to a protected area. While those roots in the garden
bed will be torn, those within the container will not be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis need a year to acclimate in the garden, Prasek says.
Then the bulbs will begin a natural spring-flowering period.
</P>
<P>
   Water amaryllis regularly through spring and summer. Decrease
watering when the foliage yellows, as lower fall temperatures
trigger dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis are known as heavy feeders, and Prasek says the bulbs
benefit from organic and synthetic nutrient sources. He prefers
light or quarter-strength rates to heavier biweekly or monthly
rates and suggests a 2-2-1 formula in spring for good foliage
growth, a 1-2-1 in summer to encourage growth processes and root
development and a 1-2-2 fertilizer formula in the fall to help the
bulbs harden off and prepare for good growth the following spring.
The first number in a fertilizer formula represents nitrogen, the
second number represents phosphorus, the third potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Do not fertilize bulbs during dormancy. Lay container plants on
their sides in a cool place during dormancy. Mulch garden bulbs.
Amaryllis will wake in spring as the soil warms.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis forced to flower for the upcoming holidays can bring
years of enjoyment as pot plants or in the garden. But don't
attempt to force the bulbs two years in a row. They need rebuilding
time. Buy new bulbs next fall for end-of-the century celebrations. &QL;

PLANT LIMA BEANS IN SPRING AND FALL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have several questions. I bought some lima beans because I
love to eat them. I have no clue as to how to grow them.
</P>
<P>
   I bought several roses and planted them in February in a new
bed. I have had great branch and leaf production but not many
flowers on most of them. I used an organic fertilizer and soil
conditioner, and flowering improved. I don't know if I've underfed
them or if it's just been a bad summer.
</P>
<P>
   I planted a butterfly bush in a mostly sunny spot. Is this OK? I
also planted some wildflower seeds. I fell in love with purple
coneflowers, but somehow I managed to kill them. I guess they
needed more shade?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can plant lima bean seed in mid-March and April. And you
can sow again mid-August to mid-September for a fall crop. Plant in
sun in a raised bed enriched with organic matter. Seeds need a warm
soil to germinate, but pod set can be poor when day temperatures
are consistently in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   You can grow pole limas or bush limas. Sow bush limas 1 { inches
deep and 2 inches apart. Thin to 4 to 6 inches apart. Harvest in 65
to 75 days. Sow pole types at the same depth but 4 inches apart,
and thin 8 to 12 inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was the worst summer I've experienced here. My roses
shut down during the heat and drought but are blooming well now.
I'll bet yours are flowering more with the cooler temperatures.
Fall blooms are often as beautiful as spring blooms. Modern roses
like a well-draining, highly organic soil, water and a regular
fertilization schedule during the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Rosarians apply granular fertilizers every four to six weeks
spring through September, then stop until the next spring. Many
apply soluble fertilizers every two weeks. It would be safe to give
your roses an application of fish emulsion now, but after
mid-October all fertilization comes to a halt. Always water before
and after fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The butterfly bush (Buddleia) will grow in full sun, but I've
had better luck with morning sun and afternoon shade and filtered
sun throughout the day. An organically enriched soil is best, and
good drainage is important. Do not overwater this plant. Cut back
in early spring to encourage strong growth. Snip off spent blooms
spring, summer and fall for repeat flowering.
</P>
<P>
   Purple coneflower (Echinacea) takes full sun as well as partial
shade. This native perennial also likes good air circulation and a
well-draining, organically enriched soil. Add a little sand, if
necessary, to ensure drainage. Water when needed, but don't overdo
it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Q: I received a large poinsettia last Christmas and have kept
it indoors ever since. It had red blooms until September. Now, only
green leaves. It is 3 feet tall and nearly as wide. Would watering
with Epsom salt encourage it to develop red blooms? Should I put it
in a dark place?
</P>
<P>
   A: To trigger the coloring process for the holidays, begin a
light-dark rotation now. In late afternoon move the plant to a
completely dark spot for 14 to 15 hours, then return to light in
the morning. Continue this rotation until the plant begins to show
color.
</P>
<P>
   A night temperature of 65 degrees is optimum; much below that
will delay the coloring process. Day temperature is not as
critical, but try to avoid temperatures higher than 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The poinsettia holds its colorful bracts for months if kept cool
and not overwatered. For long-lasting color, display poinsettias
where they will receive strong natural light and a daytime
temperature that does not exceed 75 degrees. Night temperatures
should not dip below 60. Plants exposed to 50-degree temperatures
will drop their leaves. Avoid drafts and heating registers. Water
only when the soil feels dry.
</P>
<P>
   Poinsettias can be used as centerpieces, at the foot of a
stairway, on tabletops and in a kitchen window. Those who use
poinsettias at the front door for a colorful entrance should
remember to protect them from cold winds and chilling temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Those who carry poinsettias holiday to holiday can apply a
balanced fertilizer during the growing season. A little Epsom salt
won't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: My friend is moving and has given me a night-blooming cereus
and a red passion vine. How do I care for these?
</P>
<P>
   A: Night-blooming cereus (Epiphyllum oxypetalum), is a tall,
rangy cactus. The stems can reach 6 feet with curious, long and
thick flower stems. The fragrant blooms are usually the attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Culture for the night-blooming cereus is simple. All you need is
a large pot filled with good potting soil; a well-draining, organic
soil will do. These plants like bright light and humidity, and
there's no problem providing those needs outdoors spring to fall.
But night-blooming cereus will freeze and must be protected should
temperatures drop in winter. The plants do not require a lot of
water, and in fact dislike wet feet.
</P>
<P>
   Propagation also is simple. Snip a leaf and drop it in a jar of
water, and within a relatively short time the cutting roots. Pot
this up, and when a second leaf has formed, bump the baby plant to
the next pot size.
</P>
<P>
   There's more than one species of perennial red passionflower.
The South American native (Passiflora coccinea) has beautiful
large, showy blooms spring to fall and may prove evergreen with
protection. It prefers a sandy, organically enriched soil and some
water during the growing season. ``P. vitifolia'' has rich, deep
crimson blooms and is sometimes called Texas scarlet passionflower.
It will grow in the same soil conditions. Both take sun to part
shade. Mulch both to protect roots in winter.

FRESH AIR AND FUN ARRIVE IN THE MAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having returned home from a recent trip beset with the creeping
crud, I turned to an always-dependable source for a quick
pick-me-up:
</P>
<P>
   The daily mail.
</P>
<P>
   Where can I go to find fresh air and fun? Here's an idea: I'll
take a cycling ``Tour de Pubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by BikeWest Magazine and Colorado-based
AdventureScapes Travel &AMP; Tour Club, this series of 13
Thursday-to-Sunday events offers mountain and road biking trips for
all riding abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The settings alone are enough to clear the sinuses: Jackson
Hole, Wyo.; Park City and Moab, Utah; Estes Park, Durango,
Steamboat Springs and Telluride, Colo.; Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   And with barbecue served on weekends and a brew pub as the
center of each event _ presumably with imbibings after the daily
2-to-4-hour rides, not before _ how can I go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Be his guest &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oops. I don't own a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Better check other options. This sounds intriguing: Guests at
Seattle's Alexis Hotel can now join general manager Howard Jacobs
for a one-hour in-line skating ``tour on wheels'' of Seattle's
waterfront. Guests can reserve an exercise partner, tour guide and
hotel room at the same time, and participants receive a
complimentary T-shirt and pair of shorts, use of in-line skates and
safety equipment provided by K2 Skates and two complimentary
PowerBar Energy Bars.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. Except when requested by groups of four or more, tours
are scheduled Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7 a.m. I'd need more than
two Energy Bars to don wheels that early.
</P>
<P>
   This is more my style: ``guilt-free cooking tours'' in Tuscany
and Provence sponsored by California-based Classic Journeys.
</P>
<P>
   On a seven-day ``Taste of Tuscany'' tour, I can meet with local
bakers, shepherds, farmers and wine growers in the kitchens of
private farmhouses, restaurants and hotels straddling Florence and
Siena to learn about and taste the region's breads, cheeses, olive
oils and wines.
</P>
<P>
   How do I accomplish all this guilt-free? By walking between
kitchens and the tour's scenic attractions. I am assured that these
are ``easy-going walks'' offering ``well-rounded immersion in the
local culture.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belly gaffs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If biking, hiking and skating for beer, wine and candy can't
ease the blahs, what about dancing? Mail call also brings notice of
the first annual belly dance camp for adults, scheduled by New
York-based Asya Genesis Tours April 29-May 10, 1999, on the
Turquoise Coast of southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Do men belly dance? Never mind. The 19 hours of instruction
includes Turkish folkloric dance classes for novices. I know I can
stomach that. And all sorts of nondancing excursions are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see what else the mail presents. Here's word from Travel
Holiday magazine about superstitions abroad. Want to scare your
waiter in France? (Who wouldn't?) Just put your baguette on the
table with the flat side up; it's a sign of doom. Never whistle in
Russia; it means you're about to lose money. And to attain good
luck in Thailand, paying a nominal fee allows you to walk under an
elephant's belly.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite piece of mail is an enticing promotion from Rosewood
Hotels &AMP; Resort's Las Ventanas al Paraiso in Los Cabos, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This luxurious lodging offers precisely the tonics I need to
cure all ills: a ``stress-relaxing neck massage;'' a ``leisurely
walk along a fine-sand beach or in a flowering desert
countryside;'' and for those ``who require a special diet or who
simply crave a particular food, the chef will prepare made-to-order
dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once catch: These special menus, massages and other
pampering are designed for dogs and cats. The resort even features
a treatment to help offset ``pet jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the amenities for humans _ especially ``drinks
under thatched palapas'' and ``gazing at the stars through the
individual telescope in your suite'' _ appeal, too. But I wonder if
I'm allowed to order the Kitty Captain's Plate of scrambled eggs
and poached salmon?

SKI RESORTS ARE EXPANDING AND RENOVATING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the winter-vacation race, snow-focused resorts are getting a
run for their money.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans cool to summer's crowds, Europe in winter has never
looked more appealing. And the Asian economic slump has spawned
packages so low that it's almost a shame not to go.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a ski resort to do to compete? Expand, improve and
renovate.
</P>
<P>
   Terrain grows, instructional programs are tweaked, and old
chairlifts give way to high-speed successors.
</P>
<P>
   Take Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah. Long revered as one
of the most luxurious of ski resorts _ and that's ski, no
snowboarding allowed _ Deer Valley is investing more than $18
million in improvements for the winter season.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrades and renovations include two new ski areas. Experienced
skiers will appreciate the terrain, some of the steepest found at
Deer Valley. One fixed-grip quad chairlift and one high-speed quad
chair will service 500 acres on the resort's fourth mountain,
Empire Canyon, that previously were accessible only via guided
Snowcat tours.
</P>
<P>
   Another 60 acres with a high-speed gondola and quad chairlift
will open as part of the resort's Deer Crest development.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley's enhancements will give it 18 lifts and 84 ski runs
plus six bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's new at other resorts in Utah and across North
America:
</P>
<P>
   Utah &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of the American Skiing Co., the Canyons
continues its transformation into a major winter-sports resort.
This season the resort will open Ninety-Nine 90 peak, where more
than 800 acres will be accessible by a high-speed detachable quad
chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyons also can boast of two more lifts (a triple chair and
another high-speed quad) and two surface lifts. For snowboarders,
the resort will offer Crazy Eddie's Playground, the largest terrain
park in Utah, and the Launch Pad, a halfpipe that is more than 425
feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Readying for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games (along with the Deer
Valley and Snowbasin ski resorts), Park City Mountain Resort is
increasing its terrain by more than 3,000 acres this season. The
expansion, which includes a high-speed, six-passenger chairlift,
will give Park City 97 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The resort has installed lights at its PayDay halfpipe to
enhance evening action for boarders and skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Also of note in Utah: upgraded snow-making capabilities at Alta
Ski Area, expanded tubing terrain and a snowboard park at Brian
Head, four new lifts at Snowbasin, and a terrain park and halfpipe
at Snowbird.
</P>
<P>
   And Solitude has expanded its name to Solitude Mountain Resort
to reflect a winter-sports menu that includes downhill and
cross-country skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's new tricks for old _ and not-so-old _ dogs at Telluride.
The Telluride Ski &AMP; Golf Co. is debuting the Telluride Teaching
System based on the science of biomechanics and the efficient
movements performed by the best skiers. In this system, the wedge
is out; instructors instead will focus on simple movements combined
with proper body alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen/Snowmass will continue to attract crowds with its
commitment to snowboarders. This winter, shredders will find two
new halfpipes, a terrain park and ``ride guides'' _ skilled riders
who lead mountain tours to the best snowboarding terrain. Other
guides will be stationed at the halfpipes to offer snowboarding
tips.
</P>
<P>
   At Copper Mountain, two high-speed detachable chairlifts _ a
quad and a six-seater _ will cut the time it takes to get up the
mountain. And in January, expert freestyle snowboarders will be
able to test the resort's advanced terrain park designed by
professional snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, where good grooming has always counted, has beefed up its
Snowcat collection. Ditto for its sister resorts at Beaver Creek
and Breckenridge. The other Vail Resorts property, Keystone, will
get a lift with a high-speed quad.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve new trails and a high-speed quad chairlift will add
appeal to Pioneer Ridge at Steamboat Ski Resort.
</P>
<P>
   A new triple chairlift and an on-mountain restaurant await
guests at Aspen Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news from the Land of Enchantment is the marketing
partnership between Southwest Airlines and Ski New Mexico, which
includes Taos Ski Valley, Ski Santa Fe, Red River Ski Area, Angel
Fire Resort and Sandia Peak. For Houston skiers, it will offer the
opportunity to discover our neighbor's ski resorts at a good price.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the year to try well-regarded Taos, which has
increased its snow-making capabilities by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Angel Fire, skiers and snowboarders will find a high-speed
detachable quad chairlift ready to whisk them to the top of the
Back Basin. The lift will cut last year's 16-minute journey to five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes at Angel Fire include a Children's Ski and
Snowboard School complex, trails in the Back Basin and a terrain
park.
</P>
<P>
   California &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could it be more heavenly? Sure, as two high-speed detachable
quads make lift lines shorter at Heavenly. Snowboarders and skiers
also will find more on-mountain dining options when
13,000-square-foot Mountain Lodge opens next to Sky Deck. And
families will appreciate the expanded Children's Center and a
day-care facility that accepts kids ages 6 months to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
   Northstar-at-Tahoe is adding night skiing and Snowcat tours that
take in 200 acres on the north side of Lookout Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-speed gondola known as the Gold Coast Funitel (from
the terms funicular and ``telepherique,'' as gondolas are called in
Switzerland) will move skiers at Squaw Valley, which also has added
a gondola and renovated its cable-car system.
</P>
<P>
   Also new in California: an upgraded lift system at Alpine
Meadows, a main lodge at Mount Rose, lifts and a $5.5 million lodge
with 15,000 square feet of sundeck at Sugar Bowl, a lift-served
tubing hill at Sierra at Tahoe, and a triple chair and longer name
at Boreal Mountain Playground.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big Sky in Montana is reversing its downhill thinking with the
opening of its first uphill trail. Moose Tracks, which leads to
old-growth forest and meadows, has been developed for snowshoers.
</P>
<P>
   The resort also will celebrate its 25th anniversary with the
debut of a terrain park featuring a halfpipe and banked turns,
music and a rope-tow.
</P>
<P>
   At Whistler Resort in British Columbia, where the season on
Whistler and Blackcomb mountains begins Nov. 25, a $24 million
project includes construction of a detachable quad chair that will
reach the summit of Whistler Peak in four minutes and a remake of
the resort's Summit restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In Alberta, enhancements include a high-speed quad chair in Lake
Louise Ski Resort's Larch area, a halfpipe for snowboarders on
Sunshine Village's Strawberry Face, and development of the American
Basin terrain at the Banff Mount Norquay resort.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, Tremblant is hoping guests will warm up to the heated
eight-passenger cabins on its high-speed gondola.
</P>
<P>
   At Attitash Bear Peak in New Hampshire, a high-speed quad and a
learning center await skiers.
</P>
<P>
   At Killington in Vermont, two high-speed detachable quad chairs
will replace older chairlifts. And 250 new snow-guns will be
blowing a storm of the white stuff when Mother Nature takes a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday River in Newry, Maine, will welcome skiers with a new
high-speed detachable quad.
</P>
<P>
   And while it doesn't sound as exciting as a new lift or lodge,
Sugarloaf/USA in Carrabassett Valley, Maine, has pumped more than
$1.6 million this season into grooming and snow-making equipment. &QL;

NEED INSURANCE? NO ODD REQUEST WILL BE REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you are worried about insurance covering
eccentric needs, relax. The burgeoning insurance industry has a
plethora of paranormal policies.
</P>
<P>
   You can insure your hair (supermodels do it), your legs (Mary
Hart did it), your vocal cords (Bruce Springsteen did it), even
your private parts (John Wayne Bobbitt can only wish).
</P>
<P>
   One London-based company alone has sold policies against alien
abduction or impregnation, werewolf metamorphosis and even
immaculate conception, which its owner drolly insists is ``popular
with girls named Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   California insurance companies specialize in policies to cover
bar mitzvah fiascoes, pet cancer and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   And an Internet company offers insurance against life's greatest
unpredictability. If you've purchased applicable coverage from
Worldwide Weather at www.weatherins.com, and your tropical vacation
is ruined by the wrath of a hurricane or the drizzle of persistent
rain, you'll be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call them bizarre, the exotic _ however you want to
characterize the policies. Some people need insurance that's every
bit as unique as they are,'' said Ted Pierce, executive director of
the San Francisco-based Surplus Line Association of California, a
trade group and quasi-regulator for brokers of unusual ``surplus''
insurance not available through insurance companies licensed in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The association has cleared a policy for someone breeding birds
for ostrich jerky, a policy insuring that a man's frozen fertility
remains safe in the custody of a sperm bank, and a policy for
people who fear E. coli bacteria or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   Californians have insured their collections of snuff boxes,
carousel horses and taxidermy. Pop icon Michael Jackson even
insured his private zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can imagine it and it's worth something,'' Pierce said,
``somebody out there has insurance on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of earthlings have purchased insurance against
extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   The first firm to boldly go where no insurer had gone before,
the Florida-based UFO Abduction Insurance Co. began offering alien
abduction insurance a decade ago. It costs $19.95 for a $10 million
policy that provides psychiatric care and sarcasm protection, plus
a double indemnity clause ``if your alien hosts regard you as a
food source.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy's slogan: ``Beam me up _ I'm covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers reincarnation insurance, noting, ``While
it's still true you can't take it with you, now you can leave it
here and come back and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million payout doubles ``if you return as a lower life
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants are rejected if they answer yes to the questions ``Do
you take this seriously?'' and ``Were your parents related before
they married?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mike St. Lawrence, president of the company, ``We're as
serious as we can be without serving jail time.''
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Not so a London-based insurance broker that began collecting
serious premiums for coverage against aliens. The company is
Goodfellow, Rebecca, Ingrams and Pearson Ltd. (acronym GRIP).
Managing partner Simon Burgess is a tongue-in-cheek Briton who
blithely admits he would not buy such policies, but added, ``I've
never been afraid of parsing the feeble-minded from their cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heaven's Gate cult reportedly paid $1,000 for a policy to
cover its members, at $1 million per person, for abduction,
impregnation or death by aliens. When 30 cult members committed
suicide on the outskirts of San Diego, hoping to be transported to
a UFO trailing the Hale-Bopp comet, Burgess suspended sales out of
fear that fickle Yankee juries might require GRIP to pay. But
eventually, Burgess explained, ``Greed got the better of us and we
resumed them.''
</P>
<P>
   GRIP now offers insurance against virgin birth, ghosts,
transformation into a werewolf, and coverage for unfaithful
husbands who fear ``Bobbitting.''
</P>
<P>
   GRIP recently began offering ``erectional protection''
insurance, and Burgess said he's issued one in Bill Clinton's name,
purchased by a Republican who will ``remain unnamed.'' Such GRIP
policies promise $1.5 million in coverage for an annual premium of
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, not one claim has ever been paid. Said Burgess:
``We're not in the business of paying claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The more populist policies are for special events.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people last year insured their nuptials through
R.V. Nuccio and Associates Insurance Brokers in Fawnskin, a small
town in Southern California. A $600 premium will reimburse up to
$20,000 in lost expenses, plus provide liability insurance in case
a guest trips and sues.
</P>
<P>
   The policy paid off for the bride whose little brother decided
at the last minute to make her plain white gown prettier by
finger-painting it. And for the bride whose cat used her dress to
deliver a litter of kittens. And when one bride's mother, despising
the groom, exacted revenge by scraping every wedding guest's car
with a can opener.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance also paid $25,000 to fly a party back to the wedding
site in Hawaii, recreate the flowers and food, and reshoot the
ceremony after the original negatives were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay out on six or seven of those a week _ I'm telling you,
in many cases the bride would rather have the wedding photos than
the groom,'' Nuccio said.
</P>
<P>
   But brides or grooms who wish to buy insurance against cold feet
are out of luck. ``That would too easily set us up for fraud and
collusion,'' Nuccio said. ``If you're asking the question, don't
get married.''

2002: A WINTER OLYMPICS ODYSSEY AWAITS VISITORS TO UTAH 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ 1,209 days to go.
</P>
<P>
   It's countdown time in Utah. In just 40 months, 3,500 athletes
and 10,000 members of the media are going to come calling as Utah
hosts the 2002 Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't even take into account the estimated 10 billion
who will be watching events unfold from the comfort of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fret for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the state was awarded the Games in 1995, the work
had begun. Today, 80 percent of the Olympic facilities and venues
are already in use.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for vacationers, who can easily fulfill their
athletic fantasies by visiting and even joining in the action at
these venues.
</P>
<P>
   Start your Olympic tour where the Games will begin on Feb. 7,
2002. Salt Lake City is the site of the Olympic Village and host of
the opening and closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Village, home to athletes and officials, will be on
the campus of the University of Utah. A renovated Rice Stadium is
expecting 50,000 spectators for popular opening and closing events.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Village, a 70-acre compound, also will be within the
Fort Douglas historic area.
</P>
<P>
   While the future village is not open to the public, you can
visit the Fort Douglas Military Museum, located adjacent to the
university. Fort Douglas historic area.
</P>
<P>
   While the future village is not open to the public, you can
visit the Fort Douglas Military Museum, located adjacent to the
university. Fort Douglas was established in 1862 and wasn't
de-activated until 1991. Stone buildings, dating to the 1870s,
still can be viewed and the fort's cemetery is the final resting
place of German, Italian and Japanese prisoners of war who died
here during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The museum retells the history of the fort, as well as the
military history of Utah. It is open Tuesday through Saturday, and
admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   All of the other venues are within a 60-minute drive of the
Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   West Valley City
</P>
<P>
   The new E Center in West Valley City will host the men's ice
hockey tournament. The 10,000-seat facility is home to the Utah
Grizzlies of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies, whose claim to fame is being the least penalized
team in the IHL for the past two seasons, began their season
earlier this month. The regular season continues through April.
Tickets start at $8.
</P>
<P>
   West Valley City is about 10 miles west of Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kearns &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; An outdoor oval track has been completed at this town, which
will host the long-track speed skating events. Plans call for
construction of a cover over the 400-meter track, which for the
Games will be known as the Oquirrh Park Oval. Work is to begin in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Located about 25 minutes west of Salt Lake, this fast-growing
city got its start in the 1940s as a military base. There's not
much here for tourists right now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Provo
</P>
<P>
   The 8,000-seat Ice Sheet at Provo, which along with the E Center
will host Olympic hockey games, is under construction. Part of the
facility, however, will open for recreational skating in November.
</P>
<P>
   Home to Brigham Young University, Provo offers a few attractions
of interest to tourists. Most notable is Timpanogos Cave National
Monument. This is actually three connected limestone caves. Tours
of the caves are offered mid-May to mid-September, which means
winter visitors are out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heber City &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Soldier Hollow will be the site of the Olympic Biathlon and
cross-country events. Eighteen medals, 16 days of competition and
11 different race formats and configurations are involved. Work on
the venue is to begin in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can try one of the more unusual experiences that
the Heber Valley has to offer. The lovely Homestead Resort, located
in Midway, offers winter packages that combine swimming, snorkeling
and scuba diving with traditional winter activities such as skiing
and snowmobiling.
</P>
<P>
   The water sports will be in the Homestead's Crater, a 65-foot
deep hot spring where the water is a soothing 96 degrees
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Stay for a night to have a swim and massage. Better yet, stay
for several days and explore some of the area's 100 miles of
groomed snowmobile trails. The resort also has a 12 kilometer
cross-country ski course and the hotel's formal restaurant is
famous locally for its Chateaubriand dinners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Park City
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the Wasatch Mountains, the picture-perfect ski
town of Park City is the site of three major Olympic venues and
one-third of the medal events. Its appeal to the winter visitor is
its location just 36 miles from the Salt Lake City airport and its
average snowfall of more than 350 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Park City Mountain Resort will host the men's and women's giant
slalom alpine skiing events as well as all Olympic snowboarding
events. Deer Valley gets the slalom, alpine skiing and freestyle
competitions. The Utah Winter Sports Park, home of the luge and
bobsled competitions, was constructed in 1993 just to impress the
Olympic selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you want to just get a glimpse of the future or test
your sport mettle, the Utah Winter Sports Park is the place to
start your visit. Two of the park's ski jumps and the luge/bobsled
course are open to the adventurous public.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an intermediate-level skier, you can try the ski
jumps. Lessons cost $30 ($20 for youths) and include a two-hour
ski-jumping session. Most skiers can master the 18-meter jump after
their first lesson. With some practice, you can graduate to the
38-meter jump.
</P>
<P>
   You can use Alpine skis and boots for jumping, but you will need
a helmet that covers your ears. A rental helmet is included in the
cost of the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   If you like speed, consider testing the park's bobsled course,
where the Olympic athletes will be moving at about 80 miles per
hour down the 1,335-meter track. Your ride may reach speeds of up
to 75 miles per hour. This less-than-a-minute thrill will cost you
a $125 per person. Two can ride in the four-person bobsled, which
will come with a professional brakeman and driver. You also must be
at least 16 years old to try the bobsled.
</P>
<P>
   A less costly experience is the Ice Rocket ride. The Ice Rocket
is a one-person sled that is self-steering and self-braking. Speeds
reach up to 45 mph. The fee is a more reasonable $27 and includes
the use of a helmet. You must be at least 50 inches tall to ride
this rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not interested in donning skies or being a human
bullet, the Utah Winter Sports Park is fascinating. Tours are
offered several times each week. Call for practice dates and times
so that you can see young Olympic-wannabes hone their jumping
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the summer, freestyle jumpers are training here, using a
unique 750,000-gallon pool with an air bubble system that softens
the jumper's landing.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be constructed here are the 90-meter and 120-meter
jumps, which also have stadium seating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its all rustic elegance and fine service at Deer Valley Resort,
where Olympic medals will be awarded in slalom, freestyle and
alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
   You can try your hand at Olympic-style skiing on the resort's
Know You Don't trail. The black-diamond run will be the site of the
men's and women's slalom races. The combined slalom events will be
on an Intermediate slope known as Big Stick.
</P>
<P>
   When you are through testing yourself on these runs, have a go
at the other 80 runs on Deer Valley's four peaks: Empire Summit,
Flagstaff Mountain, Bald Mountain and Bald Eagle Mountain. Expert
skiers can investigate the resort's six bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are out of luck at Deer Valley as snowboarding is banned
here.
</P>
<P>
   A full-day lift ticket at Deer Valley is $57. And save some cash
for food. Deer Valley dining is superb. Try the seafood buffet at
Snow Park Lodge or go gourmet at The Mariposa at Silver Lake Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Host of the flashy snowboarding events, as well as the men's and
women's giant slalom, Park City Mountain Resort is basking in its
Olympic role.
</P>
<P>
   This mountain resort is closely linked to the town that shares
its name.
</P>
<P>
   Park City boasts a rich history, and has grown from a mining
town populated with self-made millionaires into a hip playground.
Its historic district with more than 300 centuries-old structures
imbues Park City with a small-town flavor. Inside those buildings
are the restaurants, shops and galleries that satisfy the most
sophisticated tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating its 35th birthday this year, Park City Mountain
Resort offers snowboarders and skiers 97 trails and 650 acres of
open bowls to explore.
</P>
<P>
   A one-day lift ticket is $53.
</P>
<P>
   For an Olympic experience, try CB's trail, which will be the one
used for the giant slalom competitions in 2002.

<P>
   Ogden
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest city in Utah also is the site of the Ice
Sheet at Ogden, venue of the Olympic curling competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Sheet is open most days for public skating. The fee is
$3.25 ($2.75 for children), and skate rentals are available.
Curling clinics for the public are held 11 a.m.-3 p.m. each
Thursday. The cost is $2, and you only need sneakers to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Home to Weber State University, Ogden is a charming town with
enough attractions and activities to keep a visitor busy for days.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss Antelope Island, which at 26,000 acres is Utah's
largest state park. One of several islands in the Great Salt Lake,
it is connected to the mainland by a seven-mile causeway. While
hundreds of species of birds have been spotted in the park and
wildlife such as pronghorn antelope, badgers and bobcats are found
here, the park's main attraction is its bison. The beasts were
installed here in 1863 and a herd of 13 has grown to 600 strong.
</P>
<P>
   Also make time for two of the area's more unusual attractions:
Holy Trinity Abbey, where the monks sell homemade bread, honey and
peanut butter; and the Shooting Star Saloon, which opened in 1879
and now serves terrific burgers under the watchful eye of Buck, a
St. Bernard whose mounted head hangs on a saloon wall.
</P>
<P>
   At nearby Snowbasin Ski Area, the runs have already been cut for
the Olympic Alpine ski events, including men's and women's downhill
and combined downhill.
</P>
<P>
   If you ski, you can re-create these premiere events via the Gold
Run, which is the men's downhill course, and the Silver Run, where
the women will be competing.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbasin has long been a favorite with the locals, who
appreciate its powder bowls and laid-back atmosphere. Extensive
renovations are in the works, including four new lifts for this
season. But you can still beat the crowds if you go before 2002. &QL;

``Wit'' in Connecticut last November and the production of ``Wit''
that reopened here this month, Kathleen Chalfant says, her
performance got better. She explains that it is because her older
brother _ a mentor and close friend _ died of cancer. In ``Wit,''
Ms. Chalfant, 53, plays a woman who herself is dying of ovarian
cancer. And after living through the death of her brother, Alan
Palmer, on Good Friday, she said, she approached the play with a
new level of empathy and insight. By Robin Pogrebin.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ARCTIC-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Having endured arctic storms,
dangerous fissures in the ice pack, polar bear intrusions and a
year of crushing pressure while frozen into a drifting floe, the
Canadian icebreaker Des Groseilliers reached Prudhoe Bay, Alaska,
this weekend. Aboard it was a rich cargo of data expected to reveal
subtle mechanisms that drive changes in the world's climate. By
Malcolm Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EARLY-GALAXIES (Undated) _ In the beginning, there was
light, the bursting dawn of cosmic creation, but as the fireball of
the Big Bang expanded and cooled, the light faded away, marking
what astronomers characterize as the dark age of the universe. When
light returned to the firmament with the emergence of the first
stars and then vast communities of stars, the dark age ended. What
happened and how the light came on again is an enduring and
frustrating mystery _ but now astronomers are optimistic about
finding answers. Better telescopes finally are allowing them to
catch sight of some of the earlier, if not necessarily the first,
galaxies. And, each observation seems to put their formation back
earlier in time. By John Noble Wilford. (2200 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-SOCIAL-ANXIETY (Undated) _ Social phobia or social anxiety
disorder _ a severe condition that keeps people from participating
in basic human interactions _ is attracting increased attention
from mental health experts, in part because of the availability of
new drug treatments and novel brain-imaging technologies that are
yielding clues to the disorder's underlying biology. By Erica
Goode. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHIMPS-HUMANS (Undated) _ Biologists have always asked how
humans differ from other animals. A proposal that is now gathering
considerable support promises to provide an answer of possibly
disconcerting precision. The idea is to identify the genes that are
unique to humans by sequencing the genome, or full DNA, of the
chimpanzee and comparing it with the human genome. By Nicholas
Wade. (1500 words)

   SCI-SHUTTLE-OBSERVATORY (Washington) _ In spite of past
problems, NASA engineers say they are optimistic about plans to
have two satellites make joint observations of the sun during the
next space shuttle mission. Engineers working to reactivate a
troubled solar observatory say the craft likely will be ready for
mutual studies of the sun with a satellite carried aloft by the
shuttle Discovery, scheduled to take off with a crew of seven on
Oct. 29. By Warren E. Leary. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SEXY-PROPORTIONS (Undated) _ Good news from England:
Statistical criteria may make it easier for a man with stunted
perceptual ability to decide whether a woman is sexually
attractive, unattractive or just so-so. This breakthrough in
sexiness assessment was reported in a renowned British journal, The
Lancet. The gist of the two reports was that sexual attractiveness
in women was a function of body weight compared with height. By
Malcolm Browne. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BEETLE-CORN (Urbana, Ill.) _ A dramatic change in the
behavior of the western corn rootworm beetle is threatening one of
the great success stories in American agriculture, the use of crop
rotation instead of pesticides on millions of acres of Midwestern
corn. This change in behavior, which first appeared in east central
Illinois, is spreading north and east as the affected insects are
blown by the prevailing winds. It now affects more than 10 counties
in Illinois, the northern half of Indiana, some counties in western
Ohio and lower Michigan and is expected to reach southern Wisconsin
in five years. By Jo Thomas. (1600 words)

<P>
   SCI-SHUTTLE-MUSGRAVE (Undated) _ Conversation with F. Story
Musgrave, the astronaut who quit after flying six shuttle missions
when NASA told he would never fly again. Some say he would be
perfect for the aging experiments that John Glenn is flying. By

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: As new evidence
points to the ever-widening role of calcium in preventing disease,
milk consumption is continuing its steep decline, especially among
young people. Some experts predict an epidemic of osteoporosis
because today's children and teenagers guzzle sodas and juice
drinks instead of milk. By Jane E. Brody. (1340 words)

   SCI-HEALTH-THEPILL (Undated) _ The birth control pill is pushing
40, and like many a child of the '60s, it never looked so good. It
is the VW Bug of drugs _ a sleekly remodeled version of the 1960
prototype, housed in a box full of old associations, but completely

</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-OLD-MUSCLES (Undated) _ The aging population is
becoming far more physically active than it once was, encouraged by
a number of recent studies showing that nutrition and aerobic
exercise no longer seem enough by themselves to protect the aging
body. Research has made clear that working to restore strength in
the form of rebuilt muscle mass and bone density is not only
possible but is also crucial for people to maximize their potential
for a healthy old age. By Holcomb B. Noble. (1600 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on medicine and health:
</P>
<P>
   _In recent years, several studies have pointed to the health
benefits of green tea. Regular drinkers have less lung, stomach and
esophageal cancer as well as lower rates of cardiovascular disease
and fewer strokes. But for many, the pungent drink is, at best, an
acquired taste. So green tea pills have begun to appear on the
market. (470 words)
</P>
<P>
   _The mystery of medicinal power of cranberry juice may have been
solved. Amy B. Howell and a team at Rutgers University have
conducted experiments they believed may have established how
cranberries help prevent painful urinary infections. These include
cistitis in women and urinary infections in men, ailments that in
total account for some seven million doctor visits annually. (200

<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-SAVINGS-TIME (Undated) _ When most Americans go off
daylight savings time at 2 A.M. Oct. 25, they will have to set
their clocks back one hour and start getting up and going to bed an
hour later _ on body time, that is _ than they have been accustomed
to since April. Many people say it takes days to get back in sync.
(200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SURROGATE-MOTHERS (Undated) _ More than 10 years after
giving birth, women who acted as surrogate mothers for infertile
couples say they do not regret the role they played. But some feel
sadness and disappointment over the loss of contact with the
children they bore, who were biologically their own. And many
imagine that one day their children will find them, even though in
some cases the children have no idea that they came into the world
in any other than the usual way. Those findings emerged from a
study by Dr. Nancy Reame of 10 surrogate mothers who gave birth 11
to 15 years ago. By Denise Grady. (700 words)

NEED INSURANCE? NO ODD REQUEST WILL BE REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling due to garble)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you are worried about insurance covering
eccentric needs, relax. The burgeoning insurance industry has a
plethora of paranormal policies.
</P>
<P>
   You can insure your hair (supermodels do it), your legs (Mary
Hart did it), your vocal cords (Bruce Springsteen did it), even
your private parts (John Wayne Bobbitt can only wish).
</P>
<P>
   One London-based company alone has sold policies against alien
abduction or impregnation, werewolf metamorphosis and even
immaculate conception, which its owner drolly insists is ``popular
with girls named Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   California insurance companies specialize in policies to cover
bar mitzvah fiascoes, pet cancer and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   And an Internet company offers insurance against life's greatest
unpredictability. If you've purchased applicable coverage from
Worldwide Weather at www.weatherins.com, and your tropical vacation
is ruined by the wrath of a hurricane or the drizzle of persistent
rain, you'll be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call them bizarre, the exotic _ however you want to
characterize the policies. Some people need insurance that's every
bit as unique as they are,'' said Ted Pierce, executive director of
the San Francisco-based Surplus Line Association of California, a
trade group and quasi-regulator for brokers of unusual ``surplus''
insurance not available through insurance companies licensed in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The association has cleared a policy for someone breeding birds
for ostrich jerky, a policy insuring that a man's frozen fertility
remains safe in the custody of a sperm bank, and a policy for
people who fear E. coli bacteria or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   Californians have insured their collections of snuff boxes,
carousel horses and taxidermy. Pop icon Michael Jackson even
insured his private zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can imagine it and it's worth something,'' Pierce said,
``somebody out there has insurance on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of earthlings have purchased insurance against
extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   The first firm to boldly go where no insurer had gone before,
the Florida-based UFO Abduction Insurance Co. began offering alien
abduction insurance a decade ago. It costs $19.95 for a $10 million
policy that provides psychiatric care and sarcasm protection, plus
a double indemnity clause ``if your alien hosts regard you as a
food source.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy's slogan: ``Beam me up _ I'm covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers reincarnation insurance, noting, ``While
it's still true you can't take it with you, now you can leave it
here and come back and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million payout doubles ``if you return as a lower life
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants are rejected if they answer yes to the questions ``Do
you take this seriously?'' and ``Were your parents related before
they married?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mike St. Lawrence, president of the company, ``We're as
serious as we can be without serving jail time.''
</P>
<P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Not so a London-based insurance broker that began collecting
serious premiums for coverage against aliens. The company is
Goodfellow, Rebecca, Ingrams and Pearson Ltd. (acronym GRIP).
Managing partner Simon Burgess is a tongue-in-cheek Briton who
blithely admits he would not buy such policies, but added, ``I've
never been afraid of parsing the feeble-minded from their cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heaven's Gate cult reportedly paid $1,000 for a policy to
cover its members, at $1 million per person, for abduction,
impregnation or death by aliens. When 30 cult members committed
suicide on the outskirts of San Diego, hoping to be transported to
a UFO trailing the Hale-Bopp comet, Burgess suspended sales out of
fear that fickle Yankee juries might require GRIP to pay. But
eventually, Burgess explained, ``Greed got the better of us and we
resumed them.''
</P>
<P>
   GRIP now offers insurance against virgin birth, ghosts,
transformation into a werewolf, and coverage for unfaithful
husbands who fear ``Bobbitting.''
</P>
<P>
   GRIP recently began offering ``erectional protection''
insurance, and Burgess said he's issued one in Bill Clinton's name,
purchased by a Republican who will ``remain unnamed.'' Such GRIP
policies promise $1.5 million in coverage for an annual premium of
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, not one claim has ever been paid. Said Burgess:
``We're not in the business of paying claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The more populist policies are for special events.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people last year insured their nuptials through
R.V. Nuccio and Associates Insurance Brokers in Fawnskin, a small
town in Southern California. A $600 premium will reimburse up to
$20,000 in lost expenses, plus provide liability insurance in case
a guest trips and sues.
</P>
<P>
   The policy paid off for the bride whose little brother decided
at the last minute to make her plain white gown prettier by
finger-painting it. And for the bride whose cat used her dress to
deliver a litter of kittens. And when one bride's mother, despising
the groom, exacted revenge by scraping every wedding guest's car
with a can opener.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance also paid $25,000 to fly a party back to the wedding
site in Hawaii, recreate the flowers and food, and reshoot the
ceremony after the original negatives were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay out on six or seven of those a week _ I'm telling you,
in many cases the bride would rather have the wedding photos than
the groom,'' Nuccio said.
</P>
<P>
   But brides or grooms who wish to buy insurance against cold feet
are out of luck. ``That would too easily set us up for fraud and
collusion,'' Nuccio said. ``If you're asking the question, don't
get married.''

ALLOCATION OF LIMITED WATER RESOURCES KEY TO MIDEAST PEACE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The waters that course through the limestone
aquifers and river basins beneath the West Bank form a powerful
undercurrent that shapes the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement that may be reached this week in the United States
would finally break a 19-month deadlock. An accord is expected to
call for Israeli troops to withdraw from an additional 13 percent
of the disputed West Bank and, in return, for Palestinian
guarantees to step up its fight against terrorist strikes against
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But while these troop withdrawals and other looming issues such
as Palestinian statehood, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of
Jewish settlements have been endlessly debated, the question of
water rights has remained largely hidden beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington has ignored the issue of water at the peril of the
peace process,'' said Joyce Starr, a specialist on water in the
Mideast and a former White House adviser on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Starr added that US peace envoy Dennis Ross and his staff ``have
simply chosen to forget about the most important issue to the
future of all the people, Israeli and Palestinian. Without
attention, the deterioration of the water supply will make it
impossible to achieve lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington may have ignored the issue, but the opposing sides
have not. Like the forces that control its flow below the biblical
land of the West Bank, water has been a central issue in the
creation of the diplomatic contours and the geographical surveys
that both sides use in the ongoing struggle over land.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
conservative government have mapped out the West Bank land they
would be willing to cede to Palestinians based not only on
militarily defined ``security zones,'' but also on hydrological
charts. The idea is to give Palestinians only high, rocky land that
is an average of 1,200 feet above sea level along the Western
aquifer, the largest in the West Bank. At these levels, tapping
water resources requires deep and costly drilling, making
Palestinian wells virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the point at which it is not economically feasible to
drill wells,'' explained Israel's water commissioner, Meir
Ben-Meir, about the 1,200-foot mark. ``This way we know we are
protecting our water supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Water has been at the heart of Israel's industrial development
as well as its transformation of the Negev Desert into fertile
irrigated farmland. But Israeli references to ``our water''
infuriate Palestinians. They frequently cite the 1995 ``interim
agreement'' signed by Netanyahu's more liberal predecessor, Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres, which ``recognizes Palestinian water
rights in the West Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of the Palestinian Water Authority, Fadle
Kawash, accused Netanyahu's government of violating both the spirit
and letter of the agreement. Palestinians argue that the land on
which they hope to establish an independent state must include
rights to the water beneath it. From the Palestinian perspective,
the Israelis have consumed far more than their share, up to five
times as much of the scarce water for far too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not able to guarantee our water rights, we cannot
plan long-term for our own development, our own security, and our
own industrial health, tourism and agriculture,'' Kawash said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians consume about 13 gallons of water a day per capita,
compared with the 65 to 75 gallons consumed by Israelis, according
to the US Agency for International Development. In the West Bank,
the disparity is even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Israel obtains roughly 30 percent of its water for its
population of 6 million from the West Bank. It collects another 20
percent from its coastal plains, which rely heavily on rain from
the West Bank that runs west to form natural springs along the
plains. Slightly under 50 percent come from the Sea of Galilee,
which is fed by the Jordan River. A few percent come from several
pioneering desalination projects along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this heavy reliance on the West Bank, the Netanyahu
government has vowed that water is critical to its national
security and that it will not alter its demand to control the
allocation of water there. Israeli officials fear that if the
drilling of wells were left to the Palestinian Authority, chaos
would ensue, resulting in a dangerous depletion and contamination
of reserves.
</P>
<P>
   This process is already evident in Palestinian-controlled Gaza,
where unchecked drilling of some 2,000 wells, Israeli officials
claim, has exposed the water table to sea water, making it
increasingly nonpotable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument is not political. It is professional hydrology,''
said Ben-Meir. ``If we get into a race for drilling, it will be the
death of the entire water supply.''
</P>
<P>
   The most strident of Netanyahu's water warriors is Ariel Sharon,
the hawkish former general recently named foreign minister. In his
previous job as infrastructure minister, he was known to carry a
frayed topographical map of the West Bank. He would unroll it for
American congressional delegations, reporters, and diplomats to
illustrate why the West Bank aquifers must be protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view of Judea and Samaria is very well known,'' said
Sharon, using the biblical names for the land of the West Bank.
``The absolute necessity of protecting our water in this region is
central to our security. It is a non-negotiable item.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Allan, a University of London professor and a specialist on
the global politics of water, said Sharon's increasing role in
linking water rights to the peace talks could spell disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Water, Allan explained, is an emotional issue for Israel because
it is tied to the national ethos of ``making the desert bloom.''
But Israel has been shifting its economic focus from agriculture to
the high tech. As a result, a Palestinian labor force is growing
within its agricultural base.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sharon and Ben-Meir know that water as an issue
resonates in the minds of Israelis and the American government.
``The link between territory and water is a significant development
in the peace talks,'' Allan said. ``The truth is the two sides
could work out a solution on water. But this is a classic example
of water being used when it needs to be used for conflict. It will
slow down, perhaps even derail the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The current talks in Washington center around a 13 percent
further redeployment of Israeli troops from the West Bank. Already,
the Israelis have ceded 27 percent of the West Bank to joint
Israeli-Palestinian control, and 3 percent to full control of the
Palestinian Authority. This 3 percent consists of densely populated
areas of Gaza, Ramallah, Jericho, and Nablus where nearly 90
percent of the Palestinian population live.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Gaza, the land is roughly 3,000 feet above
sea level, specialists say, far too high for Palestinians to tap
wells. But they added that there is land now under shared control
below the 1,200-foot mark, and as the switch to full Palestinian
control looms in the near future it will cause increasing tensions
as the Netanyahu government resists exposing aquifers to
Palestinian drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Israel captured the rocky hills of the West Bank from Jordan in
the 1967 Six Day War. Many historians agreed that the war was
ignited indirectly by an attempt by Syria to divert Israeli water
supplies in the Golan Heights, now occupied by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The water under that area is a central reason why Israel has
held on to most of the Golan and the West Bank since then, and why
conservatives in Netanyahu's coalition refuse to cede more land
under the current peace agreement. Since 1967, Israel has used its
military to control the three aquifers that lie beneath the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   As diplomats struggle to keep the peace process alive, the
resolution of water rights takes them through a thicket of historic
treaties, international law and worldwide covenants regarding water
usage.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians argue that the water flowing through the West Bank
is ``Palestinian water'' and that they should have control of it as
its own valuable resource under ``fair usage'' requirements of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   But Israelis counter that under international covenants on
``prior usage,'' they have the legal right to continue to use the
water since they had been using 90 percent of it since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Water is among several key issues, according to the design of
the Oslo accords, that were to be postponed until ``final status''
talks, which are supposed to be completed by May of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The other looming questions include Palestinian statehood, the
status of Palestinian refugees and the future of Jerusalem. Israel,
which annexed East Jerusalem after the Six Day War, considers it to
be part of its indivisible capital. Palestinians see it as the
capital of their future state. With the two sides struggling to
fulfill the interim parts of the agreement, analysts fear that the
entire peace process could explode over the larger and more complex
``final status'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   As emotionally charged as the other issues are, only water
presents a health crisis for both sides if the process drags on
without agreement on how best to both share and conserve its
limited supply.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials point out that they have devoted immense
resources to develop advanced water conservation techniques such as
drip irrigation and recycled water. Palestinians, they argue, waste
large amounts of water through crude irrigation and leaking pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ideological from both sides agree that existing
water reserves are fully tapped and that other supplies will have
to be developed to serve both populations.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have tried to ease the water problem. At a cost of
$265 million, the United States has sought to help Palestinians
develop new supplies and better systems for delivery of water to
homes. But more water will be needed, perhaps through desalination
plants or imports. Either option would be costly.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis maintain that the Palestinians, with the help of
Western donors, will have to share in those costs. The Palestinians
ask, in turn, why they should have to pay for water that exists in
sufficient amounts for their population under the land on which
they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tremendous lack of trust on both sides,'' said
Gershon Baskin, a water specialist at the independent,
Bethlehem-based Israel-Palestine Center for Research and
Information.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sharon more involved in the talks, water is likely to
become a very big issue. He will try to convince the Americans it
can't be resolved,'' added Baskin. ``But the truth is if there is
good will it can be resolved. The point is to get moving on
starting with desalination projects and ways to bring in new
sources of water. They have to stop arguing about water rights, and
take care of future water needs.''

PALESTINIANS TREK FROM WELL; ISRAELIS TURN ON FAUCET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EIN ARIK, West Bank _ In the first light of morning, the women
of this Palestinian village descend stone steps worn smooth over
the ages down terraced hillsides to an ancient spring.
</P>
<P>
   They bend to fill their buckets and then, balancing them on
their heads, make the long climb back up to clusters of
lichen-covered stone homes. Many will make this trip seven times a
day.
</P>
<P>
   For these women, the heady days of the historic 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord brought a simple promise: the end
to these relentless trips to the well. They were told that their
homes would have running water for the first time. They dreamed
that the aches and pains from carrying the heavy buckets would heal
along with the hatred between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, this town still gets its water the
old-fashioned way, and residents blame the Israelis and the
Palestinian Authority for failing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we need water, we come,'' said Alia Kasem, 30, her
hands calloused from hoisting 5-gallon jugs. ``If we want to cook,
we come. If we want to wash the children's clothes, we come.''
</P>
<P>
   Up from the gorge where the spring water surfaces, above the
chalky limestone olive groves of the West Bank, Jewish settlements
of symmetrical stucco houses and red tile roofs ring the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there they have all the water they want,'' Kasem continues.
``We break our backs. They turn on a faucet. This is fair?''
</P>
<P>
   The settlements, heavily subsidized by the Israeli government,
have water towers with pumping stations fortified with barbed wire
and soldiers. The 160,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank use
roughly six times per capita more water than do the 1.6 million
Palestinians who live there.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby settlement of Dolev on a recent hot afternoon, there
were ticking sprinklers on patches of green grass and men washing
their cars. Some settlements have swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Chaim Gvirtzman, a settler from Dolev who is also a Hebrew
University hydrological specialist, drives past this spring every
day.
</P>
<P>
   As he pointed out, a plan to connect the homes to water supplies
was approved two years ago by a joint Palestinian-Israeli water
commission established within the peace process. But the
Palestinian Authority has not acted on it because of insufficient
funds. Israeli officials feel they should not have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a poor community. I hope they will have a higher
quality of life, but that is not Israel's problem,'' said
Gvirtzman. ``They see us as their enemy, so why should we pay for
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information said
that about 40 percent of West Bank Palestinian villages have no
running water. Like Ein Arik, they draw from wells and springs that
often run dry. Palestinians contend that the root cause is the
unfair water policy of the Israeli government. But in practical
terms they also blame their own Palestinian leaders for failing to
build water and sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians often turn to a growing black market in water.
Tractors towing water tanks arrive at wells and fill their tanks.
If Israelis monitor the well, the Palestinian entrepreneurs pay
five shekels (about $1.25) per cubic meter. Then they sell it to
Palestinian homes at a 700 percent markup. Often they simply take
the water from unmonitored wells, or worse, contaminated ones.
</P>
<P>
   This unregulated tapping is draining the aquifers, officials on
both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   This does not deter Fahmi Malasa, who admits he was illegally
filling his tank and planning to sell it. ``The Jews say the water
is theirs, but it is ours. If they want to try to stop me, they
can.''

   SCI-ARCTIC-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Having endured arctic storms,
dangerous fissures in the ice pack, polar bear intrusions and a
year of crushing pressure while frozen into a drifting floe, the
Canadian icebreaker Des Groseilliers reached Prudhoe Bay, Alaska,
this weekend. Aboard it was a rich cargo of data expected to reveal
subtle mechanisms that drive changes in the world's climate. By
Malcolm Browne.

   SCI-EARLY-GALAXIES (Undated) _ In the beginning, there was
light, the bursting dawn of cosmic creation, but as the fireball of
the Big Bang expanded and cooled, the light faded away, marking
what astronomers characterize as the dark age of the universe. When
light returned to the firmament with the emergence of the first
stars and then vast communities of stars, the dark age ended. What
happened and how the light came on again is an enduring and
frustrating mystery _ but now astronomers are optimistic about
finding answers. Better telescopes finally are allowing them to
catch sight of some of the earlier, if not necessarily the first,
galaxies. And, each observation seems to put their formation back
earlier in time. By John Noble Wilford. (2200 words)

   SCI-SOCIAL-ANXIETY (Undated) _ Social phobia or social anxiety
disorder _ a severe condition that keeps people from participating

   SCI-SEXY-PROPORTIONS (Undated) _ Good news from England:
Statistical criteria may make it easier for a man with stunted
perceptual ability to decide whether a woman is sexually
attractive, unattractive or just so-so. This breakthrough in

the great success stories in American agriculture, the use of crop
rotation instead of pesticides on millions of acres of Midwestern
corn. This change in behavior, which first appeared in east central
Illinois, is spreading north and east as the affected insects are
blown by the prevailing winds. It now affects more than 10 counties

   SCI-SURROGATE-MOTHERS (Undated) _ More than 10 years after
giving birth, women who acted as surrogate mothers for infertile
couples say they do not regret the role they played. But some feel
sadness and disappointment over the loss of contact with the
children they bore, who were biologically their own. And many
imagine that one day their children will find them, even though in
some cases the children have no idea that they came into the world
in any other than the usual way. Those findings emerged from a

GUINNESS SIGN IN SARAJEVO SIGNALS EFFORTS TOWARD NORMALITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ This is a city of new roofs and
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo suffered more during the Bosnian war than any other
place, and the new roofs are part of an effort to lure back some of
the 150,000 people who fled the city, nearly one-third of the
pre-war population.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian groups, meanwhile, have built playgrounds, trying
to restore to children some semblance of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling sign that Sarajevo is in a transitionary,
post-war phase is the Guinness sign that hangs outside The Harp,
the first Irish pub to open here.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be the Irish exported their people. Now they export
pubs. In the past decade, Irish entrepreneurs have opened pubs in
unlikely places, such as Moscow, Beijing, and various African
backwaters, but no place more unlikely than here.
</P>
<P>
   The Harp is the brainchild of David Alford, who came here four
years ago as a peacekeeper with the Irish army. When Alford left
the army last year after 24 years as a soldier, he knew what he
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I was here, I couldn't find a good beer,'' he
explained, exhaling smoke. ``And I knew if I couldn't find a good
beer, no one could.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford's solution was simple. Open his own place. But he has had
to endure the cultural differences that make ordering a keg of
Guinness maddening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sutra mentality here,' he said, using the
Bosnian-Croat word for tomorrow. ``I call the distributor, he says,
`Sutra, sutra.' The real problem is that my distributor is really
an engineer. He doesn't know the first thing about the beer
business. But you find that a lot of people are working in jobs
they aren't trained for, and can't get the jobs they are trained
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford sees his pub as an extension of the work he performed as
a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a peacekeeper,'' he says, draining a pint. ``Now
I'm providing humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, Alford is a businessman with a social conscience,
according to an off-duty US Marine who was drinking at the bar.
Like Irish pub owners in Boston and elsewhere who use their bars to
raise money for charity, Alford is a sucker for a Bosnian sob
story, of which there is no shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Alford overheard the Marine praising him and feigned anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your problem,'' Alford told him, ``is that you're part of a
sissy army.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine rolled his eyes and walked away, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the up-market, prefabricated pubs that have sprung up in
Russia and Asia, The Harp is funky and unpretentious. It occupies
the site of a former restaurant, and the only thing that gives it
away as an Irish pub outside is the Guinness sign.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is a road sign that says Dublin is 5 miles away.
Actually, it's 1,300. Besides Guinness stout, there's Harp lager
and Kilkenny ale on tap. There are patches from various
peacekeeping groups on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The music selection makes it seem as if you're sitting in a
quiet country pub in County Clare, or in Dublin's hip Temple Bar.
On the stereo system, Shane McGeown rasps plaintively, ``I gave my
heart to you, my love, you gave my heart to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Alford, candidly assessing the situation here
in a Dublin accent that betrays he grew up in the Liberties, the
rough and tumble neighborhood that gave us Brendan Behan, a writer
only slightly less cynical than Alford.
</P>
<P>
   As perhaps a measure of Sarajevo slowly getting its feet back
under it, The Harp is now the oldest but not the only Irish pub in
the city. Another one just opened. Alford calls the proprietor an
``ex-friend,'' suggesting the ex-friend took some trade secrets
with him.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything Irish, it was only a matter of time before
there was a split. And as with everything in Sarajevo, even the pub
business has been Balkanized.

   LOS ANGELES -- You get more than a cup of coffee at Jeff Hughes'
cafe in Santa Monica. You also get a lawyer. Or, if you want, a
lawyer and a notary. Or even, a lawyer, a notary and a bagel.
</P>
<P>
   For what Jeff Hughes offers at The Legal Grind, his cozy
establishment near the ocean, is an incongruous mixture of caffeine
relief and legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than risking a hefty bill just to crack open a
conventional attorney's office door, you can seek professional
advice at the cafe at the very modest rate of $20 a pop and enjoy a
cappuccino at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Legal Grind covers it all: child support, personal injury,
landlord/tenant disputes, unfair dismissal counsellors and of
course - this being Los Angeles - contracts and copyright in the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Every day there is a different roster of lawyers; you can
procure the services of a notary, plot your day in court or else
just enjoy the coffee and fresh munchies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conferring with an attorney over good coffee and pastries will
make people realize that lawyers are people too,'' Hughes says.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes you realize just how far the American coffee
revolution has come. By now it is scarcely enough for
establishments to offer the full rundown of lattes, mochas,
cappuccino and the rest. They have all become standard fare,
whether you are in a trendy student haunt in San Francisco or a
moldy old diner in the middle of the Nevada desert.
</P>
<P>
   The days when American coffee was so transparently tasteless
that it had to be poured into thick china mugs just to maintain an
illusion of brownness are a fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   By now, just coffee -- even Pacific Northwest coffee with
chasers and skimmed milk options and pretty domed plastic cups with
a straw -- is not enough. No, to be at the cutting edge these days
requires a gimmick, that little bit extra to keep a cafe fresh and
different.
</P>
<P>
   Within easy driving distance of The Legal Grind is Wednesday's,
where coffee lubricates the wheels of commerce in the second-hand
clothing business. On the border between Santa Monica and Venice is
Color Me Mine, where you are invited to paint ceramic bowls and
plates as you sip your special roast espresso (for licensing
reasons the coffee is made at the next shop, but there is an
interconnecting door).
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Novel Cafe, a second-hand book store with
venerably aged shelves and leather-bound volumes, all for sale
alongside the blueberry muffins and decafs. Or, a few miles to the
north, Anastasia's Asylum, a late-night coffee bar that is a minor
wonder of late 20th century Western civilization: an alcohol-free,
sugar-free, fat-free, smoke-free, vegetarian jazz club.
</P>
<P>
   All these are not to mention the more established forms of
``fusion'' coffee shops, as one might call them: the cafes that
have become almost obligatory inside big book shops, enabling
shoppers to browse and sip at the same time, the Internet cafes,
with their brown-stained computer keyboards, or the coffee bars
attached to launderettes, well-known in college towns across
America as the best unofficial pick-up joints going.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that Americans, or at least southern Californians,
feel they can't just have their coffee and drink it? Part of the
reason, perhaps, is insecurity. After all, fads come and go and
coffee has been kicking around long enough to need an extra jolt.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps -- and this observation comes from someone spoilt on the
high standards of Italian bar culture for the past four years --
the coffee is not ultimately that great. With some notable
exceptions it still tends to be too weak, and the over-homogenized,
over-skimmed milk lends itself poorly to frothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is the fear of the monster chains.
America's coffee culture has been virtually hijacked by Starbucks,
the voraciously ambitious Seattle company that is, seemingly,
setting up on every other street corner at the expense of
independent cafe owners. If you don't want to be bought out or
pushed out, installing a lawyer or two is an ingenious way of
maintaining your consumer profile.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it might be a mistake to see the phenomenon as being
strictly about coffee. Maybe the gimmicks do not serve to promote
the coffee so much as the coffee promotes the gimmicks. After all,
the legal services, ceramics classes or whatever can seem dry or
unremarkable on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck in a cup of the trendy drink of the moment and even paying
taxes or going to the dentist becomes more palatable. An Internal
Revenue Service Cafe? A Parking Fine Cafe? It can be only a matter
of time.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Justice system's flaws are ingrained and obvious
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amnesty International's recent rip on the U.S. criminal justice
system has put American backs up. Don't we provide legal counsel,
civil liberties, open trials, appeals? Wouldn't the world's
criminal-justice average jump way up if no nation did worse at it
than we do?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. But ...
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Amnesty has caught our not inconsiderable
shortfalls and lapses. Many are now built into what passes for the
system, secured there by a crude politics that, claiming to protect
us from crime, in fact wastes money on practices that in their
injustice and inhumanity actually produce more crime _ at the
willful neglect of policies that would be less pricey and more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what is amiss in the U.S. system came together in the
execution in Virginia last week of Dwayne Allen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   First, we executed. No other industrialized nation still does
that. The death penalty deters no crime, is hugely expensive and
sets a state-sanctioned example that killing is an OK way to solve
problems. It is borne in gross disproportion by the poor,
compounding class angers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Wright was black, and the residue of racial prejudice
that fouls every level of the criminal justice system piles up on
our death rows in a final grotesque racial disparity and rankling
social irritant.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Wright committed the murder for which he was killed at
17. Few other nations permit executions for juvenile crime _ at
last count, only Yemen, Saudi Arabia, lran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Wright was borderline retarded and was diagnosed at 13
with severe mental illness and brain damage. He never received the
treatment doctors recommended for him in juvenile facilities. (As
governor, Bill Clinton permitted the execution of a man so
profoundly retarded he wanted to save his last-meal dessert for
later.)
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Wright's trial attorney, in a performance common to
indigent cases, failed to mention those mitigations at the
sentencing hearing, leading two jurors to swear later they would
have voted for life imprisonment if they had known.
</P>
<P>
   We are building ever more prisons to house mainly nonviolent
offenders, most sentenced for drug crimes. Alternative sentencing
is both cheaper and less likely to create repeat offenders. And
those who must be incarcerated are now largely denied the jailhouse
education programs that also cut recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   We emphasize imprisonment and cruelty _ and cruelty it is: We
leave all other prisoners pretty much at the mercy of any prison's
worst _ and disdain crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
   We stint on drug treatment. We fail to provide most new, poor
mothers the home visits by parenting counselors that pay off in far
lower eventual crime. We fund few after-school programs _ when most
juvenile crime occurs, not at night as curfews assume. We wink at
police and prison excesses and abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Once the enlightened standard, our justice system now puts us in
the world's backwater with some very sorry company. We'll stay
stuck there until we stop punishing thoughtful counsel and
rewarding, in the name of some ever meaner ``toughness,'' the
political bidding war for more of what we know doesn't work.

BRITISH SYSTEM INSPIRES CALIFORNIA EDUCATION OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Conversations California Gov. Pete Wilson had
last year over cocktails with former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher triggered what could be a dramatic change in the
way California runs its public schools.
</P>
<P>
   From that visit to Britain last October, Wilson drew two central
and often criticized components of his Nov. 3 education ballot
measure _ giving parents control of their local school budgets and
curriculum, and creating a chief inspector to grade every public
school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Those parts of Proposition 8, the Republican governor's ballot
measure, are modeled on the 1988 education overhaul instituted by
Thatcher and her Conservative Party government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her reforms have been enthusiastically embraced and
endorsed,'' Wilson said of Thatcher's program. ``I am not ashamed
to take the best ideas of others and put them to work for
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, particularly the teachers unions and the state Parent
Teacher Association, say those ideas could mean a different lesson
plan being taught in each of the state's 8,000 schools. They argue
the measure would create another education bureaucrat, making it
even harder to know who sets policy and holds schools accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested so much in getting high standards in place, and
now we turn around and say we're going to have these councils and
they will control curriculum?'' said Mary Bergan, head of the
45,000-member California Federation of Teachers. ``What about the
expectation that every school will be pretty much teaching the same
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   The other provisions of Proposition 8 give voters a chance to
approve many of the changes Wilson has talked about or implemented:
money for small classes of 20 students per teacher; competency
testing for teachers; and policies to expel students caught with
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Thatcherite plan co-opted by Wilson, however, that
would substantially change California's schools. A powerful central
education official working out of Sacramento would be created while
local school superintendents and principals would lose power to
parents and teachers running the school ``site councils.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson visited Thatcher, talked with members of the
Economist magazine's editorial board and ``took the opportunity to
ask a lot of questions about education reform,'' he was stunned by
the similarities on the path to change in the United Kingdom and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Wilson in recent years has pushed for a statewide exam
to be taken by all students, Thatcher mandated a national exam for
pupils. Just as Wilson has backed the establishment of new
statewide curriculum standards in English, science, history and
math, Thatcher created national subject-by-subject curriculum
standards.
</P>
<P>
   If Proposition 8 passes, changes in the system of public
education in California would mirror those in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson sees the role of chief inspector as someone who performs
``quality control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.K., the inspector's `report card' produced the
predictable effect of parents, finding their child's school far
down on the list, became very grumpy and voiced dissatisfaction. It
stimulated energetic efforts to improve the quality of education,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's office of chief inspector has done a massive job in
compiling data, according to Geoff Whitty, Sally Power and David
Halpin in the 1998 book ``Devolution &AMP; Choice in Education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By any standard, (the) program of inspections is awesome,''
they wrote, saying every school was reviewed by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is doubtful if any more ambitious program of
school-by-school evaluation ... has ever been mounted anywhere in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Atkin, a Stanford University education professor, said the
British office of chief inspector _ which predates Thatcher by more
than a century _ was sharply redefined by her 1988 education
overhaul. It went from serving as an education adviser to one
focusing on inspections and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say the chief inspector has brought more
standardization, in that schools are doing more things the same,''
Atkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I don't know of any evidence that student achievement is
up as a result of the chief inspector or the other reforms.
Unfortunately, British children do just as poorly as our children
do on international comparisons,'' said Atkin, who recently
completed a 13-country study of school innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Under Proposition 8, the next governor would appoint a chief
inspector to a 10-year term with a budget of $15 million to $20
million. The money would come from the state Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Sen. Dede Alpert called the chief inspector
post ``a really dumb idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One problem we now have with education in California is we
have an elected superintendent, an appointed Board of Education and
a secretary of child development. It's hard to know who's in
charge. To wind up with a fourth person seems like a waste of money
and a poor policy direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson dismisses charges of creating more bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an absurd contention,'' he said. ``If a manufacturing
company hires someone to be at the end of the line to do a quality
check, is that another layer of bureaucracy?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's idea of school site councils appeals to Wilson
because the councils give parents ``primary responsibility for all
that occurs in that school.'' And, he said, it would ``make each
school in California a charter school.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, who would be elected by other parents, would make up
two-thirds of the councils. Teachers, elected by their peers, would
make up one-third. Each school would receive about $1,000 to train
the site council members, Wilson added.
</P>
<P>
   While teachers unions, the League of Women Voters and the state
PTA oppose the initiative _ the ``Permanent Class-Size Reduction
and Educational Opportunities Act'' _ their harshest words are
reserved for the Thatcher-inspired program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major objection to Proposition 8 is directed at the office
of chief inspector and school site councils,'' said Ann Desmond,
director of legislation for the 1.2 million-member state PTA.
``While we obviously support parent involvement, we are concerned
about parents being asked to make decisions about curriculum and
budget when they haven't been trained.''

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD -- The World Health Organization may soon begin a study
into the effects on Iraqi civilians of depleted uranium shells in
the 1991 Gulf War -- and enrage the western nations that used them
during and after the liberation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Widely blamed for a frightening increase in cancer -- especially
among Iraqi children -- the shells may have contaminated large
areas of southern Iraq, and the government in Baghdad believes that
a WHO report would finally confirm their suspicions that the Allies
saturated the land and its cities with radiation.
</P>
<P>
   A three-man WHO team, including French and German scientists,
has already visited Iraq's Hospital for Nuclear Medicine in Baghdad
to inspect its records of cancer increases since the war, and they
are due to report in the next few weeks on how an investigation can
be conducted into the use of the Allied ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   If the Iraqi Ministry of Health approves, WHO personnel would
spend two years taking evidence on the use of the shells and the
effect on the health of millions of Iraqis whose families lived
near the battles and bombardments of the January-February war of
1991.
</P>
<P>
   For Saddam Hussein, of course, this would provide further
propaganda in his campaign to lift the punitive UN sanctions
against Iraq -- always supposing sanctions are still in place in
two years' time -- and to accuse the Americans and British of ``war
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, it is Saddam himself who has been accused of crimes
against humanity. Nevertheless, if a WHO team concludes that the
shells and missiles which use armor-piercing depleted uranium
penetrators -- and cause radioactive and chemically toxic dust to
be scattered around the target -- are to blame for the Iraqi cancer
explosion, there will be substantial pressure on the Gulf War
victors to pay compensation to Iraq and to ban future use of the
controversial weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the two-story Iraqi Hospital for Nuclear Medicine
stands next door to the Baghdad WHO headquarters whose director,
Dr. Habib Rejab, has confirmed to the Independent that WHO
representatives have made their first prelimary study of Iraqi
cancer data.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the hospital's senior medical staff also allowed me to
inspect their thousands of statistics on post-war cancer cases --
figures that suggest a correlation between Iraqi leukemia increases
and the war.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the very name of Saddam Hussein tends to contaminate
Iraqi-compiled government statistics as surely as the Allied armies
may have contaminated the land of Iraq in 1991. But the hospital's
graphs appear to be accurate -- they start long before the 1991 war
and, in some cases, clearly show a fall in cancer when one might
have expected an increase. If propaganda experts have been at work,
they did a poor job.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mona el-Hassan has been drawing up cancer statistics in Iraq
since 1976 and her files are both professional and convincing.
``There has been a changing pattern of cancers since the war,
including a double incidence of cancer of the intestinal tract,''
she says. ``There has been an increase in the incidence of breast
cancer among young females. Nowehere else in the world has there
been a high incidence below the age of 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest statistics -- still to be published -- show a
startling increase in leukemias in Iraq's southern provinces, the
area most affected by the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas, like Wasit, show an actual decrease -- from 226
cases in 1989 to 203 in 1994 and then 224 in 1996 -- but other
figures bear out doctors' suspicions. The childhood cancer
registry, for example, shows a respective increase in male children
with lymphatic leukemia aged up to 4 and between 5 and 9, from 68
and 94 in the 1989-1991 period to 86 and 98 between 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During the same periods, Myeloid leukemia has increased from two
cases to 12 (in the 0 to 4 age group) and from five to 18 in the 5
to 9 group. The total Myeloid leukemia figures for children up to
15 goes from 26 in the earlier table to 61 in the most recent.
</P>
<P>
   In similar age patterns, the increase in lymphatic leukemia
among female children is equally disturbing: a total of only 118 in
the 1989-91 period compared to 174 between 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics show an overall increase among both male and
female children during the same periods for cancer of the eye,
thyroid and Hodgkin's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly -- and perhaps another reason to trust them -- the
statistics show a decrease in female child bone cancer and cancer
of the kidney. Iraqi propagandists would not have made the mistake
of leaving those figures intact.
</P>
<P>
   Annual figures for overall cancer patients give a clear idea of
the increases. In 1990, 7,058 new cancer cases were registered in
Iraq. By 1992, the figure has soared to 8,526. The comparable
breakdown figure for males is 3,913 in 1990 and 4,735 in 1992, for
females 3,145 in 1990 and 3,791 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The total of new cancer figures for 1996, still unpublished,
shows an increase of well over a thousand since 1990 -- from 7,058
to 8,360 -- although a slight fall on the comparable figure for
1992. Iraqi officials acknowledge that 1991 figures -- which show
an unbelievable decrease -- are of little use because they did not
include cancer cases from the Kurdish Mosul province of northern
Iraq, which was then in a state of insurrection against the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi doctors say there are many cancer cases that are never
reported to the government. ``In a small village, they will say a
child is 'sick' and they will think it has some passing illness and
then it dies and is buried and we never hear about it,'' one doctor
told me. ``And other families believe it wrong to admit they have
cancer cases -- in case it affects the marriage prospects of their
other children. So we may have far more cases than we realize.''

COURT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR CONFRONTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comedian Bill Maher is host of a late-night TV show called
``Politically Incorrect'' on which celebrities from assorted fields
of endeavor get together and argue about the issues of the day. The
lead-off issue Thursday night was the previous day's sentencing
hearing for child-killer Jeremy Strohmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Maher got things going by voicing outrage that the parents of
7-year-old murder victim Sherrice Iverson were allowed to get up in
court and verbally unload on the man who sexually assaulted and
murdered their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Maher, an American courtroom ought to be a place
where justice is dispensed in a dispassionate way _ not a forum for
loved ones of murder victims to vent their spleen.
</P>
<P>
   Maher said the scene reminded him of Jerry Springer's TV show,
which features scorned lovers, betrayed spouses and embittered
humans of every description screaming at one another and sometimes
engaging in fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't catch the Las Vegas hearing on television,
here's a recap. Sherrice Iverson's parents, Yolanda Manuel and
Leroy Iverson, were permitted to address the man who had pleaded
guilty to killing Sherrice and was about to be sentenced to life in
prison without parole. Both parents told Strohmeyer, 20, exactly
what they thought of him.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel called Strohmeyer a devil, among other things, and said,
``I hate to look at your evil face.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson was even rougher, expressing his disappointment that a
plea bargain had spared Strohmeyer the death penalty. Iverson also
expressed his fervent hope that Strohmeyer would suffer the worst
sort of sexual and social indignities in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In making his point, Iverson used some language and imagery that
was politically incorrect, to say the least. Watching an excerpt of
the confrontation on Court TV, I was half-expecting Strohmeyer's
attorney, Leslie Abramson, to jump up and beseech the judge to
order Iverson to tone down his tirade. She didn't _ not during the
part of the hearing that I saw, anyway _ and she shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   Victim impact statements are a relatively new innovation in
American jurisprudence, and Maher was right on the money in one
respect: They can get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   But I disagree with the idea that it is somehow demeaning to the
justice system for courts to permit a murder victim's family to
confront the perpetrator. Why shouldn't a grieving parent, spouse,
child or sibling be allowed to look a loved one's killer in the eye
and tell him in no uncertain terms what they think of him? Why
shouldn't a murder victim's survivors be allowed to tell the
murderer _ and the world _ exactly how his heinous act has
devastated their family and disrupted their lives?
</P>
<P>
   What standing does a coldblooded killer such as Jeremy
Strohmeyer have in society that would merit sparing him the
humiliation of being upbraided in public by people whose hopes and
dreams he destroyed in a moment of violent self-indulgence?
</P>
<P>
   Maher was offended by the spectacle of Sherrice's killer being
berated by her parents _ especially the father, who left his
daughter and her older brother in a casino arcade while he went off
to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   It is valid to note that Leroy Iverson's negligence placed
Sherrice in jeopardy. But Iverson could not have imagined the
horrifying fate that awaited his daughter _ and society should not
require that a murder victim's father forgo his grief and anger
because he was guilty of a terrible mistake in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's poor parenting did not diminish Strohmeyer's guilt.
Iverson had no less right than any father to confront his
daughter's killer in the legally sanctioned setting of the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   It can be unnerving to watch individuals who are driven by
unbearable grief and anger reveal their deepest feelings in the
otherwise sober atmosphere of a courtroom. But we need to be
unnerved by horrendous acts of violence and their aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   And we need to let the victims of such acts inflict some measure
of personal justice on the perpetrators.

COURT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR CONFRONTATION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Comedian Bill Maher is host of a late-night TV show called
``Politically Incorrect'' on which celebrities from assorted fields
of endeavor get together and argue about the issues of the day. The
lead-off issue Thursday night was the previous day's sentencing
hearing for child-killer Jeremy Strohmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Maher got things going by voicing outrage that the parents of
7-year-old murder victim Sherrice Iverson were allowed to get up in
court and verbally unload on the man who sexually assaulted and
murdered their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Maher, an American courtroom ought to be a place
where justice is dispensed in a dispassionate way _ not a forum for
loved ones of murder victims to vent their spleen.
</P>
<P>
   Maher said the scene reminded him of Jerry Springer's TV show,
which features scorned lovers, betrayed spouses and embittered
humans of every description screaming at one another and sometimes
engaging in fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't catch the Las Vegas hearing on television,

 &HT;    PEACE TALKS, ISRAEL SHAKEN, DOZENS HURT IN THIRD TERROR ATTACK
IN TWO WEEKS
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-TALKS-1020.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEERSHEBA, Israel _ Six thousand miles away from peace talks in
the tranquil Maryland woods, the mercurial dangers of the Middle
East landed at young Shali Ben Tal's feet Monday in the form of a
live hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
   The doe-eyed 19-year-old woman, hospitalized with shrapnel
wounds, was one of dozens of young Israeli soldiers waiting for
morning buses at an outdoor bus station when two grenades were
thrown into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed in the 8 a.m. (Israel time) attack. More than
60 were injured, including three seriously. Most suffered minor
injuries. A group of witnesses pursued the attacker, beat him and
turned him over to police. He was reportedly a 29-year-old
Palestinian from a town about 20 minutes away in the West Bank,
land occupied by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that, while no group has claimed
responsibility for the attack, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, leader of the
Palestinian extremist group Hamas, called it ``resistance'' against
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The attack sent a shiver through the country as it was focused
on the high-level peace negotiations hosted by President Bill
Clinton at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   With tears in her eyes and in a room crowded with her daughter
and five other injured soldiers, Shali's mother, Shosh Ben Tal
could not come up with an answer for what should happen at the
ongoing peace talks in the United States -- which were in their
fifth day Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we want to make peace with (the Palestinians), but it
seems that they do not want peace with us,'' she said. ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, near the site of the bombing and among Israel's right wing
political ranks, called for an end to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The attack appeared to endanger the talks as they headed into
what could be their last, and most critical day. Israeli officials
insisted that they would for now focus on security, and only
discuss the steps that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is willing
to take to stop terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   They shelved discussion of the opening of a Palestinian airport
and the possibility of another Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank -- a step toward restarting the faltering Oslo peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat reportedly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu after receiving word of the morning attack. Arafat said
he regretted the incident and ordered an inquiry, according to a
statement by Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton deplored the attack, saying it complicated
already troubled talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has
been tough. But the parties must consider the consequences of
failure'' as well as the benefits of progress, Clinton said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi said the negotiating
move was an Israeli attempt to ``derail the whole process,'' and
noted that there have been recent Israeli attacks on Palestinians
-- two have been shot to death in rock throwing incidents in the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the violence hit a southern Israeli farming and
industrial center of about 150,000 in the heart of the Negev Desert
-- 50 miles south of Jerusalem. People here could not remember the
last time they had seen terrorism. Many said they would not forget
Monday's image of blood being washed from sidewalks with firehoses.
</P>
<P>
   Shali Ben Tal said she saw the attacker approach and throw the
grenade, which Israelis call ``reemone'' the Hebrew word for
pomegranate. She was hit in the back with shrapnel while fleeing
with a group of soldiers who were tripping over each other in
panic.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has been a year since Israel faced its last horrific
suicide bombing, this was the fourth small-arms attack in about
three weeks. Two have died.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks fit two patterns: Smaller attacks requiring less
planning, making them harder to stop than large bombings; and an
escalation when peace talks are nearing -- apparently from
Palestinians who oppose any settlement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of right-wing Israeli protesters gathered near
Monday's site, calling for an end to the peace talks. But, some of
Monday's victims said the talks should continue.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kessler, a 26-year-old army reservist, responded to calls
of ``Get that Arab, he's the one,'' and pursued the attacker until
the second grenade sent shrapnel flying into his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I am injured, it doesn't make me more pessimistic about
the peace talks,'' he said. ``It's good they have peace talks.''

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ Capitalism is a simple, fair economic system: It
rewards good companies and crushes bad ones. But freewheeling
capitalism also can be brutal. Good people who work hard, make
excellent products and sell them at fair prices can get pulverized
in the unforgiving marketplace. Ask any American steelworker. Today
they are being threatened by vicious competition from foreign steel
makers. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of steelworkers in the South
could get laid off next year; in the states surrounding the Great
Lakes, the toll could be much worse. (Geewax, Atlanta

 &HT;    It's a snap to convert figures on Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Wide Web has made the world smaller and friendlier.
And, nowadays, it is certainly easier to chat with friends from
Brazil in the morning and acquaintances from Australia at night.
But all this worldwide chat and e-mail has also added some
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when your friend in Sao Paulo tells you it is a
lovely day with temperatures hovering around 30 degrees, you may
feel a little shivery here in the land where the Fahrenheit
standard for expressing temperatures reigns. But in Brazil (as they
do in Europe), temperatures are most commonly expressed on the
Celsius scale. So, if you can remember the formula and have a
calculator, you'll know that it was a lovely 86 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, just one example of the conversions that are
necessary to keep in tune with people from around the world. You
can buy reference books, or even computer programs, that will help
you perform the calculations. But since you have access to the Web,
you don't need them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with temperatures. You'll find a page at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .valdosta.peachnet.edu/vsu
</P>
<P>
   /dept/aux/animation/degree.html that will do all the math for
you. Just enter the temperature in either F. or C. and click on the
page. In fractions of a second, you'll have the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful conversion page is called Measurement Units
Translation at http://www.ur.ru/(tilde)sg/transl/. Lets say you
want to convert 1,000 square yards into acres. Just fill in the
blank and click. Before long you'll know, perhaps with a degree of
accuracy that surpasses your needs, that figures out to be
0.20657991628077077 of an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A matter of time
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about time. Suppose you have been working at a
project for three weeks and you'd like to express this fact to your
boss in more graphic and impressive terms. Just mosey on over to a
page called Measurements Units _ Time at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .text-trieve.com/products/
</P>
<P>
   references/timeconv.htm. Then type the numeral ``3'' into the
correct box and click. Now you can brag that you've been working
for 30,390 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the cars measure speed in kilometers an hour, instead
of miles an hour. So you may want to bookmark the conversion page
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .text-trieve.com/products/
</P>
<P>
   references/speedconv.htm. That way, when a friend explains they
drove to grandmother's house at an average speed of 120, you'll
know that they were traveling at 74.5643262 miles an hour. Still
pretty fast but a lot safer than 120 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The next conversion table has nothing at all to do with foreign
relations. It's more domestic. Now that interest rates are lower
than they've been in years, you may be thinking of buying a house,
or financing some other big purchase. But you'll want to know what
the mortgage payments will be.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of resources for this on the Web, but one good
one is the Mortgage Calculator at http://www.by-owner-ol.com/
</P>
<P>
   mortgage.html. Let's say you are borrowing $100,000 at 6.5
percent interest for a term of 30 years. Just fill in the blanks,
and soon you'll know that your payments (for the loan amount, not
including insurance and taxes that probably will be added in) will
be $632.07.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I cannot find a single site on the Web that will
transfer the money you need for a down payment at the click of a
mouse.

 &HT;    Let your Mac do the Windows
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtual PC is one of the most amazing pieces of software I've
ever seen. Apple Computer should include it on every G3 model it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   Why the enthusiasm? Because Virtual PC delivers as advertised.
It seamlessly simulates a Windows computer on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though this hasn't been tried before. Insignia
Solutions still sells its Windows emulator called SoftWindows. But
SoftWindows is a clunker compared with Virtual PC.
</P>
<P>
   With Virtual PC, you can run anything from Microsoft Office to
the latest multimedia game on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Virtual PC will run PC games. I tested it with a
very demanding one called ``Sid Meier's Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, a real-time simulation of the famous Civil War battle,
ran fine. There was a slight loss of speed, and the video and sound
were jumpy at times. But I played the game on a G3 PowerBook for
hours without a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual PC is easy to install and use. Switching back and forth
between operating systems is a breeze. Just click on the desktop,
and you jump back to the Apple Computer's operating system. You
click inside the Virtual PC window to go back to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, running Windows 95 and Apple Computer's operating
system side by side really showcases the Mac. Windows 95 seemed
awkward and unintuitive compared to the Mac operating system. But
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   What's amazing about Virtual PC is it's all software. In effect,
Virtual PC is tricking the Mac into believing it's a PC. Virtual PC
emulates not only Windows 95 but Windows 3.1 and DOS. You can also
buy a version that handles Windows 98, Microsoft's latest operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   While Virtual PC emulates any PC operating system, it won't work
on just any Mac. You need one with a powerful microprocessor.
Developer Connectix, for example, recommends Apple Computer's new
G3 models.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but Virtual PC will not work on Macs with chips
pre-dating the PowerPC microprocessor. Its performance is sluggish
on early models of the PowerPC.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual PC is a storage and memory hog. You need at least 32
megabytes of RAM and 150 megabytes of storage to run Windows 95.
Despite its requirements, Virtual PC is worth the money. It retails
for $149.

 &HT;    Itty-bitty video great for enclosing in e-mail
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A company called AVerMedia has given me a new way to bedevil my
friends. Now I can send them little movies of my dog, my guinea
pigs, my wife or myself (I may be mean but I'm not a sadist).
</P>
<P>
   The AVerMedia InterCam kit consists of a peripheral card, a
microphone and stand, and a little camera the size and shape of a
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up this little video system is about as easy as it can
get. The card requires a PCI slot. If you have a Pentium computer
of fairly recent vintage, it will have plenty of available PCI
slots unless you have been buying some very sophisticated stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Once the card is installed, all that remains is to plug the
camera into it and the microphone. If you want talkies, plug into
the mike input on your sound card, and install the software, which
is automatic.
</P>
<P>
   One does not expect much from a video camera the size of a
baseball that comes in a $120 package. The key to enjoying InterCam
is having fun.
</P>
<P>
   The InterCam camera has two controls: an on-off switch and a
focusing ring that surrounds the lens. When you call up the
InterCam program, it presents you with a video box about 2 inches
wide and an inch and a half high. You can enlarge this all the way
to full screen, but you don't want to. It becomes extremely fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the camera is its shape. It sits in a
depression in a soft plastic support, and the cable tying it to the
capture card is annoyingly stiff, fighting you every time you
adjust the camera's position.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn the camera on, it gives you a view of what it
sees, but it doesn't begin recording until you click the record
button in the software. When you turn off recording, you can view
the video you just recorded. Once you save it to disk, however, you
can no longer view it through the AVerMedia software.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The video is saved as an AVI file, and you can
view it just fine through the Video for Windows or the Active Movie
feature found in Media Device in the Accessories group of Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no experience with digital video, you need to know
that these files can be huge. They have to be compressed, and the
software allows a selection from among a number of video
compression formats. I chose the Microsoft decompressor, on the
theory that everybody to whom I would send a video would have it,
and set the quality to 75 percent. Choosing 100 percent quality
greatly increases file size.
</P>
<P>
   I also selected 50 frames per minute in the software, rather
than the default 20, which tends to be rather jerky.
</P>
<P>
   A video 10 or 15 seconds long is going to be about 10 megabytes
in size. You won't make any friends sending 10-megabyte e-mails.
But trying to make two- to three-second videos is extremely
difficult in some cases, such as making videos of my piggies. I put
the camera down in their enclosure and waited for them to come
around.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to handle this, since the AVerMedia software has no
editing features, is to keep your videos to a reasonable length _
15 seconds or so _ save them to disk, and then call them up in the
Video for Windows feature mentioned above. Using this, you can make
a selection of a few seconds from anywhere in the video and copy it
into a file.
</P>
<P>
   This way you can get a file down into the 200K range, attach it
to an e-mail message and send it out without becoming Attila the
Geek.
</P>
<P>
   As these things go, $120 is pretty cheap, and AVerMedia's
InterCam is the best cheap thrill I've had in a long time.

 By RUPERT CORNWELL  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK -- For a few panicky hours early last May, it seemed
the long-prophesied day of nuclear judgement had arrived on the
Kola Peninsula in Russia's far northern reaches.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors swept Severomorsk, base of the Russian Northern Fleet,
that a Delta-class submarine, carrying a dozen or more ballistic
missiles, had suffered a major accident in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The story soon reached Murmansk, 15 miles to the south, where
policemen were told to take iodine tablets and some schools were
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Calm was only restored after the regional governor and senior
naval officers held a press conference to ensure that no one was in
danger, and that what had happened was a scheduled exercise testing
reaction to a nuclear incident aboard a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   But was it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident there was an explosion or some other incident
in one of the submarine's rocket shafts,'' insists Thomas Nilsen, a
researcher for Bellona, the Norwegian environmental pressure group
which monitors nuclear goings-on in the area. ``The `exercise' was
a cover-up for the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he argues, such exercises are flagged well in
advance, precisely to avoid such rumors. Of this one however, there
had not been a word.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the Norwegan military two days later did confirm
that a Russian submarine had indeed surfaced hurriedly on May 5,
before heading to a nearby base. Furthermore, not a single
submarine of the Northern Fleet went out on patrol for three months
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for suspicion is the most obvious of all.
The Kola Peninsula, wedged astride the Arctic Circle between the
Barents Sea and the White Sea in the far Russian northwest, is a
nuclear accident waiting to happen; in environmental terms,
probably, the most dangerous place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the Northern Fleet, the nuclear cargo vessels and
icebreakers based at Murmansk, and the Kola nuclear station account
for 18 per cent of all the nuclear reactors on earth, and a fair
proportion of their spent fuel -- most of it kept in appalling
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Murmansk itself, close to the heart of a city of 500,000
people, lies the innocuous-looking but infamous Lepse cargo boat,
carrying hundreds of damaged nuclear fuel elements -- on which
after years of negotiation, Norway France and the European Union
are due to start a joint clean-up operation with the Russians.
Meanwhile, a Hotel Class submarine is moored 300 meters from a
block of apartments and known to contain dangerous nuclear
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing comes close to Andreyeva Bay, in a fjord less than
30 miles from the border with Norway. There, in a nuclear junkyard
unparalleled on the planet, some 21,000 spent fuel rods --
equivalent to 90 reactor cores -- and 13,000 cubic meters of solid
and liquid radioactive waste are housed in ancient concrete tanks
and rusting containers open to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   They lie a stone's throw from the water's edge, and like little
Chernobyls in slow motion, their contents are starting to leak into
the river and sea. Each container holds the same amount of
radioactivity as released by the last French nuclear test at
Mururoa -- except that was 500 meters underground.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the detritus is relatively new, but some is over 30
years old. Between them, the Soviet Union and Russia built 250
nuclear submarines of which, as recently as 1989, 196 were
operational. Now, as a result of arms control agreements, the end
of the Cold War and Russia's economic collapse, perhaps only 70 or
80 are in any kind of service. Some of the others have been fully
destroyed, their missile sections removed, their reactors
disassembled and their fuel reprocessed.
</P>
<P>
   More, however, are just rotting, at Andreyeva Bay and other
sites around the Kola peninsula. And, secretive as ever, the
Russians don't want anyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), along with French and Norwegian
companies have signed a preliminary agreement on a clean-up plan at
Andreyeva Bay, involving the use of robots and the construction of
new storage facilities. But all requests for on-site inspections
have been turned down: the most the Russians will offer is a video.
</P>
<P>
   No Westerner has ever been allowed to Andreyeva Bay.
Unfortunately for the environmental movement, a mile away across
the fjord lies Nerpichya, base for six 30,000-ton Typhoon-class
submarines, pride of the Northern Fleet and the largest and most
destructive underwater vessels ever built, each carying 200
strategic nuclear warheads -- and emphatically not for foreign eyes
to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence is is why Russia probably won't accept an
invitiation from NATO to join a `Partnership for Peace' exercise in
the Barents Sea next summer -- and why nothing looks like happening
very quickly at Andreyeva Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Norway has freed $40 million to tackle a pollution problem that
scares it stiff, but ``obviously the less we get a chance to have a
look for ourselves, the less money will be spent,'' says Ommund
Heggheim, State Secretary at the Defense Ministry in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Russia's stance is likely to harden, now that
Yevgeny Primakov, a foreign-policy hawk from Soviet times and
instinctively sympathetic to the military, is prime minister in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But a more immediate pointer will come Tuesday (October 20),
when Aleksandr Nikitin, a former Soviet submarine
captain-turned-sleuth for Bellona, goes on trial for espionage and
treason in St. Petersburg. Nikitin was co-author of Bellona's 1996
study of the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   If Nikitin is harshly sentenced, then Russia's and the world's
environmentalists should fear the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowing everything, however, is the crisis of money and
morale gripping the armed services. The Defense Ministry has more
pressing matters on its mind than decaying nuclear facilities.
Wages are hopelessly in arrears. The conscript who ran amok on an
(unarmed) submarine at Murmansk in September, killing eight
colleagues, was merely proof of how deprivation and brutality breed
only despair.
</P>
<P>
   As Nilsen puts it, ``If you're a naval officer in charge of the
safety of your ship, and you haven't been paid for five months and
your children are sitting at home half-starving, you're not going
to care very much.''

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ Capitalism is a simple, fair economic system: It
rewards good companies and crushes bad ones. But freewheeling
capitalism also can be brutal. Good people who work hard, make
excellent products and sell them at fair prices can get pulverized
in the unforgiving marketplace. Ask any American steelworker. Today
they are being threatened by vicious competition from foreign steel
makers. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of steelworkers in the South
could get laid off next year; in the states surrounding the Great
Lakes, the toll could be much worse. (Geewax, Atlanta

 &HT;    Commentary: Don't restrict imports to protect steelworkers
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capitalism is a simple, fair economic system: It rewards good
companies and crushes bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   But freewheeling capitalism also can be brutal. Good people who
work hard, make excellent products and sell them at fair prices can
get pulverized in the unforgiving marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any American steelworker. Today they are being threatened by
vicious competition from foreign steel makers. Hundreds, maybe
thousands, of steelworkers in the South could get laid off next
year; in the states surrounding the Great Lakes, the toll could be
much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Because these workers are so sympathetic, the temptation will be
great to try to protect them by restricting imports. Steel makers
already have filed trade complaints against competitors from
Russia, Japan and Brazil, and now are seeking legislation to stop
foreigners from continuing to ship record amounts of steel to the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and Congress must not give in to the urge
to cut off imports. As cruel as that might seem to steelworkers,
lawmakers have to consider the good of all U.S. workers and
consumers. If we try to curb global trade now, we could get snared
in a depression as severe as the one that crippled the world in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Resisting the desire to meddle in the marketplace will be tough,
because U.S. steel makers are in real trouble. For example,
Birmingham Steel Corp. earned only $1.02 million in the most recent
quarter, compared with $7.25 million in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Profits are plunging for U.S. steel makers because their
competitors in depressed countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and
Latin America are slashing prices to stay alive. At the same time,
currency values in those countries are falling. Bottom line:
Foreign steel is really cheap for us to buy.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad for U.S. steel makers but good for the other U.S.
companies that need cheap steel to make cars, appliances, pipes and
other products to be sold in the global marketplace. If Ford, for
example, has to pay more for protected American steel, it won't be
able to match the prices on Japanese cars.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, low-priced foreign steel could end up hurting people
who want to work at Birmingham Steel's new rolling mill in
Cartersville. But workers who make the Taurus in Ford's Hapeville
plant need low prices for materials so they can compete with the
Camry. Do those autoworkers deserve to have their jobs threatened
to protect steel jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission finds that for every
dollar some employees gain from protection legislation, other U.S.
workers and consumers lose $3. If Congress and Clinton give in to
the demands of all companies that want protection from competition,
foreigners will retaliate by closing their markets to U.S.
manufacturers. If that happened, millions of American jobs could be
lost and consumers would start paying much higher prices for cars,
refrigerators and other goods. Would it be fair to people on fixed
incomes to stir up inflation again?
</P>
<P>
   It would be heartbreaking to see this country's highly
productive steelworkers lose their jobs because of currency
fluctuations and overcapacity in foreign countries. But even more
misery would result if we try to stop the free market from
functioning. Steel-consuming companies must be free to seek out the
best prices for materials, and consumers must be free to shop for
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than turn to protectionist legislation, Congress ought to
help steelworkers by making sure they can get decent health care,
tuition credits and job-placement help if they do lose their mill
jobs in the continuing global turmoil.

 &HT;    Hip sites add to luster of top television shows
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think merely watching hip TV shows makes you hip, think
again. These days, even the most minor of shows has its own Web
site complete with episode summaries, chat rooms, games and enough
trivia about your favorite characters and the actors who play them
to stump even the most devoted fan.
</P>
<P>
   NBC built the outstanding site for ``Homicide: Life on the
Street,'' which originally set the standard for TV Web sites. Be
sure to check out ``Second Shift,'' an online-only component to the
show, where users can play detective and solve crimes.
``Homicide's'' Web site takes the show's premise to a new level and
illustrates ways TV and the Web can create complimentary
entertainment experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek,'' the hit teen melodrama, has more than 60
sites devoted to the show, but Columbia Tri-Star, the production
company, offers ``Dawson's desktop'' on its Web site
(http://www.dawsonscreek.com). At first glance, this inside peek
into the world of lead character Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek)
sounds pretty cool. The site promises a peek at notes from Dawson's
journal, screenplay excerpts, e-mail messages and even a peek into
his wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   But all this nifty information doesn't come easily. In order to
see everything, users must readjust the color resolution on their
monitors, download a variety of plug-ins and then wait, wait and
wait some more for the desktop to set up. And while you're waiting,
you have to look at a full-screen advertisement for Dep hair care
products. Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   But if you stick it out and wait for the desktop to load, you'll
find a clever site that looks as if it might really be Dawson's
computer desktop. The site changes daily, and on a recent visit
there was a ``chat'' in progress debating the merits of ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' directed by Dawson's hero, Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get to read the script for the budding filmmaker's
opus ``Sea Creature.'' If you've been keeping up with the show,
you'll love reading girlfriend Joey's (Katie Holmes) diary online
for yourself. It's fun, but be warned, it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's medical drama ``ER'' has 53 sites lovingly built by
devoted fans, which is a good thing since there's no official site.
Die-hard fans will want to check out the Alt.TV.ER
(http://www.digiserve
</P>
<P>
   .com/er/erdex.html) page. The site includes one of the most
astonishingly complete lists of frequently asked questions ever
assembled. All of your questions _ from what happened last week (or
last year) to the show's medical accuracy to why Carter (Noah Wyle)
decided to sport a beard this season _ are answered.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``The Practice'' won an Emmy for Best Drama this year, and
the Web site for the show is equally imaginative (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .thepractice.com). You can take Bobby's (Dylan McDermott)
``nickel tour'' of the show's Boston law firm. Fans can look
through the firm's files, which look like real law office schedules
and files. It's fun, easy to navigate and well-written _ three
things any good Web site should be.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Avoiding terminal problems with your PC not hard
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are at least 12 ways to kill your computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of PCs, I spent a lot of time urging people to
be experimental and reassuring them that nothing they could do to
their PC _ short of giving it the 10-foot drop test _ could wreck
it. Reassurances like that were needed because, in those days,
operating a PC was something akin to being the first on your block
to have an automobile back in the days of the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Now that computers are so much a part of the family, we may have
gotten too comfortable with them. While PCs are fairly sturdy
beasts these days _ certainly more so than they were five or six
years ago _ there is a limit to the abuse a PC can take. So today
we'll look at some of the fairly common mistakes that can destroy
your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most common way to ruin a computer is through
voltage surges. If you don't have a good voltage surge protector,
get one. And if you do have one, please don't rely on it during an
electrical storm. Unplug your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Heat can also kill a computer. And there are several simple
precautions that you can take to avoid overcooking your machine.
For one, make sure the covering for the exhaust fan is not clogged
with dirt and dust. It is fairly easy to remove the cover and
gently vacuum the dust away (I avoid using compressed air to blow
it away since you're likely to blow all the dirt onto the
motherboard, where it can do even more damage). Also check to make
sure there is at least four inches of clearance on all sides of
your machine, especially at the rear, where the exhaust fan is
located.
</P>
<P>
   While we're talking about heat, let's cover one of your most
expensive computer accessories, the monitor. Not too long ago I was
sitting in the newsroom, typing happily away when I smelled smoke.
I looked down the row of desks and saw a monitor smoking like a
cowboy with a hand-rolled cigarette. The reporter at that desk had
used the top of the monitor as a shelf _ loaded it down with old
newspapers and magazines. That blocked the air circulation from the
vent holes at the top and, over time, generated enough heat to
actually start a fire. If you want a fire, rub two sticks together.
Monitors make expensive kindling. Obviously the same rule applies
to your computer itself: Don't use it as a place to pile stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The next mistake won't immediately wreck your computer. Instead
think of the harm it does as similar to what smoking cigarettes
does to humans. It slowly destroys.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about turning your computer on and off many times a
day. Each time you do that, the components inside the computer get
a little jolt of electricity. I couldn't get technical about this
if I tried, but several bad things can happen to the components _
including your processor chip _ as they receive this jolt.
Eventually you can destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take this advice to mean you should never turn your
computer off. Instead, it's a good idea to turn it on when you
start using it after work and then turn it off before going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most of us are comfortable performing small tasks under
the hood of a computer _ changing the modem card, adding memory or
changing some other plug-in component. You probably already know to
turn off the power before you do this. But you also need to know
that static electricity is a real killer when chips and other
delicate components are involved.
</P>
<P>
   _ So make sure you're not carrying a static charge before you
open that package with the new memory chips, or touch any component
inside the computer. It's easy to do that. Simply touch the metal
exterior of the computer case before getting started on your work.
And if you are working over a carpeted surface, especially in the
winter (not a good idea), discharge any static repeatedly as you
work.
</P>
<P>
   _ These tips should help you keep your computer running at least
as dependably as a Model T.

LAS VEGAS HUNTS FOR TEACHERS WHEN THE SNOW FALLS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ann Rice keeps a close eye on storm systems
around the country. When she learns of a particularly nasty winter
in upstate New York, Rice springs into action.
</P>
<P>
   Rice isn't a weather forecaster. She's in charge of recruiting
teachers to the Clark County school district in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   When Buffalo, for instance, is under 5 feet of snow, Rice
bombards college placement counselors there and in other upstate
cities with e-mail messages reminding them of the opportunities,
and warm weather, in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in shirtsleeves while you people back there are digging
out,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   The rush is on. Upstate New York and other parts of the
Northeast are prime hunting grounds for school systems in booming
Sun Belt cities that need teachers. There aren't many teaching jobs
in upstate New York because the population isn't growing and there
is little turnover. But universities here churn out lots of
teachers. Most of them head west and south, where opportunities
abound.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cities such as Las Vegas have entire enclaves of
transplanted teachers from places like Buffalo, Binghamton and
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I meet somebody, they are usually from Buffalo or
Albany,'' said Kristin Brearton, a native of Troy, N.Y., who is now
a guidance counselor in one of Las Vegas' new high schools. She was
hired right out of graduate school in 1994 to work as a guidance
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ton of us,'' she said of transplanted New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers from New York colleges are also finding jobs in places
like Florida, the Carolinas and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   New York state is a gold mine for those looking to hire
teachers. In the State University of New York system, 3,486
undergraduate degrees in education were awarded in 1997, the latest
year for which figures were available, said SUNY spokesman Ken
Goldfarb. SUNY also gave out 3,131 master's degrees in education
that year. Another 70 private colleges also offer teaching degrees
in New York. The problem is that there are few jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth in upstate New York is flat at best and the
economy remains stagnant. Moreover, the new teachers often find a
clogged career pipeline, thanks in part to a system that greatly
increases pay with longevity. Veteran teachers who are at or past
the retirement age of 55 are often reluctant to leave since they
are in their prime earning years, noted Hank Dowski, an associate
professor emeritus at the State University College at Buffalo who
frequently advises new teachers on where to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke was that you looked in the obituaries to see if
somebody died,'' said Bob Mars, who moved from western New York to
Las Vegas in 1993 after he was recruited as a math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas is a prime example of how a booming Sun Belt is
changing the nation's educational landscape. Frequently cited as
one of the nation's fastest growing cities, the school system,
which actually covers a large swathe of southern Nevada, has
209,000 students, Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   With only two universities in the state, at Las Vegas and Reno,
Nevada school officials are forced to scour the rest of the nation
in search of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And they do it well.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters from the Clark County district have become fixtures
at the annual teacher job fairs held throughout the Northeast
during the spring, and they often make offers on the spot to
promising young applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Once they get a potential new teachers on the hook, a volunteer
from the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce calls the prospect to extol
the virtues of its school system.
</P>
<P>
   When the newcomers arrive, the school district arranges
get-together parties, complete with name tags bearing the wearer's
hometown so they can network, Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really work hard at making you feel at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, though, is there are opportunities in Las Vegas
that would simply be closed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never get this chance back home,'' said Brearton, who
described how she has been able to help build a guidance office
from scratch. Her school, Mojave High School, is so new that it
doesn't even have a senior class.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers who are lured to Sun Belt schools, though, are
bypassing another area of shortage closer to home _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is most graduates don't want to work there. They
fear the city's tough reputation _ and high cost of living, college
placement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have these people go to New York City than to the
Carolinas or Las Vegas,'' Dowski said. He was among dozens of
college officials who recently attended a summit meeting sponsored
by the state Board of Regents to brainstorm ways of getting more
teachers to New York City. They are even considering such ideas as
offering subsidized housing for out-of-town teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all New York graduates stay forever in these growing areas.
``We know that many of them are just getting the experience under
their belts,'' said Debbie Hill, who recruits teachers for the
school system in Burlington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   For example, low salaries in Burlington, $22,150 to start,
translate into a high turnover. After a couple years on the job,
lots of teachers in Burlington are lured to better-paying school
districts in other parts of North Carolina. Or they go back north,
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a major issue with our system right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas counters with a number of benefits that offsets the
low pay. A starting teacher in Las Vegas will earn $26,060 a year,
which is less than large upstate school districts like Albany,
where teachers start at $34,515.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevada has no state income taxes and property taxes are
generally less than a third of those in upstate New York,
transplanted teachers say. To sweeten the pot, teachers in Clark
County pay nothing toward their retirement funds.

ENOUGH ALREADY! WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What red-blooded American hasn't surveyed the muck and mire of
our national politics,'' writes Mark Jurkowitz of The Boston Globe,
``and said, ` &UR; Enough, already &LR; '?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time magazine reports that Clinton's woes have left U.S.
foreign policy adrift,'' writes The Guardian of London, ``though
Garrison Keillor says, ` &UR; Enough already! &LR; '''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Fineman of Newsweek asks, ``Is there any way out of this
mess?'' leading to an inch-high, 102-point, block-letter headline:
``ENOUGH ALREADY.''
</P>
<P>
   The stylistic issue raised is: Should there be a comma between
the first and second words of this increasingly important phrase?
The publication that pioneered in its popularization is The Toronto
Globe and Mail; of the 19,000 entries in the Dow Jones database,
the first 22 uses (from 1977 to 1983) were in that newspaper.
According to Warren Clements, style editor, ``We abandoned the
comma in 1979 because  &UR; enough already &LR;  was considered one of those
expressions that is almost one word. It rips rollingly off the
tongue; the comma would slow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Michael Kesterton of that newspaper, ``I know it's a
Yiddishism, but it just fits the Canadian soul _ you know, `I've
had it and I'm not gonna take it anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   The origin is the Yiddish  &UR; genug shoyn &LR; , literally ``enough
already.'' It is part of an array of phrases using  &UR; shoyn &LR;  for
emphasis, from the similar  &UR; gut shoyn &LR; , ``All right already!'' in
the sense of ``Stop bugging me,'' to  &UR; shvayg shtil shoyn &LR; , ``Shut
up already!'' one calibration more irritated than  &UR; genug shoyn &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``This use of  &UR; already &LR;  began to appear early in the century,''
says Sol Steinmetz, the lexicographer who has taken the place of
the late Leo Rosten as my primary Yiddish adviser, ``among
immigrant Yiddish speakers living in New York who were just
starting to talk English. By the 1930s it had become common usage
among their children who no longer spoke Yiddish _ a development
that enabled it to entrench itself in the American language.''
</P>
<P>
   Another scholar, Lillian Feinsilver, in her ``Taste of Yiddish''
(1970), notes that ``English would normally use the mild  &UR; now &LR; , as
in `Come, now,' or the stronger `Come on, now.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Now &LR;  is an adverb of time that can be used as an admonition
before a statement (``Now, I want you to listen to this ...'').
Similarly,  &UR; already &LR;  and  &UR; yet &LR;  are adverbs of time that can be used
to intensify a statement when used at the end. (``Were you bitten
by a mad dog?'' ``And the dog is mad,  &UR; yet &LR; .'') Thus,  &UR; already &LR;  _
in standard English, ``beforehand; by this time'' _ can be used in
this idiomatic sense to mean ``without further ado'' or ``and you'd
better believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   We have seen how this Yiddishism has been thoroughly assimilated
and is now an Americanism. Because other American English
expressions have been adopted in many other languages _  &UR; OK &LR;  and
 &UR; no problem &LR;  are examples _ does this mean that this particular
emphasis of exasperation is taking root elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Some evidence exists that it does. Here is a letter to The
Washington Post from Robert Hill, an American working in a large
Saudi hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: ``The overwhelming _ by 9
to 1 _ response to the Clinton affair varies among `What is the
very big deal?' to `What about the problems in the rest of the
world?' to ` &UR; Enough already &LR; !'''
</P>
<P>
   When a Yiddishism takes root in Riyadh, that's saying something.
Have we exhausted this subject? The reader may now vent
exasperation at a surfeit of data by expostulating the very phrase
being so minutely examined.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT AM I?
</P>
<P>
   At a chic Washington cocktail party, Elizabeth Drew, author of
``Whatever It Takes: The Real Struggle for Political Power in
America,'' accepted an hors d'oeuvre of chopped liver smeared on a
cracker and asked: ``Chopped liver is delicious. Why do people
derogate it so? As in the expression, ` &UR; What am I, chopped
liver &LR; ?'''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest use of this phrase in its derogatory sense _ that
is, ``something trivial; something to be scoffed at'' _ in the
Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang is by Jimmy
Durante on his 1954 CBS-TV show: ``Now that ain't  &UR; chopped
liver &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1980 monologue about the Reagan-Carter presidential debate,
Johnny Carson noted Ronald Reagan's statement that if all the
unemployed were lined up, they would stretch from New York to Los
Angeles. ``He came up with another one today,'' said Carson. ``If
everyone on welfare were  &UR; chopped liver &LR; , you could spread them on
a line of Ritz crackers from here to Bulgaria.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the actor-producer Michael Douglas applied the
phrase to himself, complaining about his secondary role in a movie:
``That hurt me in the industry as an actor, and it ticked me off. I
thought, What was I _  &UR; chopped &LR;   &UR; liver &LR;  or something?''
</P>
<P>
   This show-biz usage contributed to the treatment of the ethnic
culinary delicacy (in Yiddish,  &UR; gehakte leber &LR; ) as an object of
disdain. It may have also been influenced by its sense in
underworld lingo as ``a beaten and scarred person,'' or by the
urbanization of the once-rural expression ``That ain't hay.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinmetz speculates: `` &UR; Chopped liver &LR;  is merely an appetizer
or side dish, not as important as chicken soup or gefilte fish.
Hence it was often used among Jewish comedians in the Borscht Belt
as a humorous metaphor for something or someone insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who tastes properly made  &UR; chopped liver &LR;  can use it as a
derogation. I turned to my New York Times colleague Marian Burros,
author of ``The New Elegant but Easy Cookbook,'' for the recipe:
``Saute one finely chopped medium onion in two tablespoons hot
chicken fat until lightly golden and very soft. Add 1 pound chicken
liver and saute until cooked through; process in food processor
with one small raw onion and one hard-cooked egg. Season with salt
and pepper and mix with enough chicken fat to make it moist and
spreadable.''

<P>
   Then you can say, ``I feel just  &UR; as terrific as chopped
liver &LR; !''

IN PAINFUL DETAIL, DOCUMENTARY PAINTS THE DEVASTATING HISTORY OF
SLAVERY

   Given the stark realities of racial polarization and America's
painful history of slavery, a four-part, six-hour documentary
examining the origins and evolution of human bondage couldn't
possibly have been an easy sell. (It wasn't.) Or easy viewing. (It
isn't.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery,''
richly detailed and unyielding in tone, arrives this week on the
heels of what executive producer Orlando Bagwell calls ``a
re-questioning of the black Holocaust,'' originating from the
notion that we're no longer tongue-tied on the issue of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   It's romantic thinking. But Bagwell's examples of Steven
Spielberg's ``Amistad'' and Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved'' are, I'm
afraid, no more than timely cinematic coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   The enslavement of Africans in this country for more than 300
years serves as one of the saddest commentaries on man's inhumanity
to man, a period of our history so morbid that any serious thought
of what occurred often causes vehement hostilities, awkward chatter
or painful silence.
</P>
<P>
   And as cruel and painful as racial slavery was, it's unnerving
to think that it has been exceeded only by a worse form of
psychological bondage: for blacks, in the form of victimized
thinking; for whites, in terms of overcompensating guilt or angry
insistence that past atrocities have little to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the pragmatic Bagwell, who produced two films for the
exquisitely researched civil rights-themed ``Eyes on the Prize,''
and who has tackled documentaries on Frederick Douglass and Malcolm
X, approaches the six hours from a ``we'' mentality. To its credit,
the documentary is written under the belief that slavery is
uniquely ``American,'' no more black history than white.
</P>
<P>
   Aired in 90-minute installments and using drawings, paintings,
photographs, journals, letters, narratives and a healthy supply of
scholars, historians, writers and slave descendants, ``Africans in
America'' follows in the formidable tradition of Henry Hampton's
``Prize'' and Ken Burns' ``The Civil War'': It's painstakingly
researched, artfully assembled, scrupulously evenhanded and rather
deft in its handling of personal triumph and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these personal stories breathe life into a period of
history that has been treated by TV as either high-minded academics
talking to high-minded academics (coming across as distant and
boring), or as a sitcom dumbed down for the masses (coming across
as silly and disrespectful).
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell selects little-known narrative nuggets. Olaudah Equiano
recalls a fascinating story (pulled from his 1789 biography) of his
capture, sale and period of enslavement. Real-life characters
include poet Phyllis Wheatley, born in Africa, abducted into
slavery as a child, and purchased as a house servant by a Boston
family who taught her to read and write, and Fanny Kemble, an
Englishwoman whose visit to her husband's South Carolina plantation
brings her face-to-face with the human misery that purchased her
comfortable existence.
</P>
<P>
   Moving at a stately, even regal pace, ``Africans in America''
begins in 1607 Jamestown with the forced migration of Africans to
America (unfortunately, this is perhaps the most difficult episode
to get through, because it's visually skimpy) and ends with the
last years before the Civil War. It also manages to challenge
popular notions by pointing out that the first Africans to arrive
in Virginia were not slaves but indentured servants governed by
favorable laws.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Photos of famous men and women sporting mustaches of milk have
become familiar advertisements for a calcium-rich food that has
fallen on hard times. Milk consumption has been dropping for the
last three decades, and calcium nutrition among both young and old
has collapsed with it. Some experts predict an epidemic of
osteoporosis because today's children and teen-agers, who guzzle
sodas and juice drinks instead of milk, are consuming about half
the amount of calcium from foods that youngsters did in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Peak bone mass, the single best predictor of osteoporosis, is
largely achieved by age 20, so most of these young people will
enter the years of gradual bone loss in their 30s with a glass that
is already only half-full. Now, as new evidence points to the
ever-widening role of calcium in preventing disease, it is even
more important to be sure that everyone gets enough of this vital
nutrient each day.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving the recommended daily amounts of calcium is not
difficult for people whose diets are rich in dairy products.
Children who drink three or four glasses of milk a day, for
example, would easily meet their needs. But there is much confusion
about other food sources of calcium and the ability of calcium
supplements to compensate for a dietary deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Facts About Foods &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Food is nearly always a better source of calcium than
supplements, if for no other reason than food provides more
nutritional benefits than just calcium, including nutrients that
help the body use calcium. A consensus conference convened by the
National Institutes of Health concluded in 1994 that ``to attain
optimal calcium levels, a change in dietary habits, including
increased consumption of dairy products and/or calcium-rich
vegetable sources, is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts might have also cautioned Americans about eating too
much salt and protein, especially animal protein, which increases
the loss of calcium in urine. Eating just one fast-food hamburger
leads to a net loss of 23 milligrams of calcium, according to Dr.
Robert Heaney, a calcium expert at Creighton University in Omaha.
However, despite earlier concerns about caffeine, it only minimally
increases calcium loss, by about 2 or 3 milligrams for a cup of
coffee, Heaney said.
</P>
<P>
   DAIRY PRODUCTS _ Milk remains the best dietary source of calcium
for two reasons: the lactose (milk sugar) naturally in milk and the
vitamin D added to it enhance calcium absorption through the gut.
(For those who have trouble digesting lactose, ample calcium is
absorbed from lactose-reduced milk and from yogurt with active
cultures, which is also low in lactose.) Ounce for ounce, nonfat
plain yogurt has more calcium than milk, although it contains no
vitamin D. Among frozen dairy desserts, nonfat frozen yogurt is a
much better source of calcium than ice cream or ice milk.
</P>
<P>
   Hard cheese, whether high or low in fat, is quite rich in
calcium. Ricotta cheese is also an excellent source, but cottage
cheese, creamed or otherwise, is not nearly as good a source as
milk and yogurt unless calcium is added by the maker. Using less
water when reconstituting dry milk and adding nonfat dry milk
powder to other drinks and foods are excellent ways to increase
calcium intake.
</P>
<P>
   For children allergic to cow's milk or who become constipated
when consuming it , soy milk fortified with calcium or a daily
calcium supplement may be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLES _ Some of the best vegetable sources of calcium
include kale, collard greens, turnip greens, mustard greens,
Chinese cabbage, chicory and bok choy. Broccoli, chard and acorn
squash, though not as rich in calcium, are more common sources.
Although spinach has a lot of calcium, it also contains a substance
_ oxalic acid _ that binds up its calcium and prevents absorption
of all but about 5 percent of it. However, the oxalic acid in
spinach and foods like rhubarb does not interfere with absorption
of calcium from other foods eaten at the same time. Phytic acid,
another substance in foods like dried beans and peas, also
depresses calcium absorption somewhat, but less than oxalic acid.
</P>
<P>
   Most forms of fiber have little or no effect on calcium
absorption. Wheat bran, though, can partly block absorption of
calcium from other foods, for example, the milk in a bowl of bran
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER FOOD _ Canned sardines with their bones included are
especially rich in calcium _ 3 ounces of sardines have more calcium
than 8 ounces of milk. Canned salmon, also with bones, is about
half as good. Other sources include dry-roasted soybeans,
blackstrap molasses, figs, some beans and peas (black-eyed peas,
white beans, great northern beans, navy beans and soybeans,
although the calcium in beans is only about half as available to
the body as that in milk), poppy and sesame seeds, tahini, almonds,
oranges and calcium-fortified orange juice. The acid in the juice
enhances calcium absorption, and is especially good for older
people short on stomach acid.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Facts About Supplements &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For those who cannot or do not get enough calcium from foods to
meet the recommended intake for their age and sex, calcium
supplements are the next best option. As long as the maximum does
not exceed a total of 2,000 milligrams a day from foods and pills,
calcium supplementation appears to be safe, except perhaps for
people who tend to form calcium-containing kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
   As for how well a calcium tablet is absorbed, there is no
predictable relationship between a supplement's ability to dissolve
in vinegar water and its usefulness to the body. Calcium carbonate
(as in Tums and Rolaids as well as various supplements) is least
expensive and as good a source when taken with meals as, say,
calcium citrate, which can be taken between meals and is the
preferred supplement for older people who are deficient in stomach
acid. Avoid natural sources of calcium like bone meal, oyster shell
or dolomite, since they may contain harmful contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Bedtime is another good time to take calcium, since it will
remain in the stomach longer. If possible, avoid taking calcium
with meals that contain a lot of wheat fiber. Also, if taking iron
or a multivitamin with iron, take calcium at a different time since
it interferes with iron absorption.
</P>
<P>
   When buying a calcium supplement, check the label for the amount
of elemental calcium in each tablet, not the total weight, to
calculate the amount of calcium being consumed. Calcium supplements
are best used by the body when taken in doses of 500 milligrams or
less. Chewable and effervescent supplements are available for those
who have trouble swallowing tablets.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget about vitamin D. A large proportion of
Americans do not get enough of this vitamin to assure optimal
absorption of calcium. And the latest studies suggest that adults
need 800 International Units a day, not 400 as is now recommended.
Although milk is supposed to be fortified with vitamin D (400 units
per quart), the actual amount in milk is highly variable. About 90
percent of the vitamin D people get is made in skin exposed to the
sun's ultraviolet-B rays. Try to expose some part of your body
(without sunscreen) to the sun for 10 or 15 minutes a day
year-round. Alternatively, eat fatty fish or take cod-liver oil or
a supplement with D.

TAKING A CHANCE ON 'LIFE'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUTHE STEIN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Like the best comedians, Roberto Benigni has a
remarkably mobile face. You can see him think. Clasping his head in
his hands, he furrows his brow and rolls his dark eyes upward as
though looking for divine guidance.
</P>
<P>
   What Benigni is pondering is how he might respond if ``Life Is
Beautiful'' _ the tragicomedy he wrote, directed and stars in _
should be named best foreign-language film on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Benigni has a hard act to follow: his own. When
``Life Is Beautiful'' won the Prix du Jury at the Cannes Film
Festival, he fell to his knees and kissed the feet of Martin
Scorsese, who headed the festival jury. Benigni then jumped up and
planted a kiss on every other juror, including Winona Ryder and
Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   So how would he top that?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give me an Oscar, maybe I go naked,'' says Benigni,
his laughter filling a hotel room. ``Why not? I jump on the stage
naked and say, `Thank you very very much.'''
</P>
<P>
   To say the 46-year-old Italian comic is exuberant is an
understatement. He's been compared to Jim Carrey, Robin Williams
and the Marx Brothers. Certainly Benigni can match them in manic
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Although hugely popular in Italy, where his movies, including
``Johnny Stecchino'' and ``The Monster,'' have broken box-office
records, Benigni has barely grazed the American market. He appeared
in Jim Jarmusch's ``Down by Law'' (1986) and the forgettable ``Son
of the Pink Panther'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   With ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Benigni may finally become an
international star. It's a risky picture, starting out as a romance
set in an idyllic Italian town, then moving to a concentration
camp, where a father (Benigni) tries to keep up his son's spirits
by making up a fantasy about why they are there.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the film was so strong, Benigni says, that he felt
compelled to make it, even at the risk of appearing to make light
of the Holocaust. ``As a filmmaker, I try to have many ideas to
choose from. But in this case I just had this idea. I was thinking
about a very strong love in an extreme situation and putting a
comedian in an extreme situation. When you love something it is
easier to be brave, and I love so much this idea.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, his wife, Nicoletta Braschi, who often appears in his
films, refused to play his romantic interest. ``She was scared when
I told her I wanted to make a movie about the Holocaust. Me, too, I
was scared, so I can imagine. But when she read the script, she
fell in love with the story, which is really about protecting the
innocent from the horror of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Braschi's character is not Jewish, she follows her son
and husband to a camp just to be near them. In researching ``Life
Is Beautiful,'' Benigni discovered this happened a lot in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women decided to follow their family because, what could they
do without them? They'd be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to how Jews would respond to the story, Benigni, who
is Catholic, sent the script to members of Milan's large Jewish
community. ``They loved the script very much. They told me only
about some historical errors,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni acknowledges taking artistic license with some of the
facts. For instance, it would be difficult for those in a
concentration camp to get around as much as his character does.
</P>
<P>
   As an homage to his idol, Charlie Chaplin, who mocked the Nazis
in ``The Great Dictator,'' Benigni wore the same number _ 0373 _ in
the concentration-camp scenes that Chaplin had worn in his movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' was inspired by Benigni's father's war
experience. He was serving in Albania in 1943 when Italy changed
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a simple man, a farmer who didn't know anything
about fascism and the Nazis. But the Nazis didn't know this, and
they put him in a war camp for two years. When he came back, he was
like a skeleton.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also obsessed with what had happened to him and couldn't
stop telling his wife about it. Concerned that he would scare their
children, she suggested that he lighten up the story for their
ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us funny stories about the camp,'' Benigni recalls.
``Me and my sisters, we would imitate him sometimes as a skeleton
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Benigni showed signs of being a cutup at a young age, a
priest thought young Roberto had potential to be a man of the
cloth. The boy, who grew up on a farm in Tuscany, was sent to a
seminary in Florence. Fortunately for Benigni, the school was
closed when the Arno River flooded.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the circus as a magician's assistant. ``I did it for
three months when my hand got burnt because a joke didn't work so
good. My mother said, `OK, stop.' So I was saved from one
profession by the water and from another by the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A director of an experimental theater company in Rome heard
Benigni improvise a satirical political speech in a town square and
invited him to join the company. ``It was a very good moment for
underground and experimental theater in Rome,'' says Benigni, who
was still a teenager when he moved there.
</P>
<P>
   His stage experience led to the role of a movie critic in a
popular TV show. ``The running gag was that either I couldn't
understand the movie or I didn't even see it and I was inventing
something,'' Benigni says. To this day, he gets ribbed by Italian
film critics claiming that they don't understand his movies.
</P>
<P>
   He and Braschi met in an acting class and married in 1991. ``I
don't remember exactly when I met her,'' he says. ``I think she's
in my life forever.'' Playing parents in ``Life Is Beautiful'' made
them think about having children of their own. ``Now we are trying
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Benigni can pretty much write his own ticket as a
filmmaker, and he is free to cast Braschi in all his movies. The
two have a good life in Rome, so there hasn't been much motivation
for Benigni to try to make it in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harder as a comedian to have American audiences
understand what you are doing,'' he says. ``It is very difficult
because of language. You can be funny with your body, but you have
to talk, too. But I would like to work in the United States. It
would help if I could write it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni isn't working on a new film. ``I am working on `Life Is
Beautiful.' It's like my son. I have to walk with it around the
world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tim Barnett knew he was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He lay on his back, on the grass in the Tien Shan Mountains of
Kyrgyzstan. His friends were far down the trail. He could see the
sky, the deep blue of a cloudless afternoon. He could see his right
hand, curled into a fist, lying on the side of his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The problem wasn't just that he had fallen off a horse _ well,
dropped off, really _ and that his mount was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that he couldn't move.
</P>
<P>
   Paralyzed. Fifteen miles from the nearest road, in a country
most Americans couldn't even find on a map.
</P>
<P>
   There was no panic, no fear. Only numbness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel anything,'' he recalled later. ``I thought, `I'm
just going to lie here.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Tim Barnett, 57, lay where he fell, waiting for help to
arrive, trying not to think about the fact that his neck may have
been broken. Trying not to wonder what would happen next.
</P>
<P>
   It was 3 p.m., June 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett was in the conservation business for 25 years when the
opportunity came to fly halfway around the world. At the time, he
was the executive director of the Adirondack chapter of the Nature
Conservancy, a worldwide, nonprofit group dedicated to protecting
natural land from development.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was ready for sabbatical. That's when he decided
to join the Tien Shan project. The idea was to build a single park
in three countries: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyzstan, all
parts of the former Soviet Union. The mountains, up to 23,000 feet
high, were located south of Russia, northeast of Iran and west of
China, in a land few Westerners had seen. To Barnett, it seemed
like the end of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to buy an atlas to find out where they were,'' he said,
gesturing with the one arm that still works reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett won a grant from the World Bank to pay for expenses. He
took three trips, met with the rangers and the volunteers from
different countries that would help construct the world's newest
national park.
</P>
<P>
   On the third trip, he took a horseback ride with some friends.
At one point, Barnett stopped his horse and got off to take a
picture. They were the last steps he'd take for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett tried to mount the horse. The horse began to trot.
Barnett could not get his leg over the horse _ a duffel bag was in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The horse started galloping. Barnett hung by his arms, wondering
if he should let go.
</P>
<P>
   The horse ran on, hoofbeats pounding. It was getting harder and
harder to hold on.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett let go.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing he knew, he couldn't move.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his friends came back. They wanted him to ride a
horse. He told them not to touch him.
</P>
<P>
   Get help, he said. Any help.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Barnett lay where he fell for 24 hours. Locals massaged his
arms, but he could barely feel it.
</P>
<P>
   Help was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $600 per hour, cash in advance, to lure the only
helicopter in Uzbekistan to fly to the mountains. On the helicopter
was a United Nations doctor, who had a wooden backboard and neck
brace that had been in the country all of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They strapped him in and flew him to a hospital in the city of
Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The clinic had no screens on the windows. A
visitor had to chase a cat and her kittens out of the
intensive-care unit. They wanted to operate. If not, they said, you
will die.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, who was calm enough to talk to his wife on a cellular
phone, declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, a Swiss rescue group flew him to a spinal clinic in
Zurich. There, doctors found a shattered C-4 vertebra. His spine
was bruised, but not severed. In a six-hour operation, they
replaced the fragments with a metal plate and a piece of his hip
bone.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery, Barnett still couldn't move his arms or legs. He
lay on a special waterbed that prevented bedsores. A computer
controlled with a tube by his mouth let him make phone calls. Even
though he was racked by muscle spasms and had trouble breathing, he
talked to the conservancy every day.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett spend the next four months learning the limits of his
changed body. It took him weeks to move his arm, even longer to
clasp things with his fingers. After several months, he was able to
take a single step. His therapists, both young ladies, cried. So
did he.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, his wife Claire took him to their new apartment in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y. From now on, he would get around in a
160-pound motorized wheelchair with wide, knobby wheels and a
joystick to steer. The only walking he can do now is a step from
the chair into the passenger seat of a new van.
</P>
<P>
   It takes him a few tries to stand up, and he can do that only by
leaning on something _ for less than a minute. His left arm barely
works at all. With the other, he can hold a beer, write, shake
hands and use the phone (the receiver at home has a plastic hook
that slides over his fingers, making it easier to hold). Though
Barnett doesn't expect his body to improve much more, his wife says
it's not easy for him to admit just what his limits are.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things he did upon getting home was set up a
desk. His new office. He commutes to work once or twice a week,
driven by one of his 24-hour health-care workers.
</P>
<P>
   These days he's no longer the executive director of the
Adirondack chapter. He's a vice president of the national Nature
Conservancy, but locally he's a part-time staffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've loved going to work everyday for 26 years,'' he said.
``That doesn't change. I really enjoy what I'm doing.''

 THE LARGER SIGNIFICANCE OF ALLY McBEAL'S HEMLINE 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here it is, Hemline Monday. Tonight we find out if Ally McBeal's
miniskirts, which this season have crept up yet another inch, will
put her in contempt of court. Will Ally lower her hems so she won't
have to go to jail? And if she does go to jail, will it ruin her
dinner party? The suspense is killing me.
</P>
<P>
   This whole McBeal hemline thing is surprising on at least two
fronts. First, who would have thought her skirts could get any
shorter? Second _ and the real surprise _ is that some people think
that the length of her skirts means something more than, well, the
length of her skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Pratt, editor in chief of Jane magazine, which is targeted
to women under 30, was quoted in The Baltimore Sun as saying: ``We
can all look at Ally McBeal and see her as some kind of icon. Women
find themselves emulating her, feeling OK wearing shorter skirts to
the office because of her. She's freeing women up.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeing them up for what? To be arrested for indecent exposure?
Or to be both sexy and successful? The latter, I assume. So here's
the burning feminist question for the '90s: Can a woman hike up her
skirts to the danger zone and still be taken seriously? We've come
a long way, baby. Have we come that far?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, from what I've seen lately on the shout show circuit,
having a hemline that flirts with what were called private parts in
days of yore is a sure-fire way to be taken seriously, or to become
an MSNBC commentator anyway, which may or may not be the same
thing. Would Laura Ingraham, to name only one pair of talking legs,
see so much air time if she wasn't such fantasy fodder? If she
were, say, fat?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Calista Flockhart, who plays Ally McBeal
and who is anything but fat. Her alleged flirtation with anorexia
is much in the news. She has denied that she has an eating
disorder, and her publicist has made much of her ravenous appetite
and hummingbird-like metabolism. All of which may be true. Still,
she appears to be wasting away in her micro miniskirt. I hope she
doesn't have to cancel that dinner party. She could use a decent
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of Flockhart and other ultra-slim actresses are
plastered all over this week's supermarket tabloids, under
headlines that read, ``Starving Stars'' and ``Diet Torture'' and
``Are These Beauties Starving to Death?'' If a prize were given for
hypocrisy (and why isn't there one?) these stories would take it.
The tone of these pieces is all shock and concern, unconvincing, to
put it mildly, in publications that usually revel in humiliating
celebrities who gain weight.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one tabloid ran a photograph of Julia Roberts in
exercise clothes, on her way to a gym, under the headline ``Pretty
Big Woman.'' It quoted ``one startled passerby'' as saying, ``Her
rear end is just so huge now. ...'' Two weeks ago, one weekly ran
photos of Kate Winslet in a swimsuit with a headline that read
``Titanic Beauty Gains 30 Pounds.'' Celebrities may say these
stories aren't hurtful, but they wouldn't be human if they weren't
bothered by the unflattering photographs and cruel comments.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, the National Enquirer has done a 180-degree
turn and fears for the lives of Hollywood's ``frighteningly thin''
actresses. And in the Star ``experts warn that the emaciated look
can be a health danger.'' No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that these stories represent a change
in editorial policy, and that these weeklies would continue to draw
attention to the dangers of anorexia and other eating disorders,
and maybe even stop mocking celebrities who gain weight. But I
wouldn't bet on it. The ``starving stars'' are just this week's
sensation.

CAN'T DECIDE IF THAT CENTERFOLD IS A PERFECT TEN? JUST DO THE
MATH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good news from England: Statistical criteria may make it easier
for a man with stunted perceptual ability to decide whether a woman
is sexually attractive, unattractive or just so-so.
</P>
<P>
   This breakthrough in sexiness assessment was reported in a
renowned British journal, The Lancet, in two papers by Dr. Martin
Tovee, a psychologist, and his colleagues at Newcastle University.
The gist of the two reports, one published in November and the
other in August, was that sexual attractiveness in women was a
function of body weight compared with height.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, working this out requires some arithmetic. The
sexiness quotient proposed by the Newcastle group, called the
body-mass index, is calculated by measuring a woman's weight in
kilograms and dividing it by the square of her height in meters.
Got that?
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, this means we must divide a woman's weight in
pounds by 2.205 to get the kilograms, and multiply her height in
inches times 0.0254 to get the meters. Then we multiply that number
times itself and divide the result into the weight. Simplicity
itself.
</P>
<P>
   After culling various journals (including Playboy, which the
authors cited as ``a source which has been used by previous
researchers and which is judged reliable''), they compiled a table
of average body-mass indices as follows: fashion models, 17.57;
other models (including centerfolds), 18.09; anorexic women, 14.72;
bulimic women, 23.66; normal women, 21.86.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in the past had theorized that feminine
attractiveness was best gauged by a woman's hip-to-waist ratio, on
the grounds that a nice big ratio supposedly signaled fecundity, a
quality these scientists equated with sexual attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Newcastle team tested this hypothesis and found it
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Forty male undergraduates at the university served as a panel
rating the sexiness of full frontal color pictures of 50 naked
women of assorted shapes and sizes, depicted without faces. A graph
representing the students' rankings was compared with graphs of the
women's body-mass indices and with their waist-hip ratios, and it
was found that the students' perceptions matched the body-mass
ratios much more closely than the waist-hip ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Science marches on.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the University of Liverpool reported that
women who need anthropometric help in picking sexy mates should
look above the belt, at their prospects' hands. This conclusion,
reported by the magazine New Scientist, came from a study by Dr.
John Manning and his associates, who focused on male patients in a
fertility clinic.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, he reported, that the men with the lowest sperm
counts and poorest sperm motility also had the least symmetrical
hands. Manning's group also discovered that men whose ring fingers
were longer than their index fingers often had elevated levels of
testosterone, and we all know what that means.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scorn that has been heaped on ``anthropometrics'' by
Dr. Stephen Jay Gould (author of ``The Mismeasure of Man'') and
scores of other leading scientists, the urge to learn about people
by measuring them seems to be a deep-seated human impulse. From the
phrenologists of the 19th century to the heat-sensitive ``mood
rings'' of the 1960s, measurement systems fascinate and entertain
even skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   But while anthropometric systems are harmless fun for some, they
have also kindled bitter disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, was a pioneer in
the field of measuring people. Sir Francis might have avoided
intense criticism if he had restricted his studies to sexual
attractiveness, but he took a different line, seeking to measure
intelligence. Having concluded that intelligence was a hereditary
trait and that the breeding of stupid people should be discouraged,
Sir Francis threw the fat into a sociological fire that still
blazes intensely.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bad name anthropometric systems have in some
circles, they are sometimes useful to forensic scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Alphonse Bertillon, a 19th-century French anthropometrist,
devised a system of forensic identification based on the dimensions
of parts of a body, especially the head, left arm and left foot.
His method impressed Arthur Conan Doyle so much that in ``The Hound
of the Baskervilles,'' Sherlock Holmes exhibited jealousy of the
famous French scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of Bertillon's techniques eventually proved
unreliable, the field of forensic anthropology that developed from
his ideas still thrives, with varying degrees of success. Still,
even the modern version can yield false conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the body parts found in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City
bombing was a leg whose owner could not be identified. Forensic
anthropologists measured and studied the leg and finally concluded
it was probably the leg of a white man. But another and more
reliable method was available: DNA analysis. To the embarrassment
of the anthropometrists, DNA showed that the leg probably came from
a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   So, dear reader, if your body-mass index or finger-length ratio
is less than ideal, do not despair. Anthropometrists have been
known to err.

MORE OPTIONS IN REMEDY FOR HAIR LOSS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA VILLAROSA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that a more potent version of Rogaine has joined Propecia on
drugstore shelves, some 33 million American men who have been
anxiously counting the hairs in their combs have more options. Here
is how they measure up:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How They Work &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROPECIA: Propecia contains 1 mg of finasteride, a drug that has
also been prescribed to treat men with enlarged prostates. It
affects dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, the active form of the male
hormone at the hair follicle that contributes to male pattern
baldness. Merck, the drug's manufacturer, says that in studies, 83
percent of those taking Propecia maintained or increased their hair
count in two years, while 72 percent of those who did not take the
drug lost hair.
</P>
<P>
   ROGAINE EXTRA STRENGTH: Rogaine's new formula has been increased
from a 2 percent to a 5 percent solution of minoxidil, a drug that
has been used to lower blood pressure. Although scientists are not
exactly sure how it works, minoxidil acts directly on the follicle
to stimulate hair growth. Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Rogaine's maker,
reports that in clinical studies 4 out of 5 users said the new
product slowed or stopped hair loss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taking It &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROPECIA: Comes in the form of a pill which must be taken once a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ROGAINE EXTRA STRENGTH: A liquid that is applied directly to the
scalp twice a day using a dropper or spray.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Monthly Cost &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROPECIA: About $50.
</P>
<P>
   ROGAINE EXTRA STRENGTH: About $30.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Side Effects &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROPECIA: Can cause decreased semen volume but does not affect
sperm count. Small numbers of men report a drop in libido. If a
pregnant woman is exposed to the drug it may cause abnormalities of
the genitalia of her male fetus.
</P>
<P>
   ROGAINE EXTRA STRENGTH: Can cause itching or dryness of the
scalp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bottom Line &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Alkek, clinical professor of dermatology at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, says,
``Our clinical impression is that men who take Propecia alone grow
hair faster and more dramatically than those who take 5 percent
Rogaine alone. But what works even better is taking both drugs.
They work differently adding to each others' effectiveness.''

STEVENS'S REWRITE NO MATCH FOR HALEY'S DEFT TOUCH

   MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY &QC; 
By Alex Haley and David Stevens &QC; 
Scribner, 394 pp., $25 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The story of Mama Flora and her family is a powerful one, and it
will (as advertised on the book jacket) probably make a great
television miniseries. But in reading ``Mama Flora's Family,'' the
latest novel written by David Stevens but based on the writings of
the late Alex Haley, I found myself missing Haley's sure touch.
Stevens, a filmmaker who lives in Newburyport and who also wrote
``Queen'' from Haley's notes after his death in 1992, is simply not
as deft a writer as Haley. The book's awkward beginning and often
flat-footed prose hobbles what could be the compelling saga of an
African-American family trying to survive after the Jim Crow years
of the '30s and '40s and through the postwar civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Mama Flora's Family'' remains not only a great
yarn, but a rare glimpse into how black Americans coped with the
blatant segregation of the South before and after World War II. And
it is one of relatively few novels that examine with poignant
accuracy how the black-power movement of the 1960s wrenched apart
black families, much as the antiwar movement of the time tore
gaping holes in the fabric of many white families.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Mama Flora stands at the center of the novel. As a
teenager growing up in Jim Crow Mississippi, she is seduced by a
young scion of a wealthy black family, then forced to give up her
baby and leave town. Flora gets off the train at the small town of
Stockton, Tenn., because she sees a steeple and knows that if there
is a church in town, it will take her in. In Stockton, Flora meets
and marries a handsome young sharecropper named Booker, who soon
meets a grisly end: He is shot to death by a white farmer while
trying to steal cotton to help feed his wife and infant son.
</P>
<P>
   Flora goes on to raise the son, Willie, and an adopted daughter,
Ruthana, and the book details their lives as they try to reconcile
the strict but loving upbringing they experience in the midst of
Stockton's black community with the cold reality of racism in
mid-century America.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, readers may find Willie's story, as he leaves Stockton
for the big-city temptations of Chicago and eventually ends up
enlisting in one of the first black combat units in World War II,
more compelling and in some ways more real than Flora's. That is
probably Stevens's fault: He makes the amateurish mistake of
foreshadowing the early tragedies in Flora's life instead of
letting them unfold more naturally as the narrative gathers
momemtum.
</P>
<P>
   According to the publisher, the book is based on a play written
by Haley and some notes about the novel he planned to make of it.
That makes perfect sense, because the best part of ``Mama Flora's
Family'' is the dialogue, which comes directly from the play. You
can hear Haley's touch here, particularly in his wonderful ear for
replicating the powerful orations of Southern black ministers.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between ``Roots'' and this novel, which would
have been the third volume in Haley's ``Roots'' trilogy, is its
more nuanced depiction of individuals regardless of their race. In
``Mama Flora's Family,'' the bogeyman who seduces Flora at the
beginning of the novel and takes away her son is black, and the
kind ``Massa'' whom Flora and her family work for as sharecroppers
is white. Similarly, throughout the novel, there are some bad white
folks and some good, and some, as Flora's family finds out, who are
capable of change when confronted with individual blacks who
confound their racist expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the issue of race, perhaps the most poignant portions
of the book are those about the war between the generations, as
Willie's children, the twins Don and Diana, reject their parents in
order to embrace the militant black-power groups of the '60s.
Stevens tells this part of the saga with unsentimental pathos, and
by the time Ruthana finds Diana, the niece who has been lost to
drugs in Baltimore's inner city, and brings her back to Mama Flora,
the book has reached a powerful and moving epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   The novel should have ended there, instead of fizzling to a
close on an awkward note. It left this reader wishing that Alex
Haley could come back from the dead, if only to craft an ending
more deserving of Mama Flora and her multi-textured family.

   Fred Kovaleski, a former State Department official, stares
across the net at Jason Morton in the thick of their fight for the
title of No. 1 tennis player in the world. Kovaleski is losing,
something he has not had much experience with during the past 60
years, and he is not delighted. But in a corner of his brain is
lodged a thought that is becoming more and more common in a rapidly
expanding segment of the American population: ``I can't wait to get
older.''
</P>
<P>
   They are actually battling to become world champion in the
over-70 division at the International Tennis Federation World
Championships in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment there is no other division and no other world.
Kovaleski, of New York City, knows that Jan. 1 starts the year he
turns 75. The odds will then suddenly shift in his favor, putting
him in line to become No. 1 among the over-75's. And he can expect
to hold that title for some time _ at least until that young pup
Jason Morton, a teaching pro at Sun Lakes, Ariz., joins the over-75
age group in five years.
</P>
<P>
   These senior warriors are part of a powerful new development
among an elderly population that is becoming far more physically
active. Many start lifting weights after they retire and continue
well into their 90s. They participate in an explosion of organized
games and health-club activities. The physical activity is, in
turn, demonstrably improving their health and the quality and grace
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent studies show that nutrition and aerobic
exercise are no longer sufficient _ apart from the wisdom of
sidestepping things like illness and moving freight trains _ to
protect the aging body. The research has made clear that working to
restore muscle strength and bone density is crucial in realizing
the potential for a healthy old age.
</P>
<P>
   Although they cannot turn back the clock, elderly athletes are
finding that they can take part in sports requiring strong arms,
legs and shoulders much longer and more successfully by using
resistance-weight machines to restore muscle lost through aging.
</P>
<P>
   Morton and Kovaleski provide a case in point. Morton won the
over-70 competition and will try next year to win what might be
called American's first Granddad Slam _ national singles and
doubles titles on four surfaces, the indoor, clay, grass and hard
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Morton lifts weights. Kovaleski does not. Whether that matters
when it comes to a specific tennis match is debatable, but in
day-to-day living among an older population, the value of
strength-training exercise is virtually indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   For the very old and frail the simple act of crossing a room can
become something of a high-wire balancing act. But with
strengthened leg muscles, the endeavor becomes more routine and the
risk of serious injury from a fall decreases.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Sports Medicine recently released a
study analyzing some 250 original research projects, most completed
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the study, Dr. Robert Mazzeo, a professor of
exercise physiology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said
the work showed the aging process was far more complex than once
thought, involving a complicated interaction of genetics, life
style, disease and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   In one of two startling studies, by Dr. Maria Fiatarone, Dr.
William Evans and others at the Tufts University Research Center,
nine women and men, ages 87 to 101, strengthened their arms and
legs by exercising with resistance weights, which, as part of a
controllable system of pulleys and cables, are safer than free
weights. In eight weeks, they increased the strength in the front
thigh muscles by an average of almost 175 percent. Dr. Abraham
Datch, a 101-year-old retired dentist, increased his strength by
200 percent over what it was at 95.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, by Evans and Dr. Miriam Nelson, divided 40
postmenopausal women, none of whom were on hormone replacement
therapy, into two groups, one that lifted weights and one that did
not. The group that did not lift lost bone and muscle mass, but the
other group increased its average strength to the equivalent of
women 15 to 20 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzeo said he was surprised to see how quickly the elderly
benefited from training with resistance weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They build muscle strength,'' Mazzeo said, ``and this then
allows them to do other things, like aerobic exercises, that they
had not been able to do, and that improves their cardiovascular
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Fitz is a retired meteorologist from Silver Spring, Md.,
and a tennis player who has been in the top 20 of his age division
for 30 years. Last December, after years of hard use, his shoulder
broke down with a tear in the rotator cuff and damage in eight
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The injury should have put him out of commission for at least a
year. But after surgery, he started an elaborate program of
stretching, aerobic exercise and strength-building, lifting weights
for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   His first exercise of the day, prescribed by his physical
therapist, Peter Boyle, director of Sports and Spinal Physical
Therapy in Washington, is simply to lie on his back on a rolling
pin for five minutes, and do nothing. The rolling pin, wrapped in
two towels and placed under the small of his back, helped stretch
and gradually correct Fitz's posture, which had become bent from
long hours at a desk, Boyle said. ``With Norman we were also able
to restrengthen his shoulder muscles with weight lifting and other
exercise,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, half the time expected, Fitz was back on the
courts and soon at the top of the tennis ladder in the Mid-Atlantic
over-60 division. Last month, he made a credible showing in the
national grass-court championships in his division in Cedarhurst,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Without exercise, Mazzeo's study concluded, total muscle mass
decreases by nearly 50 percent between ages 20 and 90. Computer
tomography of individual muscles shows that after age 30 there is a
decrease in cross-sectional areas of the thigh, decreased muscle
density and increased intramuscle fat.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of muscle mass, or atrophy, occurs notably in Type 2 muscle
fibers _ the fast-twitch muscles used in high-intensity activities.
Atrophy, a normal response to lack of use, appears to be
accentuated in older people if dietary protein is not increased.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, researchers say, people lose about 30 percent of
their strength between 50 and 70, and another 30 per cent per
decade after that. At the same time, fat-free body mass declines 15
percent, which in turn slows the body's metabolism _ the rate at
which it converts food to energy. To make matters worse, the loss
of lean body mass makes people lose energy and become more
sedentary, continuing the unhealthy cycle by contributing to loss
of lean body mass.
</P>
<P>
   But increased physical activity can reverse that cycle. ``A
number of studies have demonstrated that, given adequate training
stimulus, older men and women show similar or greater strength
gains compared with young individuals as a result of resistance
training,'' the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because the aging process is so complex, getting and
staying in shape and competing becomes more complicated as the body
ages. Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a sports medicine-expert at New York
University School of Medicine, said in an interview: ``After 30,
reaction time slows, as information processing in the brain slows
and nerves conduct impulses more slowly. The heart no longer pumps
at the same maximal rate it once did. The arteries begin to
stiffen, and oxygen is transported less efficiently. Finally,
recovery time slows.''

ADJUSTING HEALTH AND BODY CLOCKS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Americans go off daylight time at 2 a.m. on Sunday, they
will need to set their clocks _ and their bodies _ back an hour.
</P>
<P>
   To the rescue, Dr. Alfred Lewy, an expert on resetting
biological clocks and a professor at Oregon Health Sciences
University in Portland. Six months ago, Lewy proposed a system for
speeding the adjustment to daylight time. This time, he has a
regimen to help people shift their body clocks the other way,
relying on the body's two main zeitgebers, or time keepers _
sunlight and the hormone melatonin produced by a tiny gland at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lewy's prescription: First thing Saturday morning, take a tiny
dose of melatonin _ between 0.1 and 0.5 milligrams (100 to 500
micrograms) and repeat that for the next two or three mornings. (Do
not drive if the melatonin makes you sleepy.) On Sunday, avoid
sunlight for the first hour of daylight by wearing dark sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   The shift back to standard time, Lewy says, is tougher than
adjusting to daylight time because the earlier dawn is
counterproductive to the needed change in body time.

   Only gradually was lifelong slavery enacted and associated with
race, the latter because skin color easily grouped African blacks.
(Another myth: that slaves were the happy, passive people
frequently depicted in film and literature.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans in America'' tells in a straightforward, almost
somber manner the story of how some of our most influential leaders
were privately troubled by the hypocrisy of a country that
contradicted on a daily basis the declarations of its Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stories involves George Washington, whose marriage
to a well-to-do woman added 286 slaves to the 30 he already owned,
making him one of the 10 wealthiest planters in Virginia. (To
clothe each adult slave, the man who would become the first
president of the United States spent less than a dollar a year;
slave children often went naked.) But Washington's will stipulated
freedom for his slaves upon his death; he hoped, as narrator Angela
Bassett says, that ``he'd be able to do in death what he couldn't
in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence, owned 202 human beings as he wrote the very words,
``All men are created equal.'' (The narrator points out, almost
comically, that one of Jefferson's slaves was standing near his
side as he signed the declaration.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Remarkable document,'' former head of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell says of the Declaration of Independence
in ``Revolution,'' the third episode, airing Wednesday. ``The only
problem: It doesn't apply to black folks.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bagwell met with the press over the summer to introduce
this project, a questioner wanted to know if there will be a time
when we can ``put all this behind us?'' That answer isn't here, but
``Africans in America'' makes it clear that we've spent more time
as a people with slavery than we have without it, and failure to
address it as an ``American'' identity merely fuels the racially
adversarial roles that are well-entrenched in contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell exactly who'll sit through ``Africans in
America'' because few people, black or white, want to deal with its
crippling truths. I wonder if the opposite of Bagwell's
clear-the-air aims for this project will come true, if even those
deciding to watch this engaging documentary will wonder whether
``putting all this behind us'' is even possible.

   MONDAY: ``The Terrible Transformation'' (1607-1750). Examines
the origins of the forced African migration to America. ``Slavery
and freedom existed side by side in this country,'' says Cornell
University historian Margaret Washington. ``The issue is: Did it
always have to be that way? And the early history of America
indicates that it probably did not.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: ``Revolution'' (1750-1805). The episode explores the
lives of two individuals: George Washington and enslaved African
Venture Smith, both of whom struggle to define what it is to be
American as the new nation's Constitution codifies slavery.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: ``Brotherly Love'' (1776-1834). Explores the first 50
years of the new nation, focusing on Philadelphia's freedmen. But
slavery also expands into America's western frontier, and a
revolution in Haiti inspires slave rebellions here. Says a slave
owner, ``One cannot go to bed in the evening without the
apprehension of being massacred in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: ``Judgment Day'' (1831-1861). It takes more than two
centuries and the bloodiest war the nation had ever known, but the
democracy built on the profits of bondage crumbles. ``Can we exist
as a multi-racial society?'' Columbia University historian Eric
Foner asks. ``Can this be a society of equality between people of
different backgrounds, different colors, different races? Those
questions are still not really answered.''

MORRISON'S BOOK DESERVES AN OSCAR-WINNING INTERPRETATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on history, the odds are not in Toni Morrison's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Bad movies have too often ruined the reputations of good books:
``Endless Love,'' a fabulous Scott Spencer novel, is forever linked
with a horrendous movie version; the awful cinematic ``Bonfire of
the Vanities'' will forever tarnish the reputation of Tom Wolfe's
classic depiction of '80s excess. In recent times, perhaps only
``Terms of Endearment'' can be credited with cluing the public in
on a wonderful book. Larry McMurtry's novel was a sales flop before
Debra Winger died on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   So whether you worship Oprah Winfrey or wish she would remove
herself to a distant planet, cross your fingers that her celluloid
rendering of Morrison's fine novel ``Beloved'' works, that it
charms sufficient droves, so that one of America's finest authors
finally gets the universal readership she deserves. Morrison
already has a Pulitzer Prize to her credit, thanks to ``Beloved,''
and also a Nobel Prize in literature based on her body of work. But
many bookstores still stick her books on far shelves generically
reserved for ``African-American authors,'' and it is sad but fair
to say far more people have heard of her than have actually read
anything she's written.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved,'' an engagingly sad, somehow hopeful work about a
courageous former slave named Sethe and a mysterious wanderer
called Beloved, touched Winfrey's heart 11 years ago for the same
reason it charmed the Pulitzer judges and impressed the 60,000 who
bought it in hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   As is true of all Morrison's work, ``Beloved'' speaks to the
honor of honest struggle, and the potential of the most battered
human spirit. That it is set in 1873 means less than that the
characters in it are immediate friends whose best qualities readers
would like to discover in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Oprah decided to make ``Beloved'' into a movie, the
book was clearly Morrison's best-known. It behooves us to pray that
everyone newly introduced to Toni Morrison through this movie will
want to buy and read her other books. Good as ``Beloved'' is, it
isn't the best thing Morrison has written.
</P>
<P>
   That accolade probably belongs to ``Song of Solomon,'' published
in 1977, a decade before ``Beloved.'' Main characters Macon and
Milkman surpass Sethe and Beloved in both desperation and
determination. Theirs is a more modern tale of self-deception,
ultimately replaced by hope.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's other novels _ ``The Bluest Eye'' (1969), ``Sula''
(1973), ``Tar Baby'' (1981), ``Jazz'' (1992) and ``Paradise''
(1998) _ are all exceptional. So, too, is her play, ``Dreaming
Emmett,'' and her lecture-in-print ``Playing in the Dark: Whiteness
and the Literary Imagination.'' Though they have never admitted it,
it is possible, even likely, that the book publishing industry and
the chain mega-bookstores believe Morrison will never sell on a
Clancyish level because her work is so proudly, even defiantly,
``black.''
</P>
<P>
   It ought to be. Born in 1931 into a working-class Ohio family
(her father sometimes held three jobs at once), Morrison was taught
to take pride in her African-American heritage. Through high school
and college, the young woman known then as Chloe Wofford immersed
herself in the study of black culture. (She began calling herself
Toni, an abbreviation of her middle name, ``Anthony,'' because
``Chloe'' proved too difficult for many people to pronounce.)
</P>
<P>
   After taking her undergraduate degree from Howard University and
a master's degree at Cornell, Toni Wofford joined the faculty at
Houston's Texas Southern University and, after moving on to the
staff at Howard University, married Harold Morrison, a Jamaican
architect. The marriage produced two children and a divorce.
Morrison joined a writers' group for diversion, began working on a
story about a childhood friend who prayed for blue eyes, and
eventually took a job in Syracuse, N.Y., as an editor for Random
House.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Morrison joined Random House's top ranks of editors
in New York City. She helped prominent African-Americans like
Muhammad Ali, Angela Davis and Andrew Young complete their books _
and, in her spare time, finished ``The Bluest Eye,'' her first
novel.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is publishing history _ but not yet universally read.
If Oprah Winfrey's self-indulgent decision to cast herself in the
lead of ``Beloved'' results in a fabulous performance and an
acclaimed film, then maybe Toni Morrison will finally gain a
readership that matches her excellence as a writer. But if Oprah
turns ``Beloved'' into a film stepchild in the tradition of
``Endless Love'' or ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' and drives
potential readers away from Toni Morrison's books, no literary hell
will be hot enough to give Winfrey the roasting she'll deserve.

   While the Republican-dominated Congress wields Kenneth Starr's
report as its major weapon against President Clinton, the Democrats
may finally have its own key weapon in its battle against
impeachment -- Starr himself.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the 1994 conversations that independent counsel
Starr had with Paula Jones's lawyers has re-surfaced as a
potentially more legitimate issue against Starr than the
impeachment charges Starr has against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the upcoming impeachment inquiry potentially has
serious consequences for Clinton. However, the possible violations
against Starr for these previously undisclosed conversations could
destroy not only Starr's integrity, but the integrity of Starr's
four-year investigation, without which there would be no
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House, along with some Democratic members of
Congress and others familiar with the legal process, Starr had
these conversations with the Jones' attorney long before he sought
and received permission from Attorney General Janet Reno to widen
his Whitewater investigation to include allegations of sex and
cover-up by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If these conversations were disclosed by Starr to Reno during is
request, Reno most likely would have not permitted the expansion of
Starr's investigation to include Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, since it would have been a serious conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Since Starr did not disclose these conversations to Reno in
1994, he may have violated laws of confidentiality or conflict, or
both, for not making such required disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   As the media reported last week, Gilbert Davis, a member of the
Jones legal team, said he called Starr, before he became
independent counsel, at least several times to seek guidance as to
whether a sitting president was immune from lawsuits. Starr then
asserted that he was not.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, various news organizations revealed these
conversations in 1994 and again by the media in January this year.
But after National Public Radio rekindled the issue last week, the
Justice Department has begun to review these conversations, and
Starr himself issued a statement asserting that ``this office did
not mislead the Department of Justice regarding relevant facts
relation to its jurisdiction, or any expension.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Starr's conversations with Davis, Lewinsky was
under subpoena in Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against
Clinton, prompting Democratic members of the House Judiciary
Committee such as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to argue that Starr
``never should have been appointed'' to investigate the
Clinton-Lewinsky sexual relationship, which Clinton acknowledged
this summer to the Starr grand jury and to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to disclose these conversations to Reno in 1994 is one
of several serious complaints the Democrats have against Starr's
conduct as independent counsel. As some members of the House
Judiciary Committee further argue, Starr wired Linda Tripp, the
woman to whom Lewinsky discussed her relationship with Clinton,
before he had jurisdiction to do so. Starr, they further alleged,
allowed Lewinsky to be held hostage for hours before she could make
a phone call, tried to pressure her into wearing a wire against
Clinton, and had set perjury traps for the president.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Clinton's personal conduct with Lewinsky gave Starr the
ammunition to pursue charges against Clinton. If not for the
Lewinsky case, Starr, as his own report demonstrates, had nothing
else on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And, as most polls reflect, the president's sexual affair with
Lewinsky is not an impeachable offense, and certainly not worth the
more than $40 million he spent from the beginning of his Whitewater
investigation. Of course, to right wing Republicans it apparently
is worth whatever it costs if it results in destroying Clinton and
paving the way for the election of a right-wing Republican
president.
</P>
<P>
   What women's groups realize, and what other Clinton supporters
are becoming aware of, is that Starr's conduct, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's push for a full impeachment inquiry, and some GOP
efforts in congress to expand the hearings even beyond the contents
of Starr's report all appear to have the full backing of the right
wing element of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although the impeachment inquiry cannot be avoided or stopped,
Congress ought to take the time to investigate not only Clinton's
conduct, but Starr's conduct as an indepedent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the legal issues, Starr has done more damage to the
presidency with his conduct than Clinton's own conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tripp's possibly illegal wiretapping of Lewinsky
also should be moving along at least as fast as the Clinton
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Starr's conduct, which appeared to resemble a
1990s version of the Spanish Inquisition, the law which created the
office of independent counsel and gave Starr his virtually
unlimited authority must be re-written, or ended, so this nation
would never see its like again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has hurt himself personally with his relationship with
Lewisnky, but Starr has personally harmed this entire nation with
his sole partisan purpose of bringing Clinton down.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the Republican-dominated Congress continues to
try to embarass and ultimately destroy the Clinton presidency with
the impeachment inquiry, Attorney General Reno and the US Justice
Department should investigate Starr and if he found to have
violated the laws of his office, should be fired for ``good
cause'', as the law provides.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if Starr and the Republican Congress can go after
Clinton for what he did with Lewinsky, Reno certainly has more
cause to go after Starr for what he did to the law and to America
itself, and to help ensure that no one else will ever have the
authority to make a mockery of our democracy.

ETHNIC CHINESE IN CUBA REDISCOVER THEIR ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Julio Wong was just out of his teens in 1920 when he
boarded a steamship headed to a new world, leaving behind his wife
and infant son in China. He set sail with big dreams of striking it
rich in the sugar fields of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to find something here, make a fortune, then
return to China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For four years he labored under the tropical sun, eventually
opening a small restaurant, but he never made his fortune. Nor did
he ever make it back to China. Now 98, Wong is one of just a few
hundred Chinese-born Cubans living in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The roots that he and thousands of other Chinese set down in
this island nation live on in a younger generation of
Chinese-Cubans, who are rediscovering their past while forging
their own identity in the unique cultural amalgam of modern Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more Cuban'' than Chinese, said Maria del Carmen Kouw,
who is in her 40s. ``But because my father is Chinese, I want to
know his culture, his history.''
</P>
<P>
   Her heritage dates back 151 years, when the first documented
boatload of 200 Chinese men landed on the northern coast of Cuba
after a grueling voyage in which 100 died. As the African slave
trade wound down, plantation owners needed laborers to work sugar
and tobacco fields. About 100,000 Chinese were imported over the
next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although they earned a nominal pay, their contracts tied them to
eight years of work, making them essentially indentured servants.
Many intermarried with slaves of African descent.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wong, Chinese immigrants continued coming to the island in
search of prosperity. By the 1940s, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000
ethnic Chinese lived in Havana and other parts of Cuba. They
flocked to El Barrio Chino, once one of the most prosperous and
densely populated Chinatowns in all of Latin America. Occupying
about 44 blocks of central Havana in its heyday, the neighborhood
was full of Chinese-owned restaurants, theaters, bookstores,
gambling parlors and jewelry shops.
</P>
<P>
   By 1949, the new immigrants had an additional incentive to leave
China: political upheaval wrought by Mao's communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But by an ironic twist of fate, another revolution took place 10
years later _ this one led by Fidel Castro _ and everything
changed. The state took over private property, and by 1968 all
Chinese-owned businesses were nationalized. Most Chinese fled. El
Barrio Chino began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese natives left behind in Havana, the ones who lacked
the resources or political will to leave Cuba, are mostly in their
70s and 80s. They've integrated into local society, intermarried
with Cubans and lost touch with both family in China and much of
their cultural heritage. The community has seen no new immigration
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now the younger generation of Chinese-Cubans _ with a mix of
Spanish, Creole and African ancestry _ has launched a drive to
revitalize El Barrio Chino. With the blessing of the Havana
provincial government and a fresh coat of paint to spruce up some
buildings, the Chinatown Promotional Group was formed five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, the group opened a language school, revived
interest in martial arts and calligraphy and helped several small
Chinese restaurants open on El Cuchillo (the Knife), the tiny
street that cuts through the heart of El Barrio Chino. Last year,
the group held its first overseas Chinese festival, opening the
community's long-closed doors to Chinese from the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But some Chinese-Cubans are worried that the group's motivation
is more financial than cultural. Much of the emphasis in this
year's festival, held the first week of June, was on promoting a
fair selling Chinese-made products and attracting overseas
investment. Moreover, the revitalization project coincides with the
government's push to develop tourism as a way out of its economic
crisis, brought on by the withdrawal of support from the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In making Chinatown more attractive to visitors, Abel Fung,
editor of Kwong Wah Po, Cuba's only Chinese newspaper, wonders
whether its residents will benefit. ``I feel ashamed to see the old
Chinese men living in these kinds of conditions,'' Fung, 61, said.
``We should be inviting overseas Chinese to help us organize the
community, not take part in a festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelio Lee Huie, 81, once ran three successful restaurants in
Havana. But after the revolution, he had no choice but to go to
work for the government, helping run the businesses he once owned.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, relaxing in a rocking chair at Ming Chi
Tang, one of the family associations, he complained about his
government-issued ration card, which entitles him to one loaf of
bread and a small amount of sugar, eggs, cigarettes and other
supplies each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is no good,'' Lee said with a scowl. ``I can't do
business.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese left Cuba after Castro's revolution for this reason
and made their way to New York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Others were fervent supporters of the revolution. Moises Sio
Wong, the 12th child of Chinese immigrants, fought in the jungles
alongside Castro and Che Guevara when they were underground rebels.
He is now a general in the Cuban military. Earlier, Chinese-Cubans
joined in the uprisings against Spanish rule; their loyalty is
memorialized by a monument in downtown Havana.
</P>
<P>
   More typical were Gloria Tang's parents, who once ran a
neighborhood grocery store in Havana called Las Tres Chinitas. She
remembers those years as happy times, when the entire family worked
in the store fetching sugar or slaughtering fresh chickens for
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1962, their store operations were restricted, food was
rationed, and there were long lines for almost everything, she
recalls. Her father, who arrived in Cuba in the 1920s, decided to
take the family to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you leave that country, you leave everything behind,''
said Tang, who lives in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``It practically broke my
parents' heart. Even though they had a good home, they just closed
their eyes, climbed into the airplane and never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   The warming of official relations with Beijing, accelerated
after Castro's 1995 visit to China, has sparked interest from
Chinese state enterprises. In a show of friendship, China has
donated the materials and labor for a massive Chinese-style portico
to be built at the original entrance to El Barrio Chino on Calle
Dragones. At 62 feet wide, it will be the largest of its type in
the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was light, the bursting dawn of cosmic
creation. As the fireball of the Big Bang expanded and cooled,
though, the light faded away and darkness fell on the young
universe, by then little more than a formless sea of dark matter
flecked with traces of primordial hydrogen and helium and broken
only by scattered but fateful ripples.
</P>
<P>
   The universe had entered what astronomers characterize as its
dark age. Over a period from 300,000 years to about half a billion
years after the Big Bang the darkness persisted, denying to
astronomers any direct evidence of this time of momentous
transformation. Somehow this epoch gave birth to the architecture
of the modern universe and conditions that would eventually lead to
planets and life.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened in the dark age and how the light came on
again is an enduring and frustrating mystery. If there was no light
or other detectable radiation from the dark age, what was there to
see? Besides, no telescope could see back that far. Sir Martin
Rees, a cosmologist at Cambridge University in England, calls this
the ``most important unsolved problem in astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the obstacles, by looking deeper and deeper into
space and thus into time with new telescopes in Earth orbit and on
the ground, astronomers are making progress in their search for the
first light.
</P>
<P>
   They are at last catching sight of some of the earlier, if not
necessarily the first, galaxies _ each observation seems to put
their formation back earlier in time. Astronomers are also
gathering clues to what makes up most of the universe, the
mysterious dark matter, and how it and other dark-age conditions
gave birth to the first stars and the first galaxies. The new
knowledge is enabling scientists to test their theories and conduct
increasingly detailed computer simulations of cosmic history,
including the dark age.
</P>
<P>
   The dark age ended when light returned to the firmament with the
emergence of the first stars and then vast communities of stars
gravitationally bound in galaxies. ``Suddenly, the universe lit up
like a Christmas tree,'' said Dr. Abraham Loeb, a theoretical
astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere in the dark age, the transition from the universe's
initial simple state to its current complex state occurred,'' Loeb
said. ``It would be philosophically exciting to glimpse that
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Loeb recalled, he was one of a handful of
scientists studying the dark age and early star formation. But a
workshop on the subject at the University of Maryland last week
drew several dozen of the top observational and theoretical
astronomers. ``Now this has become a very hot topic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
released pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope of what
astronomers think are the most distant galaxies ever studied. These
galaxies probably formed in the first billion years of cosmic
history, or more than 12 billion years ago. Such estimates are
rough because they depend on cosmological models and chronological
yardsticks based on the universe's being about 13 billion years
old, which is controversial and subject to revision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have really made a step into new territory,'' said Dr.
Rodger I. Thompson, a University of Arizona astronomer who directed
the observations with the Earth-orbiting Hubble telescope's
near-infrared camera and spectrometer.
</P>
<P>
   Only an infrared camera can detect the faintest, most distant
galaxies. Dust in deep space obscures most visible light, more so
than radiation in the longer infrared wavelengths. And it is a
phenomenon of the expanding universe that the light emitted by a
galaxy gets stretched out to the redder and even near-infrared
wavelengths. At distances of vanishing visibility, the infrared
galactic light becomes the cosmic version of the Cheshire cat's
grin.
</P>
<P>
   The more distant galaxies have a higher expansion velocity and
thus a higher redshift. Since the age of the universe is still
uncertain, astronomers express cosmic distance, and thus age, in
terms of an object's redshift.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, it was all astronomers could do to see objects
at distances at a redshift of 1, encompassing vistas extending the
recent half of the age of the universe. When they picked up some
redshift-3 sightings, it was the equivalent of aviation's breaking
the sound barrier. In recent months, astronomers have broken the
redshift-5 barrier, when the universe was only one-tenth its
present age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing things at much higher redshifts than we once
thought possible,'' said Dr. John C. Mather, an astronomer at the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Focused on a tiny patch of sky, the Hubble's infrared camera
made a 36-hour exposure and saw more than 100 extremely faint
galaxies that were absent in previous visible-light pictures. At
least some of these galaxies are thought to have the highest
redshifts ever measured. Precise measurements may have to await the
development of more powerful telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting step into the infrared view of the
universe,'' said Dr. Alan M. Dressler, an astronomer at the
Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif. ``That's where we're
going to be looking for galaxy formation.''
</P>
<P>
   The first big break in distant observations came in 1995. That
was when Dr. Robert Williams, director of the Space Telescope
Science Institute in Baltimore, did what astronomers always do with
a new telescope: take the deepest picture they can. He directed
astronomers to concentrate the Hubble telescope on a single narrow
sector of the sky, a region virtually devoid of light as seen from
the ground. The telescope's visible-light camera took a 10-day-long
exposure, long enough to resolve objects at then-record distances.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble Deep Field, as the resulting multicolor picture is
called, gave astronomers a remarkable view of more than 3,000
galaxies, some at distances beyond redshift 4. They were astonished
to find such a dense population of galaxies so far away and so
early in time. It meant that astronomers had a way to go to reach
the time of galactic genesis, the frontier to the dark age.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, a team of astronomers led by Dr. Charles
C. Steidel of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena
developed a novel technique for detecting faraway galaxies using
the world's most powerful telescopes at Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
By now, the astronomers have confirmed the presence of 440
high-redshift galaxies existing just a few billion years after the
Big Bang. No objects at such distances had ever been examined in
such close detail.

NETWORKS FIND A WAY TO GET OUT OF NEWS-GATHERING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the longest time, the business of broadcast network
television news relied on its own set of accounting principles.
News ``shows,'' amazingly enough, were always profitable.
Thirty-minute newscasts like ``The CBS Evening News'' made money
even as audience share declined. News ``gathering,'' sad to say,
was always unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, at the end of the fiscal year, network news
executives would argue that the only way to increase the
profitability of the news shows was to maintain or increase
spending on news gathering. Thus they would protect the pipeline
while maintaining the fiction that the ``shows'' made money. Every
so often, as a token offering to the concept of fiscal
responsibility, the head of news gathering was axed for failing to
stay within budget.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, network executives were happy to oblige this
arrangement. Some of them actually liked news and thought it
important. Most of them looked at their news divisions as strategic
loss leaders. News fulfilled the Federal Communication Commission's
``public service'' requirement. In return, networks were granted a
license to print money from sitcoms and other entertainment
programming. Not a bad trade. In addition, network news divisions
kept Washington from getting any ideas about changing the deal. No
senator or congressman really wanted to cross CBS, NBC, or ABC
News. From a corporate point of view, that kind of leverage was
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 1980s, network television chieftains were
blindsided by the unexpected and explosive popularity of cable
television. News executives didn't see it coming because they
simply couldn't imagine that such a cowboy culture could pose any
kind of threat to their franchise. Cable television conventions in
the early 1980s were like the bar scene from ``Star Wars.'' And
leading this motley crew of renegades was Ted Turner, the redneck
``Mouth of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   News executives were especially dismissive of Turner and his
upstart Cable News Network. They called CNN ``Chicken Noodle
News.'' Until one day, everyone in the business was out at the
Radio and Television News Directors Association convention in Las
Vegas, watching the ``Today Show,'' listening to Bryant and Jane
happy chat through the last hour. That was nice, except no one at
NBC News had bothered to update the news segments for the Pacific
Time Zone. Suddenly, a war rumor swept through the crowd and every
television set switched to CNN, which was providing live coverage
of the British invasion of the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Reagan era, network management changed hands.
Capital Cities bought ABC. General Electric bought NBC. Larry Tisch
bought CBS. And the layoffs began almost immediately. NBC News,
which had a staff of roughly 1,700, saw its head count reduced to
1,150. Bureaus were closed or consolidated. Budgets were trimmed.
All three network news divisions tried to reinvent themselves for
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire new revenue streams, news magazine shows were
invented. CBS created ``48 Hours,'' ``West 57th Street,'' and most
recently, ``60 Minutes 2.'' NBC came up with ``Dateline,'' which
now runs nearly every night. ABC created ``Prime Time Live,'' which
has since merged into a series of magazine shows called ``20/20.''
In addition, ABC and NBC invested heavily in cable television
ventures with an eye toward spreading the cost of news gathering
over a number of channels. MSNBC is perhaps the best example of
this kind of venture.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the numbers still didn't work. News gathering continued to
bleed all over network balance sheets. And so another wave of
layoffs commenced. CBS News announced last week it would cut 120
staff positions and close bureaus around the world. Earlier this
year, NBC News announced it would undertake dramatic cost-cutting
measures. ABC News is expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of network news was officially announced Wednesday,
at a Time Warner third-quarter earnings meeting in New York. There,
according to The Washington Post, Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin
said that all three broadcast networks ``have approached CNN about
various news-gathering relationships. The CBS talks, which have
been reported before, are the most comprehensive. ABC and NBC have
discussed sharing international offices and using CNN footage to
cover international stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the three broadcast networks spend roughly $120
million to $140 million on news gathering. Subcontracting this work
to CNN would dramatically reduce those costs. In the case of CBS,
subcontracting news gathering to CNN would increase the network's
profitability by $20 million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it would also mean that CBS News, once the crown jewel of
broadcast television, would cease to exist as a news gathering
organization. It would instead become a news packaging organization
and distribution channel. This would have been unthinkable 30 years
ago. It is all but certain today.

 UNDATED: close detail.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steidel's observations are made by the ultraviolet ``dropout''
technique. Ultraviolet light from a remote galaxy tends to be
absorbed by hydrogen within the galaxy itself and between there and
Earth. The more distant a galaxy, the more hydrogen its light
encounters in the intervening space, and thus the more its
ultraviolet emissions are dimmed. By seeking objects that show up
in green and red filters but not in ultraviolet, the astronomers
detected galaxies with redshifts from 2.2 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble Deep Field and Steidel's snapshots have given
theorists much to think about. The early galaxies appear to be
smaller, more concentrated and less regular than today's galaxies.
And they are ``as strongly clustered in the early universe as they
are today,'' Steidel said.
</P>
<P>
   Small, irregular galaxies, cosmologists say, fit their models in
which structure in the universe evolved from the bottom up, and not
from the top down. That is, galaxies presumably started as small
collections of stars and these merged to form much larger objects,
instead of stars starting out in extraordinarily vast congregations
and then fragmenting into galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small, young objects we find are still in the process of
formation,'' Loeb said, explaining why the findings seem to support
a growing consensus in favor of the bottom-up interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The observations also suggest that cosmologists are on the right
track with their ideas about the nature and amount of cosmic mass.
Years of studying the rotations of galaxies near and far have
convinced scientists that there is much more to the universe than
what they can see. Galaxies would have disintegrated long ago if
they were not held together by more gravity than ordinary matter
can account for. Most of the universe's mass, maybe as much as 99
percent, must be in some mysterious ``dark'' form.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Before the Beginning,'' published this year by Perseus
Books, Rees of Cambridge writes, ``Clearly we will never understand
galaxies properly until we understand the dominant stuff whose
gravity binds them together.''
</P>
<P>
   The favored hypothesis predicts the existence of cold dark
matter, exotic and as yet unknown subatomic elementary particles
that emerged from the Big Bang. They are so small and slow that
they virtually never interact with each other or with ordinary
matter except through gravity and thus produce no detectable
radiations. Yet they could have supplied the decisive gravitational
force to marshal ordinary matter into galaxies and clusters of
galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   It all began, according to theory, with tiny ripples in the
cosmic microwave background radiation, the detectable afterglow of
the Big Bang that is the source of much knowledge about the
universe's first 300,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   These slight fluctuations in radiation, confirmed and plotted by
COBE, the Cosmic Background Explorer spacecraft, in the early
1990s, are caused by irregularities in the density of matter in the
Big Bang. Such clumps of dark matter would have attracted ordinary
matter to create larger clumps and set in motion agglomerations
leading to stars and galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated simulations based on the COBE findings and
many other physical data and assumptions have showed that a
universe dominated by hot dark matter, an alternative idea invoking
known fast-moving particles called neutrinos, should have resulted
in a top-down creation in which much larger conglomerations of
matter would form first and then break up into galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario, however would result in a much longer dark age
than now appears to be the case. Cold dark matter, on the other
hand, should have formed galaxies on small scales and at a
relatively early time. Which is just what the new observations are
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   In February, astronomers announced the first detection of a
redshift-5 object, a young galaxy that existed when the universe
was only 8 percent of its present age. They had crossed the
frontier into the first billion years of the universe, with the
boundary to the dark age still not in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Working at Keck Observatory, a team led by Dr. Arjun Dey of
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore measured a redshift of 5.34
for the early galaxy, meaning that it was shining 820 million years
after the Big Bang (also assuming an age of 13 billion years for
the universe).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know what to look for, I'm sure this record will
be broken in a matter of months,'' Dey remarked at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, in May astronomers at the University of Hawaii and
Cambridge University reported sighting a more distant galaxy with a
5.64 redshift. This pushed back galactic discovery about 60 million
years. One of the discoverers, Dr. Esther M. Hu, said astronomers
were on the verge of seeing galaxies back to about 500 million
years after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb noted two intriguing clues that light had returned to the
universe at least that early, perhaps at redshifts beyond 10. Both
came from observations of light from quasars, cores of distant
galaxies and the brightest objects in the universe. Because the
quasar light passes through clouds of hydrogen gas before it
reaches Earth, it serves as a probe of the cosmic environment out
to great distances.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the quasar light is not absorbed by the gas, Loeb
said, is evidence that nearly all of the hydrogen atoms in deep
cosmic space have been ionized, their electrons stripped away by
ultraviolet radiation. Such radiation could have come only from a
large population of stars at redshifts beyond that of the quasars.
</P>
<P>
   Other quasar studies yielded the second clue: some of the
distant gas clouds contained not only hydrogen but heavy elements
like carbon, which are produced only by the nuclear furnaces inside
stars and scattered through space when stars explode at the end of
their lives. So there had been stars living and dying long before
these early galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fainter and fainter objects and getting
smarter and smarter each month,'' said Dressler of the Carnegie
Observatories. ``But we've pushed just about as far as we can
expect from today's telescopes, even the Keck or the Hubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers are in the early stages of planning a more powerful
replacement for the orbiting Hubble telescope. Called the Next
Generation Space Telescope, it is expected to be launched a million
miles into space in 2007 and be able to detect infrared emissions
from objects 400 times fainter than those being studied with any of
today's ground-based and orbiting infrared telescopes. Its mirror
will be nearly three times larger than Hubble's.
</P>
<P>
   With the new telescope thus able to gather so much more light,
Mather of the Goddard space center said, astronomers in exposure
times as short as two weeks should ``see as far as you can imagine
seeing.'' They should be able to make out galaxies with redshifts
of 10 or more.
</P>
<P>
   That might be just enough to observe the first stars and
galaxies and understand more about how the early universe passed
its long night of darkness organizing itself to bring form and
light everywhere.

DRAG QUEENS HAVE A GOOD HAIR DAY FOR CANCER PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The overlapping interests of cancer patients and
drag queens may not be immediately obvious, but the connection is
wigs: cancer patients need them and drag queens have them.
</P>
<P>
   So the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the most outlandish drag
queen group in what may be the drag queen capital of the world,
held a wig drive Sunday to benefit the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   With three performances in San Francisco, the group collected
about 100 wigs for the society's ``Look Good, Feel Better''
program, which serves several hundred women a year in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came to Sister Phyllis Stein of the Sisters of
Perpetual Indulgence last year when his mother started treatment
for breast cancer, which caused most of her hair to fall out. After
hearing she got a wig from the American Cancer Society in her
hometown of Syracuse, N.Y., Stein decided to call the San Francisco
chapter to check into its wig situation.
</P>
<P>
   He found out it was in dire need of wigs and has even had to
turn people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, wait a minute, this is San Francisco!'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   And a fund-raiser was born.
</P>
<P>
   At the first wig drive last year, more than $1,400, 40 wigs and
many scarves were donated. Stein used about $1,000 in donations to
buy more wigs from a wholesale dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Look Good, Feel Better'' program offers services, all
free, at five locations in San Francisco. It gives women an
opportunity not only to select a wig or turban but also to meet a
cosmetologist to learn about other changes that may result from
cancer, such as skin discoloration or the loss of eyebrows and
eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   To be diagnosed with cancer, then lose your hair on top of that
because of chemotherapy, ``it's a loss of control of your sense of
self and body,'' said Agnes Moorehead, who oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
   Drag performer Patty Mae, dolled up in a black sequin dress and
poofy blond tresses, donated about six wigs Sunday from his supply
of about 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw in a couple that I knew a good wash would be able to
fluff them up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all wig donors were drag queens. One woman dropped off a
garbage bag containing 56 freshly-washed wigs and rushed off,
looking more than a little stunned at Stein's elaborate makeup,
black cocktail dress and flowing nun's habit.

FREE SPEECH IS ANTIDOTE TO CAMPUS QUASI-APARTHEID
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In olden days, ``before the oppression began,'' as Alan Kors and
Harvey Silverglate put it, there existed at the University of
Pennsylvania an institution called Van Pelt College House. This was
a residence in which diversity flourished _ real diversity, not the
sour quasi-apartheid common at American universities today. Van
Pelt House brought together instructors and students of every
stripe _ ``evangelicals and gay activists, Catholic Newman Center
members and radical feminists, conservatives and revolutionaries,
blacks and whites of all persuasions, including the first few
presidents of the militant Black Student League and blacks majoring
in finance at the Wharton School.''
</P>
<P>
   What the residents of Van Pelt experienced, Kors and Silverglate
write in a blistering new book, ``The Shadow University'' (Free
Press), was the authentic ``discovery of difference'' that once
made the best colleges incubators of tolerance and broadmindedness.
``Its members moved each year from distance to conversation, and
from mutual suspicions to various degrees of understanding, and,
usually, to touchingly kind relationships. People offended each
other all the time, but they learned to talk to each other and to
understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Try to find a Van Pelt House at Penn, or anywhere else, in the
1990s. Rarely are students today encouraged to view each other as
individuals. They are pushed instead to divide themselves by race,
sex, and ethnicity. Higher education once offered undergraduates
the time and tools they needed to shape their own identities; now
undergraduates get their identities handed to them as they arrive
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   At Smith College, freshmen in 1990 were provided with handbooks
from the Office of Student Affairs. These began with a definition
of ``ethnic identity'' and went on to supply a glossary of
``oppression'': Ableism, Ageism, Antisemitism, Classism,
Ethnocentrism, Heterosexism, Lookism, Racism, Religious
Discrimination, Sexism. These terms would prove valuable, the new
students were told, ``as groups of people begin the process of
realizing that they are oppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only at Smith that administrators are engaged so
tendentiously in bringing students to political enlightenment.
Incoming Columbia freshmen a few years ago were lectured on ``the
archetypes and stereotypes in American society that support racism
and prejudice''; they then gathered to hear three students _ one
gay, one Asian, one black _ discuss their encounters with bigotry
and discrimination. Dartmouth's mandatory orientation dealt with
what the assistant dean of freshmen termed ``the various forms of
`isms': sexism, racism, classism.'' For newcomers at Bowdoin, there
was a program snappily called ``Defining Diversity: Your Role in
Racial-Consciousness Raising and Cross-Cultural Social Enhancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kors, a professor of history, is on most issues a conservative;
Silverglate, a noted attorney, is a liberal. What they share is a
commitment to freedom, especially freedom of speech and conscience.
The two men, who were undergraduates at Princeton in the 1960s,
have watched with alarm the transformation of US campuses from
places of robust expression to grim zones of censorship and
repression. When they were students, the Free Speech movement was
germinating. Today free speech is out, and speech codes are in.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do universities prize the uninhibited clash of ideas
and opinions. On campuses from sea to shining sea, political
correctness is the ruling orthodoxy and The Right Not To Be
Offended trumps every consideration. The authors describe case
after case of professors and students silenced, punished, or exiled
for daring to say things somebody deemed offensive. Some of the
episodes are notorious _ a chapter is devoted to the shocking
``water buffalo'' inquisition at the University of Pennsylvania.
Others are little known. Consider the fate of Don Staples, a
professor of film at the University of North Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``At a university forum on ways to improve the experience of
minority students, a black undergraduate complained that courses
contained inadequate materials by minorities. Staples replied that
his own course incorporated a large number of contributions by
black filmmakers, but that minority students in his class still had
poor attendance. For that remark, the university suspended Staples
for one week. Chancellor Alfred F. Hurley (explained) that while
free speech would be protected, `racism will not be tolerated.'''
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? In 1993, a motion was introduced at a faculty
meeting of Hampshire College in Amherst. It affirmed ``the right of
all members of the college community to the free expression of
views in speech or in art, and the right of all members of the
community to hear the expression of any views'' and condemned ``the
censorship or prohibition of non-criminal speech.'' The motion was
defeated, 26-21. That bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation that does not educate in freedom,'' Kors and
Silverglate warn, ``will not survive in freedom, and will not even
know when it has lost it.'' All tyrannies eventually crumble; so
will the tyranny of thought in American higher education. But
between now and eventually, how many free minds and spirits will be
crushed? ``The Shadow University'' sends up an unignorable flare,
but it may be a long time before help arrives.

AT MATT SHEPARD'S FUNERAL, THE CLEANSING SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ Matthew Shepard's beating death became the week's
media event. And Shepard became a national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred reporters gathered in front of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church Friday in order to tell the nation about the funeral of this
young gay man who had been pistol-whipped and tortured and strung
up like a scarecrow on a buck-and-rail fence.
</P>
<P>
   They came to report on the anti-homosexual religious louts from
Kansas and Texas who picketed outside the church with placards
stating ``God hates fags.'' They came to see if Wyoming is really
only ``guns, chew and brutality.'' The Easterner's stereotype of
the West: Marlboro Man turned psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's family and friends came to mourn the death of a young
man whose life was ended so abruptly and brutally. They will miss
the person, his dreams, his smile, his touch, his presence, his
passion for life.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Shepard has become a symbol of the victimized
homosexual _ the reason he was chosen for the deadly assault. His
killers saw only a one-dimensional Shepard, Shepard the queer. The
nation now sees him as the one-dimensional gay victim.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,000 others from Wyoming and surrounding states
flew or drove into Casper to mourn for Matt Shepard, the symbol.
They did not know Shepard, the person. They learned from media
reports that he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Some mourned because they, too, are homosexuals. They mourned
not merely because they understand the fear Shepard must have felt
in his last hours, they mourned for themselves. They know his fate
could be theirs _ living in a society that treats gays and lesbians
as deviants, as pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   Some mourned because of their sense of common humanity. What
befell Shepard befalls all of us _ gay or straight.
</P>
<P>
   Others mourned for the brutal death of a young man _ in a way,
to help ease the guilt some Wyoming people feel about this
travesty.
</P>
<P>
   In three days, the Casper newspaper received nearly 300 letters
and e-mails from all over the world concerning Shepard's death.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from individuals outraged by the way Shepard was killed.
The image of him tied to a fence like a scarecrow and left to die _
imbedded in the psyche like a Jungian archetype.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from gay and lesbian advocacy groups calling for Wyoming
to pass hate crime legislation and join the ``civilized world'' _
as if it would cure America's addiction to violence. Texas has
numerous hate-crime statutes, yet it was in that state recently
where some white thugs tied a black man behind a pick-up and
dragged him until his body disintegrated into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crime legislation does not stem the violence that arises
out of hate and fear. Not even murder charges stop these vicious
assaults. Hate crime legislation is a symbolic response to the
death of Shepard, the symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Letters lambasting the people of Wyoming. Or filled with the
pain of identifying with Shepard. Or full of sorrow for the human
condition. For our stupidities and prejudices and murderous hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Letters arrived denouncing statements made by anti-homosexual
church groups.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the courage of a fine young Casper reporter
Jason Marsden who, in response to his friend Shepard's death,
writes a column for his newspaper to reveal his own homosexuality.
And calls his grandparents to tell them before they read it or
heard about it. And explains it to his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   In a climate of brutality, he has made himself a target.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtapose Marsden's courage over the sordid, hateful fax
messages from the members of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka,
Kan., who call themselves Christians: ``Fag Matt in Hell,'' ``No
tears for queers,'' ``Fags burn in Hell.'' Some of this
congregation came to Casper to insult Shepard's parents by
picketing with placards across the street from where the funeral
service was held. Purposefully ignoring the deep sorrow his mother
and father suffer and their need for privacy, ignoring common
decency, ignoring the dignity that each person deserves in death,
at least.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the media's focus, a few anti-gay church-goers from the
God Said Ministries of Mt. Enterprise, Texas, joined the Topeka
picketers with their own brand of Christian hate.
</P>
<P>
   And snow fell. Wet snow. All day. A veil of silence descended,
surrounding the mourners and the demonstrators. White silence. To
clean the air. To wrap us in privacy. The kind of silence that
cousins sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And the picketers of hate left for shelter or dry cars or motel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old man with all the promise of youth tied to a fence
and left to die, propped up like a scarecrow. And now the snow.

   SEMICON _ Another problem with the chip business slump is that
the payoffs in billions of dollars of investments equipment makers
have made in new equipment are even further away. They had planned
that chip companies would be buying equipment that makes chips on
bigger wafers. That would enable chipmakers to make better chips
more cheaply. With the slump, however, the chipmakers are holding
on on buying the new equipment. The Semicon Southwest convention in
Austin this week has cancelled its session on the bigger wafers.

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ Capitalism is a simple, fair economic system: It
rewards good companies and crushes bad ones. But freewheeling
capitalism also can be brutal. Good people who work hard, make
excellent products and sell them at fair prices can get pulverized
in the unforgiving marketplace. Ask any American steelworker. Today
they are being threatened by vicious competition from foreign steel
makers. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of steelworkers in the South
could get laid off next year; in the states surrounding the Great
Lakes, the toll could be much worse. (Geewax, Atlanta

   CYBERSCENE _ The World Wide Web has made the world smaller and
friendlier. And, nowadays, it is certainly easier to chat with
friends from Brazil in the morning and acquaintances from Australia
at night. But all this worldwide chat and e-mail has also added
some confusion. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   TECHNOBUDDY _ There are at least 12 ways to kill your computer.
In the early days of PCs, I spent a lot of time urging people to be
experimental and reassuring them that nothing they could do to
their PC _ short of giving it the 10-foot drop test _ could wreck
it. Reassurances like that were needed because, in those days,
operating a PC was something akin to being the first on your block
to have an automobile back in the days of the Model T.(Husted,

   TECH-MEDIA _ Torn between buying a new PC or upgrading the one

   MAC-REPORT _ Virtual PC is one of the most amazing pieces of

   NETWATCH _ If you think merely watching hip TV shows makes you
hip, think again. These days, even the most minor of shows has its

Gateway is offering three different models. (Ghirardini, Atlanta

 By ABIGAIL ZUGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The birth control pill is pushing 40, and like many another
veteran of the 1960s, it never looked so good. It is the Volkswagen
Beetle of drugs _ a sleekly remodeled version of the 1960
prototype, housed in a box full of old associations, but completely
reconfigured inside and intended for a brand-new market.
</P>
<P>
   Today's pills use hormone doses that are a small fraction of
what they once were. While not utterly risk-free, they are far
safer than the original versions and remain among the most
effective forms of birth control on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, surveys show that even women too young to remember
the 1970 Congressional hearings that widely exposed the pill's
health risks continue to worry about its dangers. About one in four
women who take it say they stop because of side effects, a poll
commissioned by the Association of Reproductive Health
Professionals found last year.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors are now endorsing the pill with increasing
enthusiasm. Side effects can be tempered by switching among some
two dozen different formulations now available, they say. Further,
when women are carefully screened for problems, like smoking and
blood clotting disorders, that exacerbate the pill's dangers, its
risks are small while its benefits extend far beyond contraception
to ease a host of gynecologic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many women for whom the pill is just so
wonderful,'' said Dr. Anita Nelson, an associate professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA and the director of a large
women's clinic there. ``And hopefully a woman will get some other
benefit from it than just contraception.''
</P>
<P>
   The pill remains the most popular nonsurgical form of birth
control in the country, used by about one in six women of
child-bearing age. Last month the Food and Drug Administration
extended its contraceptive range still further, approving a
four-pill emergency kit, which can help prevent pregnancy up to
three days after unprotected intercourse has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The pill interferes with conception from several different
angles. The estrogen and progestin that most contain stop the
pituitary gland from releasing the hormones that prompt the ovaries
to release eggs. Progestin also thickens the mucus at the uterus
entrance so that sperm cannot penetrate, and it thins the lining of
the uterus so that an egg cannot adhere and develop there. It is
quite effective with a 3 percent failure rate during the first year
of use.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its potency, the pill can no longer offer women the
carefree sexual freedom it once symbolized: It provides no
protection against sexually transmitted diseases without condom or
spermicide backup.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dr. Nelson said, the pill's long-term safety means that now
it can offer women other freedoms instead, like freedom from the
constraints of menstruation itself.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have known for years that if a woman skips the seven
dummy tablets in most 28-day pill packs _ ordinarily taken to
induce menstruation _ and simply takes 21-day courses back to back,
menstrual flow can be postponed for months, she said. This
technique has been used safely for as long as a year in women with
debilitating menstrual complications like migraine headaches or
endometriosis, which may result in severe pelvic pain and copious
blood loss in during menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the word out on how to do this,'' Dr. Nelson
said. ``It's perfectly safe. Athletes going to a competition, women
going to meetings _ there's no reason to have a period when you're
midair over Frankfurt, having to try to remember the word for
tampons in German.''
</P>
<P>
   Another newly appreciated use of the pill is its ability to free
older women from the symptoms that may accompany a rocky transition
to menopause. Because the early versions of the pill were most
dangerous in older women, they were generally never used after age
35. In women who do not smoke, however, the new versions are often
prescribed through age 50 and even beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several encouraging therapeutic uses of the pill in
older women,'' said Dr. Maida Taylor, a gynecologist at the
University of California at San Francisco. One is to treat a
condition she calls ``perimenopausal chaos'' in which women who are
nearing menopause become the victims of wildly erratic hormone
bursts, swinging between high levels of estrogen one month and low
levels the next with sweats, ho flashes, mood swings and general
misery that fit no predictable pattern.
</P>
<P>
   These women still need contraception, which the pill can
provide, while it also smoothes out the fluctuating hormone levels
and lets them function normally. Then, when menopause occurs,
hormone doses can be tapered from those that provide contraception
down to the lower doses that are used for hormone replacement in
postmenopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   The pill may also help older women avoid osteoporosis, Dr.
Taylor said. Women lose roughly 10 percent of their bone mass
between ages 35 and 50 even though they are not overtly
estrogen-deficient during that time, she said. ``Women who take
oral contraceptives from age 35 to 50 arrive at menopause with that
much more bone mass, and that translates into a significant
reduction in bone fractures later in life,'' Dr. Taylor said.
``It's like arriving at retirement with 10 percent more money in
your Keogh.''
</P>
<P>
   Other noncontraceptive benefits that recent studies have
associated with long-term use of the pill include reduced rates of
ovarian cancer and malignant cancers of the lining of the uterus,
and possibly also decreased rates of benign tumors of the breasts
and the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   But, the benefits still exact a price. The new pill is still
accompanied by some old health risks, including a danger of blood
clots forming in the veins of the legs (which, if they move to the
lungs, may cause serious complications or death), and an overall
increased risk of heart attacks and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks and strokes, however, now seem to be provoked
exclusively in women already at risk, especially those with high
blood pressure or who smoke, said Dr. Leon Speroff, a professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland and an international authority on the pill.
</P>
<P>
   For women without other risks, he said, taking the pill appears
to hold no added danger of these complications, although it does
mandate that they be honest with their doctor about smoking habits
and have regular general check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, although women who take the pill suffer blood clots
in the legs about three times more often than those who do not, the
risk is greater in women who are predisposed to blood clots for
other reasons, like prolonged bed rest or a family history.
</P>
<P>
   Although many breast cancers are apparently nourished by
estrogen, the relationship between the pill and breast cancer is
complex. A study of more than 50,000 women published in the journal
Lancet two years ago found that breast cancer was diagnosed
slightly more often in women who had used the pill during their
teens and 20s. But it was diagnosed earlier and had a better
prognosis than in other women, making the overall impact of the
pill on their health extremely difficult to assess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who have a pre-existing tumor have an accelerated growth
of that tumor because of hormone exposure. It's picked up earlier,
and they actually do better,'' Speroff said.
</P>
<P>
   In the balance, the pill of the 1990s is ``very good, very safe,
lots of benefits. It's a good product,'' he said.

   ``Man seeketh in society comfort,'' Francis Bacon asserted, but
you could have fooled Robert Suhoza. Gatherings of his fellow
humans have rarely inspired in Suhoza a sense of consolation and
well being. Usually, it has been more like sweating, heart-pounding
dread.
</P>
<P>
   Stand up and give a speech to a group of co-workers? He would
prefer to be trampled by elephants. Make small talk at a cocktail
party? Just go ahead and shoot him. Introduce himself to a room
full of strangers? Maybe he'll just come back some other time.
</P>
<P>
   Suhoza, a 53-year-old Connecticut businessman, has lived with
this social unease since childhood, fretting and worrying, afraid
he will say something stupid, afraid people will see how nervous he
is. At work, he dreaded meetings and sat quietly, praying he would
not have to speak. He wanted to read a passage of Scripture at his
niece's wedding, but in the end had to tell her that he just could
not do it.
</P>
<P>
   Even answering the phone seemed at times an insurmountable task:
He knew he should pick up the receiver, but he was paralyzed by not
knowing who was on the other end, or what the caller wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Suhoza finally sought help at the Yale University
Psychological Services Clinic. To his surprise, he learned that his
plight had a name _ social phobia or social anxiety disorder, a
condition attracting increased attention from mental health
experts, in part because of the availability of new drug treatments
and novel brain-imaging technologies that are yielding clues to the
disorder's underlying biology.
</P>
<P>
   And while Suhoza often felt he was the only human on the planet
with such a disabling affliction, it turns out he has lots of
company. National surveys indicate that 1 in every 8 Americans meet
the diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder at some point
in their lives, making it the third most common psychiatric
condition. More women suffer from social phobia than men, studies
show, though men are more likely to seek treatment, perhaps because
society deems extreme shyness in males less acceptable than in
females.
</P>
<P>
   Descriptions of the socially anxious appear throughout history.
Hippocrates wrote of a man who ``through bashfulness, suspicion and
timorousness will not be seen abroad''; Charles Darwin, exploring
the evolutionary roots of blushing, described a dinner party given
in honor of a very shy man. Rising to return the thanks of the
guests, the man began his speech, gesticulating for emphasis as he
went along but never actually uttering a single word. ``His
friends, perceiving how the case stood, loudly applauded the
imaginary bursts of eloquence, whenever his gestures indicated a
pause.'' The man later remarked to a friend, Darwin wrote, that he
thought the speech had gone quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last two decades, however, have researchers begun to
investigate social anxiety disorder in any depth, or to distinguish
it fully from other psychiatric conditions in which anxiety
features prominently, like panic disorder and agoraphobia. The
diagnosis first appeared in the 1980 edition of the official
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; before that,
all phobias were lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists divide those who suffer from social phobia into
two groups. Some, like Suhoza, experience pervasive anxiety that is
triggered by a multitude of social situations and interferes with
their daily lives. For others, the fear is more specific: They may
be bold as roosters at cocktail parties but fall to pieces when
they have to deliver a speech or perform in public.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Liebowitz, a Columbia University psychiatrist and
director of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at New York Psychiatric
Institute, said he has treated corporate vice presidents so
frightened of public speaking that they consider abandoning their
careers just to avoid the podium, and concert musicians who, when a
performance looms, spend the hours leading up to it shaking and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these two groups is a large, if unquantified, number of
people who are shy and socially uncomfortable, but not to the
degree that it impairs their lives. Still, they feel much more at
ease at a party after the first glass of Cabernet. Or they banter
confidently with colleagues while running an internal monologue
that goes something like ``OK, here comes that new guy from
Department 12. I better say something witty. Jeez, that was stupid.
Now he probably thinks I'm a boob.''
</P>
<P>
   Some degree of social anxiety, researchers point out, is not
only normal, but essential. ``If you've never been concerned about
the opinion of others, then you've never been an adolescent,'' says
Dr. Richard Heimberg, director of Temple University's Adult Anxiety
Clinic and developer of a widely used group therapy treatment for
social phobia. ``And if you don't think about it a bit every day,
you're probably not a very sensitive person.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, like the fear of snakes, heights or deep water, social
anxiety probably has its roots in natural selection. Most animal
species count among their ranks individuals who are unusually bold
or extremely timid, and a growing body of evidence suggests these
temperamental differences are largely genetic.
</P>
<P>
   In nature, temerity has obvious payoffs: Intrepid animals
explore new territory. They fight their way to the top of the
dominance hierarchy, and are first to get the food _ and to snag a
desirable mate. But timidity also has its advantages. The fearful,
though they may rank lower in the social order, know when to defer
to the top brass, and are less likely to be killed picking fights
with neighborhood toughs. A variety of coping strategies,
scientists speculate, may allow adaptation to changing
environments, favoring species survival.
</P>
<P>
   Research on timidity in animals is proving fruitful to
scientists probing the biological underpinnings of social phobia in
people. Studies of mice and of monkeys bred to be timid, for
example, indicate submissiveness may be associated with
abnormalities in a number of messenger chemicals in the brain, in
particular a neurotransmitter called dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies using a three-dimensional imaging technique
called Spect (or single photon emission computed tomography), which
allows measurement of chemical structures in the brain, suggest
dopamine may be involved in humans, as well. A 1997 Spect study by
Finnish researchers found that patients diagnosed with social
phobia showed abnormalities in the brain's dopamine system in
comparison to normal subjects. And in a small, still uncompleted
Spect study at Columbia University, Dr. Franklin Schneier,
Liebowitz and their colleagues have found indications that socially
phobic patients may have fewer brain dopamine receptors.
Antidepressants that affect brain dopamine levels have proven
effective in alleviating symptoms of social phobia; but so have
newer antidepressants, like Paxil, that alter levels of another
neurotransmitter, serotonin. And scientists are still a long way
from knowing how such brain chemicals act separately or together to
influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Social phobia and shyness overlap, yet to what extent is still
unclear. In humans, shyness appears to have a strong genetic
component. In a series of now classic studies, Jerome Kagan, a
Harvard University psychologist, and his colleagues, found that 10
percent to 15 percent of children begin life with what Kagan calls
``a temperamental bias to be shy, timid and fearful,'' a propensity
identifiable even in infancy. Such ``inhibited'' children become
unusually quiet when faced with unfamiliar adults, hang back in
groups of peers they do not know, and even at four months are more
reactive and more irritable in response to stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of these children grow into adults classified by
psychiatrists as socially phobic. Certainly, many people with
social phobia remember being inordinately shy in childhood. A
35-year-old electrical engineer who sought help at The Shyness
Clinic in Portola Valley, Calif., for example, still winces
recalling a classroom show-and-tell in nursery school. She had
brought in a deer's antler, discovered behind her house in the Los
Angeles hills. ``I remember repeating over and over in my head, `I
found it in my backyard,''' she said, ``but I just couldn't say
anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   A 38-year-old social worker remembers walking to school at the
age of 11 as ``like going into a war.'' She added, ``I felt like
people were judging me. I don't know how I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   But a genetic predisposition toward shyness is just that; in a
human child the contribution of biology is shaped, modified, and
sometimes entirely contravened by the power of environment. Of
Kagan's inhibited children, about 70 percent outgrew their extreme
shyness by the age of 7, though they remained more quiet and
subdued than their uninhibited counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The interplay between genetic and environmental forces is easier
to see in primates who, unlike humans, can be raised in controlled
circumstances. Dr. Stephen Suomi, chief of the Laboratory of
Comparative Ethology at the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development in Bethesda, Md., and his colleagues are studying
rhesus monkeys that show temperamental differences similar to those
of Kagan's shy children. These ``uptight'' monkeys, representing
about 20 percent of the wild population studied by the researchers,
are from birth more vigilant, more reactive to disruption in the
environment and more fearful than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Uptight males linger longer with their mothers' troops than
other males, who emigrate to a new troop at puberty. The shy males'
submissiveness usually lands them low in the dominance rankings.
They carry higher parasite loads than other monkeys _ suggesting
prolonged stress may affect their immune systems _ and display
other physiological differences, including higher stable heart
rates and elevated levels of stress hormones.
</P>
<P>
   But Suomi's team has found that when monkeys bred to be uptight
and timid are raised by successful, secure, high-ranking mothers, a
kind of miracle occurs. ``They learn from their mothers how to cope
with new social situations,'' Suomi says. ``They get very good at
recruiting friends and seeking help, and they often end up at top
of the dominance hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar healing can take place in people. ``Just as the mother
can help heal the child, the girlfriend can help heal the shy
guy,'' said Dr. Ethel Person, a New York psychoanalyst. For those
who are not so fortunate, dealing with their fear is often a
lifelong process. Some seek out jobs that shield them from a
surfeit of human interaction; they become night guards, or computer
programmers, or astrophysicists.
</P>
<P>
   Others eventually find their discomfort intolerable. For a
42-year-old nursing home recreation therapist in Connecticut, the
limit came when she changed jobs and became preoccupied with fears
she would embarrass herself in front of her new co-workers. For a
35-year-old Temple University graduate student it arrived when he
worried, weeks in advance, about a class presentation, and could
not stop thinking, ``I'm going to screw up. I'm going to make a
fool of myself. My voice is going to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Many treatment programs are designed to combat just such
self-flagellating thoughts. Using a model called
``cognitive-behavioral therapy,'' they challenge assumptions
socially anxious people often make reflexively: that they are being
closely observed by everyone in the room, for example. At the Yale
clinic, Suhoza discovered that he did not appear as nervous as he
had feared. He said he was learning not to compare himself
constantly with others, or to assume they are judging him badly.
</P>
<P>
   Group therapy, which allows patients to share their experiences
with others, is a preferred mode of treatment, though half the
battle, said Dr. Michael Otto, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical
School, is often to coax socially anxious people in the door in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   If work by Dr. Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford University
psychologist, is any indication, clinics treating social phobia may
draw even more customers in the future. Shyness, Zimbardo has
found, is on the rise. In surveys, more than 50 percent of young
adults describe themselves as chronically shy, up from 40 percent
in the 1970s. In part, he said, the jump may reflect the rise of
e-mail, automated gas pumps, video games, ATMs, and other
technologies that remove human beings from the ordinary equations
of life. With fewer chances to practice social skills, children may
find face-to-face interaction more difficult. ``And if you have a
any tendency toward shyness,'' Zimbardo said, ``that's going to
amplify it.''

WHY DO LEAVES CHANGE COLOR?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do leaves change color?
</P>
<P>
   K.S.
</P>
<P>
   Newton
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Think of a leaf as a factory. It takes in raw materials,
converts them to a finished product, and sends what it makes back
to the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Like any factory, it has operating costs, measured in how much
energy it takes to do its work. And like any factory, the leaf
wants to operate at a profit, an energy profit, sending more back
to the tree than it takes to do its job. When it can't make an
energy profit, it shuts itself down. As it downsizes, it changes
color.
</P>
<P>
   Let's branch out a little. The tree supplies the leaf with water
and minerals. Those raw materials go to the leaf's cells, for use
by little packets inside the cells called chloroplasts.
</P>
<P>
   Chloroplasts make several products, including the green pigments
chlorophyll A and B, the key machines in the factory of the leaf.
Both act like little solar panels, absorbing energy from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorophyll A can also use solar radiation to excite atoms in
the cells of the leaf, setting off a reaction that converts the
light energy into chemical energy. Then the leaf uses the chemical
energy to manufacture sugars, the leaf's finished product. That
process is photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   The factory runs best when conditions are ideal. New England
leaves operate at a substantial energy profit for most of the
summer, when they have the maximum sunlight, warmest temperatures,
and an adequate supply of water. But in the fall, conditions
deteriorate. Sunlight dwindles, temperatures drop, and it gets
harder and harder for the leaf to make as much energy for the tree
as it takes just to keep the factory running. The biochemistry of
the leaf senses that the leaf factory is about to start running at
an energy loss, and genes that have been dormant all summer order
up proteins that trigger a series of changes in leaf biochemistry,
changes that give us the colors of early fall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Here's what's going on at the intercellular level in all that
glorious foliage. First, proteins shut down the manufacture of
chlorophyll. But the chloroplasts keep on producing another
pigment, carotenoids, which they've been making all along. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Carotenoids are yellow and orange. They are kind of the
internal security force in the factory. Their job is to absorb
damaging free radicals, which are created when the leaf is zapped
by especially strong bursts of sunlight. Carotenoids soak up those
free radicals to protect the all-important chloroplasts. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In the fall, the yellow and orange carotenoids are left behind
as the green chlorophyll disappears.
</P>
<P>
   But where does the color red come from? It comes from
anthocyanins, the same chemicals that give us the red in roses,
cranberries, and apples.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Contrary to popular belief, anthocyanins are NOT in the leaf
all the time. They are manufactured as the leaf begins its
genetically programmed shutdown &UR; . &LR;  Everyone assumes they're
unmasked, that they've been there all along, says David Lee,
professor of botany at Florida International University. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But they're not. You can't find anthocyanins in leaves in the
summer. They're only produced during senescence. &UR;  &LR; Why? Lee says no
one knows. The best guess is that they are a mechanism to help get
rid of the remaining chlorophylls, which block the tree from
claiming back any precious nitrogen left over in the leaf to store
it for the winter. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Have you ever noticed that some trees go through this process
sooner than others? Lee says the first trees to change are those
under some kind of stress. Trees in wetlands, for example, often
change earlier because their roots are under water, which isn't
ideal. Trees near highways change early because their roots are
being pounded by traffic, and possibly because pollution stresses
the leaf factories.
</P>
<P>
   When the tree has stopped sending raw materials to the leaf and
sucked out anything it can use for energy over the winter, the
abscission layer that glues the leaf stem to the tree breaks down.
And what was yellow and orange and red and lovely a few weeks
earlier floats down brown and lifeless to join the pile we have to
rake up from the lawn.

SURROGATE MOTHERS REPORT FEW REGRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 10 years after giving birth, women who acted as
surrogate mothers for infertile couples said they did not regret
the role they played. But some felt sad and disappointed over the
loss of contact with the children they bore, who were biologically
their own. And many imagined that one day their children would find
them, even though in some cases the children had no idea that they
came into the world in any other than the usual way.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings emerged from a study by Dr. Nancy Reame of 10
surrogate mothers who gave birth 11 to 15 years ago. Dr. Reame, a
professor of nursing and a researcher in reproductive science at
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor presented her work this
month at a reproductive-medicine conference in San Francisco. In a
telephone interview, she said it was the first in-depth look at
what became of the women, now aged 37 to 47, who were among the
earliest to bear children for other couples, for a $10,000 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers she studied had already had children of their own
when they agreed to be inseminated with sperm from men whose wives
were infertile. The babies they conceived grew from the surrogates'
own eggs and so were biologically their own offspring. Dr. Reame
estimated that over the years 4,000 American women entered into
such arrangements. These are much less common today because
technology has made it possible for many infertile women to become
pregnant themselves with eggs from donors, or to have their own
eggs transferred to other women who carry the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reame said she had a personal interest in finding out what
had happened to the women: She had worked with some of them, as a
volunteer childbirth educator, support-group leader and labor coach
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always worried me,'' Dr. Reame said. ``For those of us in
the forefront, there were no laws. What were we operating? Were we
doing the right thing? What happened to these women?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reame had lost touch with the surrogate mothers, until one
contacted her two years ago. The woman was in emotional upheaval,
Dr. Reame said. The couple for whom she had been a srrogate had
cut off their relationship with her shortly after she gave birth,
``to her dismay and disappointment and heartbreak,'' Dr. Reame
said. They later told the child that she had been adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, after divorcing his wife, the husband
looked the surrogate up again. He told the child the truth and
introduced her to her biological mother. He and the surrogate
eventually moved in together, but after two years they split up,
leaving the surrogate devastated once again.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reame decided to do a study, conducting extensive interviews
with some of the women she had worked with as well as several
others.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 10 were ``highly satisfied,'' Dr. Reame said. ``It
was wonderful, the best thing they ever did.'' Two of the four have
remained close with the families of the babies they had borne, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other six, a few were angry and bitter because they felt
they had been exploited or abandoned by the children's families.
But others were satisfied with the relationships, though a natural
distancing had occurred over time, as all the parties went their
own ways in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've disengaged in a healthy way and have this nice memory
of doing something wonderful,'' Dr. Reame said. ``But they also
fantasize that someday, when the child is 18, there will be a knock
on the door and it will be the child coming to find them.''

ITALY IS FOR LOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ To be an American tourist in Italy during the Monica
Lewinsky crisis is to be a stranger in a puzzling alien paradise.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to politics, the Italians think we are loony. We
reciprocate by thinking they are. Their looniness is different from
ours.
</P>
<P>
   We are wringing our hands over the prospect of bringing down a
president for having illicit sex and lying about it even as
Congress marches steadily and unflinchingly toward just that goal.
The country, we anguish, will suffer from the trauma of changing
administrations in such a disorderly and dishonorable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   We prefer government stablity. We don't like to rock our
political boats unless we are really angry at the incumbents.
President Clinton is counting on our feeling this way for his
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, much more experienced than we are in this sort of
thing, are upset neither by sneaky sex in the corridors of power
nor by the collapse of governments. Insofar as can be judged by an
outsider, they take it for granted that both are the habitual way
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   While I was in Rome, the government of Romano Prodi fell.
Because he couldn't get the parliament to approve his budget, he
was forced to hand in his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   This calamity did not shock many Italians, who merely shrugged.
They have seen 55 governments come and go since World War II. Prodi
had lasted more than two years, longer than all but one other prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi said at first that he was disgusted and wanted nothing
further to do with politics. Then he changed his mind and tried to
put together a new governing coalition after all. He failed,
leaving Italy officially rudderless this week and dependent on
civil servants to keep things going.
</P>
<P>
   One sensible legislator viewing the chaos observed mildly, ``It
would be a good thing for Italy to have a government.'' Nobody
seemed to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi fell in the midst of NATO negotiations for the use of his
country's local bases to send planes to strike Yugoslavia in hopes
of preventing further carnage in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With the Serbian withdrawal settlement, the use of the bases has
not yet been necessary. But in an ironic twist, the Italians'
original resistance to approval of such use melted away once Prodi
was out. Partisan posturing mattered less, and the legislators
could hide behind a leaderless caretaker government. With nobody in
charge, nobody had to take responsibility for a potentially
incendiary decision.
</P>
<P>
   But the current power vacuum at the top also happens to come
merely three months from the start of Europe's new monetary system.
Prodi had bravely raised taxes to force Italy into compliance with
the economic standards necessary to join the revamped European
Union. The fact that Italy thus qualified was something of a
political miracle and a surprise to other major European
participants.
</P>
<P>
   The last (and only) time I saw Prodi was at last year's
international economic summit in Denver. He was buying several
bottles of aspirin at a local drugstore. Boy, has he needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Politics as played in Italy is a free-for-all with too many
players, too many parties and too few economic and political
controls. Don't laugh, but it makes our own system seem downright
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   This impression is heightened by the complicated confusion of
daily operations in Italy, particularly Rome. Someone is regularly
on strike, making life difficult for thousands of others. Because
of a strike by public transportation workers, Rome's legendary
traffic jams were even more clotted than usual when I was there.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, successors to a glorious intellectual and artistic
culture, are perversely proud of their version of organized chaos.
Our driver joked good-naturedly that in heaven the lovers are all
Italian, while in hell the Italians run the place.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, we Americans are far more uptight and mentally
tortured. We get into a tizzy when Congress dallies until the last
minute over the federal budget or a president pulls some really
dumb stunt. We run around feeling sorry for ourselves. We wouldn't
dream of calling ourselves lovers _ with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   But our governments do not fall routinely. We leave such changes
up to regular elections.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton is impeached and convicted, he will be the
first chief executive in history to be so destroyed. And although
he is now on the legal skids, it seems unlikely that he will
ultimately be tossed from office by a vengeful two thirds of the
Senate after a politically polarizing trial. Public pressure could
still force his resignation, but he won't go quietly, as Prodi did.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to the fact that although we know how to laugh
at ourselves and roll with life's vagaries, we are not yet as
expert as it as the Italians. We have had only 200 years of
practice. They have had thousands.

BOATING THROUGH SHARK CENTRAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A great day on the briny blue was just about
over, with deckhand Bill Lowery of the Wacky Jacky cleaning the
day's catch, about a dozen big salmon, and tossing the waste over
the stern for gulls, sea lions and crabs to munch.
</P>
<P>
   ``All done,'' he shouted, the gulls squawking, hovering and
diving, going crazy at the handouts. This was near Duxbury, located
off the coast, not far from Stinson Beach in Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   At the stern, Lowery hosed out the fish box, which washed salmon
scales into the sea, the silver flecks shimmering near the surface,
and Lowery watched them for a moment, when suddenly, this giant
mouth came out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Connected to that giant mouth was 17 feet of shark. It came
right up to the boat, then swam parallel for a moment, enough for
all aboard to see. It was a white shark, a huge one, an estimated
3,500 pounds, about four feet across at the head, and who knows,
maybe the same one that took the bite out of that surfer.
</P>
<P>
   It was so big and inspired such a shock of fear that nearly
everyone aboard had a different idea of how big it really was. One
old-timer, who has spent 30 years on the water, swore ``It was 30
feet long!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome, just huge, both the girth and the length of
it,'' said skipper Jacqueline Douglas. ``First I saw this dark
silhouette in the water on the starboard side, then it just kind of
looked at me, and I felt shockwaves go through me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it disappeared, as quietly as it had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest sharks of the world swim in coastal areas
near the San Francisco Bay. According to records, the biggest ever
documented in the Bay area washed up at Ano Nuevo State Reserve,
measured at 18 feet long and weighed at an estimated 4,500 pounds,
about the same size as the shark in the first ``Jaws'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery came just a few months after a surfer had been
attacked and fatally wounded near Santa Cruz, where a surf board
was found with a perfect bite mark out of it. It perfectly matched
the missing piece of surfer.

CLINTON HEADING TO CALIFORNIA IN BID TO HELP BOXER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton briefly shelves his ``Rose
Garden'' strategy in the mid-term congressional elections Tuesday
to conduct a two-day campaign swing in California on behalf of the
re-election bid of Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to California is his last scheduled overnight
campaign swing before the Nov. 3 midterm elections. The president's
last scheduled campaign trip is a day-long visit to New York on
Oct. 30 to campaign for Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who is
challenging three-term Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   On his trip to California, Clinton planned to appear at four
separate fund-raising events in Los Angeles and San Francisco to
bolster Boxer's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Latest polls show that Clinton's efforts could be crucial for
Boxer's hopes of holding her Senate seat against a challenge by
Republican Matt Fong, the state treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statewide survey, released by the San Francisco
Examiner and KTVU-TV, showed Boxer losing to Fong 44 percent to 46
percent. Ten percent of the respondents said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, a liberal Democrat from Marin County who served in
Congress for 10 years before winning a Senate seat in 1992, is
distantly related to the Clinton family by marriage. Her daughter
Nicole married first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's younger brother,
Tony Rodham, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has traveled to California more than three dozen
times during his presidency, also planned fund-raising appearances
in Los Angeles to help Democrat Janice Hahn in her bid to succeed
Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., and in San Francisco to help California
Assembly Democrats strengthen their numbers in the state
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn faces a tight race with Republican two-term Assemblyman
Steve Kuykendall, a businessman and military veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's latest campaign swing to California reflects the
by-invitation-only campaign style that has characterized his
appearances on behalf of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The president visited 14 states in the last 25 days of the 1994
midterm congressional campaign on behalf of Democratic candidates
only to see voters install Republican majorities in the House and
Senate for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides deny that a fear of protesters over the Monica
Lewinsky sex-and-coverup scandal have forced Clinton to avoid open
air public campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Clinton's six events in California on Tuesday and
Wednesday are fund raisers. The sixth event is an appearance at a
school in Oakland on Wednesday to underscore elements of the $500
billion omnibus spending package negotiated with the GOP Congress
last week and due to be signed into law this week.
</P>
<P>
   California, the nation's most populous state with 31.9 million
people, gave its 54 electoral votes for Clinton in 1992 and 1996 _
the first time the state has voted for a Democrat for the White
House in two successive elections since 1944 and 1948.

THE PERFECT EVERYDAY GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUTHE STEIN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ As William H. Macy discovered when he arrived in
Hollywood in 1990, acting technique will get you only so far in
movies. Even with 20 years of stage experience, much of it in plays
by his buddy David Mamet, Macy could only land
blink-and-you'll-miss-him roles in ``The Client,'' ``Mr. Holland's
Opus'' and ``Down Periscope.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough that turned Macy into ``a big fat movie star,''
as he gleefully calls himself, came not through hard work but from
something given him at birth _ his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've got this American face,'' Macy says. Look at
the the 48-year-old actor across a table in a hotel room and his
square, open face and ordinary features do seem all-American. In a
plain blue shirt, which brings out the blue in his eyes, he looks
like somebody you'd brush by at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   This everyman quality, he says, is ``why I'm always being cast
to play this normal American guy who is confused, whose world has
just been burned down around him and who is wondering what he's
supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pleasantville,'' Macy plays such a role _ a '50s father
forced to question whether he really does know best. In December,
he'll be seen doing more variations on the ordinary theme: as an
accountant in John Travolta's law firm in ``A Civil Action'' and as
a Milquetoast detective in a remake of ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   The prototype was the hapless Minnesota car salesman who bungles
a plan to have his wife kidnapped in ``Fargo,'' the 1996 Coen
brothers black comedy. Not only was the role responsible for
showing Macy in a new light, it also got him his first Oscar
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the script, ``I almost fell down I was so nervous
because I realized it was one of the best scripts (the Coens) had
written in a long time, and that I was born to play the role. When
something fits, you know it,'' Macy recalls. All he had to do was
convince the filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that he isn't at his best in auditions, Macy kept coming
back. ``I read for them twice in Los Angeles and then I found out
they were still seeing people in New York, so I flew to New York
and walked in. I said, `I'm very, very worried that you are going
to screw up this movie by giving this role to somebody else. It's
my role, and I'll shoot your dogs if you don't give it to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   No threats were necessary for director Gary Ross to cast Macy in
``Pleasantville.'' From the beginning, Ross, a screenwriter
(``Dave,'' ``Big'') directing for the first time, felt that Macy
had the ``acting chops'' to show how someone could become a better
person after everything he believes in collapses around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is so collaborative and inventive and spontaneous. He
loves the process,'' Ross says of working with him.
</P>
<P>
   For Macy, the only difficult scene in what he found to be a
remarkably easy shoot was when Ross expected him to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to cry. I hate to watch it, and I hate to indulge in
it. I don't like emotions in any way because I'm a Lutheran,'' Macy
says.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls informing Ross to ``have your ducks lined up because
I can't do it a bunch of times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we do the first rehearsal and I burst into tears. I wept
like a baby. We did the first take, I wept like a baby. To make a
long story short, I wept all day. I think I needed a good cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's experience growing up in Cumberland, Md., in the '50s
helped him understand the milieu of ``Pleasantville.'' The film's
title is also the title of a mythical '50s TV series within the
movie, starring Macy and Joan Allen as the perfect parents in a
perfect suburban household.
</P>
<P>
   Like this dad, Macy's father, an insurance agent, would leave
for work every day with a stuffed briefcase. His mother stayed home
and watched after Macy and his older brother. ``I always looked at
myself as the Beav and he was Wally.'' When the boys misbehaved,
their mother would threaten them with ``Wait till your father comes
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy has only fond memories of his childhood and is perplexed
that so many current films try to ``poke a pin into the big bubble
of nostalgia we have for post-World War II America.'' While
suburbia takes some hits in ``Pleasantville,'' he appreciates that
at least ``it's told with a smile instead of being so dour.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy was on his way to becoming a veterinarian when he
transferred to Goddard College in Vermont and took a drama class
from Mamet. ``It changed my whole life. Dave taught me how to act.
He was the first guy who told me it was a noble profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The two moved to Chicago in 1972 and started the St. Nicholas
Theater. Macy unintentionally gave Mamet a line for the company's
first play, ``American Buffalo'' (in which Macy originated the role
of Bobby).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave used to come over and help himself to everything in my
refrigerator. I was poor as a church mouse back then,'' Macy
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``So one day I was watching him carve off this great block of
cheese, talking about all the great things we were going to do
someday, and I said, `Help yourself.' He goes, `Help myself?' He's
got a mouthful of cheese and he keeps going, `Help myself?' The
rest of it can't be printed. Ten months later, I'm reading his play
and there's a line where one of the characters, in a similar
situation, goes `Help yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the late '70s, Macy had started appearing on TV and in films.
Because there already was an actor named Bill Macy, he had to go by
his initials. His middle name is Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was W.H. Macy for years, and then I just sort of
unilaterally decided to start calling myself William H. Macy
because nobody would know what to call me. I'd go for auditions and
they would see `W.H.,' and a lot of times they would just skip me
because they didn't want to say `W.H., you're next.'''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he is hired without having to audition. ``I'm the
flavor of the month,'' he said. The Oscar nomination ``made it
official'' that he belongs in big movies, though usually in a
supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost don't care if I get the lead. Well, I do care a
little bit. I would like to be heroic and get the girl every once
in a while. But I like the good roles; if it's a small role or a
big one doesn't matter so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The salaries he's commanding astonish him. ``I get to put a zero
on the end of everything I'm doing,'' says Macy, who reportedly was
paid $750,000 for ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Having money has changed his life in little ways. He has a
retirement plan for the first time. He and his wife of one year,
actress Felicity Huffman, who is in the new ABC-TV series ``Sports
Night,'' just bought a bigger house. And they're thinking about
starting a family _ or at least Macy is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a little old and long in the tooth. My wife is
younger. So while I'm ready to get started, I might have to get
somebody to hold her down,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling so long, success comes with its own set of
anxieties. ``I'm not dumb,'' Macy says. ``It could go away as
quickly as it arrives. So I'm trying to keep my eye on the work and
be grateful for the good times and not be afraid of whether they're
going away.''

<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ To the outside world, where the black and
white images captured by photographer Edward S. Curtis became
renowned for their haunting, frozen moments, the young girl was
known simply as ``Makah Maiden.''
</P>

   To her own people, the child's identity remained a mystery for
more than 60 years. It wasn't until the 1970s, when 15 tribal
elders were asked by the University of Washington to review
archival photos, that the little girl got a name.
</P>
<P>
   That the girl in the photo was a woman all had known as Iva
Tyler-Lawrence was a surprise to her family.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the long-ago image became not only a family connection
to the past, but a link to a time when the Makah hunted whales
without international attention or controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the older elders told me my mother was one of the last
of the full-blooded Makah,'' said one of Iva's daughters, Josephine
Ray, now 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised when we saw the picture. We never knew it
was in a museum or how famous it was. It was never in Neah Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a copy of the photograph Curtis took in 1914
was proudly hung inside the Makah Maiden Cafe, near a beach where
the photographer may have snapped the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The tidy yet humble restaurant was opened in April by Iva's
granddaughter and grandson, Joddie Johnson and Gary Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Beebe's Cafe, the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, and
JJ's Pizza, the Makah Maiden is one of the few eating spots around.
But it holds a prime spot as the first restaurant in the village
upon entering, and lies across the road from the village's only
general store, Washburn's.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe has become a de facto community center and meeting spot
for tribal members as well as the media, who have gathered here to
witness the tribe's first whale hunt in more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, guests sip coffee and watch with a mixture of amusement
and irritation at the occasional sorties through the marina of
boats launched by Paul Watson, founder and skipper of the protest
vessel, Sea Shepherd, which will be used to try to thwart the whale
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the gaze from Curtis' photo of the Makah Maiden, members
of Iva Tyler-Lawrence's family recently sat down to talk about Iva,
who likely never knew the impact of Curtis' photo or of her own
small contributions to future generations hungry for knowledge
about Makah traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis snapped the photograph when Iva was 11, her family said.
No one recalls anything about Curtis' visit. But if it was a
typical day for an 11-year-old girl, Ray said, ``she was probably
playing tag with the waves on the beach'' when Curtis decided to
pose her.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a young woman, Iva met and married on the reservation
a Polish immigrant whose family came to Chicago from Austria after
World War I. His name, family members say, was something like
``Ziglivich.'' Immigration authorities changed it to Joseph
Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster struck, and Lawrence and his five brothers were
orphaned. Three brothers were adopted, and Joseph and a brother
headed West. They landed logging jobs on the reservation, where
Joseph met and married Iva.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph and Iva died in 1973 just three months apart. Iva
followed her husband to the grave with ``a broken heart,'' Ray
said. ``She was lonely without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another grandson, Scott Tyler, a family physician in Kent,
remembers his grandmother's love and still marvels at the Curtis
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go back and see that haunting beauty was amazing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the photograph became family lore, Tyler remembers his
grandmother as gray, plump and surrounded by grandkids. ``She had a
life with the typical suffering of Native women, with the warmth of
a grandmother and a wood stove for cooking, and with a big lap for
the grandkids like myself to sit in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iva's life journey saw her win recognition as a rare,
left-handed basket weaver. Her legacy is in the family she helped
rear: eight children, 25 grandchildren and at least 65
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Iva's daughter's, Jodine Richards, 64, is the tribal
council secretary. Richard's daughter, ayit, who has a daughter
named Iva, also will oversee the preparation and cooking of the
whale, should the tribe's hunters kill one this winter.
</P>
<P>
   While the Makah gave up whaling voluntarily in the 1920s, many
aspects of their culture and language were forcibly attacked in the
name of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   As a young girl, Iva was made to attend a government boarding
school on nearby ``BIA Hill,'' her family recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Such schools were mostly misguided attempts to assimilate Native
Americans into mainstream America by separating them from their
parents and educating them away from their cultures and languages.
Punitive measures were exacted for even speaking a word of the
Makah language.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's generation, which attended a state school under similar
conditions, remembers the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's father said there was too much trouble
(encountered) to learn the (Makah) language, so they didn't teach
it to us,'' Ray recalled. The language was almost forgotten until
the 1970s, when its teaching returned in accredited school courses.
</P>
<P>
   The Makahs' determination kept their cultural links alive. A
photo flanking the Makah Maiden in the cafe depicts dugouts, wooden
shelters and tents. They were pitched at one of the tribe's secret
hideouts established after government attempts began to quash their
culture in about 1865.
</P>
<P>
   The famed photo was taken at an unknown time after that, on the
far side of Tatoosh Island off Cape Flattery, where the Makah could
paddle and, unseen from the mainland, continue their practices,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler says the best thing the whale hunt has done is restore the
tribe's sense of self-determination. By going before the
International Whaling Commission, , the tribe is recovering
something it lost when it stopped whaling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Its members are ``learning to see themselves as participants in
the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reminder of the tribe's past and identity as a nation.
In his grandmothers' time, Tyler said the tribe freely traded with
Russia and other tribes in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``My other grandmother _ not Iva _ actually went to the Bering
Straits in sealing boats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler believes the tribe ``did quite an admirable thing'' when
it agreed to stop 70 years ago, when the gray whale population
began to decline dramatically as a result of commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler also recalls how much a part of Makah culture whaling is.
As a boy, he said, he remembers being taught a whaling song by an
old man named Sebastian LaChester.
</P>
<P>
   LaChester ``sang a song that he said the whale sings to him when
it dies,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   The role of elders in educating the young has always been
important to the tribe, and Iva, herself, led by example, her
family says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother instilled honesty in us, and taught that those who
wrong you will reap what they sow,'' said Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Added Johnson: ``Our elders teach us to maintain the traditions
of the spirit within us, and refusing to let that spirit be taken
from us through hurt, bitterness or injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Before opening the Makah Maiden, Johnson, a former Air Force
wife who had traveled to Europe with her husband, Donovan, ran a
resort on the reservation at an old Air Force radar base closed in
1986. It was converted for use as the tribal council headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the Makah Maiden Cafe and its photographs are
intended to be educational as well as enhance the ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Makah Maiden photo is a picture of Johnson's niece,
Heather, who is posed to invite a comparison to Iva. The look-alike
composition won a blue ribbon at the Clallam County Fair 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Johnson has channeled her energies into other
cultural projects. By researching minutes of the original treaty
conference from almost 150 years ago, Johnson produced a 45-minute
play titled ``One Nation to Another.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken on the road in 1996, the play was performed in two
regional Native American schools, two juvenile detention centers,
and before inner-city kids in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we took it on the road, we gave it to our elders in the
village. It brought tears, coming from the voices of kids in school
now. You have to be stone cold not to be touched by it,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Funding ran out last year, but the school and Johnson hope to
find a source to revive it. She dreams of taking it nationwide to
other reservations, as a reminder of the pain and pride of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a past of art and beauty, like Iva's rare,
left-handmade baskets, which she continued to make throughout her
life, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She earned a little extra money weaving those little baskets
until the day she died,'' said Tyler.

THAT STAR IN ``HAMLET'' MAY HAVE BEEN EXPLODING SUPERNOVA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people scarcely notice it, but in the opening scene of
``Hamlet,'' the play many consider Shakespeare's greatest, the
sentries refer to a particular star in the northern sky _ and then
discuss how celestial sightings often portend ``fierce events.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there a reason for this specific stellar reference?
Physicist Donald Olson thinks he's got it figured out.
</P>
<P>
   Piecing together subtle clues from within the play and from his
own knowledge of the history of astronomy, Olson has deduced what
star the sentries on the castle ramparts are most likely discussing
just before the ghost of Hamlet's father strides onstage.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no ordinary star, Olson says. He and his wife Marilyn
Olson, an English professor, and Russell Doescher, another
physicist, all at Southwest Texas State University, have concluded
that it was actually a famous exploding star known as Tycho's
Supernova, which dazzled viewers around the world when Shakespeare
was just eight years old. Their article about their investigation
of the stellar allusion appears in the November issue of Sky &AMP;
Telescope magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Supernovas are now understood to be the dramatic death throes of
ordinary stars that have consumed all their nuclear fuel and flare
up briefly before passing into a long, dark decline. But when the
great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe and other scientists, clerics
and scholars of the day saw a bright star flash into view where
none had been before, in November of 1572, it was an event that
shook their beliefs and helped unleash a revolution in human
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   It was quickly determined by careful measurements of position
that this interloper was far out in the realm of the stars, not
some transitory phenomenon in the atmosphere. That challenged a
deeply-held belief: that the stars were perfect, immutable,
unchanging _ a manifestation of the perfection of heaven itself.
Any sudden change in that realm was supposed to be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But the star flared and then disappeared, and the foundations of
belief were shaken.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on learned people was probably no less disturbing and
frightening than the appearance of a ghostly king to the sentries _
and his arrival interrupted their conversation about that very
star:
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo: Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward
from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating
one, _ (enter Ghost)
</P>
<P>
   During the 16 months that it blazed in the sky, Tycho wrote a
book about the apparition, called ``De Nova Stella'' _ of the new
star. He continued to refer to the sight in later works, including
this description of his first sighting:
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly and unexpectedly beheld near the zenith an
unaccustomed star with a bright radiant light. Astounded, as though
thunderstruck by this astonishing sight, I stood still and for some
time gazed with my eyes fixed intently upon this star. It was near
the stars which have been assigned since antiquity to the asterism
of Cassiopeia. I was convinced that no star like this had ever
before shone forth in this location...
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, its apparent magnitude exceeded all the
fixed stars, including those of the first magnitude... Indeed, the
new star appeared brighter than Jupiter... when closest to the
Earth. It rivaled the brilliant aspect of Venus when nearest to the
Earth. During November the new star was so bright that, when the
air was clear, many people with sharp vision were able to see it in
the daytime, even at midday.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who teaches a class on astronomy in art, history and
literature and has studied the astronomical details behind a
variety of historic events, was intrigued by the reference in the
opening of Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Others had previously found passages in the play that seem to
relate to a major astronomical debate of Shakespeare's time: The
overthrow of earlier views of the structure of the universe by the
newer cosmologies of Tycho and his British contemporary, Thomas
Digges. Several people, including Harvard University historian of
science Owen Gingerich, have pointed out that the names of the
characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Hamlet most likely
referred to ancestors of Tycho, whose names were emblazoned on a
portrait of Tycho that hung on Digges' wall and was likely seen
there by Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody had previously succeeded in making a plausible
identification of the star in the play's first scene. And, as Olson
noted in a recent interview, ``it's right at the beginning of the
play. Some people say that the way you open a play is
significant.'' And, he added, the reference is very specific:
Shakespeare has identified the exact time of night, the place, and
the direction. And although the references are more indirect, there
are clues in the play that can identify the time of year: most
likely in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reference is unusually specific for a Shakespeare play,''
he said. ``People before us have tried to figure out what the star
is,'' but the theories were unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   The details led Olson and his collaborators to the conclusion
that the area of the sky referred to by the sentries _ just west of
the pole at 1 a.m. _ contains the constellation of Cassiopeia, with
its familiar W shape. But at that point, Olson felt stuck.
Cassiopeia contains no bright, distinctive stars. What could the
reference to this specific star mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were driving down the highway,'' Olson recalls,
and they were discussing the fact that none of the stars in that
part of the sky ``really fit. The only thing there is Cassiopeia.
That's when the light bulb hit: There are no really bright stars in
Cassiopeia _ except Tycho's supernova!''
</P>
<P>
   That led him to investigate how well known that supernova would
have been in Shakespeare's time. Olson consulted a leading
historical reference book of that era, Raphael Holinshed's
Chronicles, which Shakespeare is known to have consulted. There, he
found detailed references to the celestial apparition.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the new star, Holinshed noted that ``it is supposed
that the signification thereof is directed purposelie and
speciallie to some matter, not naturall, but celestiall, or rather
supercelestiall, so strange, as from the beginning of the world
never was the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Shakespeare witnessed the star himself may never be
known, although it is clear from historical references that it was
widely discussed at the time and may well have caught his
attention. But in any case, he certainly would have been aware of
it _ and its significance _ from the published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Olson thinks the upheaval embodied by this celestial apparition
fits right in with the themes of ``Hamlet,'' which is full of
references to disturbing the established order. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``What was the big deal?'' he says. ``Change was supposed to
happen down on Earth, not in the heavens &UR; . &LR;  The heavens were not
supposed to change at all _ and they just had. Seeing that star was
very disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   That outward disturbance reflected the inner turmoil that Hamlet
expresses throughout the play _ sometimes even with references to
the stars. In act 2, scene 2 he describes his troubled mental
state: ``This most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden
fire, why, it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapours.''
</P>
<P>
   Tycho Brahe himself was clearly influenced strongly by his early
observation of this supernova _ he was 26 at the time _ and it may
have helped propel him into a career as one of the leading
astronomical thinkers and observers of the age. In a strange
coincidence, he spent most of his career watching the heavens from
the great observatory of Uraniborg that he had built on an island
directly across from the castle of Elsinore _ the setting of
Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Shakespeare personally witnessed the supernova, or
simply heard and read about it, Olson and his co-authors say, ``the
spectacular stellar event in 1572 may have been the inspiration for
the celestial portent in the opening scene of the most famous play
ever written.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theologians may ponder the difference between God and the
creature made in his image, but biologists have always asked a
humbler question: How do humans differ from other animals? A
proposal now under active discussion promises to provide an answer
of possibly disconcerting precision.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to identify the genes that are special to humans by
sequencing the genome, or full DNA, of the chimpanzee and comparing
it with the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Because chimpanzees are so closely related to humans, those
genes that work differently in people from in chimpanzees could be
all that is needed to convert a default-mode great ape into a
human.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such genes seems likely on present knowledge to be
startlingly small _ perhaps a mere 50 or so out of the 100,000
genes that humans and chimps are thought to possess _ according to
scientists at GenoPlex, a company in Denver that is exploring chimp
genes for medical reasons. The company hopes to identify the
specially human genes by their supposedly distinctive pattern of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Others, while welcoming pursuit of the new knowledge, foresee
certain hazards that might accompany it, such as the temptation to
engineer more human humans through enhanced versions of the 50
genes, as well as the ethical problems inherent in trying to test
the role of the uniquely human genes by inserting them into
chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   Most human genes have an ancestry that goes back to the earliest
animals and is shared in common with other species. Creatures as
distant from man as the fruitfly or roundworm have genes whose DNA
sequence is recognizably similar to their human counterparts, as if
they were variant spellings of the same word.
</P>
<P>
   The federal human genome project, which aims to decode the 3
billion units of human DNA by 2003, will lay the basis for
understanding the human genetic programming as a whole, but is not
designed to ferret out the genes unique to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of doing this by means of the chimp genome was first
proposed a year ago by two biologists who study evolution at the
DNA level, Edwin McConkey of the University of Colorado at Boulder
and Morris Goodman of Wayne State University in Detroit. Their
proposal was further explored at a meeting held earlier this month
at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey said that the German government had started a project
to sequence part of the chimpanzee genome and that he hoped the
National Institutes of Health would do the same.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the leading supporter of chimp genome research
in the United States has been Genoplex, a company founded by two
University of Colorado biologists, James Sikela and Thomas Johnson.
The company has already identified a gene that may contribute
toward chimpanzees' greater resistance to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   DNA, the chemical tape that embodies the genetic programming,
changes very slowly. Chimpanzees and humans are thought to have
taken different evolutionary paths only 5 million years ago, a mere
eyeblink in evolutionary time. Because the two species shared an
ancestor so recently, their DNA is on average 98.4 percent
identical.
</P>
<P>
   It is a serious puzzle for biologists to explain how two such
similar genetic programs generate such different animals. Dr. David
Nelson, a biologist at the Baylor College of Medicine, said that
some of the anatomical differences between chimps and humans might
arise from very small changes in the genes that regulate fetal
development.
</P>
<P>
   The human brain is about twice the size of the chimpanzee brain,
but a genetic program that allowed time for the brain cells in the
developing fetus to go through just one more doubling would account
for the difference, Nelson said. The human face is tucked
underneath the brain case instead of projecting beyond it as in the
chimp, but this could be arranged just by arresting the forward
movement of the face during fetal development.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many other human-chimp differences that have to
be generated by the almost identical genetic programs. Nelson
believes that some of the differences may be explained by a
phenomenon that lies beyond the mere sequence of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   With a colleague, Elizabeth Nickerson, he has been studying a
curious rearrangement in chimpanzee chromosomes, the units in which
DNA molecules are packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with humans, chimps have five chromosomes in which a
central segment has been flipped. Genes on the flipped portion of
the chromosomes would find themselves in a different environment
and might be more or less active than before, Nelson said. Even a
small difference in the activity of a high-level regulatory gene
could produce significant effects in the developing animal.
</P>
<P>
   The genes that make humans more than just another great ape are
unlikely to be totally novel genes, experts say, but rather ones
that acquired a new role compared with their counterparts in the
chimp genome.
</P>
<P>
   These genes would have been under strong evolutionary pressure,
a force that can often be detected through a quirk in the genetic
code, the system whereby a set of three DNA units, or nucleotides,
specifies each of the amino acid building blocks of proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The code is somewhat ambiguous, in that in some cases one
nucleotide can change or mutate to another without changing the
specified amino acid. These so-called silent changes make no
difference to the organism and are almost neutral in terms of its
survival prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Nucleotide mutations that do change the specified amino acid are
usually harmful; hence these consequential mutations are less
common than the silent mutations. On the rare occasions when
consequential mutations are beneficial, they are quickly favored by
natural selection and outnumber the silent mutations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sikela hopes to pinpoint genes that have been under strong
selective pressure in both human and chimp lineages by comparing
differences in the DNA sequence of human genes and their chimp
counterparts, and looking for genes in which consequential changes
outweigh the silent ones. Comparing such genes with counterparts in
a third species, like the gorilla, should show whether it is the
chimp or human member of the pair that has been under selective
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Many changes that seem distinctively human, such as larger brain
size, are in fact evolutionary trends that began far earlier in the
primate line. Goodman thinks it will necessary to sequence the
genomes of a series of primate species in order to clarify these
trends.
</P>
<P>
   To explore each of the major branch points leading to humans
over the last 60 million years, he would like someone to sequence
lemurs, bushbabies, pottos, tarsiers, rhesus monkeys, gibbons,
orangutans, chimps and bonobos.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the genes that are special to humans would not be
without hazard, McConkey believes. ``The more we learn about the
genes that are crucial for our uniquely human characteristics, the
greater the temptation to produce humans that have optimal
combinations of these genes, or even enhanced genes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another dilemma is that biologists might wish to test the
supposed role of the uniquely human genes by inserting them into
chimpanzees. ``I don't know whether society will ever be
comfortable with such a drastic thing as adding a human gene to an
ape,'' McConkey said.

SAILING TEAM WORKS ON TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL TO WIN AMERICA'S CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Corporate sponsors of a San Francisco-based
sailing team are kicking in about $34 million to design a high-tech
vessel that can rule the waves and return the coveted America's Cup
to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the technology, you just can't compete,'' said
AmericaOne skipper Paul Cayard, a dashing, world-renowned racing
veteran who, in 1997, became the first American skipper ever to win
the Whitbread Round the World Race at the helm of the
Swedish-sponsored EF Language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology gives you a fast boat, and the fastest boat will
win _ period,'' said Cayard, a native of Sausalito, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With sponsorships from Ford Motor Co., Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Bellcore/SAIC and others, the St. Francis Yacht Club's AmericaOne
campaign is still pretty much a digital campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are kicking in with the hopes of demonstrating
their cutting-edge technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsoring AmericaOne allows us a pretty good opportunity to
present to the world the breadth of H-P technologies,'' said Knute
Christensen, market development manager at H-P's high-performance
systems division and AmericaOne's coordinator for super computer
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what all the tech sponsors are after. AmericaOne is on
such a fast track, we just can't use it to create new
technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are employing technology in a bid to win the America's
Cup. America True, sailing from the San Francisco Yacht Club, has
lined up its own high-tech sponsors, including Southfield,
Mich.-based Radioss Consulting Corp. and NASA's Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland. Radioss, which makes car-crash simulations, is
creating software that re-creates the effects of waves crashing on
a boat's hull. NASA is providing technology gleaned from its solar
panel research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you exactly what it is,'' said America True
spokeswoman Grace Kim. ``Its all a big secret right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said his team is using powerful computer technology to
create digital models of the ultimate sailing machine.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create the fastest boat by mounting the largest
possible area of sails atop the heaviest amount of underwater
weight (to provide a ``righting force'' that brings the boat
upright, driving it forward) and then attaching all that to a
lightweight hull that creates the least amount of drag in the
water. The resulting design will create a machine that can reach
top speeds of 20 knots, or roughly 23 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound that fast,'' Cayard said. ``But in sailing,
that's a screaming boat speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cup finals will be held in New Zealand's Haruaki Gulf in
February 2000. The America's Cup has resided in New Zealand since
1995, when Black Magic trounced American Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP;
Stripes.

IT'S TIME TO CHANGE NAME OF ``CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It says a lot about chronic fatigue syndrome in 1998 that a main
topic at a national conference on the subject in Cambridge last
week was what to call the elusive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited two-hour debate on whether to junk the current name
was ``very polarizing,'' says one researcher. Patients and their
advocates insist that the ``fatigue'' label is pooh-poohed and
joked about among those who haven't experienced chronic fatigue
syndrome, also called CFS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name sounds so trivial. People think, `Well, I get tired
by Friday afternoon too,''' says K. Kimberly Kenney, executive
director of the North Carolina-based Chronic Fatigue and Immune
Dysfunction Syndrome Association of America. ``The illness is much
more devastating than the name would imply.''
</P>
<P>
   No less a public health figure than Dr. Philip Lee, the former
US assistant secretary of health and human services, declares it's
time to change the name.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in the field are sympathetic. After all, they have
put up for years with colleagues who look askance at their research
on such an ill-defined (read: ``imaginary?'') disorder. But,
researchers counter, what do we call it when we can't yet agree on
what its essence is?
</P>
<P>
   Is it at bottom a brain disease? A metabolic disorder? An immune
derangement? There's evidence for all and consensus on none.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's unanimity on one point: The current name is really bad
because it trivializes the illness,'' says Dr. Anthony Komaroff of
Harvard Medical School, one of the most respected CFS researchers.
``But we don't know enough to choose the right name. And we'd damn
well better get it right and be prepared to live with it for the
next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it's called, whatever it is, there is new evidence that
many more people suffer from it _ in the most strictly defined
terms _ than many people think, or than previous studies had
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   A new $1.7 million study by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention _ the largest and most rigorous ever on CFS _ has found
that the syndrome afflicts 183 out of every 100,000 Americans
between the ages of 18 and 69.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the previous CDC study found between four and nine
cases per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The new study was based on 90,000 residents of Sedgwick County,
Kan., where Wichita lies _ one-quarter of the county's population.
Researchers identified about 4,000 people who said they suffered
serious fatigue for a month or more, and interviewed them in
greater depth. Among those, 500 appeared to have the syndrome;
researchers persuaded 300 of these to undergo physical exams and
laboratory tests.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 300, a panel of physicians decided that 39 had bonafide
CFS by the most stringent definition. That definition rquires at
least six months of severe unexplained fatigue plus four or more of
these symptoms: impairment in short-term memory or concentration;
sore throat; tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit; muscle pain;
pain in multiple joints without inflammation; unusual headaches;
unrefreshing sleep; and long-lasting malaise following exertion.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking new information from Wichita is that CFS rates
are much higher among women than men _ 303 cases per 100,000 for
all adult women, 340 cases for white women.
</P>
<P>
   To put the rates in context, chronic fatigue syndrome in adult
women appears to be less common than diabetes (which is more than
three times as prevalent) or high blood pressure (66 times more
prevalent). But it is roughly three to five times more common than
lung and breast cancer. (CFS is not considered a fatal disease,
although it often disables victims for years.)
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the new prevalence rates, there may be roughly
314,000 adult Americans suffering from the syndrome. (Estimates of
CFS in adolescents and children would add another 40,000 or so.) A
firmer estimate will have to await further analysis by CDC
researchers, taking into account the prevalence of the syndrome
within specific age groups.
</P>
<P>
   One clear lesson from Wichita is that the great majority of
sufferers are currently undiagnosed. Only six of the 39 patients
identified there had been diagnosed with CFS.
</P>
<P>
   The Wichita findings, which were echoed by another new study of
27,000 Chicago households, have a number of important
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very large study. And it was done by the CDC, and
people implicitly trust data that comes from the CDC,'' Komaroff
says. ``It shows that CFS is more common than many people had
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Klimas, a CFS authority at the University of Miami,
predicts that ``the new prevalence data will interest drug
companies'' in trying to develop drugs to treat it, because the
numbers suggest a substantial market. ``Those guys will get little
dollar signs in their eyes when we talk about CFS,'' Klimas says.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to discovering what causes the syndrome, or how to
treat it, the Cambridge conference shows that researchers are still
like the blind men and the elephant: no one has a clear picture of
the whole beast yet.
</P>
<P>
   Data are accumulating that the syndrome involves a chronic viral
infection. The lead candidate is human herpesvirus-6, which is
suspected of damaging the fatty sheath that surrounds nerves, among
other possible effects; but many believe there is no single viral
culprit. Similarly, evidence is mounting that the target organs are
the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in the lower brain and the
adrenal glands, which sit atop the kidneys and secrete stress
hormones. Recent studies of Gulf War veterans suggest that some
individuals get CFS or a very similar syndrome after exposure to
stress or environmental toxins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's accumulating evidence that there's something wrong
with the brain,'' Komaroff says. ``The way I have put it together
is that these syndromes all ultimately affect changes in
neurochemistry in the brain. In CFS, my unproven bet is that
chronic low grade infection with a variety of agents causes it in
most patients, and maybe toxins do in some.''

HOPEFUL TESTS IF CLINTON SCANDAL MAY ACTUALLY HELP DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former US representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat
running in one of the nation's tightest congressional races, says
his latest television commercial has prompted voters to walk up to
him with responses like: ``That a way, Jay!''
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, airing in the 1st Congressional District of
Washington state, Inslee tries to turn President Clinton's
impeachment troubles into a Democratic advantage. The announcer
blames Inslee's opponent, Republican Representative Rick White, and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich for supporting ``months and months of
more mud and politics'' by backing an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick White and Newt Gingrich shouldn't be dragging us through
this,'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have made speeches urging a quick resolution to
the impeachment process, but party officials say Inslee and just
one other Democratic House candidate, Ralph Neas of Maryland, have
put their money behind that message in campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   And while many Democrats are trying to ignore the issue of
impeachment, Inslee is embracing it, gambling that he can win by
turning the election partly into a referendum on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is only about a week old, and Democratic Party
leaders are reluctant to endorse it. Still, it is being closely
watched by Democrats, who think it might be used in some other
races to provide a much-needed, last-minute boost.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans discount the idea that Clinton's
scandal will turn to the Democrats' advantage. But like Democrats,
few Republicans are making impeachment a major element in their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment issue is hardly a winner for the GOP, said
Georgia Representative John Linder, who heads the National
Republican Congressional Committee. Asked whether Republican
candidates should bring up the scandal, Linder responded: ``I don't
think it is a good idea'' because voters don't want to be reminded
of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls support the idea that the public is tired of the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that if you put a pro-impeachment
Republican up against a Democrat who says we shouldn't spend that
kind of time on an impeachment inquiry, the Democrat wins 2 to 1,''
said Democratic consultant Mark Mellman, who recently conducted
private polling on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, such as Clinton strategist James Carville, have
suggested the party should be far more aggressive at a time
analysts are predicting Republicans could pick up as many as 30
House seats. Republicans control the House with a 228-206 majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If folks want the direction of the country to be muck and mire
for the next year, they should vote Republican,'' Inslee said in an
interview. ``But if they want us to be dealing with health care,
Social Security, then they should vote Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Neas, a prominent civil-rights activist who is running against
Representative Connie Morella in Maryland, agreed: ``What we are
trying to do is make it a referendum on what the next two years are
going to be like. ... Voting for the impeachment inquiry is the
functional equivalent of voting for a government shutdown.''
Morella did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic Party officials are cool to the idea, and even
Mellman says it would work best only in selected races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching what impact this has,'' said Representative
Martin Frost of Texas, who heads the Democratic National Campaign
Committee. But Frost, asked whether the election should be a
referendum on Clinton, tersely responded: ``No. The answer is no. I
don't think either party benefits from making this election about
Clinton. As an overall strategy, it makes no sense to make this a
referendum on Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost, like many other Democrats, said a better strategy is to
focus on which party is best prepared to lead the nation on issues
such as Social Security, health care, and education.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy used by Inslee and Neas clearly has risks. Polls
show that most voters blame Clinton for creating his own problems
because of his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. But the polls also
show that an overwhelming majority of voters don't want Clinton to
be impeached. Thus, Inslee and Neas say the president should be
censured by Congress, but they rail against the prospect of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Inslee ad partly is based on a formula created by Clinton
himself. Like many Democratic ads, it attempts to link the GOP
candidate to Gingrich, implying that Republicans are clones of the
unpopular speaker. In the 1996 presidential campaign, the
Democratic Party ran many ads that paired Republican nominee Bob
Dole with Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But White, the Republican incumbent Inslee is trying to oust,
said his challenger's strategy won't work. In 1996, White said the
AFL-CIO ``spent $3 million on ads, $2.9 million of which attempted
to connect me to Gingrich. It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   White is quick to point out that he isn't in lockstep with
Gingrich. He said Inslee is showing desperation by running the ads.
``I think there is a reason he is the only person in the country
doing this,'' White said, before Neas unveiled his ads late last
week. ``No. 1, the public is sick of it. Two, it is a little
irresponsible to be prejudging this.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder, of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said
the anti-Gingrich strategy in the last election backfired. In 1996,
Linder said, Gingrich was cast negatively in commercials that aired
125,000 times. ``But a funny thing happened,'' Linder said.
``Voters go into the booth, and Gingrich's name is not on the
ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Linder doesn't think impeachment should be a major issue
this time around, he said Clinton's impeachment inquiry could help
Republicans. In the post-Watergate election of 1974, Linder said,
many candidates said nothing about President Nixon's resignation.
But millions of Republican voters stayed home and many more
Democrats went to the polls than usual, helping sweep a large new
class of Democrats into Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's problems will be in the back of people's minds
just as Watergate was,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde was asked last
week on CNN whether the election results should be interpreted as a
referendum on the upcoming impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say I think it will be an opportunity for America to
make a statement,'' Hyde said. ``Whether they want the status quo
or want things to change.''

   &UR; Wrinkles &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do we wrinkle as we age? What can be done about it?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Skin changes that cause wrinkles do accompany aging, but if
you really want wrinkles, smoke and get plenty of sun exposure,''
said Dr. Larry Meyer, a dermatologist and geriatrician at the
University of Utah Health Sciences Center in Salt Lake City. The
deeper layer of skin, the dermis, gets thinner with age, Meyer
said, but it happens more quickly in sun-exposed areas and in
people who smoke. The breakdown of two kinds of molecules, collagen
and elastin, is at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Collagen type 1 is the molecule that makes up the bulk of the
skin. Loss of this type of collagen, the same type found in bones,
affects the elderly, just like osteoporosis, and smoking makes both
worse. At least five studies have found that smoking is associated
with ``smoker's face,'' one that is prematurely aged by fine
wrinkles that can accentuate the coarser wrinkles that occur along
the lines of expression.
</P>
<P>
   As for elastin, the stretchy molecules that help support the
skin, ultraviolet rays cause direct damage. ``You can see elastin
broken down and clumped in chronically sun-exposed skin,'' Meyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   To help avoid wrinkles as you age, Meyer said, avoid smoking,
stay out of the sun, routinely use hats and sunscreens and use a
good moisturizer, which holds water in the dermis and plumps it up.

LOW VOTER TURNOUT SPELLS TROUBLE FOR NATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere between apathy and indifference, at the intersection
of too busy and too disgusted, reside more than 100 million
Americans _ all of them eligible to vote, but none of them likely
to do so on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   It might be chronologically fitting that as the 20th century _
America's century _ draws to a close, mid-term election turnout has
never in the nation's history been lower than it was in the
primaries that just past. According to non-partisan Committee for
the Study of the American Electorate, 17.4 of the voting age
population went to the polls _ a stunning 45 percent drop from the
disappointing 31.8 percent who voted in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout spells big trouble for the country that likes to
consider itself the World's Greatest Democracy, even though in
terms of voter turnout, it lags far behind other democractic
countries. For example, in recent elections Belgium _ where voting
is mandatory _ had 93 percent turnout. In Germany, 78 percent
turned out, and in the United Kingdom, when only 67 percent voted
there were calls for massive reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, high voter turnout is not always a good thing. Masses
flocking to the polls can signal instability. Germany, for example,
had extremely high turnout before Hitler came to power, says Joseph
S. Nye, dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. And
low voter turnout can indicate a contented electorate, not a
cynical one. But having less than 18 percent vote in primaries ``is
truly much too low for a democracy and is worrisome,'' says Nye.
</P>
<P>
   Even more blunt is Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for
the Study of American Electorate. Gans has been tracking turnout
for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing is a progressive meltdown in civic
engagement,'' he says. ``Voting is the lowest common denominator
action. If you don't vote, you certainly don't participate in
anything else. So on one level, you are losing the reservoir of
people who participate, and, on another level, you are making
politics responsive to intense interests at the expense of the
public interest. If the only people who vote are the ones who
scream the loudest, you have a bleak future for American
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout is dropping everywhere. In Britain, where about 67
percent of eligible voters (71 percent of all registered voters)
turned out for national elections last year. That number _ which
would be unheard of in the US _ resulted in calls for action. This
month, a committee in parliment released a report calling for the
study of major changes in the election system in an effort to
increase turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things to consider, according to the Home Affairs
select committee report are making voting compulsory or switching
elections to weekends rather than the weekday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that while it may not be desirable to have any
form of compulsory voting, we nevertheless consider that there
should be a public debate over this,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of people of voting has dwindled in Europe, the
trend in America is particularly troubling because demographics and
voter registration reform should indicate an upswing in
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the so-called ``motor-voter'' law made
registration easier than ever before and swelled voter registration
by more than 3.5 million. And that the more educated the person,
the more likely they are to vote and the nation has never had so
many college graduates. And the older the person, the more likely
they are to vote and as a country, we are getting older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything, in structural terms, argues for higher
participation,'' says Gans. ``Even our elections are more
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   One major difference, however, between the US and virtually
every other democracy is that in this country it is up to the
individual to register to vote. In most other countries, the
government registers individuals _ the thought is anathama in the
US _ because it tracks where they live. In places like Britain and
Canada, expensive voter registration efforts are conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Even more controversial is compulsory voting, but the fact is it
works. It is practiced in Belgium, which has the highest voter
turnout in Europe, and has been embraced from Australia to Greece,
where, after all, democracy was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Arend Lijphart, a professor of political science at the
University of California San Diego and the former president of the
American Political Science Association, has been advocating for
compulsory voting in the US for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Considering voting a civic duty, much like serving on a jury,
rather than a right one can chose to ignore, would increase
participation, he says. In other countries, nominal fines can be
levied on those who fail to show up at the polls, but in most cases
the fines are waived. While some would consider forcing anyone to
vote as un-American _ after all having the right to vote implies
having the right not to vote _ Lijphart points out that if the
requirement is simply to show up at the polling place and have your
name crossed off, individuals do not have to vote if they don't
want to. ``But is the act voting that burdensome? It really isn't.
It is just that people are lazy.'' Furthermore, even if receiving a
ballot was a requirement there could be no enforcement of how it is
filled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one magic bullet, it is compulsory voting,'' says
Rob Richie, executive director of the Center for Voting and
Democracy. ``Certainly, as a theoretical proposition I would like
to see it thought about and debated.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between the US and most other democracies is
how the voting is done. Here it is winner take all, there it is
done by proportional representation, so if your party wins 10
percent of the vote, your party gets 10 percent of the seats. In
that system, fewer votes are ``wasted'' and ``it creates a dynamic
where parties are getting the voters out and they believe they have
a real choice,'' says Richie.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, there had been proportional representation in
the 1996 election in Massachusetts, three of the 10 Congressional
seats would have gone to Republicans since they garnered 30 percent
of the vote. And it is hihgly likely there would be someone in the
state delagation other than a white male.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists say proportional representation generally
increases voter turnout by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two other changes that some advocate for could also increase
turnout. One is rescheduling voting from a weekday to a weekend
when people have more free time. Such a change, says Lijphart,
would add another 5 percent or 6 percent to voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing mail-in voting, which is gaining in popularity, would
add another 4 percentage points, he says.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum in Oregon this year will determine wheter all
elections should be done by postage rather than polling places. For
the past decade, the state has been using mail-in balloting in many
elections. Supporters say it is easier and increases participation.
Those opposing it say participation might go up in part because it
would be easier to vote early and often. Furthermore, they contend,
not having the sanctity and privacy of the voting booth will result
in increased coersion.
</P>
<P>
   Gans, however, thinks something more fundamental is needed than
so many cosemetic changes. Something like regulation of campaign
advertisements. ``You see what being the only advanced democracy
that does not regulate advertising on television has done.''
Campaign ads, he says, fuel cynicism, voter alienation and
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ` We need to address the civic illiteracy and control
indisriminate television watching. If we do not address the big
things that are causing the problem, we will continue to see
declines.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability of Americans to register themselves, or get to the
polls, or ask for an absentee ballot to mail in, not only dilutes
democracy in this country, it also subverts our efforts to advocate
for election reform in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the US State Department criticized Indonesia's
tightly controlled parlimentary elections in 1997 _ in which 90
percent of the people voted _ saying ``Indonesians citizens do not
have the ability to change their government through democratic
means'' and the country ``should move towards a political system in
whcih the will of the people can be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the United States has ever had this percentage
of voter turnout,'' sniffed Abu Hasan Sazilli, a member of
parliment. ``Therefore, the United States should learn from
Indonesia about the implementation of elections ...(and) how to
encourage eligible voters to cast their ballots conscientiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch!

   &UR; Behind That Steady Gaze &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In filmmaking, jitter-free hand-held shots are made possible by
the Steadicam, a spring-and-pulley contraption that keeps the
camera still no matter how much its operator moves around.
</P>
<P>
   The head of a common blowfly, it turns out, is something of a
Steadicam itself, enabling the fly to fix its gaze, at least
momentarily, and reducing the effects of all that buzzig around.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Dutch researcher writing in the journal Nature,
the insect stabilizes its gaze by moving its head later, and
faster, than its body. The result is shorter periods when the head
is moving and vision is blurred, and longer periods when the head
is stable and the fly can see well enough to analyze its
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   And when a fly makes a banked turn, the body rolls one way but
the head rolls another. The fly's eyes move very little in relation
to their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Filtering Out Odor &LR;
</P>
<P>
   How are you going to keep an odor down on the farm? Try a
low-tech air filter.
</P>
<P>
   Using a technique developed in Canada, researchers at the
University of North Dakota have reduced the smell from a two-acre
lagoon of hog manure by covering it with a mat of barley straw up
to a foot thick. Odor-causing chemicals like ammonia, sulfides and
volatile organic acids waft up through the mat, where
microorganisms naturally present in the straw break them down.
</P>
<P>
   The mat is created by shooting the straw over the lagoon using a
kind of cannon (barley straw is suited because it floats). In the
fall, when the manure is pumped out to be spread on fields, the
straw goes with it after being chopped up by blades.
</P>
<P>
   The North Dakota researchers have also developed a filter to
reduce the aroma from hog barns, stacking bales outside a barn near
its ventilating fans. The straw acts like a particulate filter,
removing hog dander and barn dust.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Chip off the Shelf &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The largest iceberg in a decade has broken off an ice shelf in
Antarctica. At 90 miles long and 30 miles wide, it is as if
Delaware suddenly weighed anchor and put out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   The ice, which calved off the Ronne Ice Shelf about 1,400 miles
south of Tierra del Fuego, will not get very far, however,
according to the National Ice Center, the agency that noticed the
berg in a satellite photo last Tuesday. It is hemmed in by hundreds
of miles of pack ice; some icebergs in the same area have been
trapped for a decade. And by the time the new berg does make it
out, it will most likely have broken up into smaller chunks,
accelerating the melting.

WORLD'S LONGEST ESCALATOR CREATES MULTIETHNIC COMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ From his perch on the steps outside a glitzy health
club and across from a dusty Chinese souvenir shop, 73-year-old
Chan Bo spends every afternoon watching Hong Kong's fast-paced life
go by _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   His supreme people-watching spot is just a few yards from the
world's longest escalator, on which every day 34,000
business-suited and high-heeled commuters glide up and down a steep
mountainside, past hidden alleys and untold secrets of old
communities they once bypassed in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Chan has seen Hong Kong evolve from a sleepy, segregated port
town where laborers carried colonials up a back-breaking mountain
by sedan chair, into a postmodern, racially integrated financial
capital crowded with buses, trolleys, and Mercedeses. And even with
his failing eyesight, Chan has noticed a dramatic change in his own
neighborhood since the Central to Mid-levels Hillside Escalator
opened five years ago last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've built a lot up here. There are a lot of people, a lot
more business,'' said Chan, who had to move out of his run-down
apartment to make way for a restaurant capitalizing on the
popularity of a neighborhood that used to be off the beaten path
because of ladder-steep streets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere in Hong Kong is the collision of old and new
worlds more evident than along the route of the escalator. The
2,620-foot series of some 20 linked, moving stairways was meant to
alleviate road traffic by connecting downtown with a residential
neighborhood higher up Victoria Peak. In the process, expatriate
foot traffic through a once-sheltered Chinese neighborhood has
created a multiethnic community along the slope.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of 156 years of British rule on July 1, 1997, some
locals worried that the territory's East-meets-West appeal would
dry up with the gradual ``mainlandization'' of Hong Kong, or the
exodus of anxious expatriates. But the fact that the mixed
neighborhood under the raised walkway has thrived since then seems
to have made a lie of that dire prediction.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that the century-old Peak Tram funicular is a
symbol of old colonial life, the escalator has become an emblem of
the new Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionable restaurants catering to yuppies have sprung up near
old ``dai pai dongs,'' or food stalls selling $1.50 bowls of
porridge and 50-cent sticks of fried bread. Chinese medicine shops
and temples sit alongside chic salons and wine shops. Residents
brag that the neighborhood now dubbed ``SoHo'' _ South of Hollywood
Road _ embodies the spirit of post-colonial Hong Kong: striving,
changing and decidedly international, even as it embraces its
Chinese roots.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jervis Chaston, 27, a lawyer who just moved from London,
loves the ``welcoming, inner-city feel. It's Eastern enough to be
exciting, but it's still got the convenience of restaurants where
you recognize what you're ordering.''
</P>
<P>
   The escalator runs from 6 a.m. to midnight, and it takes 20
minutes to ride the whole length if you don't get off anywhere to
look around. Since there is just one staircase, it switches
direction at 10 a.m., after most commuters have made it down. And
in a city where living carries a hefty price tag, riding the $26.5
million escalator is, surprisingly, free.
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of the journey passes over a still shabby part of
the hillside, populated with crumbling low-rise apartments with
washing hanging out windows and chicken coops on balconies.
Bare-bones Chinese restaurants serve up $2 meals on plastic plates
to value-conscious locals.
</P>
<P>
   There are some merchants such as Martin Lam, third-generation
owner of Good Spring herbal medicine shop, who say that while the
escalator has meant the flowering of Soho further up the line, it
has hurt business near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people now just go up the escalator to their destination
instead of walking up the street, so we miss the old foot
traffic,'' said Lam, 26, whose grandfather opened the shop in 1916.
Nearby, hidden under the raised gray walkway, is a spot Lam says
has been vacant for three years, because the escalator blocks any
rider's view of the storefront.
</P>
<P>
   Lam's shop is still crowded, however, with Chinese businessmen
on mobile phones collecting prescriptions of bark and deer antlers,
and tourists enthusiastically photographing the mysterious jars of
dried roots and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Good Spring's oldest outlet was bulldozed to make way for the
escalator, and plans are afoot to knock down some dilapidated
apartment blocks beside the walkway. But Lam says such change is a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is doing something to improve the area; you
can't disagree,'' he said. ``And the coexistence (of Chinese and
foreign businesses) is good, because that's `East meets West.' It's
also good that we can bring our culture to foreigners from all
parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Tao, owner of Leader &AMP; Co. stationery store, complains of
competition from merchants up the hill who used to be inaccessible
to shoppers without hiking boots. Tao recalls that a master of
``feng shui,'' the Chinese art of arranging objects and buildings
to take advantage of Earth's natural forces, warned her that a
cloud of good fortune in the lower area would ``go up the escalator
and move up the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the hill is New York Fitness, a fancy gym with a huge
picture window, through which clients watch Hong Kongers _ old and
young, construction workers and clergy, Europeans and Chinese _
roll by like characters in an old movie. Every morning, the gym's
Irish general manager, Tony Smyth, watches Filipino maids and old
Chinese ladies stand with their groceries and gossip until the
escalator switches direction so they can ride back uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth, 33, worries that as the neighborhood becomes fashionable,
construction might occur that doesn't respect ``the old-world
charm.'' One historic neighbor is Central Police Station, built in
1919, and one of the oldest colonial complexes in Hong Kong.
Another is the green-and-white Jamia Mosque from 1915.
</P>
<P>
   But the upside of the trendiness, Smyth said, is the multitude
``of cuisines available _ Scandinavian, Middle Eastern, Vietnamese,
Nepalese. People can eat anything in this neighborhood and then
come here to work it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pricey restaurants along the cobblestoned slope have odd
neighbors, though, in clanking old print shops and in street
vendors who smash coconuts on the road before disposing of the
fibers in the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere else in the world, a posh restaurant would try to
kick out something that's not good for their image, or they
wouldn't locate there,'' Smyth said. ``Here, it's part of being in
a residential area with small local businesses that have been here
for generations. That's part of the charm.''
</P>
<P>
   What residents don't like is the lack of privacy that comes with
having tens of thousands of people glide by one's windows every
day.
</P>
<P>
   As in Wayne Wang's recent movie ``Chinese Box,'' which was
partly filmed here, escalator-riders can peep into people's lives,
spotting fathers lounging in T-shirts, pots boiling on the stove,
and couples arguing with flailing arms.
</P>
<P>
   One appreciates the spirit of the neighborhood when watching
Bill Lee, manager of Staunton Street Patisserie, who leans out his
windowsill and calls out to regular customers of all races in both
English and Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different kinds of people live here alongside the traditional
Chinese way of living _ and we get on pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee added with a wink, ``Maybe better than in Boston.''

Lewinsky is going to get it on with Frank Gifford.''
</P>
<P>

Hillary were going to be apart this weekend on their 23rd wedding
anniversary, they celebrated it early. Apparently, they had the
foresight to celebrate it in 1985.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize were announced
and one of the winners is from Brooklyn. He was the one quoted as
saying, 'Yo, I won a freakin' Nobel Prize.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, Cindy Crawford was spotted in New York having a
fortune teller read the lines on her palm, which is odd because
Cindy Crawford is the reason most men no longer have lines on their
palm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During a fund-raiser in Minneapolis, Vice President Al Gore
accidentally called Minneapolis 'Missouri.' After the mistake, the
crowd accidentally started calling Al Gore 'Dan Quayle.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to newly released documents, last year Kenneth Starr
made $1.2 million from his legal practice and his family assets
total $4.5 million. When asked about it, Starr said, 'Hey, can't a
guy have a private life?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``TV News _ the skirts on the show 'Ally McBeal' are an inch
shorter this year and the ratings are up. Which means the show will
be really popular five years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the 'Washington Post,' the other day Linda Tripp
was spotted at a mall asking for advice on how she could apply her
makeup better. Apparently the salesperson thought about it for a
second and then sent Tripp to the hat department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde said he wants the
impeachment inquiry to focus on three core charges. After hearing
this, President Clinton asked, 'Hard core or soft core?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky has told friend of hers that she wants this
whole thing to be over so she can live a normal life. Reportedly
Monica went on to say, 'I'd just like to meet a nice married
congressman and settle down.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nashville Network is bringing Roller Derby back to TV and
they said they've already signed up 100 women. In a related story,
President Clinton accepted the resignation of Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, an American Airlines flight had to land early at
Kennedy Airport because a large bird got caught in one of the
engines. A spokesman said everything's fine now and they'll be
serving the bird on their next flight.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, more popular than ever. Hillary is now more popular
than ever before. According to a new poll, 67% of men would love to
have Hillary Clinton as a wife. Well sure, look what you could get
away with!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big rumor is that Monica Lewinsky is coming back home here
to California. I don't know if she's gonna become an actress or
not, but she's certainly got the audition part down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home-run king Mark McGwire, gonna be featured on boxes of
Wheaties. I also read today that the Washington Redskins team will
be pictured on the containers of Tidy Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NBA -- which stands for ``No Basketball Anymore'' _
they cancelled the first two weeks of its season after labor talks.
Instead of canceling most of the game, why not just cancel the
first three quarters of every game? The fourth quarter's the only
part of the game you care about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Geo Metro has been named the most fuel-efficient car in
America. It's amazing how much gas you can save when people are
pushing you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three American scientists have won this year's Nobel Prize in
medicine for discoveries that led to the development of Viagra. I

MARYLAND CONSERVATIVE PLAYS DOWN ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ Ellen Sauerbrey ran for governor in 1994 like
women used to run: Little money, no big-name endorsements, no
attack ads, and no clue how to close the gender gap that plagues
many Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent painted me as someone who was going to shut down
the schools, pave the Chesapeake Bay, and turn criminals out onto
the street,'' said Sauerbrey, a former state legislator who lost
narrowly last time and is in a rematch with Maryland's Democratic
Governor Parris Glendening this fall. ``I didn't have the ability
to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the conservative Sauerbrey is playing down her
opposition to abortion and gun control, emphasizing such issues as
education and economic security that appeal to women, and
capitalizing on the image that female politicians are not only more
pragmatic than men, but have more character and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy is working _ polls show her race a dead
heat _ and Sauerbrey seems to be proving that candidates don't need
a feminist agenda to woo women voters as long as they have a good
message and set the right moral tone.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the candidates who champion women's rights are
struggling in 1998. Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California
and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois are scrambling to catch
challengers. Both were elected in 1992's so-called Year of the
Woman, when a record number of female candidates were swept into
statewide offices with the help of women outraged over Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice presidential nominee
who was expected to be a formidable Senate candidate in New York
this year, lost in the Democratic primary. Eight-term
Representative Barbara Kennelly, a Democrat, entered the race for
governor of Connecticut last year with an odds-on chance to beat
incumbent John Rowland. A recent University of Connecticut poll
shows her trailing by 37 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women aren't the campaign novelty that they once were, and
they will lose if they portray themselves simply as female
messengers,'' said Jennifer Burton, a political consultant to
Democrats. ``They have to be message-deliverers because women
voters have moved on to connect with the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Sauerbrey has targeted women's groups and brought a
host of top Republicans, including former president George Bush and
Elizabeth Dole, into Maryland on her behalf. Though she has
received no support from Emily's List, the political action
committee that helps women candidates who favor abortion rights,
Sauerbrey has raised and spent more money than the governor. She
also has put the governor on the defensive for what she calls his
flip-flops, including inviting, disinviting, and reinviting
President Clinton to campaign with him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant for Sauerbrey, the gender gap _ the
difference between men and women in voting behavior _ has narrowed
in her race. Polls conducted for the Baltimore Sun show that
Sauerbrey's support among women voters has grown in the last three
months to 42 percent from 34 percent, while Glendening's has
slipped to 46 percent from 53 percent. In 1994, Glendening won
because of the gender gap: He got 57 percent of the female vote,
compared with 44 percent of the male vote.
</P>
<P>
   Generally the gender gap has benefited Democrats, because women
have been more loyal to Democratic candidates and turn out in
greater numbers than men.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Linda DiVall says the GOP recognizes its
gender-gap problems and is working to overcome them. ``The 1996
elections taught Republicans that they cannot ignore the issues
women care about, which are education, health care, safety, and
income security,'' DiVall said. ``This year, there is very little
difference between Democrats and Republicans on what these key
issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   While analysts cannot agree on how President Clinton's affair
with Monica S. Lewinsky and Congress's vote to open an impeachment
inquiry will play with the voters, there is a general consensus
that women candidates could benefit from public weariness with the
scandal. ``Women voters want to move on, and women candidates are
viewed as being better able than men to get things done and find
common ground,'' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
   This year 10 women are running for the US Senate, but only one
newcomer, Democrat Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, is expected to win.
A record 121 women are seeking US House seats, but the number of
female representatives is not expected to grow much, particularly
because four women are not seeking reelection.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for women seeking governorships is somewhat
brighter. Incumbent Governors Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire
Democrat, and Jane Dee Hull, an Arizona Republican, look secure in
their races. Women are either ahead or in contests too close to
call for governorships in Hawaii, Colorado, Nevada, Rhode Island,
and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Women are candidates in 25 of the 30 races for lieutenant
governor this fall. One, Jane Swift, is the Republican running for
the office in Massachusetts. In Maryland, Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend, daughter of the late Robert Kennedy, is on the Democratic
ticket, seeking reelection as lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum last week for small business owners in Rockville, a
District of Columbia suburb, Sauerbrey portrayed herself as
solution-oriented and trustworthy. She told the group of men and
women she would cut regulatory red tape and create a friendlier
climate for businesses to grow, and she endorsed programs that give
women and minorities preferential treatment for government
contracts because ``the playing field is not level yet.''
</P>
<P>
   She also stressed the need for improving schools in Maryland,
saying she is particularly sensitive to the education issue because
she was once a biology teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But Glendening's television ads call Sauerbrey a right-wing
conservative because of her opposition to abortion and gun control,
and her ideology seeps into her pitch on education. More children
misbehave in school these days, she said, because they have been in
day care and raised with both parents working outside the home. Tax
and social policies must be made friendly to two-parent families,
and more after-school programs are needed to ``keep kids from
running on the streets,'' Sauerbrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a teenager, and I think what she says about education
and the family makes sense,'' said Mary Brooks, a banker who
attended the Rockville forum. ``I like her because she is honest
and direct and seems determined to take issues down to brass
tacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendening's most important weapon in the final weeks may well
be Townsend, who is taking a high-visibility role. Townsend, known
as something of a policy wonk, appears in almost all of the
governor's television ads, and she has a busy public schedule that
puts her before many women's groups to talk about children, health,
and crime. ``Remember, we do have a great governor running, too,''
said a Glendening press spokesman when asked how to find Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' Sauerbrey said. ``For four years, no one
knew where Kathleen was. Now, suddenly, she's joined at Parris's
hip, and the reason is clear. His polls, like our polls, show she
is a lot more popular than he is.''

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton spent her 23rd wedding anniversary at a
women's conference in Bulgaria. She said, 'I just wanted to be
someplace where I could feel sexy.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new report shows that the pregnancy rate for the nation's
teenage girls is at a 20-year low. Officials warn that this trend
may not last because of the work stoppage in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The five-day waiting period to buy a handgun will now be
replaced by an instant computerized background check. The NRA
applauds the development saying, 'Now people will no longer have to
wait five days to settle family disputes.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports say that former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
would like to move to New York. Gentlemen, start your engines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fires have destroyed many of Florida's most lucrative crops,
including marijuana. This has resulted in millions of dollars of
losses and hundreds of very paranoid firemen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian groups are protesting Terrence McNally's new play
'Corpus Cristi' about a gay Jesus. Christian leaders are reportedly
outraged saying, 'Jesus wasn't gay; Judas kissed him.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arab and Muslim groups are protesting the new Bruce Willis
movie 'The Siege' in which New York City is placed under martial
law after terrorist bombings by Arabs. Did I miss something? Who
bombed the World Trade Center? The cast of 'Caroline in the City?'
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so this is what it comes to. Now you can't show any
criminal unless it is a white guy in a suit. I saw a movie about
the Crips the other night starring Greg Kinnear and Jonathan Taylor
Thomas.''

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I recently took my 3-year-old daughter, Dorielle, to Harry's
Shoe Store on Broadway and 83rd Street to buy her first Mary Janes.
As I was paying for them, the clerk gave her a green balloon with
the store name on it. I wanted to tie the string of the balloon to
her wrist, but being an independent young lady, she insisted on
holding it in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   We started walking to the next corner, to Barnes &AMP; Noble for
some books, when a breeze lifted the balloon. Dorielle was in
tears, crying inconsolably as she watched it go higher and higher.
I explained the ways of balloons, and pointed out that next time
she should listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   We went up to the children's section of the bookstore, on the
second floor, Dorielle still not consoled. A woman came up and
asked, ``Are you the little girl who lost her balloon?'' and handed
her an identical one from the same shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   How did the woman know what happened, I asked. She said she had
been sitting in her car in front of the shoe store and when she saw
what happened, ran in and got another balloon. As she saw the
direction we were headed, she guessed we might be looking at
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She left one happy child and one flabbergasted mother.

   Rose Rudnitski returned on an overnight flight from a trip to
Brazil and got off the shuttle bus at the long-term parking lot at
Kennedy International Airport. When she arrived at her car, she
discovered her ignition and trunk keys prominently displayed on top
of the car trunk. They had apparently fallen off her key ring when
she parked and, as it was a rainy day when she left and she had
been in a rush, she hadn't noticed. Obviously, someone walking by
had spotted the keys on the ground and carefully put them in a more
noticeable position. Who would believe that the car remained
undisturbed? Call it a true New York miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard by Deborah Goldberg at the Guggenheim Museum during
the recent ``Art of the Motorcycle'' exhibition: ``I always thought
this would make a good garage.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My daughter Ellen recently attended her first evening parenting
class. The following afternoon she was running errands and told her
4-year-old son, Matthew, to get in the car and put on his seat
belt. He refused to put on the belt. After some failed
negotiations, my daughter became frustrated and started screaming
at him. Matthew looked at her and announced, ``You really didn't
learn anything from your class last night.''

<P>
   As a newly arrived young immigrant in New York several years
ago, I was horrified at the notices I saw all over the city. It was
when terrorism in Ireland was a day-to-day reality and well before
talk of a peace treaty. We had been brought up with stories of
money being sent from America to help support the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea of the extent of the support and how much money
must have been involved until I saw notices in every bank window to
``put your money into an IRA account.''
</P>
<P>
   I was sick about it and couldn't inquire of anyone as I was an
illegal immigrant at the time. I felt I must be the only person in
the city who didn't support the IRA. I wrote home telling my family
that things were much worse than we imagined.
</P>
<P>
   When I became legal and began working in a publishing firm,
someone in personnel asked me to fill in a form that had the
ominous question: ``Do you want to put money into an IRA account?''
I finally found out what it was all about.

   Selma Rudnick was trying to get a cab in midtown. There wasn't
an unoccupied one in sight, and after some time she decided to give
up and take a bus. She was short a dime, and asked a young woman
standing in front of her whether the drivers took pennies. The
woman didn't know but another woman in line, who had heard the
exchange, pressed a dime in her hand and refused the pennies in
exchange. Just then Ms. Rudnick spotted a cab a short way down the
block and, still clutching her donated dime, she ran for it. As the
cab sailed by the bus line, the good Samaritan looked disillusioned
_ so it was only a dime but was this a new scam she had fallen for?
Ms. Rudnick wants her to know that she couldn't resist that cab _
her feet were killing her, she said.

<P>
   Teen-ager No 1: ``You don't have to be Jewish. I'm having one,

   A recent pleasant day at noon. I sat on a bench facing the
Hudson River at Battery Park City. As I unwrapped my sandwich, a
bird, chirping loudly, landed on the railing in front of me. I
threw a small portion of focaccia to the pavement. The bird
approached it, pecked at the morsel several times and flew away. I
continued eating, offended that my gourmet sandwich was seemingly
not good enough for this sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the same bird returned with its baby, barely old
enough to fly. The mother bird proceeded to pull small pieces from
the morsel and place them in the young bird's open beak, feeding
the baby before helping herself. Then, apparently satisfied, the
two flew away. A male sparrow, who had been watching from the
sidelines, then felt entitled to come over and help himself to what
was left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicious noon meal for all of us.

</P>
<P>
   A California man just won a contest by growing a 974-pound
pumpkin. Apparently it was the gourd equivalent of the Ken Starr
report.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Richard Holbrooke has an agreement with Slobodan
Milosevic, maybe he can get back to the U.S. and end the lockout of
NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   The UN resolution on Kosovo was No. 1199. No wonder it took so
long to get a deal. That's backward for dialing 9 for an outside
line and then 9-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The hot new toy for the holiday season is called Furby. Toy
stores, we suspect, will end up calling it Tickle Me Cash Register.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has dreamed up a new word meaning betrayal of a friend's
confidence _ entrippment. Where does this happen? In Washington,
DCeit.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``has been a special part of
this country from its inception.'' That's another reason to avoid
politics. You end up saying such embarrassing things.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's approval rating in the polls is much higher than
the rating for Congress. Yes, but in Congress you have 535 people
making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats are feeling a bit better now about their
chances in November. In fact, they may not have to called
mid-termination elections.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence from Mars show it's a violent planet where winds
can blow 350 mph. Sounds like Capitol Hill, but without the
duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel prize in physics this year has gone to scientists who
discovered how electrons can change their behavior. It's not
electrons we're worried about, it's elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is more than a process.'' Right.
For instance, for negotiators it's job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more success out in the country and maybe out in the
world than I have in Washington,'' Mr. Clinton says. But we're not
sure if he meant on public issues or with women.
</P>
<P>
   The president says his job now ``is to work in the next few days
to work to cross party lines to do the work that we have to do
here.'' Who'd want his job? It's just work, work, work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my experience,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``the right thing
to do is the right thing to do.'' Based on our experience, uh,
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into a world that is smaller and smaller and
faster and faster,'' Mr. Clinton says. No wonder we feel out of
synch. We're getting larger and slower.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal agencies still are scrambling to avoid those Year
2000 computer problems. If the Pentagon doesn't make it, will we
have to fight World War I over again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is now passing through one of the most difficult and
complex periods in its history,'' says its prime minister.
Translation: This isn't his fault.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows two-thirds of Americans believe their
representative in the U.S. House should be re-elected. Until they
get it right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen activities,'' says Hillary Rodham Clinton, are
``necessary preconditions for true democratic values.'' Well, as
long as the citizen's spouse knows about them.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy next door is almost set for Halloween, but isn't
sure which would be scarier to be _ Ken Starr or Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, says Aunt Ilse from Oelwein, is that this year's
Nobel peace prize didn't go to whoever kept Hillary from killing
Bill.

</P>
<P>
   ``It has been reported that coverage of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal may be hurting the ratings for 'Monday Night Football.'
That should all change next week because during halftime, Monica
Lewinsky is going to get it on with Frank Gifford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House said that because President Clinton and
Hillary were going to be apart this weekend on their 23rd wedding
anniversary, they celebrated it early. Apparently, they had the
foresight to celebrate it in 1985.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize were announced
and one of the winners is from Brooklyn. He was the one quoted as
saying, 'Yo, I won a freakin' Nobel Prize.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, Cindy Crawford was spotted in New York having a
fortune teller read the lines on her palm, which is odd because
Cindy Crawford is the reason most men no longer have lines on their
palm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During a fund-raiser in Minneapolis, Vice President Al Gore
accidentally called Minneapolis 'Missouri.' After the mistake, the
crowd accidentally started calling Al Gore 'Dan Quayle.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to newly released documents, last year Kenneth Starr
made $1.2 million from his legal practice and his family assets
total $4.5 million. When asked about it, Starr said, 'Hey, can't a
guy have a private life?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``TV News _ the skirts on the show 'Ally McBeal' are an inch
shorter this year and the ratings are up. Which means the show will
be really popular five years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the 'Washington Post,' the other day Linda Tripp
was spotted at a mall asking for advice on how she could apply her
makeup better. Apparently the salesperson thought about it for a
second and then sent Tripp to the hat department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde said he wants the
impeachment inquiry to focus on three core charges. After hearing
this, President Clinton asked, 'Hard core or soft core?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky has told friend of hers that she wants this
whole thing to be over so she can live a normal life. Reportedly
Monica went on to say, 'I'd just like to meet a nice married
congressman and settle down.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nashville Network is bringing Roller Derby back to TV and
they said they've already signed up 100 women. In a related story,
President Clinton accepted the resignation of Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, an American Airlines flight had to land early at
Kennedy Airport because a large bird got caught in one of the
engines. A spokesman said everything's fine now and they'll be
serving the bird on their next flight.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, more popular than ever. Hillary is now more popular
than ever before. According to a new poll, 67% of men would love to
have Hillary Clinton as a wife. Well sure, look what you could get
away with!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big rumor is that Monica Lewinsky is coming back home here
to California. I don't know if she's gonna become an actress or
not, but she's certainly got the audition part down.''

BENIGNI-FILM (Los Angeles) _ ``Life Is Beautiful'' is about a
father who shields his son from the brutal reality of life in a
concentration camp by pretending that the whole thing is just part
of a contest to win an army tank. This unlikely comedy from Italian
director Roberto Benigni won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, won
the the People's Choice Award at Toronto and is likely to be one of
this year's Oscar foreign film nominees. By Bob Strauss.

SHANKAR (Los Angeles) _ She talks like your basic Southern
California beach teen, but possesses with one of the great names

when she picks up a sitar to play with her famed father, Ravi, on
tours and now on a debut album that hits stores Tuesday. By David

PROVIDING GOOD SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS ON WANE

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. We were supposed to have a customer service
training program, but it was abruptly canceled, supposedly to save
money. I don't see it that way. I think our company is downplaying
customer service, and this is just part of it. Have you heard of
this happening in other companies? N.A. &QL; 
A. Although customer service is not on the endangered species list,
it does seem to be moving in that direction. There is a growing
number of articles indicating that companies are not as enchanted
with providing good customer service as they used to be. The bottom
line is that some companies seem to be finding that service is not
contributing much to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that operate on a more bare-bones basis with light
customer service seem to be drawing in customers and revenue by the
truckload, while those that place major emphasis on service find
that they spend too much time and money smiling, taking back
``never worn'' costly goods, and letting the customer always be
right, even when the customer is definitely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Another emerging trend in this area is the idea that it is
somehow chic to be nasty or surly to customers. There is some sort
of a snob appeal associated with this type of treatment, and this
supposedly makes the company and its products more intriguing and
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what is really happening is that the pendulum is now
starting to swing back from heavy emphasis on customer service to a
more balanced approach. However, companies that are cutting back
need to be careful because that swinging pendulum could hit them
very hard. &QL; 
Q. What do you do with a boss who yells, hurls insults left and
right, and is never satisfied? He can be normal and even friendly
sometimes, but most of the time he is out of control. How do you
deal with this type of person? M.N. &QL; 
A. Rather than asking how to deal with this type of person, the
real question is why are you dealing with this type of person? No
employee should be subjected to these outbursts. Are there some
incredibly compelling reasons forcing you to stay on this job?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like your boss went into the ``terrible 2's'' and
never emerged. Although most children pass through this stage, most
adults do not. In fact, as they age, it often gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is making your boss act this way is far beyond anything
you can change. Perhaps years of therapy could unearth whatever may
be causing his behavior, but that is not your job.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that every job has certain givens that are not
likely to change, and your boss's personality is one of them. You
can approach him after he has settled down and tell him how you
feel and that you want these outbursts to stop. He may even agree
with you, although he may just as easily flip into his yelling
mode.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss does not change, perhaps you should consider doing
so and let him find another baby sitter. &QL; 
Q. I was a sociology instructor in a community college, but my
position was eliminated for budgetary reasons, and the potential to
rehire is very grim. The problem is that I would like to teach
again full-time. I have been consulting in nursing homes, but this
is not as fulfilling as teaching. People tout the wonders of
independent contractors, but I run into more people who are on the
edge of survival, educated and without medical benefits or sick
time. What are we to do? E.B. &QL; 
A. As an independent contractor, you are not only the manufacturing
and shipping department, you are many other departments as well,
including sales and marketing, research and development, and
finance, to name just a few. Is this really what you want to do?
</P>
<P>
   If you want to continue as an independent contractor, it's time
for your marketing department to spring into action. Look carefully
at the range of professional services that you can provide and then
consider contacting as many appropriate organizations as possible.
It may also be worthwhile to take some business development
classes.
</P>
<P>
   You should also consider affiliating with other independent
contractors, as well as contacting some of the relatively new
consulting firms that form alliances with independent contractor
consultants on a negotiated fee basis.
</P>
<P>
   However, rather than being motivated to build a business, it
sounds like your motivations are focused on building others. If you
want any semblance of job satisfaction, you should go where your
motivations take you, and that is probably to a classroom.

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton spent her 23rd wedding anniversary at a
women's conference in Bulgaria. She said, 'I just wanted to be
someplace where I could feel sexy.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new report shows that the pregnancy rate for the nation's
teenage girls is at a 20-year low. Officials warn that this trend
may not last because of the work stoppage in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The five-day waiting period to buy a handgun will now be
replaced by an instant computerized background check. The NRA
applauds the development saying, 'Now people will no longer have to
wait five days to settle family disputes.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports say that former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
would like to move to New York. Gentlemen, start your engines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fires have destroyed many of Florida's most lucrative crops,
including marijuana. This has resulted in millions of dollars of
losses and hundreds of very paranoid firemen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian groups are protesting Terrence McNally's new play
'Corpus Cristi' about a gay Jesus. Christian leaders are reportedly
outraged saying, 'Jesus wasn't gay; Judas kissed him.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arab and Muslim groups are protesting the new Bruce Willis
movie 'The Siege' in which New York City is placed under martial
law after terrorist bombings by Arabs. Did I miss something? Who
bombed the World Trade Center? The cast of 'Caroline in the City?'
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so this is what it comes to. Now you can't show any
criminal unless it is a white guy in a suit. I saw a movie about
the Crips the other night starring Greg Kinnear and Jonathan Taylor
Thomas.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I recently took my 3-year-old daughter, Dorielle, to Harry's
Shoe Store on Broadway and 83rd Street to buy her first Mary Janes.
As I was paying for them, the clerk gave her a green balloon with
the store name on it. I wanted to tie the string of the balloon to
her wrist, but being an independent young lady, she insisted on
holding it in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   We started walking to the next corner, to Barnes &AMP; Noble for
some books, when a breeze lifted the balloon. Dorielle was in
tears, crying inconsolably as she watched it go higher and higher.
I explained the ways of balloons, and pointed out that next time
she should listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   We went up to the children's section of the bookstore, on the
second floor, Dorielle still not consoled. A woman came up and
asked, ``Are you the little girl who lost her balloon?'' and handed
her an identical one from the same shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   How did the woman know what happened, I asked. She said she had
been sitting in her car in front of the shoe store and when she saw
what happened, ran in and got another balloon. As she saw the
direction we were headed, she guessed we might be looking at
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She left one happy child and one flabbergasted mother.

   Rose Rudnitski returned on an overnight flight from a trip to
Brazil and got off the shuttle bus at the long-term parking lot at
Kennedy International Airport. When she arrived at her car, she
discovered her ignition and trunk keys prominently displayed on top
of the car trunk. They had apparently fallen off her key ring when
she parked and, as it was a rainy day when she left and she had
been in a rush, she hadn't noticed. Obviously, someone walking by
had spotted the keys on the ground and carefully put them in a more
noticeable position. Who would believe that the car remained
undisturbed? Call it a true New York miracle.

   Overheard by Deborah Goldberg at the Guggenheim Museum during
the recent ``Art of the Motorcycle'' exhibition: ``I always thought
this would make a good garage.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My daughter Ellen recently attended her first evening parenting
class. The following afternoon she was running errands and told her
4-year-old son, Matthew, to get in the car and put on his seat
belt. He refused to put on the belt. After some failed
negotiations, my daughter became frustrated and started screaming
at him. Matthew looked at her and announced, ``You really didn't
learn anything from your class last night.''

   _ SHEILA KAHN
</P>
<P>
   As a newly arrived young immigrant in New York several years
ago, I was horrified at the notices I saw all over the city. It was
when terrorism in Ireland was a day-to-day reality and well before
talk of a peace treaty. We had been brought up with stories of
money being sent from America to help support the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea of the extent of the support and how much money
must have been involved until I saw notices in every bank window to
``put your money into an IRA account.''
</P>
<P>
   I was sick about it and couldn't inquire of anyone as I was an
illegal immigrant at the time. I felt I must be the only person in
the city who didn't support the IRA. I wrote home telling my family
that things were much worse than we imagined.
</P>
<P>
   When I became legal and began working in a publishing firm,
someone in personnel asked me to fill in a form that had the
ominous question: ``Do you want to put money into an IRA account?''
I finally found out what it was all about.

   Selma Rudnick was trying to get a cab in midtown. There wasn't
an unoccupied one in sight, and after some time she decided to give
up and take a bus. She was short a dime, and asked a young woman
standing in front of her whether the drivers took pennies. The
woman didn't know but another woman in line, who had heard the
exchange, pressed a dime in her hand and refused the pennies in
exchange. Just then Ms. Rudnick spotted a cab a short way down the
block and, still clutching her donated dime, she ran for it. As the
cab sailed by the bus line, the good Samaritan looked disillusioned
_ so it was only a dime but was this a new scam she had fallen for?
Ms. Rudnick wants her to know that she couldn't resist that cab _
her feet were killing her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: West 23rd Street.

   Participants: Two teen-age boys, dressed in baggy hip-hop
outfits.

   Teen-ager No. 1: ``Why don't you have a bar mitzvah?''

<P>
   Teen-ager No. 2: ``How can I have a bar mitzvah? I'm not

</P>
<P>
   Teen-ager No 1: ``You don't have to be Jewish. I'm having one,
and I'm an atheist.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the last Titanic story, maybe not: 7-year-old Rachel Adams

   A recent pleasant day at noon. I sat on a bench facing the
Hudson River at Battery Park City. As I unwrapped my sandwich, a
bird, chirping loudly, landed on the railing in front of me. I
threw a small portion of focaccia to the pavement. The bird
approached it, pecked at the morsel several times and flew away. I
continued eating, offended that my gourmet sandwich was seemingly
not good enough for this sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the same bird returned with its baby, barely old
enough to fly. The mother bird proceeded to pull small pieces from
the morsel and place them in the young bird's open beak, feeding
the baby before helping herself. Then, apparently satisfied, the
two flew away. A male sparrow, who had been watching from the
sidelines, then felt entitled to come over and help himself to what
was left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicious noon meal for all of us.

   A California man just won a contest by growing a 974-pound
pumpkin. Apparently it was the gourd equivalent of the Ken Starr
report.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Richard Holbrooke has an agreement with Slobodan
Milosevic, maybe he can get back to the U.S. and end the lockout of
NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   The UN resolution on Kosovo was No. 1199. No wonder it took so
long to get a deal. That's backward for dialing 9 for an outside
line and then 9-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The hot new toy for the holiday season is called Furby. Toy
stores, we suspect, will end up calling it Tickle Me Cash Register.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has dreamed up a new word meaning betrayal of a friend's
confidence _ entrippment. Where does this happen? In Washington,
DCeit.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``has been a special part of
this country from its inception.'' That's another reason to avoid
politics. You end up saying such embarrassing things.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's approval rating in the polls is much higher than
the rating for Congress. Yes, but in Congress you have 535 people
making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats are feeling a bit better now about their
chances in November. In fact, they may not have to called
mid-termination elections.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence from Mars show it's a violent planet where winds
can blow 350 mph. Sounds like Capitol Hill, but without the
duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel prize in physics this year has gone to scientists who
discovered how electrons can change their behavior. It's not
electrons we're worried about, it's elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is more than a process.'' Right.
For instance, for negotiators it's job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more success out in the country and maybe out in the
world than I have in Washington,'' Mr. Clinton says. But we're not
sure if he meant on public issues or with women.
</P>
<P>
   The president says his job now ``is to work in the next few days
to work to cross party lines to do the work that we have to do
here.'' Who'd want his job? It's just work, work, work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my experience,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``the right thing
to do is the right thing to do.'' Based on our experience, uh,
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into a world that is smaller and smaller and
faster and faster,'' Mr. Clinton says. No wonder we feel out of
synch. We're getting larger and slower.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal agencies still are scrambling to avoid those Year
2000 computer problems. If the Pentagon doesn't make it, will we
have to fight World War I over again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is now passing through one of the most difficult and
complex periods in its history,'' says its prime minister.
Translation: This isn't his fault.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows two-thirds of Americans believe their
representative in the U.S. House should be re-elected. Until they
get it right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen activities,'' says Hillary Rodham Clinton, are
``necessary preconditions for true democratic values.'' Well, as
long as the citizen's spouse knows about them.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy next door is almost set for Halloween, but isn't
sure which would be scarier to be _ Ken Starr or Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, says Aunt Ilse from Oelwein, is that this year's
Nobel peace prize didn't go to whoever kept Hillary from killing
Bill.

THE STARR REPORT: AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE?

<P>
   &UR; By JUDITH A. HUNTER &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The word ``unprecedented'' keeps turning up in the media's
analysis of the Clinton/Lewinsky saga. Particularly perplexing to
many analysts has been the popularity of the Starr Report, in both
printed and on-line forms, despite the fact that most Americans
have told pollsters they don't want to see President Clinton
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits have been unable to reconcile these facts, which seem to
point to opposite conclusions. What they don't realize is that the
Starr Report is actually only the latest example of an American
fondness for what could be termed ``political pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nineteenth century the American public showed a
remarkable appetite for publications that were, for their time,
graphically sexual, as long as these works made at least a pretense
of being related to an important issue of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was an entire genre of books that purported
to be exposes written by wives who had escaped from polygamy in the
Mormon territory of Utah (Utah's admission as a state was denied
until 1896, after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
formally renounced polygamy).
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans sincerely believed that what the Mormons called
``plural marriage'' was a danger to the nation; in fact, in the
1860 Republican platform the young party referred to polygamy and
slavery in the same sentence as evils to oppose, ``twin relics of
barbarism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one remembers the early Republicans for their stand
against Mormon marriage practices; we remember them for their stand
against the extension of slavery. And, in truth, Republicans of the
time spent the preponderance of their energies on the slavery
issue, despite what their platform said.
</P>
<P>
   Polygamy simply didn't seem to be as important an issue. But you
would never know that from the number of anti-Mormon books and
pamphlets produced and consumed in the nineteenth century.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent example was ``Wife No. 19,'' whose author claimed
to be ``Ann Eliza Young, Brigham Young's Apostate Wife.'' Among the
many tales she told about life in Utah, she often stressed how the
Saints were fond of marrying more than one female from the same
family. (It is true that Mormons believed taking ``sister wives''
who were truly sisters might lessen some of the tensions inherent
in a polygamous household.)
</P>
<P>
   As an example of an ``incestuous intermarriage'' she told of a
widowed mother who remarried, with the understanding that her two
daughters would also wed her husband when they were old enough.
``The little girls knew of the arrangement, and used to talk very
openly of 'marrying Pa,' and in very much the same way they would
speak of their intention to take tea with a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The author also insisted that very young girls were forced into
marriage, saying her father had to begin turning down marriage
proposals for her once she reached the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polygamy, incest, and underage marriage were not the only
avid interests of nineteenth-century readers. Anti-Mormon stories
were a variation on even more popular anti-Catholic works, whose
sordid details found large audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Disclosures'' of a woman who claimed to be a former
nun and called herself ``Maria Monk'' was a runaway bestseller when
it first appeared in 1836. (It was the best-selling book in
American history before Harriet Beecher Stowe's ``Uncle Tom's
Cabin,'' published in 1853, finally overtook that distinction.)
Monk inspired scores of imitators, whose stories were eagerly
bought long after the specific ``facts'' of Monk's tale were
exposed as frauds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Disclosures'' remained the model for Monk's
imitators. The book spun lurid tales of convents being attached to
priests' quarters by underground tunnels, of mother superiors
ordering nuns to ``obey the priests in all things,'' and of the
cold-blooded murder of newborns produced by the illicit unions
which seemed to be the whole purpose of convents. Monk even claimed
to have been raped by clergymen the day she took her vows as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of this sort of work sought to inspire Americans
to join a political crusade, the nativist movement, which opposed
the influence of immigrants who were arriving in port cities in
numbers they found alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these immigrants were Catholic, and that was a
frightening thing to many native-born Protestants, especially since
the official pronouncements of the papacy, embroiled in the
political upheavals of Europe, seemed so at odds with American
values. (For instance, one pope of the early nineteenth century
referred to liberty of conscience as ``that most pestilential
error.'')
</P>
<P>
   The consumers of anti-Catholic material, however, did not rise
up and make nativism the controlling political force of the day.
How many current Americans have ever even heard of the Know
Nothings, the short-lived national nativist party?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the current threshold for titillation is exponentially
higher than it was 100 or 150 years ago. Today's eager audience for
``respectable pornography,'' salacious material with a political
veneer, needs more graphic, explicit detail. But the Starr Report
does have precedents in American culture. Give something salacious
the fig leaf of political significance (e.g., egregious
presidential misconduct) and Americans have always consumed it
lustily, whether it be the report of an independent counsel or the
purported memoirs of escaped nuns or Mormon wives.
</P>
<P>
   But the past demonstrates that whatever the public's appetite
for such pornography, it doesn't necessarily produce the expected
political response.

   I recently took my 3-year-old daughter, Dorielle, to Harry's
Shoe Store on Broadway and 83rd Street to buy her first Mary Janes.
As I was paying for them, the clerk gave her a green balloon with
the store name on it. I wanted to tie the string of the balloon to
her wrist, but being an independent young lady, she insisted on
holding it in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   We started walking to the next corner, to Barnes &AMP; Noble for
some books, when a breeze lifted the balloon. Dorielle was in
tears, crying inconsolably as she watched it go higher and higher.
I explained the ways of balloons, and pointed out that next time
she should listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   We went up to the children's section of the bookstore, on the
second floor, Dorielle still not consoled. A woman came up and
asked, ``Are you the little girl who lost her balloon?'' and handed
her an identical one from the same shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   How did the woman know what happened, I asked. She said she had
been sitting in her car in front of the shoe store and when she saw
what happened, ran in and got another balloon. As she saw the
direction we were headed, she guessed we might be looking at
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She left one happy child and one flabbergasted mother.

Brazil and got off the shuttle bus at the long-term parking lot at
Kennedy International Airport. When she arrived at her car, she
discovered her ignition and trunk keys prominently displayed on top
of the car trunk. They had apparently fallen off her key ring when
she parked and, as it was a rainy day when she left and she had
been in a rush, she hadn't noticed. Obviously, someone walking by
had spotted the keys on the ground and carefully put them in a more
noticeable position. Who would believe that the car remained
undisturbed? Call it a true New York miracle.

   As a newly arrived young immigrant in New York several years
ago, I was horrified at the notices I saw all over the city. It was
when terrorism in Ireland was a day-to-day reality and well before
talk of a peace treaty. We had been brought up with stories of
money being sent from America to help support the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea of the extent of the support and how much money
must have been involved until I saw notices in every bank window to
``put your money into an IRA account.''
</P>
<P>
   I was sick about it and couldn't inquire of anyone as I was an
illegal immigrant at the time. I felt I must be the only person in
the city who didn't support the IRA. I wrote home telling my family
that things were much worse than we imagined.
</P>
<P>
   When I became legal and began working in a publishing firm,
someone in personnel asked me to fill in a form that had the
ominous question: ``Do you want to put money into an IRA account?''
I finally found out what it was all about.

   Selma Rudnick was trying to get a cab in midtown. There wasn't
an unoccupied one in sight, and after some time she decided to give
up and take a bus. She was short a dime, and asked a young woman
standing in front of her whether the drivers took pennies. The
woman didn't know but another woman in line, who had heard the
exchange, pressed a dime in her hand and refused the pennies in
exchange. Just then Ms. Rudnick spotted a cab a short way down the
block and, still clutching her donated dime, she ran for it. As the
cab sailed by the bus line, the good Samaritan looked disillusioned
_ so it was only a dime but was this a new scam she had fallen for?
Ms. Rudnick wants her to know that she couldn't resist that cab _
her feet were killing her, she said.

   A recent pleasant day at noon. I sat on a bench facing the
Hudson River at Battery Park City. As I unwrapped my sandwich, a
bird, chirping loudly, landed on the railing in front of me. I
threw a small portion of focaccia to the pavement. The bird
approached it, pecked at the morsel several times and flew away. I
continued eating, offended that my gourmet sandwich was seemingly
not good enough for this sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the same bird returned with its baby, barely old
enough to fly. The mother bird proceeded to pull small pieces from
the morsel and place them in the young bird's open beak, feeding
the baby before helping herself. Then, apparently satisfied, the
two flew away. A male sparrow, who had been watching from the
sidelines, then felt entitled to come over and help himself to what
was left.

<P>
   It was a delicious noon meal for all of us.

</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Disclosures'' of a woman who claimed to be a former
nun and called herself ``Maria Monk'' was a runaway bestseller when
it first appeared in 1836. (It was the best-selling book in
American history before Harriet Beecher Stowe's ``Uncle Tom's
Cabin,'' published in 1853, finally overtook that distinction.)
Monk inspired scores of imitators, whose stories were eagerly
bought long after the specific ``facts'' of Monk's tale were
exposed as frauds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awful Disclosures'' remained the model for Monk's
imitators. The book spun lurid tales of convents being attached to
priests' quarters by underground tunnels, of mother superiors
ordering nuns to ``obey the priests in all things,'' and of the
cold-blooded murder of newborns produced by the illicit unions
which seemed to be the whole purpose of convents. Monk even claimed
to have been raped by clergymen the day she took her vows as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of this sort of work sought to inspire Americans
to join a political crusade, the nativist movement, which opposed
the influence of immigrants who were arriving in port cities in
numbers they found alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these immigrants were Catholic, and that was a
frightening thing to many native-born Protestants, especially since
the official pronouncements of the papacy, embroiled in the
political upheavals of Europe, seemed so at odds with American
values. (For instance, one pope of the early nineteenth century
referred to liberty of conscience as ``that most pestilential
error.'')
</P>
<P>
   The consumers of anti-Catholic material, however, did not rise
up and make nativism the controlling political force of the day.
How many current Americans have ever even heard of the Know
Nothings, the short-lived national nativist party?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the current threshold for titillation is exponentially
higher than it was 100 or 150 years ago. Today's eager audience for
``respectable pornography,'' salacious material with a political
veneer, needs more graphic, explicit detail. But the Starr Report
does have precedents in American culture. Give something salacious
the fig leaf of political significance (e.g., egregious
presidential misconduct) and Americans have always consumed it
lustily, whether it be the report of an independent counsel or the
purported memoirs of escaped nuns or Mormon wives.
</P>
<P>
   But the past demonstrates that whatever the public's appetite
for such pornography, it doesn't necessarily produce the expected
political response.

</P>
<P>
   ``It has been reported that coverage of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal may be hurting the ratings for 'Monday Night Football.'
That should all change next week because during halftime, Monica
Lewinsky is going to get it on with Frank Gifford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House said that because President Clinton and
Hillary were going to be apart this weekend on their 23rd wedding
anniversary, they celebrated it early. Apparently, they had the
foresight to celebrate it in 1985.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize were announced
and one of the winners is from Brooklyn. He was the one quoted as
saying, 'Yo, I won a freakin' Nobel Prize.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, Cindy Crawford was spotted in New York having a
fortune teller read the lines on her palm, which is odd because
Cindy Crawford is the reason most men no longer have lines on their
palm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During a fund-raiser in Minneapolis, Vice President Al Gore
accidentally called Minneapolis 'Missouri.' After the mistake, the
crowd accidentally started calling Al Gore 'Dan Quayle.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to newly released documents, last year Kenneth Starr
made $1.2 million from his legal practice and his family assets
total $4.5 million. When asked about it, Starr said, 'Hey, can't a
guy have a private life?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``TV News _ the skirts on the show 'Ally McBeal' are an inch
shorter this year and the ratings are up. Which means the show will
be really popular five years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the 'Washington Post,' the other day Linda Tripp
was spotted at a mall asking for advice on how she could apply her
makeup better. Apparently the salesperson thought about it for a
second and then sent Tripp to the hat department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde said he wants the
impeachment inquiry to focus on three core charges. After hearing
this, President Clinton asked, 'Hard core or soft core?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky has told friend of hers that she wants this
whole thing to be over so she can live a normal life. Reportedly
Monica went on to say, 'I'd just like to meet a nice married
congressman and settle down.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nashville Network is bringing Roller Derby back to TV and
they said they've already signed up 100 women. In a related story,
President Clinton accepted the resignation of Janet Reno.''
</P>

Kennedy Airport because a large bird got caught in one of the
engines. A spokesman said everything's fine now and they'll be
serving the bird on their next flight.''

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, more popular than ever. Hillary is now more popular

have Hillary Clinton as a wife. Well sure, look what you could get
away with!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big rumor is that Monica Lewinsky is coming back home here
to California. I don't know if she's gonna become an actress or
not, but she's certainly got the audition part down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home-run king Mark McGwire, gonna be featured on boxes of
Wheaties. I also read today that the Washington Redskins team will
be pictured on the containers of Tidy Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NBA -- which stands for ``No Basketball Anymore'' _
they cancelled the first two weeks of its season after labor talks.
Instead of canceling most of the game, why not just cancel the
first three quarters of every game? The fourth quarter's the only
part of the game you care about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Geo Metro has been named the most fuel-efficient car in
America. It's amazing how much gas you can save when people are
pushing you.''

<P>
   ``Three American scientists have won this year's Nobel Prize in
medicine for discoveries that led to the development of Viagra. I
just hope this doesn't give them a swelled head.''

<P>
   ``Some good news for parents. New survey conducted by Playboy
magazine says the number of virgins on college campuses has doubled
in the last two years. Of course, a lot of these students are
probably using Clinton's definition of sex.''

</P>
<P>
   I recently took my 3-year-old daughter, Dorielle, to Harry's
Shoe Store on Broadway and 83rd Street to buy her first Mary Janes.
As I was paying for them, the clerk gave her a green balloon with
the store name on it. I wanted to tie the string of the balloon to
her wrist, but being an independent young lady, she insisted on
holding it in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   We started walking to the next corner, to Barnes &AMP; Noble for
some books, when a breeze lifted the balloon. Dorielle was in
tears, crying inconsolably as she watched it go higher and higher.
I explained the ways of balloons, and pointed out that next time
she should listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   We went up to the children's section of the bookstore, on the
second floor, Dorielle still not consoled. A woman came up and
asked, ``Are you the little girl who lost her balloon?'' and handed
her an identical one from the same shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   How did the woman know what happened, I asked. She said she had
been sitting in her car in front of the shoe store and when she saw
what happened, ran in and got another balloon. As she saw the
direction we were headed, she guessed we might be looking at
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She left one happy child and one flabbergasted mother.

   Rose Rudnitski returned on an overnight flight from a trip to
Brazil and got off the shuttle bus at the long-term parking lot at
Kennedy International Airport. When she arrived at her car, she
discovered her ignition and trunk keys prominently displayed on top
of the car trunk. They had apparently fallen off her key ring when
she parked and, as it was a rainy day when she left and she had
been in a rush, she hadn't noticed. Obviously, someone walking by
had spotted the keys on the ground and carefully put them in a more
noticeable position. Who would believe that the car remained
undisturbed? Call it a true New York miracle.

<P>
   My daughter Ellen recently attended her first evening parenting
class. The following afternoon she was running errands and told her
4-year-old son, Matthew, to get in the car and put on his seat
belt. He refused to put on the belt. After some failed
negotiations, my daughter became frustrated and started screaming
at him. Matthew looked at her and announced, ``You really didn't
learn anything from your class last night.''

   As a newly arrived young immigrant in New York several years
ago, I was horrified at the notices I saw all over the city. It was
when terrorism in Ireland was a day-to-day reality and well before
talk of a peace treaty. We had been brought up with stories of
money being sent from America to help support the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea of the extent of the support and how much money
must have been involved until I saw notices in every bank window to
``put your money into an IRA account.''
</P>
<P>
   I was sick about it and couldn't inquire of anyone as I was an
illegal immigrant at the time. I felt I must be the only person in
the city who didn't support the IRA. I wrote home telling my family
that things were much worse than we imagined.
</P>
<P>
   When I became legal and began working in a publishing firm,
someone in personnel asked me to fill in a form that had the
ominous question: ``Do you want to put money into an IRA account?''
I finally found out what it was all about.

   Selma Rudnick was trying to get a cab in midtown. There wasn't
an unoccupied one in sight, and after some time she decided to give
up and take a bus. She was short a dime, and asked a young woman
standing in front of her whether the drivers took pennies. The
woman didn't know but another woman in line, who had heard the
exchange, pressed a dime in her hand and refused the pennies in
exchange. Just then Ms. Rudnick spotted a cab a short way down the
block and, still clutching her donated dime, she ran for it. As the
cab sailed by the bus line, the good Samaritan looked disillusioned
_ so it was only a dime but was this a new scam she had fallen for?
Ms. Rudnick wants her to know that she couldn't resist that cab _
her feet were killing her, she said.

   A recent pleasant day at noon. I sat on a bench facing the
Hudson River at Battery Park City. As I unwrapped my sandwich, a
bird, chirping loudly, landed on the railing in front of me. I
threw a small portion of focaccia to the pavement. The bird
approached it, pecked at the morsel several times and flew away. I
continued eating, offended that my gourmet sandwich was seemingly
not good enough for this sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the same bird returned with its baby, barely old
enough to fly. The mother bird proceeded to pull small pieces from
the morsel and place them in the young bird's open beak, feeding
the baby before helping herself. Then, apparently satisfied, the
two flew away. A male sparrow, who had been watching from the
sidelines, then felt entitled to come over and help himself to what
was left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicious noon meal for all of us.

   Now that Richard Holbrooke has an agreement with Slobodan
Milosevic, maybe he can get back to the U.S. and end the lockout of
NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   The UN resolution on Kosovo was No. 1199. No wonder it took so

   The hot new toy for the holiday season is called Furby. Toy

   Someone has dreamed up a new word meaning betrayal of a friend's
confidence _ entrippment. Where does this happen? In Washington,
DCeit.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``has been a special part of
this country from its inception.'' That's another reason to avoid
politics. You end up saying such embarrassing things.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's approval rating in the polls is much higher than
the rating for Congress. Yes, but in Congress you have 535 people

   Congressional Democrats are feeling a bit better now about their

   The Nobel prize in physics this year has gone to scientists who
discovered how electrons can change their behavior. It's not
electrons we're worried about, it's elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is more than a process.'' Right.
For instance, for negotiators it's job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more success out in the country and maybe out in the
world than I have in Washington,'' Mr. Clinton says. But we're not
sure if he meant on public issues or with women.
</P>
<P>
   The president says his job now ``is to work in the next few days
to work to cross party lines to do the work that we have to do
here.'' Who'd want his job? It's just work, work, work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my experience,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``the right thing

what?

   ``We are moving into a world that is smaller and smaller and
faster and faster,'' Mr. Clinton says. No wonder we feel out of

   Some federal agencies still are scrambling to avoid those Year

   A new poll shows two-thirds of Americans believe their

   ``Citizen activities,'' says Hillary Rodham Clinton, are
``necessary preconditions for true democratic values.'' Well, as

JOAN HICKSON, 92, ACTRESS WHO PLAYED MISS MARPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Joan Hickson, a stage, screen and television actress
who became an international celebrity when she played Miss Marple,
Agatha Christie's sharp-witted elderly detective, in a BBC
television series from 1984 to 1992, died last weekend at a
hospital in Colchester, Essex, said her son, Nicholas Butler. She
was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Though Miss Hickson acted in more than 80 movies and had a
considerable stage career, it was as Miss Marple, a role she took
on in her late 70s, that she achieved her greatest success and won
most renown.
</P>
<P>
   She played the part just as Christie had written it: as a
seemingly fluffy and disorganized spinster whose vast understanding
of human nature and formidable, clear-eyed intelligence helped her
solve the mysteries that visited her village with uncanny
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hickson took to her late television career with relish,
saying that she thought Miss Marple was a ``splendid'' person,
because there was ``nothing you could say or do that would shock
her.'' Among her legions of fans, drawn from the more than 30
countries in which the series appeared, was Queen Elizabeth, who
awarded Miss Hickson the Order of the British Empire in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, in 1906, Joan Hickson began
acting as soon as she could, despite disapproval from her
relatives. ``My Aunt Aggie _ she was about 4 feet tall _ drew
herself up to her full height and said, `What is Joan's destination
to be?' which she thought was the gutter, you see,'' she once
recalled in an interview. Her first appearance, in 1927, was with a
provincial theater company as an aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she appeared in many West End comedies, often taking on
the role of a slightly batty aunt or a befuddled middle-aged woman,
characters with names like Mrs. Pottle, Gladys Rumbelow and Mrs.
Mould. During World War II, when London was prone to sudden
bombing, she appeared in the Open Air Theater in Regent's Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept one eye on the sky to see what was coming over,'' she
recalled. ``We used to feel the audience were being damned stupid
because they sort of hurled themselves on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long stage career, which included appearances in Henry
James' ``The Tragic Muse'' and Ian Hay's ``The Gusher,'' she began
to appear more and more often in movies, including ``The Guinea
Pig'' (1948), ``The Card'' (1952), and ``The 39 Steps'' (1959).
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the scores of films she made, she once said: ``I
watch these old films in black and white, and suddenly the door
opens and there I am. The other day I was wearing the most awful
hat.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned often to the stage. Later in her career, she
appeared in three of Peter Nichols' plays: ``A Day in the Death of
Joe Egg'' (1967), ``The Freeway'' and ``Forget-Me-Not Lane''
(1967). She also played Mrs. Bradman in the National Theater
Company's production of Sir Noel Coward's ``Blithe Spirit'' (1976)
and won a Tony award as best supporting actress for her performance
as Delia in Alan Ayckbourn's ``Bedroom Farce'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Before she became television's definitive Miss Marple (``There
were 30 others in the queue for auditions,'' she said), she
appeared in the slender role of Miss Pryce in a 1946 West End
production of Christie's ``Appointment With Death.'' Christie
happened to sit in the audience one night, sending Miss Hickson a
prophetic note afterward that read, ``I hope one day you will play
my dear Miss Marple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Retirement is fatal,'' Miss Hickson once said, and she
continued working long after the Miss Marple series ended,
recording audio books of Christie mysteries. Her husband, Eric
Butler, a family doctor, died in 1967. She is survived by a son and
a daughter.

CANADIAN ICEBREAKER MAY SHED LIGHT ON WEATHER PATTERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Wash., Ariz., N.H.)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having endured arctic storms, dangerous fissures in the ice
pack, polar-bear intrusions and a year of crushing pressure while
frozen into a drifting floe, the Canadian icebreaker Des
Groseilliers reached Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, on Saturday. Aboard it
was a rich cargo of data expected to reveal subtle mechanisms that
drive changes in the world's climate.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's arrival marked the end of a yearlong round of
experiments paid for mostly by the National Science Foundation,
with support from the Office of Naval Research and the Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
   The $19.5-million project, called ``SHEBA,'' for Surface Heat
Budget of the Arctic Ocean, was a detailed measurement of heat flow
among the water, ice and air of the high Arctic, and the results
are expected to improve the mathematical modeling of global climate
change.
</P>
<P>
   SHEBA, administered by the University of Washington, was the
largest and most complex project ever supported in the Arctic by
the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call from the ship, Dr. Richard Moritz of the
University of Washington, director of the project, said the
atmospheric, oceanic and geophysical scientists who spent part of
the year aboard the floating laboratory, would spend the next
several months compacting and analyzing the data collected by
thousands of sensors on and around the ship. The investigators will
meet in Tucson, Ariz., at the end of January to begin consolidating
their findings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some preliminary results include indications that the entire
year was markedly warmer than past years. The ocean remained open
much farther north than normal, and the ice began breaking up
sooner than normal in the spring. Moreover, the salinity of ocean
surface water was low, showing that the water was mixed with an
unusually large proportion of fresh water from melting ice.
</P>
<P>
   Moritz said the warming trend may have been mainly the result of
the recent El Nino climate event in the Pacific Ocean, but could
also reflect a global-warming trend.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Perovich, SHEBA's chief scientist on loan from the
Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, in
Hanover, N.H., said the research year had been eventful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a real scare during the winter when our headquarters
floe started to break up,'' he said. ``One of our ice camps near
the ship broke away and drifted a half-mile from the ship in less
than an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   From the point at which the ship was intentionally embedded in
ice 320 miles north of the coastal village of Dead Horse, Alaska,
it drifted about 1,800 miles before its powerful engines were
started and the vessel headed for land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the summer,'' Perovich said, ``the ice had
melted so much that thin patches barely covered the water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists were constantly falling through into the nearly
freezing water _ 11,000 feet deep _ so everyone took to wearing
flotation devices while working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we had polar bear visits. Once, a mama bear was
instructing her cub how to floss its teeth with a cable strung out
to one of our sensors, and we had to chase them away with a
tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a wonderful project.''

BENIGNI-FILM (Los Angeles) _ ``Life Is Beautiful'' is about a
father who shields his son from the brutal reality of life in a
concentration camp by pretending that the whole thing is just part
of a contest to win an army tank. This unlikely comedy from Italian
director Roberto Benigni won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, won
the the People's Choice Award at Toronto and is likely to be one of
this year's Oscar foreign film nominees. By Bob Strauss.

WE ALL HAVE AN INTEREST IN HOW OTHERS ARE EDUCATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America must never give up on public education. The surest
predictor of any nation's future is the priority it gives to
educating its young. Nations, like families, express their
priorities in the things for which they're willing to spend their
money. Excellence in education can be expensive, Lloyd Bentsen once
remarked, ``but not half as expensive as ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the policy disagreements that kept Congress and the
president at loggerheads for months this year was whether to budget
$1.1 billion to help states hire 100,000 more classroom teachers
and thus reduce the widespread overcrowding that handicaps
learning.
</P>
<P>
   The item was finally accepted. But other goals, like
computerizing every classroom, making sure every child reads by the
third grade, and making two years of junior college as standard as
a high school diploma went unfunded. Legislators who assent without
murmur to annual military budgets approaching $300 billion and
multibillion-dollar highway bills seem pickier when it comes to the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some hark back to pre-World War II days, when federal monies
played practically no part in educating America's children. States
and school districts had virtually the entire responsibility.
Glaring disparities were widespread. Massachusetts, for example,
apportioned eight times as much for each of its students annually
as did Mississippi. For low- to medium-income families throughout
America, the quality of educational opportunity became an accident
of geography.
</P>
<P>
   Then modern war taught us that the general level of learning was
as essential to our national survival as the quality of our arms.
By President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration, it became a matter
of national pride to ensure the humblest American child a
birthright to a first-class education.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every American profited in some way from the GI Bill
of Rights that sprang from World War II. It may have been history's
most massive transfusion of money into education. That program paid
rich dividends to the nation. The percent of America's youth
finishing four years of college increased in one generation from
4.5 percent to 21.5 percent. America boomed economically and
bloomed intellectually.
</P>
<P>
   As a financial investment, the GI Bill paid for itself at least
40 times over. Because college graduates earn more, they've paid
more taxes. As a direct result of America's enhanced earning power,
the coffers of the U.S. Treasury have been enriched enormously. And
every one of us is a beneficiary of the discoveries, inventions and
technologies flowing from the fountains of knowledge that bold
experiment unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviets beat us into space in 1957 with Sputnik, it
shocked us into the sudden realization that we'd neglected
scientific studies. Uncomfortably apprehensive at being behind, we
launched our massive space effort, which ultimately overtook and
surpassed that of the Soviets. With a sense of national survival at
stake, Democratic and Republican members of Congress submerged
their differences and joined hands, not quarreling over credit.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy now bursting upon the scene must convince us
that our quality of life depends more than ever upon a high level
of education, broadly shared. A handful of geniuses won't suffice.
The widespread diffusion of knowledge and modern job skills among
ordinary Americans will be our surest salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Some haven't yet comprehended the truth that it matters to all
of us how the rest of us are educated. Here in Texas, some
residents of affluent neighborhoods appear to resent the state law
that shares a part of their property taxes with our state's
impoverished school districts. A few school boards have sought ways
to circumvent that law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some critics are almost ready to give up on the
public schools. Conscientious parents, eager to have the best for
their children, increasingly resort to home schooling. Both
national and state legislators, looking for an easy fix, want to
abdicate the responsibility of providing excellence in public
education. They'd prefer to offer vouchers, subsidizing private
schools while further draining public school systems, relegating
them to second-rate status.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to admire in parents who are willing to oversee
their children's education personally on a daily basis. Parental
guidance is vital. It takes patience and perseverance to teach
one's own child, at home, all those things that an enlightened
educational curriculum requires. My hat is off to those who try.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, however, daily home schooling would present
insurmountable problems. The vast majority of parents today
couldn't manage that. The average American family now has two
bread-earners, not one. What comforts will they sacrifice so that
one can be at home all day, every day, teaching the children all
the good things they'd otherwise learn in school?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I believe that a vital part of the learning comes from
the mixing. A broad education cannot be administered in a vacuum.
For most children, the elementary grades have been our most
important introduction to the wide world of other people. And in
this increasingly global environment, nobody and no nation can
survive indefinitely within a protective shell.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I do not rue the property taxes we pay on our
residence to the Crowley school district, or resent any portion
that may end up helping children in El Paso or the Rio Grande
Valley. It could tap some wellspring of undiscovered genius from
whose works mankind will benefit. What better use of money could
there be?

TWO SATELLITES TO STUDY SUN DURING DISCOVERY MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 BY WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In spite of past problems, NASA engineers say they
are optimistic about plans to have two satellites make joint
observations of the sun during the next space shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers working to reactivate a troubled solar observatory say
the craft will probably be ready for mutual studies of the sun with
a satellite carried aloft by the shuttle Discovery, scheduled to
take off with a crew of seven on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, a major scientific objective of the
Discovery mission _ which includes studies of the aging process in
space with 77-year-old John Glenn, the once-and-future astronaut
and U.S. senator _ was to conduct the joint solar studies involving
the Spartan satellite, taken up by the shuttle, and the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO.
</P>
<P>
   SOHO, a $1 billion joint project of the European Space Agency
and the United States, is painstakingly being brought back into
service after it spun out of control and lost communications with
Earth on June 24. Engineers eventually located and regained control
of the errant satellite, which is stationed about a million miles
out in space on the sunward side of Earth, where it can make
uninterrupted observations of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The space agencies announced last week that the spacecraft,
designed to study sunlight at different wavelengths and analyze
particles and magnetic fields generated by the sun, had taken test
images and soon would return to full operation. Engineers have
successfully reactivated nine of the 12 instruments aboard SOHO,
they said, including two that are critical to the joint
observations planned with Spartan. Four of the recovered
instruments are fully functional and the other five are undergoing
careful recommissioning, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to resume normal scientific operations with SOHO in
the near future,'' Joseph Gurman, U.S. project scientist for SOHO
said Friday. ``But we have recovered enough of its operations to
expect full cooperation with Spartan when the time comes. We should
make it just under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurman said technicians could delay some of SOHO's other
recommissioning activities to concentrate on the joint operation
with Spartan during its mission.
</P>
<P>
   SOHO will probably not resume all of its normal operations until
December, he said, because it will take that long to make some
changes in operating the spacecraft recommended by a review board
that examined the near-loss of the craft. That board concluded that
SOHO went out of control because of ground control errors and the
failure to adequately monitor the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartan, being carried by Discovery, is a 3,000-pound,
battery-powered satellite that has been flown on four previous
shuttle missions. The satellite, which is deployed from the
shuttle's cargo bay by an astronaut using the orbiter's 50-foot
robot arm, flies free of the shuttle at a distance of 70 to 100
miles to conduct its operations. At the end of two days, the
shuttle retrieves the satellite using the arm and returns it to
Earth so that scientists can retrieve its data from tape recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery crew is to release Spartan on the second day of
their nine-day mission, leaving the satellite to turn itself on,
point its telescopes toward the sun and conduct a programmed series
of observations, some in conjunction with SOHO and other
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic that we will have a joint operation with
SOHO,'' said Richard Fisher, a Spartan project scientist from
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Fisher said observations of the
same solar areas by different spacecraft can come hours or days
apart, since many of the sun's features do not change very rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Joint observations are important because instruments differ in
their sensitivity, field of view and what part of the
electromagnetic spectrum they measure. SOHO, for example, views
more of the sun's outer layer than Spartan, but instruments on
Spartan are more effective in studying the lower part of this
layer.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the instruments also help verify each other's
measurements. For example, the Spartan instruments, just tested on
the ground, will help engineers recalibrate the SOHO instruments,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple observations will concentrate on the sun's corona
and the high-speed solar wind of charged particles it generates
that bathe the solar system. The corona is the thin, upper layer of
the solar atmosphere that reaches temperatures exceeding 2 million
degrees Fahrenheit, compared with surface temperatures of about
10,000 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   To observe this region, the spacecraft use special telescopes
called coronagraphs, which let in only the extremely faint
illumination from the corona region.
</P>
<P>
   Spartan carries two complementary telescopes: a white light
coronagraph to measure the density of electrons in the relatively
dim coronal luminance and an ultraviolet coronal spectrometer to
measure the velocities, temperatures and densities of plasmas _
streams of charged particles _ from the corona.
</P>
<P>
   SOHO, a European-built craft launched in December 1995, carries
similar instruments. Its ultraviolet coronagraph measures
densities, temperatures and elemental constituents of mass
ejections from the corona, as well as other features. Engineers
said last week that this instrument was working.
</P>
<P>
   A second instrument, the large-angle and spectrographic
coronagraph, or LASCO, is a set of three coronagraphs that measure
the corona at different altitudes. Two of the LASCO components were
working last week and engineers were optimistic about recovering
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher also said Spartan is to make cooperative observations
with instruments sent on short flights by sounding rockets and will
do joint studies with NASA's new Transition Region and Coronal
Explorer spacecraft, launched last April.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartan program has had problems. Its upcoming mission,
designed to conduct solar observations for about 43 hours, repeats
one flown from the shuttle Columbia in November 1987 that did not
record data.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA inquiry found that the fourth Spartan flight failed
because astronauts aboard the shuttle did not send a crucial
command to activate the craft's control system and then
accidentally struck the satellite with the robot arm, sending it
tumbling out of control. Two astronauts made an emergency spacewalk
three days later and caught the satellite.
</P>
<P>
   This is the last scheduled flight of Spartan, but Fisher said
NASA engineers were studying advanced models of the craft that
might be flown after 2000. Such spacecraft, run by solar power
instead of batteries, could operate longer and relay data directly
to the ground.

HUMOR IN THE HOLOCAUST? BENIGNI FINDS SOME IN `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``HALLO! How are you? Nice to hear you!''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Benigni is calling from Rome with a voice so full of
gusto that it sounds like he's shouting from 5 feet away. As
always, the exuberant Italian comedian exudes a sense of fun and
affection and is apparently overjoyed to share your company,
whoever you are.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've just got to make a concentration camp comedy,
Benigni is probably the best guy to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's not a comedy about the Holocaust,'' Benigni
says of ``Life Is Beautiful,'' his award-winning movie that's
scheduled to open the AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival
on Thursday, a day before commencing its commercial engagement
here. ``I am a comedian who did a movie about the Holocaust. The
second half of it is set in a concentration camp, and that's a
comedian playing a real tragedy. That makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   While Americans may barely recognize the frizzy-haired,
Gumby-resembling 45-year-old from the indie films of Jim Jarmusch
(``Down by Law,'' ``Night on Earth'') or the unsuccessful attempt
to revive the old Peter Sellers cop comedy franchise ``Son of the
Pink Panther,'' Europeans know Benigni as the most popular Italian
comic of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Stecchino,'' in which he played a goofball con artist
and the murderous mobster who looks just like him, is the most
successful movie in Italian history. In a follow-up hit, ``The
Monster,'' Benigni once again played an inept penny ante swindler
type, who was this time confused with a serial rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the slapstick-prone Benigni has a bent for comedy
with an edge. But his previous work was nowhere near as risky as
his long-nurtured concept about a wacky Jewish waiter who, when
shipped off to a concentration camp toward the end of World War II,
shields his young son from the horror of their situation by
pretending that it's all just a big, elaborate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Benigni admits in disarming, not-quite-fluent
English. ``But I was scared like when you are in love with
somebody, because I was honest with myself. I was not trying to
make something violent or bad. A lot of friends of mine told me
that this would lose me a lot of my audience. But the idea was so
simple _ it's a love story, about a man's love for his family and
his son _ and I can't imagine something better than this. If I
could come back, I would remake it 100 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Against most expectations, Benigni's conviction has been
rewarded. ``Life Is Beautiful'' was another huge hit at home and
won eight Donatellos, Italy's Academy Award equivalent. Though it
stirred some controversy at the Cannes Film Festival last spring,
it also received a 20-minute ovation and the Grand Jury Prize. Even
more than his usually ecstatic self, Benigni kissed everyone on
stage at the closing night ceremony, then kissed jury president
Martin Scorsese's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni was even more moved by ``Life Is Beautiful's'' positive
reception at the Jerusalem Film Festival. Trees were planted in the
Israeli city in honor of Benigni and his wife, Nicoletta Braschi,
the leading lady of ``Beautiful'' and most of his productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roberto approached this project with great reverence, and the
film has played beautifully in festival after festival,'' notes
Marcy Granata, executive vice president of marketing and publicity
for Miramax Films, which is distributing ``Beautiful'' in America.
``Not only is it an audience-pleaser, it's a critics film. It works
on many emotional levels, and people respond to that. It's a fable;
and the universal thing everyone is going to understand is
protecting the innocence of their children, no matter what
sacrifice they have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Fitzgerald, the director of AFI's L.A. Film Festival,
describes ``Life Is Beautiful's'' uniquely difficult achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my favorite film in Cannes,'' Fitzgerald notes. ``I
really thought it was an amazing accomplishment to take something
as serious as the Holocaust and be able to let an audience enjoy a
story with that as the backdrop. It's a pleasant surprise when
you're watching it and thinking, `He can't pull this off, it can't
happen,' then he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni took a few precautions with the material, of course. He
had ``Life Is Beautiful's'' script, which he co-wrote with Vincenzo
Cerami, vetted by members of Milan's Jewish community, and he
invited Holocaust survivors to observe and advise during filming.
Benigni claims the feedback he got was almost entirely of a
technical and historical accuracy nature, with little to no
criticism of the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an artist, I took some license,'' he admits, ``some
freedom, some liberty. But they helped me a lot _ with their heart,
with their sensitivity _ and I have to thank them very, very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not Jewish himself, Benigni can locate the origins of
``Life Is Beautiful'' in family experience. His father, a poor
farmer from Tuscany, was serving in the army in occupied Albania
when Italy switched sides at the height of World War II. The
Germans quickly overcame their former Fascist allies, and Benigni's
father spent the last two years of the conflict imprisoned in a
Nazi slave labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were the same as the concentration camps, but
there were no gas chambers _ which is a big difference, I know,''
Benigni says. ``But when he came back, he was a skeleton, like 35
kilos (about 77 pounds). And he was obsessed by the need to tell
his story to me and my three sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Benigni soon realized that he was frightening the
children he loved but still could not repress the need to talk out
his trauma every evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he started to tell us the story with levity, in a different
way,'' Roberto recalls. ``Funny stuff did happen in the camp also.
Me and my sisters were not having fun, but we were smiling
sometimes at this. And when my father started to smile back, he
stopped having nightmares so. This was very touching for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his father infected the children with his natural
inclination toward comic playfulness _ ``The way I play with my son
in the movie is the way he played with me,'' Benigni reveals _
young Roberto leaned toward becoming a priest. A chance job with a
circus, however, changed the course of his life. By the 1960s, he
was applying the Tuscan tradition of improvisation to Rome's
underground theater scene. From that grew a career as a comic
monologuist, with increasingly popular television and film projects
building from there.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, influences from Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen to
the legendary Italian comic Toto found their way into Benigni's
generally broad, sometimes unexpectedly intelligent brand of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' is, at least to date, the ultimate
expression of that comic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cannes, during the press conference, one journalist was
against the movie in a very aggressive way,'' Benigni recalls.
``But I respected this opinion. A comedian making a movie about the
Holocaust, this can be an explosion, and I respect the sensitivity
of somebody who is telling that only silence can explain why.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes, I must say, there is a sort of prejudice about
comedy. Comedy is considered, like, low level, no? I think the
contrary. I think sometimes only clowns can reach certain heights.
Tragedy can sometimes be embarrassing, schmaltzy. I know we can't
laugh about everything, but the challenge is to make something
beautiful, poetical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clowns, sometimes, can do that with levity.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Autumnal weather will extend from the upper Great Lakes to the
Northeast on Tuesday. A reinforcing shot of cool air will follow a
cold front pushing south through New England. Brisk winds from the
northwest will further enhance the chill. Patchy showers will form
downwind from Lakes Superior, Erie and Ontario. Wet snowflakes will
mix with the rain in the higher elevations of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sinking air currents will promote a sunny and
pleasant day with seasonal temperatures from the middle Atlantic
coast to the Ohio Valley. Cooler air will arrive Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of only moderately moist air will accompany a cold
front moving through the Southeast. The result will be plenty of
clouds but limited showers from the central Gulf coast to the
Carolinas. The front will stall across the western Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will prevail from Texas to the southern
Rockies. Humid air from the east will result in clouds and areas of
rain from the lower Rio Grande Valley to western Texas. However,
the axis of heaviest rain will shift away from the water-logged
parts of eastern Texas. As the moist air ascends the sloping
terrain, clouds and rain will expand over New Mexico, southern
Colorado, and the mountains of northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil weather will cover most of the northern Rockies and
Pacific states as sprawling high pressure brings ample sunshine.
Although some morning low clouds and fog will begin the day along
the southern California coast and interior Northwest, the afternoon
will turn mostly sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Waning Season
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Pacific coast of Mexico
on Sunday as Hurricanes Lester and Madeline loomed offshore.
Meanwhile, in the Atlantic Ocean, clusters of showers, the
seedlings for tropical storms, were battling for survival. By late
October, hurricane season is rapidly winding down in the Atlantic.
Cooling seas and strengthening high-altitude winds conspire to
inhibit tropical cyclone formation. Only 41 tropical storms have
formed during the last 10 days of October since 1886. On Tuesday, a
disturbance in the northwest Caribbean Sea will struggle to become
a tropical depression.

THE NEXT SHANKAR FOCUSES ON HER MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Her voice is basic Southern California beach girl:
bright, friendly and open. But when 17-year-old Anoushka Shankar
picks up the sitar to play with her famous father, she's pure
India, the hypnotic drone of the instrument distilling centuries of
craft and tradition in her young, talented hands.
</P>
<P>
   She has been accompanying father Ravi Shankar since she was 10,
first on tambura and since 13, on sitar, during winter tours of
their home country, summer tours of Europe and spot concerts
throughout North America in between.
</P>
<P>
   That means hours of practice, a couple each night, three or four
each weekend day, five or six when she's in India on tour and ``the
music is the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Shankar has been leading the more or less
normal life of a high school senior in Encinitas, an upscale beach
town in north San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   That means finding time for all the studying needed to keep up
with an accelerated course load at her alternative public high
school. And ensuring concert dates don't conflict with prom
weekend. And beginning to apply to such colleges as Brown
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of the things that I do would keep me completely busy if
that were all that I did,'' Shankar said. ``In a sense, I'm not
doing anything fully. I have sleepovers once a month with a group
of 13 or 14 friends. I end up missing so many of them because I
travel. Or I'll miss parties or plans because I'll be leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   With her first album debuting today and an industry showcase on
Nov. 4 in Los Angeles, it might be a tad daunting _ except it's all
she's ever really known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it for so long that I don't know how strange
it is for me,'' Shankar said. ``I feel more strange about it when
people ask me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankar began learning sitar from her father at age 8, at her
mother's urging. Learning the difficult instrument and performing
40 dates a year with her 78-year-old father has cemented a special
bond with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a musician, it's been incredible being his daughter,
because he gets so much attention and listeners,'' Shankar said.
``I don't know what kind of relationship I would have with him if
we didn't have the music, because that's the part that binds me
together with him.''
</P>
<P>
   She is giddy about her debut release, ``Anoushka,'' a fine first
effort that hits record stores today. Angel Records will also
release the first two of a series of her father's classic albums
going back to the late 1960s when he first rose to world prominence
because of his influence on the Beatles. Though her father wrote
her album's music and produced it, Anoushka said the music is
definitely hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were playing, it would be a lot different,'' she said.
``He tends to be a lot more vigorous. He sort of goes nuts when he
plays. I'm still more reserved. I've noticed it more on stage. Me,
I'm not that lost.''

DAVIS EVOKES MIXED FEELINGS, BUT HIS AMBITION IS CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the man who would be
governor of California, boasts a shining public image and a
heavyweight reputation.
</P>
<P>
   A Stanford University graduate. A decorated Army captain in
Vietnam. A champion of liberal causes. A brilliant dealmaker in
Democratic circles since the 1970s, from his days as former Gov.
Jerry Brown's chief of staff to his current post as lieutenant
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all aspects of government, Gray knows the game very well,''
said Donna Lucas, who was former Gov. George Deukmejian's
spokeswoman. ``He's a political animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters portray Davis, 55, as a model candidate, a devoted
public servant, a consensus builder. His vast government experience
and centrist political values are ideal for a new and diverse
state, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   But both Republican and Democratic critics depict Davis as cold
and calculating, obsessed by ambition. They say he's a hot-tempered
boss who berates employees, a politico with a history of
questionable campaign practices.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has acknowledged his temper. It's not something he's proud
or happy about, he once told an employee in an apology left on an
answering machine tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand Gray, you have to understand that politics
consumes his entire life,'' said Steve Merksamer, a Sacramento
attorney, former chief of staff to Deukmejian and ``informal
adviser'' to Davis' Republican opponent, Attorney General Dan
Lungren. ``He's very good and very aggressive at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Graham Davis Jr. was born Dec. 26, 1942, and grew up in
the tony suburbs of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Doris Morell, is a retired interior designer, while
his late father, Joseph Davis, was a Time Inc. ad executive and an
alcoholic who squandered the family fortune, as Gray Davis tells
it.
</P>
<P>
   Davis studied at the Harvard School in North Hollywood, then
spent his college years at Stanford University. When he wasn't
buried in books, he played on the golf team, partied with his Zeta
Psi fraternity brothers and tooled around town in a red Chevy Bel
Air.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than join antiwar protests, Davis entered the Army Signal
Corps in 1969. He spent a year in Vietnam, earning a Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' rise to political grace began in 1973, as finance
director for the Los Angeles mayoral campaign of the late Tom
Bradley. A year later, he joined Jerry Brown's gubernatorial race,
becoming chief of staff after Brown's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has proved to be a skilled negotiator, a tough political
soldier and an imaginative problem solver, his supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   They praise his fight for affirmative action as a University of
California regent; his strong stand against anti-abortion forces;
and his environmental leadership against oil drilling off the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, Davis was a mediating force in the tense talks
between farm workers and growers. Colleagues say his strong hand
helped lead to the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, which gave
employment rights to farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can bring people to the table and persuade them through the
strength of his arguments,'' said Art Torres, head of the
California Democratic Party and a former state senator who
co-sponsored the labor act.
</P>
<P>
   Like many politicians, Davis has mastered the art of political
neutrality on explosive issues. He stayed silent on the North
American Free Trade Agreement. Now, he's taking no stand on
Proposition 5, the state gambling initiative for Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   As a boss, Davis earns high marks as a policy wonk and a good
idea man who welcomes lively debate and brainstorming sessions. He
is a taskmaster and workaholic, often toiling until late at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray is one of the most disciplined and thoughtful public
servants I've ever encountered,'' said Daniel Zingale, former chief
of staff to Davis and executive director of AIDS Action in
Washington, D.C. ``He takes his responsibilities very seriously,
and he holds himself to extraordinarily high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   According to former staffers, though, Davis can be a harsh and
demanding boss, given to tirades and cursing fits.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign manager Garry South conceded Friday that Davis is ``a
demanding boss'' who ``chews people out from time to time.'' But
that's part of the high-stakes, high-pressure world of politics, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a supervisor, as a boss, it is not your fault every time
somebody on the staff has an emotional problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Davis' wife, Sharon Ryer Davis, is a warm and
down-to-earth woman who has lightened her husband's hard-driving
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds damn corny, but Sharon is the loving soul for him to
go home to,'' said Kam Kuwata, a Los Angeles political consultant
advising the Davis campaign. ``She's given him balance in his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Davis, a practicing Roman Catholic at the Good
Shepherd parish in Beverly Hills, genuinely believes that
government can better the lives of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of politics is to do what's good for the public,''
said Bob Mulholland, a campaign adviser to the Democratic Party.
``Gray has never forgotten that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Davis is more complex, though. Beyond the choir
boy visage seen on television, Davis has a less flattering side.
</P>
<P>
   A review of his record and interviews with dozens of political
sources suggest Davis' tenacious drive _ perhaps his greatest
strength _ may cloud his judgment as a campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Politicos point to one big blunder: his mud-slinging U.S. Senate
race against fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein in 1992. Davis
attacked Feinstein in campaign ads, likening her to wealthy
hotelier and tax evader Leona Helmsley. He has since apologized,
and last week, the senator endorsed Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Or look at political contributions. Davis is a Herculean
fund-raiser, netting $24 million so far for his governor's race,
compared with $21 million for Lungren, according to state campaign
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has gained a reputation among politicians as a brash
fund-raiser who has angered wealthy donors by his relentless
soliciting over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ruthless,'' said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Gov. Pete
Wilson, who is barred from law from running for a third term. ``One
joke goes: When you meet him, his right hand shakes yours, while
his other hand is an open palm.''
</P>
<P>
   In an episode last year, insurance executive William F. Hooper,
a Republican who says he gives to both parties, was so insulted by
Davis that he broke off a long friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper, the head of Student Insurance Inc. in Los Angeles had
invited the politician to speak at a Monterey conference of 300
business managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done as a favor, in the spirit of friendship and
trust,'' said Hooper, a California delegate to the 1988 Republican
convention in New Orleans. ``I thought it would be good for Gray to
meet these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech by Davis went beautifully. But then, according to
Hooper, Davis turned to him and said bluntly: ``I'd like you to
send me $5,000 for this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooper said that episode _ plus similar incidents _ led to his
estrangement from the politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray is insincere, and he's always after money,'' Hooper said.
``We were dear friends for many years, but he disappointed me. You
don't do those things to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the resilient Davis is destined for the
governorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise that Gray is on the threshold of the
governor's office,'' Zingale said. ``Anyone who knew him well knew
this would happen one day.''

   BBO-YANKEE-FEVER (New York) _ Over the last few weeks, and
especially over the weekend when the reality of the World Series
finally manifested itself on the field of Yankee Stadium, the whole
of New York has been transformed into that idiosyncratic and
much-studied taxonomic group known as the fan. Suddenly the most
important thing in the world seems to be whether a team that has
already won a preposterous 23 championships in 75 years will insist
on one more. By N.R. Kleinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   WASH-AFFIRM (Seattle) _ Two years after California voters
abolished most affirmative action programs and a year after
Houston's residents chose to retain them, voters here in Washington
are facing the only ballot initiative in the country this year
dealing with the issue. The one big thing that both camps agree on
is that the outcome is hugely important to their cause. With their
only electoral victory so far in California, proponents of
eliminating most affirmative action programs hope to carry momentum
from a victory here to other states. But opponents say that if they
can stop the measure in a state like Washington, where affirmative
action is not in general a hugely divisive issue, in large part
because the minority population is relatively small, their victory
may further dampen efforts in other states to bring the matter
before voters. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

   BOX-TYSON (Las Vegas) _ From wires: The Nevada State Athletic
Commission on Monday restored former World Heavyweight Champion
Mike Tyson's right to box, more than a year after his license was

ear in a title bout. By Timothy W. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-UNREST (Turen) _ A ferocious hysteria is sweeping some
remote parts of Indonesia. Communities are so terrified of black
magic that vigilante groups are forming daily to seize, torture and
execute anyone suspected of being a sorcerer. The victims have
little in common beyond the fact that in some way they do not fit
into their communities. At least 150 people, and perhaps many more,
have died so far in the frenzy, and law and order have broken down
almost completely in some areas. The convulsions have disrupted
commerce, paralyzed travel in places, and underscored the risks of
social upheaval as Indonesia grapples with economic depression and
a transition away from political dictatorship. By Nicholas D.
Kristof.

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a sweltering recent autumn afternoon and F. Story
Musgrave, 63, physician, poet, sky diver and now former astronaut,
was sitting in a Florida hotel room and fiddling with a
recalcitrant air-conditioner. ``I'll get this going in a flash,''
declared Musgrave, the former space walker. ``I'm real good at
fixing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he is. In 1993, when the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration needed someone to fix the nearsighted Hubble Space
Telescope, Musgrave was the successful mission commander. Three
years later, he was back in space, deploying and retrieving
satellites for the study of the origin and composition of stars. In
all, he has flown on the shuttle six times, more than anyone else.
Last year, under conditions not entirely of his choosing, Musgrave
retired from the space program. In his hotel room, after the
air-conditioner kicked on, he explained why he left his ``calling''
last September.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did you leave the space program?
</P>
<P>
   A. They told me in the most unambiguous terms that they weren't
going to fly me anymore. I could have fought it. Lots of people
urged me to. But I just figured that space flight is a huge
privilege, and I've had an incredible career.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think you were eased out because of your age? You were
62.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know. I do think NASA is uncomfortable with people
who make a career of being an astronaut. For most astronauts, NASA
is a stepping stone to other things. I think they get uncomfortable
with someone who believes, ``Space is it and I put it ahead of
institutions.'' I had done that. I always said, ``Space is my
calling.'' My own guess is that this was as important as my age.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You were the oldest of the astronauts. Were you a good
subject for experiments on aging and space?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yeah. Agewise, you can't miss with me. If you want to
make some conclusions about age and space, there are decades worth
of scientific data on me in NASA's own format.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I can fly as a full-fledged crew member who does
everything, not just a body they are using for study.
</P>
<P>
   The thing I learned about aging and space is that the more I
did, the easier it got. Whatever functions you lose because of
aging, you gain in terms of experience. I remember that after
landing from the Hubble repair mission, I did five hours of medical
exams, got on an airplane, flew home and went to work the next day
at 8 a.m. I made the circadian shift in one night. My last shuttle
flight was even easier. I walked off and was steady as a rock.
</P>
<P>
   Q. NASA will be flying John Glenn, 77, into space soon. Are you
feeling a twinge of envy about his being given the mission?
</P>
<P>
   A. I feel we should fly him. He was the first American into
orbit. It's probably the right thing to do in terms of historic
closure. And I feel that the reason he is flying, and I'm not, are
probably not related. The real reason he's going up is because he's
John Glenn, and he's a senator, and he convinced them to fly him.
After they made that decision, science _ looking at issues of aging
in space _ became the rationale for justifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I think it will be difficult to make many scientific
conclusions from Sen. Glenn's flight. What they are doing is taking
a John Glenn, who has led the life of a senator for decades, and
all of a sudden, switching his life to that of an astronaut. Now,
what effect does that have? Are you really studying space flight?
Due to the multiple factors involved, such as the total change in
the man's lifestyle, it will be very difficult to attribute any
observed changes to age alone.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that bothers me about the Glenn flight is that
he's chosen to do his space part time, while still a senator, while
still living in Washington. We all know that you get out of a space
flight what you put into it. I do wonder if he'll have much of a
space experience, other than just the survival training.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's a ``space experience?''
</P>
<P>
   A. Two principal things: what you see out the window and also
your cognitive sense of your mind and body in terms of the
free-fall condition. When I go up, I give myself over to the space
experience, surrender to it, let it touch me. I'm always saying to
myself: ``Story, look around. Don't just go out there and fix the
Hubble, look around.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. A more earthbound question: Are you critical of the way the
space program has been administered?
</P>
<P>
   A. Listen, NASA's a magnificent organization at the technical
level. I have such an incredible pride and love for the people who
work space _ not so much for the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   We need to assume that ``the Big We'' _ the president, the
Congress, the NASA, the aerospace industry, the public _ right now
cannot manage any space program. Think about it: We have spent $20
billion over 14 years for a space station and we do not yet have a
screw in orbit!
</P>
<P>
   Another serious problem is that launch costs are too high. The
most important priority should be to have low-cost reliable access
to space, and we seem to have no interest in that. I worry that we
have not developed a new launch vehicle in over 40 years. We're
still flying Atlases and Titans and Deltas from the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think the space station will actually happen?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe so. We are into it for $20 billion and 14 years. It
would be extraordinarily difficult to turn away from that kind of
investment. The current posture we are in, however, is absolutely
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   The posture that bothers me with the shuttle costing more than
$600 million a flight and with our flying this very old, very
fragile technology, is an accident could happen and the whole deck
of cards will come down. You can't do the space station without the
shuttle, and the shuttle is old and fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the current posture is that the space
station will dictate resources and make them dedicated to Earth
orbit activities for the next 10 or 15 years. Also, I worry that
it's all going to be so expensive, so bureaucracy-bound, that we
won't be doing cutting-edge projects anymore. With this current
posture, we may not pursue that science which bridges cosmology and
philosophy _ the science that gets at who am I and what is the
meaning of all this. We must do science that touches to the core _
which means science that asks, ``Who am I?'' Anything less does not
excite the public.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A more earthbound question: You've recently moved your home
base from Texas to Orlando. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. I had a vision for decades that when something brought an end
to my calling I would get into a car and drive to Hobby Airport and
go to Orlando. That's as far as the vision went. I never saw
anything else. Then, when I decided to leave NASA, Disney asked me
to be involved in their work. So the vision kind of came true.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, I'm a consultant to Disney's various projects. I work
on creative ideas for new resorts, new parks, new pavilions. I'm
consulting on movies. One of my own personal goals here, is to find
ways to communicate the experience of space to people without their
actually having been there. Without being specific, there are a lot
of possibilities at Disney for doing that. In Orlando, there's a
lot of interesting work going on in virtual reality. I also like
Orlando. It's an esthetic place and the beach, and what happens at
the Kennedy Space Center, is not very far away.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How are you adjusting to your new status as an ex-astronaut?
</P>
<P>
   A. Who's ``ex?''
</P>
<P>
   Q. You are.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure how it is. Do I miss it? I've got to. But I can
go into space any time I want to.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Through meditation?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, through imagination. I put myself there. I do that.
Listen, I got dealt a card, and went forward with it.

WITH CHANGE IN DIET, BEETLES SHAKE UP CORN COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ In the endless battle between farmers and
insects, the bugs have won another round. A big change in the
behavior of the western corn rootworm beetle is threatening one of
the great success stories in American agriculture, the use of crop
rotation instead of pesticides on millions of acres of Midwestern
corn.
</P>
<P>
   The larva of the beetle, first documented in the United States
in 1867, can devastate corn by eating away the roots of the young
plants, causing them to keel over in a strong wind. Forty years
ago, the beetle became resistant to the insecticides used then. But
farmers, in turn, learned to control the pest by rotating corn and
soybean crops in the same field.
</P>
<P>
   This was the strategy: The adult beetles, which eat corn silks
and pollen, would lay their eggs in a cornfield in midsummer. Their
larvae, the rootworms, would emerge in late May and early June of
the following year. When they found themselves among soybeans
instead of corn, they starved to death because they could not
develop on soybean roots. By the following spring, the soil would
be free of rootworms, ready for a new crop of corn.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in a shift that has shocked farmers and surprised
entomologists, adult western corn rootworm beetles have developed a
taste for soybeans and have added soybean fields to their
egg-laying destinations. When corn is rotated onto these fields the
following spring, the western corn rootworms are waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers first discovered the rootworms in rotated fields in 1986
near Piper City, Ill. ``This was unheard of,'' said Dr. Eli Levine,
a research entomologist at the University of Illinois, who was
called to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he might see northern corn rootworms, found in
relatively small numbers here. In a better-known shift in behavior,
its beetle had begun laying eggs that took two or more years to
hatch, allowing some of its offspring to bypass crop rotation and
show up in young corn.
</P>
<P>
   But instead it was the western corn rootworm. Levine theorized
that the pyrethroid insecticides used in seed corn had simply
forced the beetles into nearby soybeans at egg-laying time.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, the problem stayed in an area less than three
miles square. Then in 1992, there were reports of infestations in
commercial cornfields that were far from any pyrethroid-treated
areas, including Lake County, Ind., south of Gary. Now, the pests
are found in more than 10 counties in Illinois, the northern half
of Indiana, some counties in western Ohio and lower Michigan, and
they are expected to reach southern Wisconsin in five years. Their
spread west is much slower, but scientists expect them to reach
Iowa in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The use of soil insecticides has soared from 13 percent of farms
to more than 90 percent in some affected counties in Illinois.
Nationally these pesticides, widely used in agriculture and the
home, are the subject of scrutiny by federal officials concerned
about water runoff and health. If the problem spreads to all the
state's 7.9 million acres of rotated corn, the additional cost of
soil insecticides could reach $104 million a year, crop scientists
say. Yield losses in untreated corn could reach $132 million a year
in Illinois alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mere curiosity has emerged into a huge problem,'' Levine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, has been shaped in part by human actions
and agricultural practices. The western corn rootworm beetle, whose
scientific name is Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte,
originated in the tropics and was only found in the southwestern
United States as a pest on buffalo gourds. In 1909, it was found
attacking corn on a farm near Greeley, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The beetle got its path east to the corn belt when irrigation
made continuous corn crops possible in Kansas and Nebraska, said
Dr. Robert Metcalf, a professor emeritus of entomology and
environmental studies at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, the beetle became resistant to chlorinated hydrocarbon
insecticides in southeastern Nebraska, Metcalf said, ``and it
immediately migrated.'' By 1964, it reached Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time to get growers off pesticides,'' said Dr.
Joseph Spencer, an expert on insect behavior who has been studying
the beetles for the Illinois Natural History Survey. Once farmers
realized crop rotation would control the rootworms, pesticide use
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   But crop rotation, despite its benefits in restoring nutrients
to soil, has limitations as a pest-control tool. In the spring of
1996, Spencer took a lawn chair and went out into the soybean
fields to watch rootworm beetles. In the nearby cornfields, they
were yellow, but ``the further I went into the soybeans, more and
more females were green,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow beetles were full of corn, the green ones full of
soybean leaves. Many beetles had eaten some of each, cycling
between the fields. Laboratory tests have since shown that ``if
they just eat soybeans, they'll die,'' Spencer said, but if they
are given a choice between the two, they will eat some of each.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bledsoe, an entomologist with the Purdue University
extension service, said the beetles had, in a way become resistant
to crop rotation. ``Planting a soybean field where rootworm eggs
were laid is similar to putting on a powerful insecticide,'' he
said. Faced with insecticides, almost all the insects die, but a
few of the very resistant will not. By killing all but the
resistant ones, ``we have changed the distribution,'' Bledsoe said.
The insects left to reproduce are the ones that are
insecticide-resistant _ or, in this case, the insects that are less
choosy about laying their eggs only in corn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The exact cause of the behavior shift is not known, Spencer
said. It may be that the changes can be attributed to weather or
some environmental factor. But he considers it more likely that
there has been a genetic change in the beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Novak, a professor of medical entomology at the
University of Illinois, who has started studying the DNA of the
beetles, said he had seen ``a marker that looks very good'' for
differentiating between the beetles that like soybeans and the ones
that do not.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Thompson, an evolutionary biologist at Washington State
University in Pullman, pointed out that, ``Every time a genetically
based shift is found, it's always a situation where a local plant
or an introduced plant has gotten very abundant relative to the
usual host plant. That's the situation you have with corn and
soybeans. Every other year, you have a tremendous universe of food
to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in the affected region got a respite last summer, a
tenfold decrease in the number of rootworms, Levine said. He
believes they were drowned by heavy rains that caused flooding just
as they emerged. But this development ``in no way diminishes the
long-term seriousness of the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen miles south of Piper City, where it all began, Greg Pool
said he did not intend to take any chances. He farms nearly 1,400
acres in Melvin, Ill., and still rotates soybeans with corn. Only
now he spends $16 to $17 an acre for insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   For three years Pool has set aside a 10-acre plot to participate
in a University of Illinois study, leaving untreated corn in
scattered patches. The scientists are watching the damage to the
corn roots. He is watching the effect on his yield per acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage is still on the way up,'' Pool said. ``In the first
year, there was a two-bushel difference. Last year, we were in the
8-to-10-bushel difference. This year, it was 17 bushels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've learned my lesson,'' Pool added ``Next year I
won't have the plot, and I'll treat all my acres.''

PROMISE OF SPRING IS UNFULFILLED FOR FOX THIS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of the last television season, Fox was hot.
</P>
<P>
   So hot that at NBC, the prime-time leader, executives were
eyeing the young network in their rear-view mirror when calculating
how to replace ``Seinfeld'' on Thursday nights. The possibility of
a Fox invasion featuring ``The Simpsons,'' ``King of the Hill'' and
``Ally McBeal'' on Thursdays helped lead the network to move its
best comedy weapon, ``Frasier,'' into the ``Seinfeld'' spot.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Fox was so robust that some of its executives
countenanced the possibility that with the World Series and the
Super Bowl on the network this season, and a hoped-for hit new show
here and there, they might seriously challenge NBC in the
competition among young-adult viewers (that 18-to-49-year-old
group), which both networks regard as the true prime-time
television championship.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks into the new television season, the heat wave of last
spring is a fast-fading memory. A batch of new Fox shows have gone
sour quickly; and for the moment, Fox has retreated to its old
strategy of filling the black holes on its schedule with critically
ridiculed (though usually ratings-reliable) specials typified by
this year's newest entry, ``When Good Pets Go Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The network, whose second-place finish to NBC among
18-to-49-year-olds last season was the most notable achievement in
its 12-year history, has fallen off 11 percent in that category
this season, and suddenly finds itself in fourth _ and last _ place
trailing even CBS, which for years has been written off as the
network for old people.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's bad luck may even extend to the World Series this week.
The network's expectation for a surge of buoyant ratings from the
games is threatened by the possibility that the Yankees will run
the Padres off the air in four nights. For any network, getting at
least a six-game series is essential, not only to pay off the
rights fee for the games but also to give as much additional juice
as possible to its overall prime-time ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's riskiest move of the season was shifting the animated show
``King of the Hill'' from Sunday, where it was a hit, to Tuesday,
where it has gotten off to a rocky start. Four other Fox comedies,
``Costello,'' ``Living in Captivity,'' ``Holding the Baby'' and
``Getting Personal,'' all with live people, have already been
jettisoned, underscoring the longtime Fox problem of establishing
noncartoon comedy hits.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Fox with one new comedy, ``That '70s Show,'' which
has performed passably on Sundays but less well than ``King of the
Hill'' did in the same spot last year. ``The Simpsons,'' now paired
with ``That '70s Show,'' has suffered a falloff of more than 10
percent on Sundays so far as well.
</P>
<P>
   At a network known for being fiercely competitive, this is not
the type of outcome that is shrugged off.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at Fox's sister studio, 20th Television, said that
the network ``is pushing for product,'' citing recent questions
from Fox about when a comedy, ``Killer Ap,'' and a drama,
``Rosewell High,'' might be ready.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Roth, the president of Fox Entertainment, said there
was no rush to bring in new shows and dismissed any notion that Fox
was feeling overly stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the best is yet to come,'' he said. ``Check back with
us at the end of November.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It reminds me of 1996.'' That year Fox got off to a
stumbling start, only to right itself in November, add ``King of
the Hill'' in January, and tie ABC for second place in the 18-to-49
competition. (Fox executives also pointed out Monday that in 1996
Fox also had a World Series in which one team dominated the first
two games, but the other team, the Yankees that year, came back to
win in six.)
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Fox is playing without its clean-up hitter.
This season, as in the last several seasons, ``The X Files'' will
offer no new episodes until November. And once again postseason
baseball, which Roth described as ``a great asset for our
company,'' has put Fox's schedule into a squeeze, pre-empting shows
and offering opportunity for some competitors.
</P>
<P>
   One competitor, WB, is an emerging force for Fox to reckon with
because it attracts the same young audience. And WB has done well
establishing some shows this fall, including two on Wednesdays,
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Charmed,'' which are geared toward taking
viewers away from Fox's ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Party of
Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week WB, with a much weaker group of stations, held Fox to
a standstill on Wednesday. But Roth pointed out that because his
network had expected to broadcast a playoff game, neither Fox
series had an original episode. A week earlier a game was delayed
more than two hours by rain. ``It's been a confluence of bad luck''
on Wednesdays, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Roth acknowledged, Fox has tripped this fall.
``Obviously we've made some mistakes,'' he said. ``We've had some
program failure and some scheduling miscues.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latter category he put the move of two of the now
vanished comedies, ``Living in Captivity'' and ``Getting
Personal,'' to Fridays. These not only failed dismally but they
also hurt the network's 9 p.m. drama, ``Millennium.'' Fox has now
slotted a similar dark drama with supernatural overtones,
``Brimstone,'' in that hour.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth defended the ``King of the Hill'' move, saying it was
``part of our long-term strategy.'' Another part is ``That '70s
Show,'' which Roth predicted would eventually ``emerge as a true
winner for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, Roth said, Fox has previously proved that it can turn
its seasons around. ``We pride ourselves on our ability to make
quick decisions,'' he said. And the network has one significant
advantage. It fills only 15 hours a week compared with 22 for the
other big networks.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So for the November sweep rating period, Fox expects to be
highly competitive, pursuing, as it always does, a strategy of
removing almost all the weak hours on its schedule and replacing
them with special programs. This year these will range from the
first television broadcast of the box-office hit ``Jurassic Park
II: The Lost World'' to the Fox roster of video specials.
</P>
<P>
   This year the specials include ``The World's Most Shocking
Moments Caught on Tape,'' (``courtroom brawls, and a mudslide
devouring an entire street'') and surely the month's highlight,
``When Good Pets Go Bad'' (``stunning footage of cats, dogs, horses
and even snakes getting out of control'').
</P>
<P>
   If November can start a turnaround, Roth said, the network
should be able to hold on until three new animated shows it has
high hopes for are ready to go on the schedule after the first of
the year: ``Futurama,'' ``The PJ's'' and ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Super Bowl might help, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost some of the momentum we had last season,'' Roth
said. ``Admittedly we had a tough third quarter. But in the fourth
quarter, we're looking to intercept the pass and regain the
momentum.''

PSYCHOLOGISTS CAN'T AGREE ON BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH SEX OFFENDERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.A. DYER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of publicizing the addresses of rapists, pedophiles and
exhibitionists, society could better protect itself by sending sex
offenders to therapy.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the hotly debated belief of many also argue that
restrictive registration and notification laws, while popular with
the public, actually can undermine treatment. To undermine
treatment, they say, is to risk more sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex offender treatment is the only thing that brings us any
hope of stemming the rate of this crime,'' said Michael Cox,
director of the Sexual Abuse Treatment Program at Baylor College of
Medicine. ``Some registration and notification strategies make
sense to me. But when they begin to rob people of their dignity,
then it truly backfires and ends up increasing the chance of
recidivism.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,300 sex offenders reside in Harris County and about
23,000 live in Texas. Protecting the public from this population
raises tough questions: Should lawmakers direct more resources
toward treatment? Should they pursue more restrictive notification
and registration laws?
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Texas law requires that convicted sex offenders
regularly provide their address and other personal information to
law enforcement officials. Police are under orders to provide some
of that information to local newspapers and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts _ often civil libertarians and those associated
with the field of psychology _ argue that one of society's best
protections against sex offenders is not these notification and
registration laws, but extensive therapy. Likewise, some therapists
argue that treatment can save taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 different organizations provide such therapy in Texas,
according to the state's Registry of Sex Offender Treatment.
Generally, the treatment requires more direct confrontation with
the patient than traditional therapy, with offenders pushed to
accept responsibility for their crimes and for the damage they have
inflicted upon others. Many treatment providers also medicate
offenders to decrease their sexual urges.
</P>
<P>
   If required as a condition of probation or parole, the offenders
can be sent to jail for not cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, offenders often pay for this treatment. But even if
the state paid those costs, therapy would remain cheaper than
imprisonment, said psychologist Collier Cole, chairman of the
state's Council on Sex Offender Treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In an article for a 1997 edition of Texas Medicine, Cole wrote
that ``treatment costs for sex offenders remain significantly below
costs for once again taking the individual through the law
enforcement-judicial process, eventually paying for long-term
offender incarceration and adding the expenses associated with
caring for additional victims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, a 1 percent reduction in recidivism pays for the
treatment of all sex offenders by reducing costs associated with
investigation, trials, incarceration, victims and supervision,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that, here in Texas, treating an offender safely
in the community for one year equals the cost to lock him up for
one month in prison, with no treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   To accept Cole's conclusions begs the assumption that treatment
reduces recidivism. But studies supporting that view typically have
been flawed or incomplete, said R. Karl Hanson, a psychologist and
senior research officer with the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   Working with colleague Monique T. Bussiere, Hanson analyzed more
than 60 studies on sex offender therapy and found that most tracked
offenders only over relatively short periods of time _ say five
years _ even though recidivism can increase over the course of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Hanson said, many of the studies lacked appropriate
comparison or ``control'' groups _ that is, the studies did not
monitor groups of sex offenders who forgo treatment, but who share
various characteristics with those who receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,
Hanson and Bussiere found that offenders who complete sex offender
programs generally are less likely to commit additional sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers cautioned that it does not necessarily
follow that treatment reduces recidivism. The reason: Offenders who
reject therapy may have been more likely to commit new offenses
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. study that may best address those limitations, Hanson
said during a phone interview, was mandated by the California
Legislature in 1984 and is scheduled for completion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary findings from that study indicate that offenders who
complete treatment have lower rates of recidivism than those who
forgo treatment.
</P>
<P>
   While the differences, at least so far, are statistically
insignificant, Hanson said the preliminary results appear
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, chairman of the Council on Sex Offender Treatment, agreed
that it has not been unequivocally, scientifically proven that
therapy reduces recidivism. But he said his own experience and that
of other clinicians support his view that treatment can be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other therapists, Cole acknowledged that therapy
cannot help everyone _ and that some ``hard-core individuals should
be locked up for as long as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said more judges should order initial psychological
assessments to determine which offenders should receive treatment,
which should go to prison and which should receive some combination
of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make a complete blanket statement'' that treatment
works, Cole said, because often ``it depends on the kind of
offender you're working with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the alternative?'' he continued. ``Do we lock everybody
up when we have alternatives that are available and show very good
promise?''
</P>
<P>
   Although not specifically analyzing this state's programs,
Hanson and Bussiere drew more conclusions about offenders who
completed similar programs elsewhere in the nation. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Sex offenders who denied their offense or displayed a low
motivation for treatment were at increased risk of recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   Offenders with negative relationships with their mothers were at
a higher risk for recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual offenders often are passive, with low self-esteem and
substance abuse problems, but rarely meet other criteria for major
mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither general psychological problems nor alcohol abuse were
related to sexual offense recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson and Bussiere also reported that ``when recidivists have
been asked about the factors that contributed to their new offense,
they frequently identify subjective distress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual offenders,'' wrote Hanson and Bussiere, ``appear to
react deviantly when distressed. Specifically, sexual offenders
often report taking solace in sexual thoughts and behavior when
confronted with stressful life events.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapists can point to that finding when they argue that overly
restrictive notification and registration laws undermine treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, whose Baylor sex offender treatment program is the largest
such operation in the area, said the state's changing laws and
mandates cause so much stress to his clients that it often is a
discussion topic during group therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent session, for example, a middle-aged offender
recalled how law enforcement officials had unexpectedly come to his
house to verify information used in the county's sex offender
registry.
</P>
<P>
   The offender said the visit humiliated his family and caused his
daughters, then 10 and 14, to be teased by neighborhood children.
The visit also compelled the offender to explain to his own
daughters why he was in trouble, that he had molested a young girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing that I ever had to do,'' said the
grim-faced man, speaking to other offenders in his therapy session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them as much as I could without going into graphic
details. When I finished, and after they went to bed, I just broke
down and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Other therapists, however, argue that public notification laws
can actually enhance therapy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some treatment is modeled after so-called 12-step
programs in which friends and neighbors provide a support network
for those who exhibit self-destructive behavior, explained
psychologist Cole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would argue that notification and registration is a way
to let people know (about compulsive behavior) and some people
would argue that that's helpful and therapeutic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A third view, discussed in a 1997 U.S. Department of Justice
study of sex offender notification laws, is that such laws can help
compel therapy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after one state gave judges the option of
subjecting offenders to notification laws, officials there reported
a ``huge scramble among offenders to admit to their crime'' in
order to demonstrate they were progressing in therapy and should
not be subject to the law.
</P>
<P>
   Notification can also be used to compel offenders to adhere to
probation and parole conditions or to find a job and remain
employed, the Justice Department report noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of being subject to notification,'' it said, ``...
may help reduce recidivism.'' &QL;

 &HT;    GATES CALLED MASTERMIND OF ANTITRUST PLOT
 &HT;    570&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates masterminded an
illegal campaign to crush rival Netscape Communications Corp. after
Netscape refused a deal to carve up the Internet market between
them, the government charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Netscape said 'no,' Microsoft set out to do exactly what
they said they would do _ crush them,'' David Boies, a star outside
litigator for the Justice Department, told a packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the government's antitrust case against Microsoft,
Boies contented that Gates personally orchestrated a criminal
conspiracy aimed at squashing not only Netscape, but also all other
competitors that dared to threaten Microsoft's dominance in the
personal computing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down to the details, the top management of Microsoft was
directly involved in what was going on,'' Boies alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, the government released the prepared
testimony of its leadoff star witness: Jim Barksdale, Netscape's
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In his 127-page statement, Barksdale challenged Microsoft's
portrayal of his firm ``as a whiner who can't compete in the
marketplace.'' He said Netscape ``has been strong enough and
innovative enough to reinvent its business model in the face of the
slew of Microsoft actions designed to cut off Netscape's air
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   After Microsoft's lawyers complete their opening statement
Tuesday, they will proceed directly to cross-examination of
Barksdale based on his prepared testimony. Under an innovative
procedure ordered by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
all but one of the 24 announced witnesses have submitted their
testimony in written form, saving courtroom time.
</P>
<P>
   On large video monitors, Boies played in court excerpts from
Gates's testimony. In one, Gates said he knew nothing of Netscape's
business plans and that he had played no role in setting strategy
for a crucial June 21, 1995, meeting between key executives of the
two software firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time I had no sense of what Netscape was doing,''
Gates, wearing an olive green suit, said in his deposition taken
Aug. 27 at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Boies also showed a tape in which he asked Gates whether
Microsoft had weighed buying a stake in Netscape. Pausing to
scratch the back of his head, Gates squinted and replied that he
had only a dim recollection of an underling having suggested that
Microsoft, the world's largest software firm, make an investment in
Netscape, then a struggling startup venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that didn't make sense,'' Gates recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Boies then read into the court record a slew of internal
Microsoft memos and e-mail exchanges _ both to and from Gates _
that painted a different picture of what had actually gone on.
</P>
<P>
   In one such message, written three weeks before the 1995
meeting, Gates suggested: ``Of course ...we could even pay
(Netscape) money as part of the deal, buying some piece of them or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   In a another e-mail message, Gates wrote: ``I think there is a
very powerful deal we can do with Netscape.'' And he also raised
the possibility of persuading Netscape to turn the browser market
entirely over to the new Windows 95 operating system, a Microsoft
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really like to see something like this happen!!''
Gates wrote in that memo.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the industry was rife with talk that the Netscape
browser could be mated with the new programming language named Java
as a potential ``cross-platform'' solution to all computing needs _
one which could make Windows, the big Microsoft cash cow, obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Microsoft acted as a business
predator, even paying Internet providers in some cases to feature
its Internet Explorer browser in order to protect its core product.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited trial began with a request from Stephen Houck,
the lead trial lawyer for the 20 states that have joined in the
suit, that Jackson take the witness stand because he had
``repeatedly refused to respond'' to questions during his pretrial
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Mr. Gates' key role in these events, the only
explanation for his failure to appear is his lack of intestinal
fortitude,'' Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government plans to use the deposition in full, Gates
should be counted as one of the prosecution's allotted dozen
witnesses, Microsoft lawyers said in a pleading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the courthouse steps, Microsoft general counsel Bill Neukom
charged that Boise had only offered up ``snippets (of testimony)
out of context'' and added: ``We look forward to presenting our
case, because we believe the facts and the law are on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company's
witnesses were ``chosen to reflect their hands-on experience and
because they were in a position to specifically refute the
government's unwarranted charges.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan held out the possibility, however, that Gates, the
world's richest man, would be called as a one of two rebuttal
witnesses granted to each side.

 &HT;    Enough talk: Smits' ``NYPD'' character starting to phase out
 &HT;    By Phil Kloerc. 1998 Cox News Service
 &HT;    Bye-bye, Bobby. Although there are plenty of crimes to solve for
the cops of ``NYPD Blue'' (10 EDT tonight on ABC) the main order of
business for now is the departure of Bobby Simone.
 &HT;    Jimmy Smits, who's played the suave detective for four years,
wants to move on to develop another series for ABC, and ``NYPD''
will ease Simone out slowly over the next five weeks, with his
departure coming in the middle of November sweeps. After he's gone,
Rick (the actor formerly known as ``Ricky'') Schroder will step in
on Dec. 1 to be the new young-pup partner to dyspeptic detective
Sipowicz (Dennis Franz).
 &HT;    It's a tough time to be shaking up ``NYPD,'' which starts its
sixth season tonight, but maybe an appropriate one. Ratings have
fallen, and last season was a little weak and predictable, despite
a few bright spots. Perhaps a greenhorn Schroder for Sipowicz to
mentor and/or growl at will perk up the pace (although what's
really needed are some meaty subplots for the floundering
supporting characters).
 &HT;    Tonight's and next week's episodes certainly indicate that
creators Steven Bochco and David Milch are going to milk every drop
of pathos out of Simone's departure. Tonight, he has a disturbing
dream, gets stabbed by a perp (just a flesh wound, as they say in
the Westerns) and complains of shortness of breath. By next week,
his symptoms are multiplying like bacteria in a warm petri dish.
 &HT;    Bochco and Co. are being coy about whether they'll bump him off
(they didn't kill his predecessor, John Kelly, even though they
hated David Caruso). But by the end of next week's episode it's
looking like Simone's wife Russell (Kim Delaney, who's staying on
the show) ought to go shopping for a black dress.
 &HT;    One of ``NYPD's'' unremarked-on strengths over the years has
been the flat-out amazing actors it recruits for the small roles of
the victims and victimizers who pass through the interrogation room
and are never seen again. There are six to eight tonight, from a
twitchy, coked-out suspect to a sad-eyed teen-aged rape victim, who
show how much a talented actor can bring a small role to life.
 &HT;    They'll all be forgotten by fans tomorrow , though, as everyone
diagnoses Simone and speculates about whether he'll leave toes-up
or not.
 &HT;    Grade: B
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SEEN AND HEARD
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Kaufman returns to the anchor chair
 &HT;    Looking chipper but feeling a little bit sore, Atlanta news
anchor Monica Kaufman returned to the co-anchor chair at WSB-TV
(ABC-Atlanta) on Monday, 10 days after undergoing breast cancer
surgery.
 &HT;    ``It didn't scare me at all,'' said Kaufman, who returned to the
5 p.m. newscast for the first time following the operation at Emory
University(Ga.) Hospital on Oct. 9 to remove a small cancerous
tumor from her left breast. The 51-year-old anchor had been
diagnosed with an early, highly treatable form of breast cancer
that was confined to the milk duct.
 &HT;    There was no mention of Kaufman's quick comeback at the top of
the newscast, but after the 5:30 p.m. commercial break,
sportscaster Chuck Dowdle presented her with a bouquet of yellow
roses.
 &HT;    ``You're going to make me cry,'' Kaufman said. She thanked her
colleagues and well-wishers, than reminded female viewers to ``get
a mammogram.''
 &HT;    Immediately after the surgery, Kaufman spent a week relaxing on
a Florida beach, but in a telephone interview before Monday's
evening news she said she quickly grew bored.
 &HT;    ``I don't like sitting at home, and it was just time to come
back,'' Kaufman said. ``I missed work and there were two series
that I wanted to finish working on.''
 &HT;    WSB news director Ray Carter said that Kaufman will do the 5
p.m. and 6 p.m. news for now but won't return to anchoring the 11
p.m. newscast for at least another week.
 &HT;    Kaufman said the surgery left a half-inch scar, and the area
around the incicision ``is still a little bit sore.'' However she
said because she was familiar with the procedure she was not
worried about the outcome.
 &HT;    ``My first thought was, at least I'm not gonna need a tattoo,
becasuse I had been saying if it was big scar I'd get a tattoo to
cover it,'' Kaufman joked. ``Even if I lost a breast, if that was
the worst thing that ever happened to me, I'd have nothing to worry
about.''
 &HT;    Although her doctor has cleared her to return to work, Kaufman
said she will not be participating in the annual Susan G. Komen
Race for the Cure in Atlanta on Saturday, a fund-raiser for breast
cancer research. Kaufman has been running in the race for the last
10 years, inspired by a friend at the station who also had breast
cancer.
 &HT;    ``I won't be doing any personal appearances until January, and I
can't do the walk this year because people would be hugging me,''
she said. ``Right now I can't take any hugs on my left side.''

 &HT;    JUDGE RELEASES MORE DOCUMENTS IN JONES LAWSUIT
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _The litigation that spawned the scandal that led to
an impeachment inquiry is a case of Victim v. Victim, judging from
court documents unsealed Monday in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No slight is too petty to ignore, no question is too obvious to
contest in the hundreds of pages of previously secret documents
released on the Internet by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber
Wright, who presided over the proceedings and eventually dismissed
Jones' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Both principles, the filings show, consider themselves the
aggrieved party.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly documented is the bickering and acrimony that
thwarted an out-of-court settlement which might have spared the
president the troubles to which the lawsuit led. The suit charged
that Clinton made improper sexual advances to Jones, a state
employee, when he was governor of Arkansas and that her subsequent
treatment amounted to sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges Congress will consider in deciding whether to
impeach Clinton are whether he perjured himself in the lawsuit and
encouraged Monica Lewinsky to submit a false deposition about their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The newly released documents did not include the sworn
depositions of Jones , Clinton, and Danny Ferguson, the former
Arkansas state trooper who is a co-defendant in the case. However,
the judge did release a routine motion to quash a subpoena for
Lewinsky, the former White House intern referred to in the suit as
``Jane Doe 6.''
</P>
<P>
   In the documents, Clinton was asked if he had sexual relations
since 1986 with any women ``who were state or federal employees
...'' His written answer was ``none.''
</P>
<P>
   He has since admitted a intimate relationship with Lewinsky, who
worked at the White House and Pentagon, but has maintained that he
understood the term ``sexual relations'' to cover only intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The documents consist mainly of both sides' pleadings to Judge
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers complained about their client _ the plaintiff _
being ordered to give depositions in the ``hostile environment'' of
a Little Rock law firm chosen by attorneys for the defendant _
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In one session, her lawyers complained, Jones was ``presented at
that office (with) what plaintiff contends to be false, perjurious
testimony of two convicts alleging prior sexual relations with
plaintiff. Such testimony is clearly calculated to emotionally
upset plaintiff, which it did, and plaintiff and her counsel had no
place to go ... (to) collect herself and recover from such
emotionally trying depositions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attorneys attacked the relevance of questions about
whether he had extramarital sexual relations with any state
employee while he was governor of Arkansas and used the state
patrol to facilitate the meeting _ essentially what he as accused
of trying to do with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton objects to this request for admission in
that it is intended solely to harass, embarrass and humiliate the
president and the office he occupies,'' argued his attorney, Robert
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers objected to the president's refusal to answer
interrogatories that ``seek the identify of all medical doctors who
have examined or treated Mr. Clinton's genitals since May 8,
1991.'' Objections that this constituted an unreasonable invasion
of privacy are ``totally without merit,'' they contended.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett complained that Jones lawyers didn't want to throw
open the doors of her life, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiff seeks to cut off all discovery of her past conduct,
while she simultaneously is pursuing limitless discovery of
President Clinton's past,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents, written by lawyers, reveal little about
the personalities of the principals. An exception is an answer
Jones gave when asked about professionals she had consulted for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had any psychologist, psychiatrist, etc.,'' said
Jones. ``My only counselors are the Lord, my husband and my mother.
(The Lord is helpful, but my husband can talk back.)''
</P>
<P>
   The case will take another turn Tuesday as Jones' lawyers ask to
a federal panel of judges to reverse Judge Wright's decision to
dismiss the case. They will argue that the case should be reopened
because of Clinton's tainted testimony and also cite a Supreme
Court decision since Wright's decision that broadened the legal
definition of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal will be heard in Minnesota before three federal
judges.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton reportedly rejected an offer from Mrs. Jones
to settle the case for $2 million _ with half the funds being
provided by New York real estate developer Abe Hirschfeld, who has
offered a $1 million contribution.

GRIEVING PARENTS CREATE A CD TO HONOR THE CHILDREN THEY'VE LOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days and weeks after her son's murder, Brenda O'Quin
listened to a lot of music _ including Mariah Carey and Boyz II
Men, acts that 17-year-old Michael McEachern had loved.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and a friend, 16-year-old Katy Nesbit, had been shot
during a robbery on Aug. 26, 1995, and O'Quin says music was a
great comfort to her. She and other members of the North Texas
chapter of Parents of Murdered Children would trade songs that had
helped them deal with their loss.
</P>
<P>
   It only made sense to put together a CD of songs that soothed
those left behind after senseless deaths, and now, after two years
of planning and preparation, that CD is a reality: ``Lullabies From
Heaven: Songs for Healing Hearts'' will be available at local
stores within a few weeks, O'Quin says. Copies of the CD can also
be ordered via a Web page, www.lullabiesfromheaven.com, beginning
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to remember our children by music or special
songs _ I know how much it helped me,'' she said. ``I think this
will help people a lot in getting through their grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lullabies'' is a sweet, pleasant CD _ but it becomes more
significant when you realize who some of its guest contributors
are. Among them are bassist Chuck Rainey (who has played with
Steely Dan and Aretha Franklin, among many others), jazz
saxophonist Rene Ounza, western swing legend Leon Rausch, and Fort
Worth bluesman Raleigh Smith.
</P>
<P>
   These contributions came through the well-known local bluesman
Dave Millsap, who has played with Delbert McClinton, Bobby Whitlock
and Jerry Lynn Williams and is the main organizer of the Fort Worth
Guitar Army.
</P>
<P>
   A mutual friend introduced Millsap and O'Quin, and Millsap
jumped at the chance to produce the CD. He had his own family
tragedy: In March 1997 his niece, 10-year-old Melissa Dearden, was
killed in a sledding accident while on spring break in Crested
Butte, Colo. In his grief afterward, Millsap composed two songs,
``Angel's Mountain'' and ``Song for Melissa.''
</P>
<P>
   Millsap began working regularly at Eagle Audio with engineer
Mike Talmage, recording songs and looking through recordings sent
for possible inclusion on the project. He and other players
overdubbed music for ``Michael's Song,'' a tune O'Quin wrote and
local vocalist Toni Williams sang, and he recorded versions of both
``Angel's Mountain'' and ``Song for Melissa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We gathered up Melissa's friends, who are all like 10 years
old, and had them sing `Jesus Loves the Little Children,' and then
we faded that in and out,'' Millsap said. ``It's a neat little
twist. It kind of made it special.''
</P>
<P>
   He also solicited various musicians (including Rainey and
Rausch) for songs. Rainey's ``Possessions'' came from an upcoming
solo CD, and Rausch's version of ``Peace in the Valley'' was
recorded just for this project, as was Smith's ``Angela.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Quin introduced Millsap to teen-ager Shelby Standley; she
recorded ``Bless a Brand New Angel,'' a composition from the Los
Angeles mother-and-daughter writing team of Judithe and Robin
Randall; the song had originally been featured on an episode of
``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this song and the contact with the Randalls, this CD
never would have happened,'' O'Quin said.
</P>
<P>
   Millsap said there's something for everybody on the CD, and it's
true: ``Possessions'' and Ounza's ``Angel in Flight'' are nice
jazz, Rausch's ``Peace in the Valley'' is lovely country gospel,
``Angel's Mountain'' and ``Bless a Brand New Angel'' are pure
country, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, there are already plans for a second volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volume two should be real interesting,'' he said. ``Since I've
done this I'm going to target a different thing. I'm going to try
to stir up some interest with Stephen (Bruton) and Delbert
(McClinton) and Lee Roy (Parnell) and get a different crew, an
all-original record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty pleased with this. I figured if I ever produced a
record it would be a blues CD, but in a way it is.''

THE PEPSI TAPES: A SPECIAL INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM ROGERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following is a transcript of a taped conversation between
two high-level Pepsico marketing executives. Their conversation
concerns the naming of the new Pepsi One cola, which distributors
introduced last weekend to a thirsty nation of beverage drinkers.
The tape was obtained by a Fort Worth Star-Telegram operative who
infiltrated the Pepsico organization with the aid of a special pair
of ``magic pants'' that rendered the operative invisible to the
eyes of high-level marketing executives.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-LEVEL MARKETING EXECUTIVE NO. 1, HEREINAFTER CALLED
``FELICITY'': Diet Pepsi's share of the $54 billion domestic
soft-drink market has slipped to 5.5 percent. Diet Coke is kicking
our cans. We need a new product, a home run, something with
potential for branding.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-LEVEL MARKETING EXECUTIVE NO. 2, HEREINAFTER CALLED
``NILS'': How about Pepsi Red? Or Red Pepsi? Oh, oh, I know: Redsi!
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: That whole ``red'' concept is SO 1996. Focus groups
hate ``red'' almost as much as they hate ``clear.'' Extremely
difficult to brand.
</P>
<P>
   NILS: Don't mention ``clear.'' Crystal Pepsi almost cost me my
high-level job and the high-level house that comes with it. OK,
forget ``red.'' Bad idea. Picture this: Pepsi Ultra Menthol Light.
It delivers twice the delicious nicotine with half the nasty tar.
What's that Teletubby's name? Po? Is he doing endorsements?
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: I forgot you came from Philip Morris. No, I don't
think Pepsi Ultra Menthol Light is a viable idea. Let's focus on
the newly FDA-approved sweetener that R&AMP;D is using. It's called
Sunett, and it's made by Nutrinova, a division of Hoechst. Its
generic name is acesulfame potassium.
</P>
<P>
   NILS: I've got it. Pepsi Sulfassium. Work with me here. The
slogan could be ``Alive with Sulfassium!'' No? How about ``Come to
where the Hoechst is''?
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: Excellent feedback. I'm not saying those aren't
quality ideas, because they are. But they're not home runs.
</P>
<P>
   NILS: I don't have much to work with here. If we were using a
cutting-edge sweetener like sucralose or stevia, maybe we'd have
something. Or neotame. I've got some hot ideas for neotame _ soon
as the FDA makes sure it doesn't cause incontinence in mice.
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: OK, follow me on this. I'm going to describe our
vision for you. Help me to realize the vision. We want to target
this new cola to young men. We want to brand it as the cola
beverage for men who eschew the ``diet'' label.
</P>
<P>
   NILS: Check. Probably the same eschewal principles at work that
left me with 20,000 cases of Crystal Pepsi in my garage.
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: So the new cola fulfills an unmet need, see? It's for
guys who don't do diet. It has one calorie.
</P>
<P>
   NILS: Hmm ... Pepsi ... one calorie.
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: That's it! Pepsi One! I love it, baby! What about a
slogan?
</P>
<P>
   NILS: I'll just throw this out: ``Only One is all that and a bag
of chips.''
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: Now you're talking. Except leave that last part off.
``Only One has it all.'' That has a ring to it. Who can we get for
a spokesman?
</P>
<P>
   NILS: I understand Cuba Gooding Jr. can do standing backflips.
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: You know, it's just crazy enough to work.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates masterminded an
illegal campaign to crush rival Netscape Communications Corp. after
Netscape refused a deal to carve up the Internet market between
them, the government charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Netscape said 'no,' Microsoft set out to do exactly what
they said they would do _ crush them,'' David Boies, a star outside
litigator for the Justice Department, told a packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the government's antitrust case against Microsoft,
Boies contented that Gates personally orchestrated a criminal
conspiracy aimed at squashing not only Netscape, but also all other
competitors that dared to threaten Microsoft's dominance in the
personal computing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down to the details, the top management of Microsoft was
directly involved in what was going on,'' Boies alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, the government released the prepared
testimony of its leadoff star witness: Jim Barksdale, Netscape's
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In his 127-page statement, Barksdale challenged Microsoft's
portrayal of his firm ``as a whiner who can't compete in the
marketplace.'' He said Netscape ``has been strong enough and
innovative enough to reinvent its business model in the face of the
slew of Microsoft actions designed to cut off Netscape's air
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   After Microsoft's lawyers complete their opening statement
Tuesday, they will proceed directly to cross-examination of
Barksdale based on his prepared testimony. Under an innovative
procedure ordered by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
all but one of the 24 announced witnesses have submitted their
testimony in written form, saving courtroom time.
</P>
<P>
   On large video monitors, Boies played in court excerpts from
Gates's testimony. In one, Gates said he knew nothing of Netscape's
business plans and that he had played no role in setting strategy
for a crucial June 21, 1995, meeting between key executives of the
two software firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time I had no sense of what Netscape was doing,''
Gates, wearing an olive green suit, said in his deposition taken
Aug. 27 at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Boies also showed a tape in which he asked Gates whether
Microsoft had weighed buying a stake in Netscape. Pausing to
scratch the back of his head, Gates squinted and replied that he
had only a dim recollection of an underling having suggested that
Microsoft, the world's largest software firm, make an investment in
Netscape, then a struggling startup venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that didn't make sense,'' Gates recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Boies then read into the court record a slew of internal
Microsoft memos and e-mail exchanges _ both to and from Gates _
that painted a different picture of what had actually gone on.
</P>
<P>
   In one such message, written three weeks before the 1995
meeting, Gates suggested: ``Of course ...we could even pay
(Netscape) money as part of the deal, buying some piece of them or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   In a another e-mail message, Gates wrote: ``I think there is a
very powerful deal we can do with Netscape.'' And he also raised
the possibility of persuading Netscape to turn the browser market
entirely over to the new Windows 95 operating system, a Microsoft
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really like to see something like this happen!!''
Gates wrote in that memo.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the industry was rife with talk that the Netscape
browser could be mated with the new programming language named Java
as a potential ``cross-platform'' solution to all computing needs _
one which could make Windows, the big Microsoft cash cow, obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Microsoft acted as a business
predator, even paying Internet providers in some cases to feature
its Internet Explorer browser in order to protect its core product.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited trial began with a request from Stephen Houck,
the lead trial lawyer for the 20 states that have joined in the
suit, that Jackson force Gates to take the witness stand because he
had ``repeatedly refused to respond'' to questions during his
pretrial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Mr. Gates' key role in these events, the only
explanation for his failure to appear is his lack of intestinal
fortitude,'' Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government plans to use the deposition in full, Gates
should be counted as one of the prosecution's allotted dozen
witnesses, Microsoft lawyers said in a pleading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the courthouse steps, Microsoft general counsel Bill Neukom
charged that Boise had only offered up ``snippets (of testimony)
out of context'' and added: ``We look forward to presenting our
case, because we believe the facts and the law are on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company's
witnesses were ``chosen to reflect their hands-on experience and
because they were in a position to specifically refute the
government's unwarranted charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan held out the possibility, however, that Gates, the
world's richest man, would be called as a one of two rebuttal
witnesses granted to each side.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For years, Debbie Walden believed that Christ could set
her free from homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Two failed marriages, two emotional breakdowns and numerous
Christian ``gay healing'' sessions later, Walden said she finally
has accepted that her lesbian orientation is as much a part of her
as her eye color _ and that she can still be a good Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty sad when you're 44 and just becoming able to
accept yourself,'' said the Plano resident. Raised a strict
Southern Baptist, she now is one of 2,400 weekly worshipers at
Cathedral of Hope, a predominantly gay and lesbian congregation in
Dallas that is part of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan
Community Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christian groups disagree with Walden's assessment. Certain
that homosexuals can change their lifestyles, they are pushing
programs that blend evangelism with 12-step counseling to try to
convert gays to heterosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The programs received national publicity this summer in a series
of full-page advertisements in major newspapers including The New
York Times and USA Today. The ads claimed that the programs had
helped ``tens of thousands'' to ``walk out of homosexuality ...
into sexual celibacy or even marriage.'' The $500,000 campaign was
sponsored by the American Family Association, the Christian
Coalition and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Folger, national director of the Center for Reclaiming
America, who first suggested the ads, rejected as ``irresponsible''
criticism from gay rights groups that the campaign nurtured the
climate that led to the beating death of a gay Wyoming student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign is not about hate,'' Folger said. ``It's about
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the coalition of mainly religious-right groups are planning
to follow up the ads with two TV commercials to underscore their
belief that homosexuals can become heterosexual, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use the word `cure,''' stressed Eddie Traughber,
co-director of Living Hope Ministries of Arlington, a local program
that offers counseling and support groups based on a 12-step
approach. ``The way we see healing taking place is when an
individual's relationship with God grows deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   But the push for ``gay healing'' has brought a backlash from
some in the psychiatric community and from a new group of
ex-ex-gays, like Walden, who say that Christian therapy programs
only added to their personal confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who have worked with gays and lesbians know you
cannot change homosexual orientation any more than you can change
heterosexual orientation,'' said Dr. Marshal Forestein, assistant
professor of clinical psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ``There
are a small group of people who are bisexual who can focus their
orientation one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Pierce, 28, a charismatic Christian gay, said he underwent
fasts, prayer vigils and the laying on of hands by Pentecostal
ministers to ``cast out the foul demons,'' but nothing changed his
sexuality. Such efforts led only to desperation and depression,
said Pierce, who has since joined Fort Worth's Angel of Hope
Church, a Disciples of Christ-affiliated congregation which has
both gay and heterosexual pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas animator Charlie Rose said he struggled with his
homosexuality for decades, endured a seven-year stretch of
celibacy, sought out friendships with women that never evolved into
romances and joined fundamentalist churches that condemned
homosexuality as against the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose, like Walden, said his ``healing'' wasn't permanent. He
ended up dating a gay he met at a ``healing'' gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a 12-step program for people who are Christian and
either came from a gay lifestyle or had questions about their
sexual orientation,'' Rose recalled. ``You couldn't wear shorts or
thongs _ had to wear pants. You could share a ride but couldn't
socialize. But a lot of people left because they met new boyfriends
there.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Christian ``healing'' programs have operated in the
Metroplex for several years. Typically not affiliated with any
major religious denomination or church, they are part of a national
network of small groups that operate with limited resources. Two in
North Texas are affiliated with Exodus International, a
22-year-old, Seattle-based organization that endorses conversion
programs that meet its expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Living Hope Ministries operates on a $20,000
budget and offers support groups and counseling based on 12-step
programs akin to Alcoholics Anonymous, said Randy Thomas, its
co-director.
</P>
<P>
   Its participants _ he says there are 30 to 40 _ are urged to
accept that homosexuality is a problem that can't be overcome
without Christ. Stressed are Bible readings indicating that
homosexuality is a sin that can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Traughber, a licensed family and marriage therapist with a
master's degree, estimated a success rate of ``30 to 40 percent''
but said he has not tracked participants during the past nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   After years as an active homosexual, Thomas says he changed to a
heterosexual orientation after attending the program, although he
still acknowledges an occasional erotic thought about men.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Thomas said, he became engaged to a woman, but
it didn't last. He said he and his fiancee never had sex, never
kissed, never went beyond holding hands. But the experience
``showed me I could have a good, godly relationship with the
opposite sex. So when I do meet my future wife, I've learned
important relational skills.''
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of downtown Dallas, the Rev. Terry Wier uses more
unconventional methods when working with gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Wier runs the nondenominational Isaiah 56 Ministries and claims
a 98 percent success rate ``healing'' gays. He said he's too busy
to do any follow-up studies, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heal everything from androgyny to zoophilia. I guess I've
counseled 5,000,'' said Wier, a 50-year-old former fashion
photographer who jokingly refers to himself as a ``redneck from
Odessa.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing takes place by opening spiritual pathways to bring God,
he said. Then, if someone has an urge to have anonymous gay sex, he
prescribes aversion therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have them drop a mint-sized bitter pill in their mouth or
open a small bottle of rotting hamburger,'' he said. ``We ask them
to smell it and put their mind to God by singing a worship song.''
</P>
<P>
   That technique drew criticism from one of the leading
practitioners of gay therapy, California psychologist Joseph
Nicolosi, who heads the California-based National Association for
Research and Therapy of Homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rotting hamburger? That's ridiculous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolosi said many clerics don't have the proper background to
be counseling gay people in this area. Nicolosi says chances for a
conversion are best when the therapist is involved in the patient's
life, almost like a surrogate father who works to spur masculine
identification, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose and Walden think that any such efforts are futile and
that sexual orientation is not a matter of choice.
</P>

rejection, fear and pain. You fear for your job, your children.''

FONG RAISES RACE ISSUE IN ATTACKING BOXER COMMERCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Raising the issue of race for the first time
in his race for Senate, Republican Matt Fong has accused incumbent
Barbara Boxer of orchestrating a racially tinged campaign against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, California's state treasurer, said a recent television
commercial by Democrats uses ``fear and race.'' And he charged that
Boxer plans to attack him for an illegal contribution he returned
from an Indonesian businessman.
</P>
<P>
   But a Boxer spokesman called the charge ``complete fiction'' and
said Fong was defensive because of new allegations in Washington
about his role in accepting the illegal contribution.
</P>
<P>
   A draft report from Democrats on the House Committee on
Government Reform and Oversight, leaked to reporters on Friday,
raised questions about Fong's account of his handling of the
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Fong accepted $100,000 from Indonesian businessman Ted Sioeng to
pay down debt from his 1994 race for treasurer, but returned it
after Newsweek magazine raised questions about the legality of the
donation from a foreign source.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report by Democratic members on the committee said
Fong may be sincere in saying he didn't know the money was illegal.
But the report pointed to ``inconsistencies and implausible
aspects'' in Fong's testimony before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also a possibility that Matt Fong has not testified
truthfully,'' the report said. ``Further investigation is needed to
resolve this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for Fong, was furious at the release
of the draft report, which he said was an attempt to influence the
election. But Democrats defended the timing, which came 10 days
after Republicans on the House committee issued their own interim
report on campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Fong made his comments at a Palo Alto fund-raiser Sunday with
former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. The event, a $60-a-plate
affair hosted by the Vietnamese-Americans of Northern California
Committee, raised $20,000 for the Fong campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The event mixed old-fashioned American patriotism with Asian
ethnic pride.
</P>
<P>
   It featured an appearance by Miss Vietnam '98 and boastful talk
by Asian-American political leaders of electing Fong, a
fourth-generation Chinese-American, to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The event underscored Fong's strong support from the
Asian-American community. But the Senate hopeful surprised even
some supporters with his bristling attack on Boxer's alleged use of
the race issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare Barbara Boxer continue using her tactics of fear and
distortion to divide, not to unite us, and to use race where it
should not be used _ in an election,'' Fong said, raising his voice
before the 200 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fong referred to a new television commercial, paid for by the
California Democratic Party, that attacks him for opposing a
patient's right to sue a health maintenance organization for
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   He told supporters the commercial is wrong: He supports a
patient's right to sue, but would limit the size of jury awards.
But the worst part is the commercial's attempt to make his race a
factor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, the narrator says Fong ``wants laws that mean
just about the only people in America who can't be sued are foreign
diplomats and HMOs.'' The commercial shows a black-and-white photo
of Fong next to a grainy image of the United Nations headquarters
in New York, with the tagline: ``Foreign diplomats and HMOs off the
hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong quoted Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania
expert on televised campaign commercials, who said the subtle link
to ethnicity and race was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But Art Torres, the state Democratic Party chairman, who
approved the commercial, said the charge of a race-focused effort
is ``unfounded and a diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Fong-diplomat link was made because voters know
foreign diplomats can't be sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most easily understood kind of immunity,'' Torres
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer campaign spokesman Roy Behr said the senator, who is
seeking her second term, plans to stick to issues of policy not
race. But he said questions over Fong's handling of Indonesian
donation are not irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does say something about Matt Fong,'' Behr said. ``It says
he will do anything to raise money. That has been borne out over
and over again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere between the production of ``Wit'' at the
Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn., last November and the
production of ``Wit'' that reopened at the MCC Theater in Manhattan
this month, Kathleen Chalfant says, her performance got better.
</P>
<P>
   That, Ms. Chalfant explained over a bowl-size cup of coffee on a
recent morning in her cozy West Village home, is because her older
brother _ a mentor and close friend _ died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wit,'' Ms. Chalfant, 53, plays a woman who herself is dying
of ovarian cancer. And after living through the death of her
brother, Alan Palmer, on Good Friday, she said, she approached the
play with a new level of empathy and insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finding that playing the play now is a kind of memorial to
Alan,'' said Ms. Chalfant, who was wearing a blond wig over the
head she keeps shaved for the role. ``It's somewhere to put both my
grief at his loss and what I learned about dying from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant's performance as a 50-year-old English professor,
Vivian Bearing, has received unusually resounding critical praise.
In The New York Times, Peter Marks called it ``as intelligent and
uncompromising as you're likely to come across on a New York
stage.'' New York Magazine called Ms. Chalfant ``a Vivian of power
and vulnerability, commanding intelligence and compelling irony.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News of New York said that Ms. Chalfant and the
playwright, Margaret Edson, ``create the kind of moving,
enthralling and challenging experience that reminds you what
theater is for.'' And so on. The play has been extended at the
nonprofit MCC through Nov. 22 and may have a future commercial run.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Ms. Chalfant's experience with her brother help her
in reapproaching the play _ it was he, in fact, who read the script
and told her to do it in the first place _ but she said that having
done the play helped her help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what to do,'' she said, ``and how to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, a fund-raiser 14 years her senior who had an
encyclopedic knowledge of opera and ballet, lived with Ms. Chalfant
for the last two years of his life, occupying one of the apartments
in the town house that she and her husband also share with a cousin
and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant slept in a chair in her brother's hospital room
during her brother's final days and was there when he died. ``He
was my glamorous relative,'' she said. ``He encouraged me to be an
actor. He took it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the things her brother's experience taught her, Ms.
Chalfant said, was what happens at the end. In the play, she
collapses into bed the way her brother did, remembering how his
body simply stopped working. And she plays her final scene _ in
which her former English professor reads ``The Runaway Bunny'' to
her _ with an understanding of how the mind of an ill person makes
its own reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few days of his life, Ms. Chalfant said of her
brother, ``he began to tell stories to people who came that were
hallucinations, but he narrated them in a perfectly clear way. I
realized that at the end of your life, it doesn't matter whether
something is objectively real to the outside world or not. There
isn't any experiential difference between what we call reality and
hallucination.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The play has also allowed Ms. Chalfant to draw on her experience
studying the classics in graduate school at Stanford University. In
``Wit'' her character specializes in the Holy Sonnets of the
17th-century poet John Donne. To prepare for the role, Ms. Chalfant
said she read a great deal about Donne, including a 1989 article by
Richard Strier mentioned in the script.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the medical details in the play when they
were performing at the Long Wharf, Ms. Chalfant and her fellow cast
members took field trips to Yale-New Haven Hospital and talked with
nurses, who evaluated the play's medical procedures for
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant also had her brother reread the play to make sure
it rang true to his experience, and he saw it performed twice
before he died. The play's director, Derek Anson Jones, said he had
noticed a change in Ms. Chalfant's performance from one production
to another. ``There is a level of true fear and dislocation that
she brings, which I think adds greater resonance to the work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant was born in San Francisco and spent much of her
childhood in Oakland, where her parents ran a 50-room boarding
house for working people that served two hot meals a day, six days
a week. She met her husband, the filmmaker Henry Chalfant, in
college and married him after she graduated in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, David, 30, is a bass player in the Nields, a folk
fusion band. Their daughter, Andromache, 26, a painter, who has
been working as a set designer for film and theater.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Ms. Chalfant was praised so thoroughly was in
1993, for her portrayal of multiple parts in ``Angels in America,''
for which she received a Tony award nomination. Since then she has
appeared steadily in productions off-Broadway and at regional
theaters, including the Hartford Stage Company in Connecticut and
Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said she had not expected to be so warmly embraced,
particularly in the role of a dying woman who lectures about Donne.
``When we first did the play, I wasn't sure whether or in what way
it was redemptive,'' she said. ``Here, the response to the play has
been overwhelmingly powerful, and overwhelmingly positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for everyone,'' she said.

the the People's Choice Award at Toronto and is likely to be one of
this year's Oscar foreign film nominees. By Bob Strauss.

SHANKAR'S TEEN DAUGHTER FOCUSES ON HER MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Her voice is basic Southern California beach girl:
bright, friendly and open. But when 17-year-old Anoushka Shankar
picks up the sitar to play with her famous father, she's pure
India, the hypnotic drone of the instrument distilling centuries of
craft and tradition in her young, talented hands.
</P>
<P>
   She has been accompanying father Ravi Shankar since she was 10,
first on tambura and since 13, on sitar, during winter tours of
their home country, summer tours of Europe and spot concerts
throughout North America in between.
</P>
<P>
   That means hours of practice, a couple each night, three or four
each weekend day, five or six when she's in India on tour and ``the
music is the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Shankar has been leading the more or less
normal life of a high school senior in Encinitas, an upscale beach
town in north San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   That means finding time for all the studying needed to keep up
with an accelerated course load at her alternative public high
school. And ensuring concert dates don't conflict with prom
weekend. And beginning to apply to such colleges as Brown
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of the things that I do would keep me completely busy if
that were all that I did,'' Shankar said. ``In a sense, I'm not
doing anything fully. I have sleepovers once a month with a group
of 13 or 14 friends. I end up missing so many of them because I
travel. Or I'll miss parties or plans because I'll be leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   With her first album debuting today and an industry showcase on
Nov. 4 in Los Angeles, it might be a tad daunting _ except it's all
she's ever really known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it for so long that I don't know how strange
it is for me,'' Shankar said. ``I feel more strange about it when
people ask me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankar began learning sitar from her father at age 8, at her
mother's urging. Learning the difficult instrument and performing
40 dates a year with her 78-year-old father has cemented a special
bond with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a musician, it's been incredible being his daughter,
because he gets so much attention and listeners,'' Shankar said.
``I don't know what kind of relationship I would have with him if
we didn't have the music, because that's the part that binds me
together with him.''
</P>
<P>
   She is giddy about her debut release, ``Anoushka,'' a fine first
effort that hits record stores today. Angel Records will also
release the first two of a series of her father's classic albums
going back to the late 1960s when he first rose to world prominence
because of his influence on the Beatles. Though her father wrote
her album's music and produced it, Anoushka said the music is
definitely hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were playing, it would be a lot different,'' she said.
``He tends to be a lot more vigorous. He sort of goes nuts when he
plays. I'm still more reserved. I've noticed it more on stage. Me,
I'm not that lost.''

HUMOR IN THE HOLOCAUST? BENIGNI FINDS SOME IN `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``HALLO! How are you? Nice to hear you!''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Benigni is calling from Rome with a voice so full of
gusto that it sounds like he's shouting from 5 feet away. As
always, the exuberant Italian comedian exudes a sense of fun and
affection and is apparently overjoyed to share your company,
whoever you are.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've just got to make a concentration camp comedy,
Benigni is probably the best guy to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's not a comedy about the Holocaust,'' Benigni
says of ``Life Is Beautiful,'' his award-winning movie that's
scheduled to open the AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival
on Thursday, a day before commencing its commercial engagement
here. ``I am a comedian who did a movie about the Holocaust. The
second half of it is set in a concentration camp, and that's a
comedian playing a real tragedy. That makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   While Americans may barely recognize the frizzy-haired,
Gumby-resembling 45-year-old from the indie films of Jim Jarmusch
(``Down by Law,'' ``Night on Earth'') or the unsuccessful attempt
to revive the old Peter Sellers cop comedy franchise ``Son of the
Pink Panther,'' Europeans know Benigni as the most popular Italian
comic of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Stecchino,'' in which he played a goofball con artist
and the murderous mobster who looks just like him, is the most
successful movie in Italian history. In a follow-up hit, ``The
Monster,'' Benigni once again played an inept penny ante swindler
type, who was this time confused with a serial rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the slapstick-prone Benigni has a bent for comedy
with an edge. But his previous work was nowhere near as risky as
his long-nurtured concept about a wacky Jewish waiter who, when
shipped off to a concentration camp toward the end of World War II,
shields his young son from the horror of their situation by
pretending that it's all just a big, elaborate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Benigni admits in disarming, not-quite-fluent
English. ``But I was scared like when you are in love with
somebody, because I was honest with myself. I was not trying to
make something violent or bad. A lot of friends of mine told me
that this would lose me a lot of my audience. But the idea was so
simple _ it's a love story, about a man's love for his family and
his son _ and I can't imagine something better than this. If I
could come back, I would remake it 100 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Against most expectations, Benigni's conviction has been
rewarded. ``Life Is Beautiful'' was another huge hit at home and
won eight Donatellos, Italy's Academy Award equivalent. Though it
stirred some controversy at the Cannes Film Festival last spring,
it also received a 20-minute ovation and the Grand Jury Prize. Even
more than his usually ecstatic self, Benigni kissed everyone on
stage at the closing night ceremony, then kissed jury president
Martin Scorsese's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni was even more moved by ``Life Is Beautiful's'' positive
reception at the Jerusalem Film Festival. Trees were planted in the
Israeli city in honor of Benigni and his wife, Nicoletta Braschi,
the leading lady of ``Beautiful'' and most of his productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roberto approached this project with great reverence, and the
film has played beautifully in festival after festival,'' notes
Marcy Granata, executive vice president of marketing and publicity
for Miramax Films, which is distributing ``Beautiful'' in America.
``Not only is it an audience-pleaser, it's a critics film. It works
on many emotional levels, and people respond to that. It's a fable;
and the universal thing everyone is going to understand is
protecting the innocence of their children, no matter what
sacrifice they have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Fitzgerald, the director of AFI's L.A. Film Festival,
describes ``Life Is Beautiful's'' uniquely difficult achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my favorite film in Cannes,'' Fitzgerald notes. ``I
really thought it was an amazing accomplishment to take something
as serious as the Holocaust and be able to let an audience enjoy a
story with that as the backdrop. It's a pleasant surprise when
you're watching it and thinking, `He can't pull this off, it can't
happen,' then he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni took a few precautions with the material, of course. He
had ``Life Is Beautiful's'' script, which he co-wrote with Vincenzo
Cerami, vetted by members of Milan's Jewish community, and he
invited Holocaust survivors to observe and advise during filming.
Benigni claims the feedback he got was almost entirely of a
technical and historical accuracy nature, with little to no
criticism of the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an artist, I took some license,'' he admits, ``some
freedom, some liberty. But they helped me a lot _ with their heart,
with their sensitivity _ and I have to thank them very, very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not Jewish himself, Benigni can locate the origins of
``Life Is Beautiful'' in family experience. His father, a poor
farmer from Tuscany, was serving in the army in occupied Albania
when Italy switched sides at the height of World War II. The
Germans quickly overcame their former Fascist allies, and Benigni's
father spent the last two years of the conflict imprisoned in a
Nazi slave labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were the same as the concentration camps, but
there were no gas chambers _ which is a big difference, I know,''
Benigni says. ``But when he came back, he was a skeleton, like 35
kilos (about 77 pounds). And he was obsessed by the need to tell
his story to me and my three sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Benigni soon realized that he was frightening the
children he loved but still could not repress the need to talk out
his trauma every evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he started to tell us the story with levity, in a different
way,'' Roberto recalls. ``Funny stuff did happen in the camp also.
Me and my sisters were not having fun, but we were smiling
sometimes at this. And when my father started to smile back, he
stopped having nightmares so. This was very touching for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his father infected the children with his natural
inclination toward comic playfulness _ ``The way I play with my son
in the movie is the way he played with me,'' Benigni reveals _
young Roberto leaned toward becoming a priest. A chance job with a
circus, however, changed the course of his life. By the 1960s, he
was applying the Tuscan tradition of improvisation to Rome's
underground theater scene. From that grew a career as a comic
monologuist, with increasingly popular television and film projects
building from there.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, influences from Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen to
the legendary Italian comic Toto found their way into Benigni's
generally broad, sometimes unexpectedly intelligent brand of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' is, at least to date, the ultimate
expression of that comic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cannes, during the press conference, one journalist was
against the movie in a very aggressive way,'' Benigni recalls.
``But I respected this opinion. A comedian making a movie about the
Holocaust, this can be an explosion, and I respect the sensitivity
of somebody who is telling that only silence can explain why.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes, I must say, there is a sort of prejudice about
comedy. Comedy is considered, like, low level, no? I think the
contrary. I think sometimes only clowns can reach certain heights.
Tragedy can sometimes be embarrassing, schmaltzy. I know we can't
laugh about everything, but the challenge is to make something
beautiful, poetical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clowns, sometimes, can do that with levity.''

GOVERNMENT LAYS OUT ITS CASE AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of noisy prelude, the antitrust trial
against the Microsoft Corp. opened in federal court Monday morning
with a pointed personal attack on Bill Gates, the company's
chairman, who testified in a taped deposition that he knew little
if anything about the key charges leveled against his company by
the Justice Department and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only knowledge is the Wall Street Journal article; it
surprised me'' Gates said of reports of a meeting in which his
company had offered its chief competitor in Internet software a
chance to divide the market. Gazing directly at his questioner,
brow furrowed, head tilted slightly to the left, he added, ``I was
not involved'' in discussions of the key meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Justice Department proceeded with its opening
argument over the next two hours, its lead lawyer in the case,
David Boies, presented more than a dozen memos and e-mail messages
written by Gates over the last three years, showing clearly that he
and other senior Microsoft executives not only knew about the
matters in question but had forcefully directed them.
</P>
<P>
   Using memos and documents, the government portrayed a company
obsessed with crushing its competitor, the Netscape Communications
Corp., and willing to use every tool at its disposal, including
threats and financial inducements, to force or persuade other
companies to drop any planned or existing alliances with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Gates told his questioner at another point in the deposition
that he had not even read the government's antitrust suit. As to
its central charge, illegal collusion to divide software markets,
Gates said only: ``I think somebody said that was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also said that in 1995, ``somebody came to me to ask if it
made sense investing in Netscape.'' Shaking his head dismissively,
Gates recalled, ``I said it didn't make any sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Boies displayed on a 10-foot video screen and
enlargement of a memo in which Gates wrote to Paul Meritz, a senior
Microsoft executive, that over time Microsoft might have to compete
with Netscape. ``But in the meantime we can help them,'' Gates
wrote. ``We can pay them some money.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this competition _ and central to the case _ are
browsing programs used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
Netscape got an early lead in the market with its Navigator
browser. What frightened Microsoft was that Navigator could also be
used as a ``platform,'' a layer of software on which other programs
can run. This is the main function of an operating system, a market
in which Microsoft has a monopoly with its Windows family of
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the federal courthouse Monday afternoon, William H.
Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president of law and government
affairs, said that the government's opening presentation was
``based entirely on loose and unreliable rhetoric and snippets that
were not in any reliable context.'' Microsoft will offer its own
opening remarks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same tired old allegations,'' Neukomb said.
``None of these snippets, none of this rhetoric even approaches
proof of anti-competitive conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, however, Boies had told the judge, ``It's competition
on the merits that the antitrust laws foster. But this is not a
situation of competition on the merits. This is a situation, I
respectfully submit, your honor, of clear restraint of trade.''
</P>
<P>
   In one 1995 e-mail message relating to Microsoft's effort to
push Netscape out of the market for browsers that run on Windows
computers, Gates wrote other Microsoft executives: ``I think there
is a very powerful deal we can make with Netscape. I would really
like to see something like this happen!!'' Other memos showed that
Gates was continually and personally involved.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to demonstrate a pattern of anticompetitive
behavior, Boies led Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court through a chronology of memos and messages that seemed to
show Microsoft threatening and cajoling other companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a meeting with Gates in 1996, an executive with America
Online, the nation's largest on-line service, wrote to other
executives in his company: ``Gates delivered a characteristically
blunt query: `How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?
This is your lucky day.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, one memo showed, Gates wrote to Andrew
Grove, chairman of the Intel Corp., and bluntly asked why the
company was doing software research that might conflict with
Micrsoft's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why Intel funds a program that is against
Windows,'' the message said. An Intel note a few weeks later said,
``Gates made vague threats about supporting'' Intel's competitors,
unless Intel agreed to shut down its software research.
</P>
<P>
   Intel eventually relented, but while this standoff was underway,
a Microsoft memo said, the nation's computer-manufacturing industry
was paralyzed while awaiting word on whether Microsoft deemed it
acceptable to use certain features of a new computer chip Intel was
selling. Gates wrote: ``This is good news. It means they are
listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the memos indicated that Microsoft threatened
to stop selling the Apple Computer Co. a version of Microsoft's
Office software suite, which holds more than 90 percent of that
market _ unless Apple stopped supporting Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   A central argument in the government's suit is that Microsoft
has bundled its Web browser with Windows as a tactic in its war
with Netscape. For the last year, at least, Microsoft has argued
that the browser was added to Windows only for the benefit of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, however, the Justice Department displayed
numerous internal memos indicating that the bundling was indeed a
tactical decision. The memos showed that Microsoft's leaders first
wanted to sell Interent Explorer and expected to earn $120 million
a year from the sales. Then, when the plan to push Netscape out of
competition with Microsoft failed, the company's leaders decided to
bundle the browser with Windows instead as a means of helping it
gain a majority share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In one memo, written in December 1995 _ in the thick of
Microsoft's effort to push Netscape out of the market _ Gates wrote
a memo to others in the company acknowledging that Netscape was
designing browser software ``far better than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a few months later, displayed in court Monday,
Gates said: ``Our business model works even if the Internet
Explorer software is free. We are still selling operating systems.
What's Netscape's business model look like in that case? Not very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also proffered several memos from computer
manufacturers complaining bitterly about Microsoft's licensing
restriction that prohibited them from offering Netscape if they
wanted to offer Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Hewlett Packard wrote to Microsoft
last year. ``This will cause significant, costly problems. From a
consumer perspective, it is hurting our industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had another choice of another supplier, based on your
actions here, we would take it.''

GERMANY PREPARES TO ADDRESS SLAVE LABOR ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a sign that Germany's new government may
be willing to set up a fund to compensate people forced into slave
labor under Hitler, Gerhard Schroeder, the chancellor-elect, plans
to meet with top industrial executives to discuss options for
resolving the growing number of lawsuits over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several German companies said Monday that they had received
invitations for a meeting on the issue with Schroeder in the next
several days. The companies are believed to range from automakers
like Daimler-Benz and BMW to chemical companies like Hoechst and
BASF and the giant electronics company Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes at a time when German industrial companies are
increasingly worried about a spate of new class-action suits
brought by American lawyers on behalf of former factory workers
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   German companies increasingly fear that the lawsuits could cost
them billions of dollars and would expose them to torrents of
horrifying publicity. Some companies are also worried about
boycotts of their products, particularly in the United States, if
the disputes fester.
</P>
<P>
   Many industrial companies named in the lawsuits admit they used
forced laborers, but insisted the Nazis forced them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including Daimler-Benz and BMW, have argued
for some time that the German government needed to take the lead in
creating a fund to compensate former workers and have volunteered
to contribute toward it. Volkswagen, which is also being sued,
recently announced plans to set up its own $20-million fund to
compensate claims by former slave workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was defeated for re-election
last month and hands power over to Schroeder on Oct. 27, adamantly
rejected proposals for a government fund. Kohl said the German
government had already paid out tens of billions of dollars in
various forms of compensation for the Holocaust, and did not want
to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure has been building to work out some kind of
agreement. ``The government needs to seriously recognize the
pressure on German companies, which could find themselves abandoned
in the USA as a result of the class-action suits,'' said Manfred
Gentz, Daimler-Benz's chief financial officer, in a recent
interview with the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Switzerland's biggest banks agreed to pay
$1.25 billion to settle a class-action suit over unreturned money
and property that belonged to Holocaust victims. That suit was
brought by the same lawyers, led by Edward Fagan in New York City,
who are now suing the industrial companies over compensation for
slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   John Gilardi, a spokesman for the chemical company BASF A.G.,
said it had received an invitation to the meeting with Schroeder.
BASF, one of three companies spun off from the old I.G. Farben
chemical conglomerate, contended that its portion of the old
company never used slave labor but was willing to take part in the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has not yet defined his position on the issue.
Executives familiar with his invitation say the meeting is intended
only to be a chance to exchange ideas.

PAKISTANI PREMIER WON IN CLASH WITH ARMY CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ In the welter of events unfolding here,
one remarkable episode stands out: After the chief of the powerful
Pakistani army got in hot water for publicly criticizing the prime
minister and proposing a stronger military role in making policy,
it was the general who lost his job, not the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   There was no coup, although generals have ruled Pakistan for
almost half of its 51-year history. And prime ministers have been
dismissed in earlier clashes with the army.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gen. Jehangir Karamat quietly resigned on Oct. 7, and
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif immediately replaced him with another
army commander, Pervez Musharraf. Last week, in a smooth
transition, the new chief of the army staff installed his own team
of top officers.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the opposition parties bemoan the loss of Karamat, a
popular figure who was widely regarded as a thoughtful, cautious
democrat, and accuse the prime minister of being a power-hungry
politician eager to dominate yet another arm of the government.
</P>
<P>
   But personalities aside, the elected government was able to
exercise its authority over the military with no dire consequences
_ at least not yet. And that is a marker of sorts in a country
whose modern history has been dominated by the struggle between
military and civilian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a democratic society, would an army chief talk about the
government like that?'' said Mushahid Hussain, a Cabinet member in
charge of Pakistan's Ministry of Information. ``What happened to
General MacArthur? Truman did not waste much time. Pakistan is
finally becoming a normal democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussain probably overstates the case for normalcy here. After
all, Pakistan is still a country where less than 1 percent of the
population bothers to pay taxes, where corruption is endemic and
sectarian violence rages. On Saturday, hit squads gunned down a
former governor of Sindh province in Karachi and a Muslim leader in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pakistan's political structure has changed profoundly in
the year and a half since Sharif was elected by a landslide _
changed in ways that have clearly strengthened the prime minister,
even as they weakened the army.
</P>
<P>
   Under constitutional amendments passed by a consensus vote of
all parties after his election, the prime minister can dismiss any
legislator in his party who votes against him, and he selects the
army's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two amendments ended a crucial vestige of military
rule that had allowed an appointed president to choose the army
chief and to dismiss the elected prime minister, a power that was
used three times in the last decade to oust Sharif and his
archrival, Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
   The world's newest nuclear power, the host to archrival India
for talks here over the last week, seems to be turning into a more
stable democracy, Western diplomats say. But paradoxically,
although Sharif has acted decisively to consolidate his political
power, he has been reluctant to use it to tackle the country's
deep-seated problems, many political experts here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very powerful prime minister with no power at all,''
said Samina Ahmed, a political scientist and consultant to private
foundations. ``Power is tangible when you can exercise it. In
Pakistan today, the government doesn't seem capable of exercising
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His action on utility rates is a case in point. Last year, the
two biggest electrical utilities _ which members of his own
government describe as bloated, corrupt and inefficient _ lost $1.6
billion. But instead of reining in the bureaucracy and raising
rates as international lenders requested, he announced last week
that he was cutting electricity rates 30 percent, a move sure to
spill more red ink.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is desperately trying to persuade the International
Monetary Fund to give it a financial bailout to forestall
defaulting on $30 billion in foreign debt _ a financial crisis
badly worsened by sanctions imposed after Pakistan conducted the
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharif missed no opportunity last week to express defiance
to reporters following him, saying he would not bow to the fiscal
conditions the IMF was setting, like higher electricity rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot make anti-people decisions that might burden the
lives of common people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Sharif moved to collect taxes from the feudal landlords
who have never paid anything to the cash-poor government, which has
such limited resources for education that most of its people cannot
read and write. And when the prime minister, himself a millionaire
industrialist who pays very little personal income tax, sought to
impose a sales tax and shopkeepers responded with a general strike,
Sharif quickly backed off.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has proposed another constitutional amendment that is
widely seen as an attempt to increase his power as well as to steal
the thunder of militant Islamic groups, which have little influence
at the polls but can turn out angry crowds in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would give the federal government the duty to
enforce an Islamic legal system based on the Koran. As originally
written, the bill said its provisions would apply ``notwithstanding
anything contained in the Constitution, any law or judgment of any
court.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly passed a diluted version of the bill, but
officials in the Sharif administration concede that they do not
have the votes to get the measure through the Senate, where his
party does not have the requisite two-thirds majority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult to measure Sharif's popularity with the
overwhelming majority of Pakistanis, who are rural people unable to
read or write, he is clearly a disappointment to many of the
educated elite who are often quoted in the feisty, no-holds-barred
press.
</P>
<P>
   And the discontent with Sharif's leadership clearly extends to
the military. Scholars who have studied Pakistan's army, generally
considered the country's most professional and competent
institution, say Karamat would never have publicly assailed the
prime minister's government for its political failings unless his
views were widely shared by the top command.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal for a national security council that would involve
the army and technocrats in making policy was seen by some as a
benign attempt to improve the quality of government.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the idea had a history that gives it more
sinister overtones. When the military dictator Mohammad Zia ul-Haq
floated the idea of such a council in the 1970s and 1980s, he
intended it to be an institutional means for the military to veto
national policies it disliked.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Karamat's proposal would have ended the unfettered
civilian authority that Nawaz Sharif has tried to exercise,'' said
Selig Harrison, an expert on South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts say they believe that the army may yet step
in if conditions in Pakistan worsen seriously, most seem to agree
that a military takeover is far less appetizing to the generals
themselves than in the past. The economy here is in such a mess
that military men with no particular expertise in managing the
country's finances are unlikely to leap at the chance to run the
show.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the appointed president's power to dismiss the
prime minister, the army would have little option but a naked coup
without the facade of constitutionality that the presidential
system allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the generals are keenly aware that a military coup would
further isolate Pakistan internationally at a time when it needs
help from abroad. Gone are the Cold War days when the United States
supported a Pakistani dictator as part of a proxy war to parry the
Soviet Union's influence in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who know Pakistan's modern history do not rule out
a reassertion of the army's power. What if the IMF does not give
Pakistan a bailout package? What if the economy crumbles and social
order disintegrates?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one elected government has managed to complete its full
term of office in Pakistan, ever,'' said Ms. Ahmed, the political
scientist. ``So there you are. These are still early days.''

magic that vigilante groups are forming daily to seize, torture and
execute anyone suspected of being a sorcerer. The victims have

into their communities. At least 150 people, and perhaps many more,

almost completely in some areas. The convulsions have disrupted

   WASH-AFFIRM (Seattle) _ Two years after California voters

Houston's residents chose to retain them, voters here in Washington
are facing the only ballot initiative in the country this year
dealing with the issue. The one big thing that both camps agree on
is that the outcome is hugely important to their cause. With their
only electoral victory so far in California, proponents of
eliminating most affirmative action programs hope to carry momentum
from a victory here to other states. But opponents say that if they
can stop the measure in a state like Washington, where affirmative
action is not in general a hugely divisive issue, in large part
because the minority population is relatively small, their victory
may further dampen efforts in other states to bring the matter
before voters. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

<P>
   Brain implants are making it possible for severely disabled
people to use the power of thought to communicate through a
computer. The researchers responsible hope that the technology will
eventually allow people who are totally paralyzed to operate
artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two incapacitated people have received the implants.
This gave them the power to control a cursor on a computer screen
by thinking about moving parts of their body. By pointing the
cursor at different icons, the patients could make the computer
voice phrases such as ``I'm thirsty'' or ``Please turn off the
light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world,'' says
Roy Bakay of Emory University in Atlanta, whose team developed the
implants.
</P>
<P>
   The implants consist of two hollow glass cones, no bigger than
the tip of a ball-point pen, placed into the brain's motor cortex,
which controls body movements. The glass cones are laced with
neurotrophic chemicals extracted from the patients' own knees.
These chemicals encourage nerve growth so, over several months,
neurons in the cortex grow pathways into the cones and attach
themselves to tiny electrodes mounted inside.
</P>
<P>
   To decide where to place the implants, Bakay and his colleagues
used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to reveal the most active
regions of each patient's motor cortex. Once nerves had grown into
the cones, the patients were asked to think about moving various
parts of their body. The responses of the electrodes in the cones
were monitored and translated into commands for the computer
cursor. At the moment, these commands are quite simple: up and down
for one cone, and left and right for the other. But this is just
the start, Bakay says.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on exactly which nerves grow into the cones, each
patient may have to think about moving a different part of his or
her body to achieve the desired cursor movement. They are trained
to use the device by listening to a buzzer which becomes faster and
louder when they are thinking along the right lines. Controlling
the cursor soon becomes second nature, Bakay says.
</P>
<P>
   The implants are powered by a coil worn outside the skull in a
cap. This induces a small current in a transmitter-receiver placed
just inside the skull. It transmits to an amplifier in the cap,
which boosts the signal and sends it to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken the researchers eight years to come this far. After
extensive research on monkeys they were given permission by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to try the procedure on up to
three human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The first volunteer was a woman with Lou Gehrig's disease, or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurodegenerative condition which
gradually robs its victims of their ability to move. She received
the implants 18 months ago and has since died of her disease. Six
months ago a 57-year-old man, almost totally paralyzed by a stroke,
became the second to receive the implants, Bakay told the Congress
of Neurological Surgeons in Seattle last week.
</P>
<P>
   The team has now been given funding by the National Institutes
of Health to continue the research with a further three patients.
``If these implants can be developed then they could do an enormous
amount to alleviate many illnesses,'' says John Cavanagh of the
International Spinal Research Trust in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire,
England. Bakay is confident of making progress but warns that it
may be several years before the implants can be used to give more
complex commands. &QL;

   By slightly altering the AIDS drug AZT, researchers have created
a compound that disables both HIV and sperm. Used in contraceptive
gels, it could offer protection against AIDS and unwanted
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In test-tube experiments, the compound was nearly 14 times as
potent against sperm and 439 times as potent against HIV as the
popular spermicide nonoxynol-9. This is a detergentlike chemical
that destroys HIV in the test tube, but a study in Cameroon found
that condoms coated with nonoxynol-9 offered women no better
protection from the virus than untreated condoms. Animal studies
also suggest that nonoxynol-9 damages delicate tissues in the
vagina and rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Osmond D'Cruz of the Wayne Hughes Institute in St. Paul, Minn.,
has been working to find a better alternative. His team found that
adding phosphate groups to AZT made it better able to attack
HIV-infected cells in semen. They also made other subtle changes
that improved the drug's ability to enter infected cells.
Encouragingly, the compound seemed to be effective against four
strains of HIV that are resistant to AZT itself.
</P>
<P>
   The compound appears to be a promising contraceptive. When
applied to the vaginas of mice prior to artificial insemination, it
reduced the number of pregnancies by 81 percent. ``It can be useful
in any form, as a vaginal or rectal gel or even as a mouthwash,''
claims D'Cruz, who expects clinical trials to start within a year. &QL;

   Some men have low fertility because of microorganisms lurking in
their semen, say researchers in Hungary. They have shown that
bacteria can prevent sperm from swimming well enough to reach an
egg.
</P>
<P>
   The reproductive systems of up to two-thirds of men are infected
with anaerobic bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Bacteroides fragilis. These infections usually go unnoticed unless
extremely large numbers of the bacteria are present, when they can
cause pain and discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Bela Molnar of Albert Szent-Gyrgyi Medical University in Szeged
wondered if these bacteria could be one factor in some men's
fertility problems. So his team isolated F. nucleatum and B.
fragilis from 43 infected men and incubated sperm of normal
motility with various concentrations of the bacteria. These ranged
from concentrations comparable to a mild case without symptoms to a
dose equivalent to a raging infection.
</P>
<P>
   Sperm will swim in a culture medium for a day or more. But even
in the samples with low concentrations of bacteria, only 1 percent
of the sperm were still moving after 18 hours. At the highest dose,
they all stopped moving after three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar says that the bacteria may inhibit sperm motility in
several ways: by competing for fructose, a sugar that sperm need
for energy; by producing products that are toxic to sperm; or by
physically interfering with the lashing of sperm tails.
</P>
<P>
   If infertile men have asymptomatic infections, Molnar thinks
they should be given broad-spectrum antibiotics for three months to
eliminate the bacteria, before beginning IVF. ``We should first
treat them and let them try to conceive the normal way,'' he says. &QL;

   A sweetener commonly used in bubble gum, chewing gum and some
foods can help prevent ear infections in children, a new study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The plant sugar xylitol is known to inhibit the growth of
bacteria. So Matti Uhari and his colleagues at the University of
Oulu in Finland recruited 857 healthy children and gave half of
them daily 10-gram doses of xylitol in a sweet syrup, chewing gum
or hard sweets. The other half were given xylitol-free sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, 29 percent of the children who ate xylitol
had experienced an ear infection, compared with 41 per cent in the
other group. Peter Wright of the Vanderbilt Medical Center in
Nashville, Tenn., cautions that the children had to chew five
pieces of gum a day, and some developed stomach aches and diarrhea.
He suggests more studies should be done to see if lower doses of
xylitol have a similar antibiotic effect. &QL;

   Brain implants are making it possible for severely disabled
people to use the power of thought to communicate through a
computer. The researchers responsible hope that the technology will
eventually allow people who are totally paralyzed to operate
artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two incapacitated people have received the implants.
This gave them the power to control a cursor on a computer screen
by thinking about moving parts of their body. By pointing the
cursor at different icons, the patients could make the computer
voice phrases such as ``I'm thirsty'' or ``Please turn off the
light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world,'' says
Roy Bakay of Emory University in Atlanta, whose team developed the
implants.
</P>
<P>
   The implants consist of two hollow glass cones, no bigger than
the tip of a ball-point pen, placed into the brain's motor cortex,
which controls body movements. The glass cones are laced with
neurotrophic chemicals extracted from the patients' own knees.
These chemicals encourage nerve growth so, over several months,
neurons in the cortex grow pathways into the cones and attach
themselves to tiny electrodes mounted inside.
</P>
<P>
   To decide where to place the implants, Bakay and his colleagues
used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to reveal the most active
regions of each patient's motor cortex. Once nerves had grown into
the cones, the patients were asked to think about moving various
parts of their body. The responses of the electrodes in the cones
were monitored and translated into commands for the computer
cursor. At the moment, these commands are quite simple: up and down
for one cone, and left and right for the other. But this is just
the start, Bakay says.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on exactly which nerves grow into the cones, each
patient may have to think about moving a different part of his or
her body to achieve the desired cursor movement. They are trained
to use the device by listening to a buzzer which becomes faster and
louder when they are thinking along the right lines. Controlling
the cursor soon becomes second nature, Bakay says.
</P>
<P>
   The implants are powered by a coil worn outside the skull in a
cap. This induces a small current in a transmitter-receiver placed
just inside the skull. It transmits to an amplifier in the cap,
which boosts the signal and sends it to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken the researchers eight years to come this far. After
extensive research on monkeys they were given permission by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to try the procedure on up to
three human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The first volunteer was a woman with Lou Gehrig's disease, or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurodegenerative condition which
gradually robs its victims of their ability to move. She received
the implants 18 months ago and has since died of her disease. Six
months ago a 57-year-old man, almost totally paralyzed by a stroke,
became the second to receive the implants, Bakay told the Congress
of Neurological Surgeons in Seattle last week.
</P>
<P>
   The team has now been given funding by the National Institutes
of Health to continue the research with a further three patients.
``If these implants can be developed then they could do an enormous
amount to alleviate many illnesses,'' says John Cavanagh of the
International Spinal Research Trust in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire,
England. Bakay is confident of making progress but warns that it
may be several years before the implants can be used to give more
complex commands. &QL;

   Brain implants are making it possible for severely disabled
people to use the power of thought to communicate through a
computer. The researchers responsible hope that the technology will
eventually allow people who are totally paralyzed to operate
artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two incapacitated people have received the implants.
This gave them the power to control a cursor on a computer screen
by thinking about moving parts of their body. By pointing the
cursor at different icons, the patients could make the computer
voice phrases such as ``I'm thirsty'' or ``Please turn off the
light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world,'' says
Roy Bakay of Emory University in Atlanta, whose team developed the
implants.
</P>
<P>
   The implants consist of two hollow glass cones, no bigger than
the tip of a ball-point pen, placed into the brain's motor cortex,
which controls body movements. The glass cones are laced with
neurotrophic chemicals extracted from the patients' own knees.
These chemicals encourage nerve growth so, over several months,
neurons in the cortex grow pathways into the cones and attach
themselves to tiny electrodes mounted inside.
</P>
<P>
   To decide where to place the implants, Bakay and his colleagues
used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to reveal the most active
regions of each patient's motor cortex. Once nerves had grown into
the cones, the patients were asked to think about moving various
parts of their body. The responses of the electrodes in the cones
were monitored and translated into commands for the computer
cursor. At the moment, these commands are quite simple: up and down
for one cone, and left and right for the other. But this is just
the start, Bakay says.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on exactly which nerves grow into the cones, each
patient may have to think about moving a different part of his or
her body to achieve the desired cursor movement. They are trained
to use the device by listening to a buzzer which becomes faster and

   By slightly altering the AIDS drug AZT, researchers have created
a compound that disables both HIV and sperm. Used in contraceptive
gels, it could offer protection against AIDS and unwanted
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In test-tube experiments, the compound was nearly 14 times as
potent against sperm and 439 times as potent against HIV as the
popular spermicide nonoxynol-9. This is a detergentlike chemical
that destroys HIV in the test tube, but a study in Cameroon found
that condoms coated with nonoxynol-9 offered women no better
protection from the virus than untreated condoms. Animal studies
also suggest that nonoxynol-9 damages delicate tissues in the
vagina and rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Osmond D'Cruz of the Wayne Hughes Institute in St. Paul, Minn.,
has been working to find a better alternative. His team found that
adding phosphate groups to AZT made it better able to attack
HIV-infected cells in semen. They also made other subtle changes
that improved the drug's ability to enter infected cells.
Encouragingly, the compound seemed to be effective against four
strains of HIV that are resistant to AZT itself.
</P>
<P>
   The compound appears to be a promising contraceptive. When
applied to the vaginas of mice prior to artificial insemination, it
reduced the number of pregnancies by 81 percent. ``It can be useful
in any form, as a vaginal or rectal gel or even as a mouthwash,''
claims D'Cruz, who expects clinical trials to start within a year. &QL;

   Some men have low fertility because of microorganisms lurking in
their semen, say researchers in Hungary. They have shown that
bacteria can prevent sperm from swimming well enough to reach an
egg.
</P>
<P>
   The reproductive systems of up to two-thirds of men are infected
with anaerobic bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Bacteroides fragilis. These infections usually go unnoticed unless
extremely large numbers of the bacteria are present, when they can
cause pain and discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Bela Molnar of Albert Szent-Gyrgyi Medical University in Szeged
wondered if these bacteria could be one factor in some men's
fertility problems. So his team isolated F. nucleatum and B.
fragilis from 43 infected men and incubated sperm of normal
motility with various concentrations of the bacteria. These ranged
from concentrations comparable to a mild case without symptoms to a
dose equivalent to a raging infection.
</P>
<P>
   Sperm will swim in a culture medium for a day or more. But even
in the samples with low concentrations of bacteria, only 1 percent
of the sperm were still moving after 18 hours. At the highest dose,
they all stopped moving after three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar says that the bacteria may inhibit sperm motility in
several ways: by competing for fructose, a sugar that sperm need
for energy; by producing products that are toxic to sperm; or by
physically interfering with the lashing of sperm tails.
</P>
<P>
   If infertile men have asymptomatic infections, Molnar thinks
they should be given broad-spectrum antibiotics for three months to
eliminate the bacteria, before beginning IVF. ``We should first
treat them and let them try to conceive the normal way,'' he says. &QL;

   A sweetener commonly used in bubble gum, chewing gum and some
foods can help prevent ear infections in children, a new study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The plant sugar xylitol is known to inhibit the growth of
bacteria. So Matti Uhari and his colleagues at the University of
Oulu in Finland recruited 857 healthy children and gave half of
them daily 10-gram doses of xylitol in a sweet syrup, chewing gum
or hard sweets. The other half were given xylitol-free sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, 29 percent of the children who ate xylitol
had experienced an ear infection, compared with 41 per cent in the
other group. Peter Wright of the Vanderbilt Medical Center in
Nashville, Tenn., cautions that the children had to chew five
pieces of gum a day, and some developed stomach aches and diarrhea.
He suggests more studies should be done to see if lower doses of
xylitol have a similar antibiotic effect. &QL;

   Some men have low fertility because of microorganisms lurking in
their semen, say researchers in Hungary. They have shown that
bacteria can prevent sperm from swimming well enough to reach an
egg.
</P>
<P>
   The reproductive systems of up to two-thirds of men are infected
with anaerobic bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Bacteroides fragilis. These infections usually go unnoticed unless
extremely large numbers of the bacteria are present, when they can
cause pain and discharge.

   A sweetener commonly used in bubble gum, chewing gum and some
foods can help prevent ear infections in children, a new study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The plant sugar xylitol is known to inhibit the growth of
bacteria. So Matti Uhari and his colleagues at the University of
Oulu in Finland recruited 857 healthy children and gave half of
them daily 10-gram doses of xylitol in a sweet syrup, chewing gum
or hard sweets. The other half were given xylitol-free sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, 29 percent of the children who ate xylitol
had experienced an ear infection, compared with 41 per cent in the
other group. Peter Wright of the Vanderbilt Medical Center in
Nashville, Tenn., cautions that the children had to chew five
pieces of gum a day, and some developed stomach aches and diarrhea.
He suggests more studies should be done to see if lower doses of
xylitol have a similar antibiotic effect. &QL;

   By slightly altering the AIDS drug AZT, researchers have created
a compound that disables both HIV and sperm. Used in contraceptive
gels, it could offer protection against AIDS and unwanted
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In test-tube experiments, the compound was nearly 14 times as
potent against sperm and 439 times as potent against HIV as the
popular spermicide nonoxynol-9. This is a detergentlike chemical
that destroys HIV in the test tube, but a study in Cameroon found
that condoms coated with nonoxynol-9 offered women no better
protection from the virus than untreated condoms. Animal studies
also suggest that nonoxynol-9 damages delicate tissues in the
vagina and rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Osmond D'Cruz of the Wayne Hughes Institute in St. Paul, Minn.,
has been working to find a better alternative. His team found that
adding phosphate groups to AZT made it better able to attack
HIV-infected cells in semen. They also made other subtle changes
that improved the drug's ability to enter infected cells.
Encouragingly, the compound seemed to be effective against four
strains of HIV that are resistant to AZT itself.
</P>
<P>
   The compound appears to be a promising contraceptive. When
applied to the vaginas of mice prior to artificial insemination, it
reduced the number of pregnancies by 81 percent. ``It can be useful
in any form, as a vaginal or rectal gel or even as a mouthwash,''
claims D'Cruz, who expects clinical trials to start within a year. &QL;

KIA MOTORS' SUITOR MUST NOW FACE RELUCTANT BANKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Now that Hyundai Motor Co. has won the auction to take a
controlling stake in bankrupt Kia Motors Corp. and its Asia Motors
subsidiary, it remains to be seen whether Kia's creditors will
agree to the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous auctions failed after the creditors, mainly large
banks, rejected the demands of the bidders to write off large
chunks of the two manufacturers' combined 16 trillion won, or $12.1
billion, of debt.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Korea Development Bank, Kia's largest
creditor, said creditors would meet as soon as possible to discuss
the results of the latest auction, which were announced Monday
morning. In addition, Hyundai Motor's final plan for taking control
of Kia and Asia Motors, its commercial vehicles unit, will depend
on what it finds out during an audit of the two companies over the
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see the outcome change,'' said
Jeffrey D. Jones, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Korea. ``Hyundai has to come up with terms and conditions that are
supported by the government, by the creditors, by parts suppliers
and by the unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shin, a spokesman for Hyundai, South Korea's largest car
manufacturer and the crown jewel of the Hyundai Group, said the car
company was confident it could satisfy all those constituents with
its bid, which includes writing off 7.3 trillion won, or $5.5
billion, of debt owed by Kia and Asia Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the winner,'' Shin said. ``I think there is no doubt
that our terms and conditions are the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to assuming 9 trillion won of debt, or $6.8 billion,
that would be left if the creditor banks agree to Hyundai Motor's
proposed write-offs, Hyundai will put up at least 1.07 trillion
won, or $808 million, to buy 51 percent of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Kia has become a litmus test of the South Korean
government's ability to push the recalcitrant corporate sector to
change and to lure foreign investment, which is considered crucial
to the recovery of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, though, the banks that are Kia's creditors have
successfully thwarted the government, setting a minimum level of
debt forgiveness as the most important factor in deciding the
winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government has lost some credibility in this whole
thing,'' said Richard Samuelson, executive director of SBC Warburg
Dillon Read in Seoul. ``What hasn't arisen from this is a minimum
set of terms and conditions that were set from the start and led to
a reasonably rapid conclusion. Instead, certainly from a foreign
investor's perspective, it must appear to be something of a
circus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, who represented Ford Motor Co. in the auction, said
foreign investors should be encouraged by the fairness of the
process. ``Clearly, there was no prejudice against foreign
participants,'' he said. ``In fact, they were encouraged to join
the process and noisily encouraged.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government had clearly expressed its preference that Ford
win the auction, which would further its aims of consolidating the
domestic auto manufacturing business and be a potent symbol of
foreign confidence in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Kia said Ford, which together with its Mazda Motors Corp.
affiliate holds 17 percent of Kia's stock, refused to bid even the
minimum price set for shares of Asia Motors and was thus
disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts have questioned the wisdom of packaging Kia and
Asia Motors in a single sale because they appeal to different types
of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor Co., South Korea's second-largest car manufacturer,
was the runner-up, followed by Samsung Motors Co.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Motors' loss is likely to increase speculation that the
fledgling car maker will have to shut its doors. Samsung Motors
rolled out its first car at the height of the Korean economic
crisis last February, and although it has a backlog of orders
through this December, the company does not plan to sell more than
80,000 cars in its first year of operation. It must produce and
sell 300,000 cars to break even, and South Korea's domestic car
market has shrunk to less than 50 percent of its size in the year
before the economic crisis hit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Samsung Motors said it had no plans to stop
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For Hyundai Motor, an acquisition of Kia represents a chance to
step into the automotive big leagues, and it boasted Monday that
such a deal would make it one of the world's 10 largest car
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The company will spend the next month doing an audit of Kia and
Asia Motors, after which it will come up with a plan for
reorganizing the companies to present to creditors, giving the
banks another opportunity to scuttle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Seoul Monday, Chung Mong Kyu, chairman
of Hyundai Motor, said his company would seek foreign capital for
its acquisition if needed and even mentioned Ford as a possible
co-investor. He said other Hyundai Group companies might also take
part in the acquisition financing in exchange for a stake in Kia.
</P>
<P>
   Shin said it was possible but unlikely that Hyundai Motor's
plans to overhaul Kia would include layoffs. Kia employs about
18,000 workers. ``Basically, Kia and Hyundai have been
restructuring already for a long time, so we don't see so many
redundancies,'' he said.

   &UR; GREEN TEA WITHOUT THE TASTE OF OLD SOCKS &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several studies have pointed to the health
benefits of green tea. Regular drinkers have less lung, stomach and
esophageal cancer as well as lower rates of cardiovascular disease
and fewer strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, the pungent drink is, at best, an acquired taste,
the cod liver oil of the '90s. So green tea pills have begun to
appear on the market, promising all the benefits of the drink
without the bouquet of old gym socks.
</P>
<P>
   A pill or capsule that contains the essential chemicals found in
the liquid form of green tea should provide the same benefits. The
key ingredients seem to be an assortment of polyphenols, a broad
class of antioxidants found in plants. Antioxidants prevent or
delay cell damage that may cause cancer, heart disease and other
ailments. A cup of green tea contains about 60 milligrams of
polyphenols. One commonly sold capsule contains 242 milligrams, but
the amounts vary by manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   With little clinical research to guide them, experts caution
that something essential may be lost in the process of extracting
chemicals from tea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the leap from liquid tea to its essential elements is
logical, so studies are under way.
</P>
<P>
   At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, researchers have
just completed the first phase of a study of green tea extracts.
The most important finding is that the human limit for green tea
seems to be about 40 cups per day, said Dr. Waun Ki Hong, the
chairman of the Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Oncology at
M.D. Anderson. Higher doses caused tremors, nervousness, nausea and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Having established the maximum tolerable dose, the researchers
will try to determine whether the extract has any effect on the
cancers. The subjects are mostly lung cancer patients whose tumors
have recurred, Hong said. Others have recurring head, neck, ovarian
or colon cancer, or lymphoma. All are undergoing conventional
treatments while they participate in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Another study is just getting under way at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Researchers there are
also trying to establish a tolerance level and may eventually focus
on establishing optimum levels of green tea for regular use as a
dietary supplement, said Dr. Vincent Miller, the principal
investigator. Miller said he and his team hope to look at whether
green tea supplements prevent cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known, Miller said, whether extracts will prove as
effective as liquid tea seems to be. His patients are up to the
equivalent of 20 to 30 cups of tea a day, he said, and are
beginning to complain of nausea and shaking. But at least, Miller
added, no one has complained about the taste.
</P>

<P>
   &UR; THE MYSTERY OF CRANBERRY JUICE UNFOLDS &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of the medicinal power of cranberry juice may have
been solved.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 study confirmed what many had long suspected _ that
regular consumption of cranberry juice significantly reduced the
presence in the urinary tract of the bacteria that cause painful
infections in both men and women and account for some 7 million
doctor visits annually.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, by Amy Howell and a team at Rutgers University,
found that cranberries contained a type of condensed tannin, a
chemical compound called proanthocyanidins, that seemed to stunt
the growth of the culprit bacteria, E. coli, preventing it from
adhering to the walls of the bladder and kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   (Blueberries also contain this type of tannin. But, alas, the
type of tannin common to grapes _ ergo wine _ as well as lemons,
oranges, apples, bananas, carrots and tea has no effect on the
bacteria.)
</P>
<P>
   The five-year project was financed by the New Jersey state
university system and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and was
published in the Oct. 8 New England Journal of Medicine.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEN BODY PIERCING CAUSES BODY RASH &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They arrive at Dr. David Cohen's office decked out in metal,
wearing rings and studs in their ears, eyebrows, noses, navels,
nipples and nether parts. Often, they arrive scratching.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a dermatologist at New York University, is an expert on
contact dermatitis, a condition that occurs when a substance a
person is allergic to rubs against the skin. The result is itching,
often with a rash that may swell and weep. The rash from poison ivy
is a type of contact dermatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has treated so many fans of body piercing lately that he
will lecture about them next week in New York at a meeting of the
American Academy of Dermatology, which has declared November
``National Healthy Skin Month.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Cohen's pierced patients are allergic to their jewelry,
specifically, to nickel, which is often used in inexpensive costume
jewelry. Nickel is the metal most likely to provoke allergic
reactions, followed by chrome, cobalt and palladium, which are also
found in costume jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, 10.5 percent of Americans were sensitive to
nickel, but now the figure is 14.3 percent, and doctors think the
increase may be linked to the piercing craze, as more and more
people expose more and more skin to cheap jewelry. Newly pierced
skin is the most likely to react to nickel, Cohen said, and the
best way to prevent the allergy is to wear pierced jewelry made
only of stainless steel or gold, especially while a freshly pierced
opening is healing.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem a matter of common sense just to remove the
jewelry if a rash develops, instead of going to the doctor. But the
connection is not always obvious, Cohen said. For one thing, there
is a time lag between wearing the jewelry and breaking out. ``You
might wear it on Friday night, and you start itching on Tuesday,''
he said. Then, the rash can persist for weeks, and it is easily
mistaken for an infection.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment consists of taking off the offending jewelry and
putting a cortisone cream on the rash, Cohen said. If the area is
very inflamed, no jewelry should be worn until the rash goes away,
even though leaving it off may cause the hole to close. But if the
allergic reaction is not severe, the jewelry can be replaced
immediately with a piece made of stainless steel or gold that is
14-karat or more. . Sterling silver is also safe for most people,
but, Cohen said, jewelry sold as silver often turns out to contain
nickel or chrome.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Cohen said, people with a nickel allergy cannot
resist wearing a favorite piece of jewelry for special occasions,
even if they are allergic to it. They can get away with it once in
a while, he said, by judiciously using cortisone cream. He does not
scold them. ``People are very proud of piercing,'' he said. ``I
think it's fine. It's their individual expression of themselves.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ OK, now we'll see the real Cowboys. The Troy
Aikman-quarterbacked Cowboys. No more Jason Garrett fumbles and
underthrows, no more eight-men-in-the-box waiting to pounce on
Emmitt Smith.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aikman, the Pro Bowl veteran, missed his fifth game of the
season Sunday, and the Cowboys missed him more than ever. They lost
13-12 to the mediocre Chicago Bears when Garrett failed to lift
them with his passing or his leadership. He was 14-of-26 for 136
yards and one touchdown, with one interception and two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone should have expected more from a $300,000 backup
who was once cut by the San Antonio Riders of the World League. All
the Cowboys wanted was to get by until bye week, and then they
would get Aikman back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're off until Nov. 2, and they have a perfect soft spot
for Aikman to reappear: Philadelphia, which is 1-6 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have gone 3-2 with Aikman nursing his broken
collarbone, and they're 4-3 overall. That's good enough for first
place in the NFC East, the weakest division of a weak conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason did a great job,'' Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin
said. ``Thank God for him. But now, we play with our quarterback,
and let's see where we go.''
</P>
<P>
   This midseason break gives the Cowboys time not only to tune up
Aikman but to work out their assorted glitches, and Sunday's
performance against the bedraggled Bears showed they have plenty to
work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Troy will make a big difference,'' center Clay Shiver
said, ``but the problem wasn't the quarterback. We had
across-the-board problems, communication breakdowns and lots of
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' coach, Dave Wannstedt, former Dallas defensive
coordinator, had thorough knowledge of Smith's running style, and
he devised a system of inside stunts to throw the Cowboys for
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played great defense the whole game,'' Smith said. ``They
stunted, and they filled the gaps. They took away a lot of the
cutback lanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Chicago defensive tackle Jim Flanigan: ``We saw on film
that Dallas was susceptible to penetration, so we knew if we got
off the ball and into the backfield that we'd cause a lot of
disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith had his moments _ 16 carries for 78 yards _ the
Bears undermined coach Chan Gailey's confidence in the running
game. So the Cowboys went to the air and too often came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's favorite pass is the 30-yard loft ball. But as Gailey
observed, ``They played their corners very deep. They forced us to
go underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   With neither Garrett nor Irvin having one of his better days,
the Cowboys could not conduct a consistent short-pass attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dallas defense continued to show flaws that
aren't going to vanish when Aikman returns.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's game, the Cowboys had allowed 13 pass plays of
more than 25 yards. Cornerback Kevin Smith has been turned around
more than a tilt-a-whirl, and to help him on the deep routes,
defensive coordinator Dave Campo ordered zone coverage at Soldier
Field.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Bears exploited that scheme by targeting their
talented rookie tight end, Alonzo Mayes, who caught two passes over
the middle for 41 yards on the game-winning fourth-quarter drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been playing zone all day, and he slipped in between our
zones,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   So the Bears (2-5) were just good enough to win and stifle the
clamor for the head of Wannstedt. Still, this team of Wanna-bes can
hope for nothing higher than third place in the NFC Central, where
Minnesota and Green Bay set the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys should consider themselves fortunate. They're in a
division where everyone else has a losing record, and their
upcoming schedule (Philly, New York Giants at home, Arizona on the
road) is undaunting.
</P>
<P>
   And now Aikman, whom Irvin calls ``the captain of the ship,'' is
back at the helm. So Sunday's setback may be easy to forget.

CHURCH TAKES PRAGMATIC VIEW OF EX-COMMUNIST IN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ At first glance, it looked as if the Vatican was not
thrilled when Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who leads the
largest leftist party in Italy, was asked to form a majority that
would allow him to become the next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years after the hard-won victory of liberty and
democracy over Communism,'' the Vatican newspaper Osservatore
Romano warned on Sunday, ``the head of state has entrusted the task
of forming a new government to an apparatchik of the former
Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Leftist governments have been elected in Britain, France and
Germany, making the selection of D'Alema appear part of a broader
European trend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if D'Alema, 49, succeeds in getting his government approved
in Parliament, he would be the first former Communist to lead a
major Western European country. Monday, he brokered a majority by
nailing down alliances with a breakaway faction of Communists as
well as a small center-right party that defected from the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Italian readers could not be faulted for concluding that leaders
of the Roman Catholic Church in Italy, who throughout the Cold War
vehemently and openly campaigned against communist candidates, did
not relish the precedent of a former Communist in power now any
more than they did at any time in the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   On second glance, however, a more indirect strategy can also be
detected in the church's reaction. D'Alema, who leads the
Democratic Party of the Left and is relying on former Christian
Democrats as well as Communists to beef up his center-left base, is
destined to make some political compromises. The Catholic Church is
still a powerful political constituency in Italy, and it does not
intend to be left out of the horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a Socialist government in Italy to make a concordat
with the church,'' Vittorio Messori, a Catholic writer who
interviewed Pope John Paul II in the book ``Crossing the Threshold
of Hope,'' said, referring to the postwar period and the 1984
concordat that abolished Catholicism as the state religion, on
terms that many view as favorable to the church. ``In 50 years the
so-called Christian Democrats never dared pass anything favorable
to the Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's law legalizing abortion was passed in 1978, when Giulio
Andreotti, a strong Catholic, was prime minister. (He is now on
trial on corruption charges and alleged Mafia links.) Messori said
he expected that D'Alema could pass legislation that even his
predecessor, Romano Prodi, a Catholic who was hemmed in by his
leftist allies, did not risk. The church has been lobbying heavily
for the government to give more state financing to private Catholic
schools, something Prodi favored but was never able to get through
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, moreover, seems anxious not to alienate the Catholic
Church. Asked at a news conference Monday night if he intended to
use a scheduled meeting with the pope on Tuesday to clarify his
relationship with the church, he evenly replied, ``I have no
quarrel with the Holy Father, so I have nothing to clarify.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which helped keep the Christian Democrats in power
for more than 50 years, adopted a more flexible approach to
politics in 1992. By then, the Berlin wall had fallen, and so had
the Christian Democratic Party, which collapsed under the weight of
corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 elections, which brought Prodi to power, Vatican
officials said the church would not endorse a particular party,
though they urged Catholic voters to select candidates and parties
who best defended the interests of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Now, faced with the prospect of D'Alema, Messori said many
Catholics were counting on a pragmatic strategy by the church: ``As
Machiavelli said, `If you want to further your own aims, put your
enemies in power.'''

HOUSE COMPLETES WORK ON SPENDING BILL; VOTE SET FOR TUESDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After haggling for four days over last-minute
additions and deletions to the federal spending package, the House
completed action Monday night on the $500 billion spending bill
needed to keep the government open.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the final vote is set for Tuesday, Congress bought
itself extra time Monday by passing _ for the sixth time since the
Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year _ another measure to keep the
government running until midnight Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress and the White House announced a general agreement
Thursday and their aides sat down to write that agreement into
specific language, the written length of the spending package has
ballooned from an estimated 3,000 pages to more than 4,000 pages,
and the cost appears to have bulked up by millions as aides
uncovered the actual expense of many of the provisions in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an unusually disparate, catch-all package that
contains a third of the entire $1.7-trillion federal budget and an
array of policy decisions that most members of Congress will not
have a chance to read, let alone digest, until they vote on it,
perhaps Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last-minute additions are such items as $325 million
to buy enriched uranium from Russia and the $1 million reward in
the Unabomber case, which will go to David Kaczinski for turning in
his brother, Ted. David Kaczinski has said he would give the money
to his brother's victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The major issues that congressional Republicans negotiated
Monday included home-health care, the regulation of truckers, a
provision over scrap metal and details of the 1997 Chemical Weapons
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the intense last-minute pressures being applied,
Republican leaders actually reversed a bill involving the Tennessee
Valley Authority _ a bill that both houses had passed and that
President Clinton had already signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had eliminated the public subsidy for the sprawling
authority, which was created in 1933 by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt to tame the Tennessee River, provide power and spur
development in the region. But several Republicans from the area
protested the loss of money in the last few days and managed to
overturn the law. They have now secured more than $1 billion over
five years to help the TVA refinance its high-interest debt and
obtain a $50 million subsidy for flood control and recreational
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The new-found money for the TVA is part of the omnibus spending
package that Congress must pass to keep the government running. The
omnibus package is Congress' last, must-pass bill for the session,
and as such, it has become the last-chance vehicle for multiple
special interests that could not get their way otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The final draft of the bill was filed Monday night with the
House, which is mandated by the Constitution to originate all
spending bills. The House is tentatively set for one hour of debate
on the bill Tuesday night before voting. Adhering to that schedule
would mean that most members would have virtually no time to absorb
the elements of the bill before they vote.
</P>
<P>
   Once the House passes the bill, it moves to the Senate. Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, has indicated
that the Senate may not insist on a roll-call vote. This means the
Senate would probably have no debate on the bill and senators would
not have to return to Washington, leaving passage of the bill to a
voice vote by those who chose to return.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a voice vote on such a huge package with so many
elements has raised the ire even of some Republicans. Perhaps the
harshest criticism came from Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who has
excoriated the Republican leadership as secret deal-makers and said
he would vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the founding fathers ever intended for a few
members and staff to make closed-door, arbitrary decisions on
almost one-third of the federal budget and then sneak it through on
a voice vote,'' he wrote in a letter to his colleagues Monday.

<HEADLINE>
COMMENTARY: THE STARR QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Kenneth Starr is criticized, those who want
President Clinton out of office tend to respond with two sorts of
questions. What exactly has Starr done that was wrong? And in any
event, since the charges against the president are on the table
now, why should we care what Starr did?
</P>
<P>
   One answer to the first question is that Starr broke the rules:
the rules governing the conduct of federal prosecutors. For
example, Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 77.8,
says that a government lawyer may not propose or discuss an
immunity agreement with someone who he knows has an attorney
``without the consent of the attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's deputies and agents did exactly what that rule forbids
when they confronted Monica Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on
Jan. 16. They knew she had a lawyer, Francis Carter. They
denigrated his ability and discouraged her from calling him. They
pressed her to make an immunity agreement and said that, in her
words, ``if I called Carter, I wouldn't necessarily still be
offered an immunity agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the
Independent Counsel Act in 1988, it did so on the specific
understanding that independent counsels were obliged to comply with
the Justice Department's rules. What Starr's people did to Monica
Lewinsky was a crude violation of that understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Or think about the flood of illegal leaks from Starr's office.
This was not a small-bore prosecutor leaking to gloss his fame.
This was a prosecutor investigating the president of the United
States: a role that surely requires special dignity and
confidentiality. Starr's leaks were so flagrant that they are, most
unusually, the subject of a formal judicial inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to something even more profoundly wrong with Starr's
behavior. His abuses were driven by an obsessive _ and, for a
prosecutor, entirely inappropriate _ determination to force
President Clinton from office by any means available. That was the
purpose of the leaks and of his grossly salacious impeachment
report to the House.
</P>
<P>
   The passion to destroy Bill Clinton was evident in the way Starr
got into the Lewinsky business in the first place. He heard from
Linda Tripp on Jan. 12 _ or earlier from right-wing lawyers helping
her _ that on Jan. 17 President Clinton, in a deposition in the
Paula Jones case, would falsely deny a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   What would a prosecutor of good judgment _ say the universally
respected Robert Morgenthau, District Attorney of New York County _
have done with Mrs. Tripp's story? I am confident that he would
have considered it none of his business.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr, having failed to find any other prosecutable offense
by the president in years of investigation, leapt at the story of
sex and lying. He told Attorney General Janet Reno that he urgently
needed to have his jurisdiction expanded to cover that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the reporting of Nina Totenberg on National Public
Radio, we know that Starr had had several conversations with Paula
Jones' lawyers years before about their strategy. Legal ethics
required him to disclose that fact to Attorney General Reno. If he
had, she would very likely have thought it best to keep him out of
the Lewinsky matter. But he wanted in badly, and he did not tell
her.
</P>
<P>
   Then the second question: Does it matter? Yes it does,
enormously. What Starr has done, if accepted as legitimate, will
set precedents for abuse of power by other prosecutors. No future
president will be safe from an invasive, overweening investigator.
Nor will the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Jackson, a great attorney general and Supreme Court
justice, warned in 1940 that ``the prosecutor has more control over
life, liberty and reputation than any other person in America.''
And so, he told a meeting of U.S. attorneys, ``The spirit of fair
play and decency should animate the federal prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest danger of prosecutorial abuse, Jackson said, comes
when ``the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes. ... The
citizen's safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human
kindness ... who serves the law and not factional purposes.''

   MICROSOFT-JUSTICE (Washington) _ Microsoft, renowned as the
world's most successful software company and headed by the world's

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind the excitement of the coming spaceflight of Sen. John
Glenn is quiet apprehension about hidden dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Safety experts agree that the space shuttles, like temperamental
hot rods, must run regularly or become balky and their launching
crews rusty. But the shuttles have flown little of late. So Glenn's
flight is seen, at least in theory, as unusually risky.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the space agency is taking precautions like having
ground crews do many more dry runs meant to sharpen their skills.
It says these rehearsals will offset any dangers, though some
private experts say the odds of disaster still might be unusually
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been concerned,'' Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, a senior member
of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, said in an interview.
``When you have a hiatus like this you have to keep your skills
honed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. M. Granger Morgan, head of engineering and public policy at
Carnegie Mellon University, agreed. ``There are concerns whenever
an organization that has to perform a high-reliability job stops
engaging in continual practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The thunder of Glenn's blastoff aboard the shuttle Discovery,
set for Oct. 29, is to occur after an unexpected silence of nearly
five months at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This is the longest time between shuttle launching attempts
since the recovery from the 1986 Challenger disaster, when the
spaceships were grounded for more than two years. The first crew to
fly after that, in 1988, consisted of all shuttle veterans, mostly
former military test pilots used to putting their lives on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   The current gap in flights was caused by unforeseen delays in
building the international space station, a global effort whose
payloads are to dominate the shuttle agenda for years. The delays
stem from Russia's financial woes and have raised concerns among
federal and private safety experts, especially given the high
visibility of Glenn's flight.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency itself has changed its public stance on the
dangers posed by a flight slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before the gap opened up, Wilbur C. Trafton, then
head of space flight at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, told Congress that inactivity was dangerous. If
work on the station is delayed, he warned, then ``the shuttle
quickly drops below what we think is a safe flight rate, which is
about five flights a year.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem has come to pass in that the five-month gap, if
repeated over the course of a year, would amount to an annual rate
of fewer than three flights. Even so, NASA officials dismiss it as
minor. They say that better analyses show that the shuttle can
safely fly fewer times a year and that the rigorous exercise of
ground crews and managers is removing any possible peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally launch every six to eight weeks,'' said Dave King,
a shuttle official at the Kennedy center at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
``But when summer brought a five-month pause between launches, we
went to work developing a practice schedule that would keep the
team fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Sieck, head of shuttle operations in Florida, said
that he had talked with Glenn about the slowdown and that the
senator, a veteran of the astronaut corps, was unruffled by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be just as safe as ever because we have the
rules and requirements and procedures that protect us,'' Sieck said
in an interview. ``The teams are going to make sure that nothing
bad happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn himself has repeatedly played down the shuttle risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is a small danger,'' he said when his flight
was announced in January, but he added, ``NASA's done an
outstanding job'' of keeping the risks as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On his nine-day flight, Glenn, 77, and six other astronauts are
to conduct more than 80 scientific experiments. The senator's are
to center on the aging process.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle is, by far, the most complicated machine ever to fly
into space, and therein lies the danger _ there are more things to
go wrong. It has 230 miles of wiring, 417 circuit breakers, 600
fuses, 950 switches and 2 million parts, half of which are meant to
move.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's three main engines release energy equal to 23
Hoover Dams and loom as a safety factor because they work at
dangerously high heats, pressures and speeds. Its twin booster
rockets are a special worry because one of their kind leaked
blistering hot flames that touched off the Challenger explosion,
which killed six astronauts and a high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling and launching the fleet of four winged spaceships and
refurbishing them between flights takes a standing army at the
Florida spaceport, which employs about 14,000 people and pumps a
billion dollars into the state's economy every year.
</P>
<P>
   The current break in the rhythm of shuttle flights came about as
the space station project fell on hard times. Originally, orbital
construction of the big outpost was to have started in November
1997. But as that date neared, and as Russia's problems multiplied,
NASA pushed back the launching of the first station component.
</P>
<P>
   The flight of Glenn was announced on Jan. 16 of this year, as
the space agency was struggling to reduce the repercussions from
the station's delay on the shuttle, which is to be the main
transporter into orbit of the outpost's many parts. Among other
things, the agency was planning hundreds of layoffs at the Florida
spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse. On May 31, NASA announced that the start of
the station's orbital construction would be postponed even further,
from June to November, making the orbital outpost overdue by a full
year.
</P>
<P>
   That schedule still holds, barely. And it has thrown planning
for all shuttle flights into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   As silence at the launching pads was forecast to last for five
months, NASA analysts got edgy, as did the agency's overseers. So a
wide program of safeguards was undertaken in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on Aug. 20, some 150 launching team members
labored through a mock countdown bedeviled by troubles like false
sensor readings, system failures and bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test plan and problem scenarios are kept secret,'' Debbie
Frostrom, a shuttle expert who helped draw up the drill with senior
engineers known as gremlins, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   During the overall slowdown, the spaceport is doing three times
as many mock launchings and four times as many fueling simulations
as normal, said Sieck, the head of shuttle operations. It is also
conducting its first comprehensive assessment of all procedures and
systems since the restart of shuttle flights a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts, the ultimate beneficiaries of such care, have made
their presence felt in Florida in the slowdown. On July 16, C.
Gordon Fullerton, a former shuttle commander, gave the keynote
address when the entire center stopped regular work for a day to
focus exclusively on heightening safety.
</P>
<P>
   And on Aug. 27, Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, a newcomer to the
corps, gave out a coveted award to a worker who had helped improve
payload handling.
</P>
<P>
   Private experts said it was conceivable that all the extra
practice and precautions would actually make the Glenn flight
safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had time to fix all the small things,'' said Dr.
Elizabeth Pate-Cornell, head of industrial engineering and
engineering management at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Charles Perrow, a Yale sociologist and author of
``Normal Accidents,'' a study of high-technology risk, said the
slowdown and all the attendant changes could add complexity to an
already complex equation, undercutting safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly going to heighten the difficulty,'' he said.
``Whether that means new danger, nobody probably knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmel of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, a team of
independent experts, said he was confident that the heightened
precautions were sufficient to ward off unusual perils.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to realize that when you get into
something that is extraordinary, everybody has to be made aware of
that fact and to do the job right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lull is to ease up a bit after Glenn's flight. The first
space station launching is set for Nov. 20 when a Russian rocket is
to lift the initial element of the outpost into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Endeavour is to carry aloft the shuttles' first
space station payload on Dec. 3, in theory paving the way for
dozens of other shuttle trips in service of the space station over
the years, helping to keep launching teams sharp and the fleet
safe.

CLINTON ATTEMPTS TO SALVAGE PEACE TALKS FOLLOWING GRENADE ATTACK IN
ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton struggled on Monday night to
salvage stalled Middle East peace talks after a Palestinian grenade
attack on Israeli civilians made success seem less likely, senior
officials from all sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his team, guided
in large part by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, decided to use the
grenade attack as the justification for a dramatic negotiating
ploy, insisting the Israel would suspend negotiations on all issues
except for security, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli position, one official said, is designed to push
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into ``the most specific
commitments possible'' to fight terrorism, in particular the
military wing of Hamas. The Israelis want Palestinian terrorism
suspects to be extradited to Israel, specific members of the
Palestinian security forces to be arrested and tried in Israel for
terrorist acts, reductions in the number of Palestinian police and
confiscation of unlicensed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned here for a unscheduled fifth day of meetings
with Netanyahu, Arafat and scores of aides and experts. He met on
Monday night with the two leaders, who had not met face-to-face
since they had lunch together on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing King Hussein of Jordan flew to his Maryland home from
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and was described as ``standing by''
to try to push the leaders toward a deal. Arafat also appealed by
telephone to the Israeli president, Ezer Weizman, officials said,
and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, was also in contact with
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after an appeal to the leaders from the White House
lawn to ``consider the consequences of failure and the benefits of
progress,'' plunged back into the talks here, presiding over a
45-minute meeting of security officials and experts from the
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu of about half an
hour, then a similar meeting with Arafat, before bringing the two
leaders together on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will then take stock and decide where we go from
here,'' a senior American official said on Monday evening,
suggesting that the talks are likely to go on into a sixth day on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to fly to California Tuesday and remain
there on Wednesday, and his spokesman said that plan had not yet
changed.

CLOROX ACQUIRES FIRST BRANDS, AND WALL STREET CHEERS
</HEADLINE>
  (Skedded earlier as CLOROX-FIRST)  
(nk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might wonder why anyone would want to be the nation's No. 1
maker of kitty litter. But for G. Craig Sullivan, chief executive
of the Clorox Co., such a distinction is part of where he wants the
company to go.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan has said he wants Clorox to be No. 2 or better in every
category in which it competes. And Monday, after a long and
deliberate process, Clorox announced that it was acquiring the
First Brands Corp., which is based in Danbury, Conn., and makes
Glad trash bags, STP car care products and yes, three kinds of
kitty litter.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.52 billion stock deal catapults Clorox to the top of the
market in all three categories, the last of which is a high-margin
business if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will add STP to Clorox's Armor-All, the car protectant
maker it bought about a year ago, pushing the company to the top
spot in car care products. And Clorox, based in Oakland, Calif.,
will be No. 1 in another category: plastic bags and plastic wrap,
where analysts estimate Glad has 30 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was happy news for First Brands shareholders,
who had been sitting morosely on the sidelines while share prices
in other consumer-products companies soared. The share price leaped
$12.375 Monday, to close at $36.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a First Brands shareholder, you would be nothing
but euphoric today because for the last three years you've wanted
to throw yourself out of a window,'' said Andrew Shore, a managing
director and consumer products analyst at Paine Webber, adding that
the share price last Friday of $24.625 wasn't even $1 above what it
was at the end of 1995. People who bought the stock at that time,
he said, ``basically made no money through one of the greatest bull
markets in the history of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies approved the deal, in which First
Brands shareholders will receive Clorox stock equal to $39 for each
share of First Brands. Clorox will also take on $440 million in
First Brands debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox stock dipped a little in early trading but closed at
$104, up $4.25.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the acquisition would make Clorox a major
contender against companies like Colgate-Palmolive, give it an
important foothold in international markets and propel some
languishing First Brands names forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid a full price for it,'' Shore said, ``but they've
provided themselves a nice earnings cushion. This gives them an
enormous amount of scale in the U.S. and overseas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carol Warner Wilke, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said:
``It makes sense from a product standpoint, and Clorox will now
gain some exposure in international markets. Clorox is great at
managing their strong brands, and when you're in consumer products,
that's the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, the home-cleaning products division grew
17 percent in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30. ``They keep
finding ways through new products and creative, innovative ways to
educate the consumers that grow these businesses,'' she said. ``We
don't see any reason why that would not continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Low Chasen of Goldman, Sachs said: ``Clorox is extremely
focused. When they do something, they do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, Clorox's chief executive, called the combination of
companies ``a very good strategic fit'' and added that
international growth was a key motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glad has about 23 percent of its business outside the U.S.,''
he said, ``and we set a goal that we wanted 20 percent of our sales
outside the U.S. by 2000. We crossed 18 percent last year, and we
are well on our way to that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some turmoil in Latin America and Asia, he said, ``on a
long-term basis we think you've got to be international.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company expects to trim about $90 million in annual
costs as a result of the deal, but no one seemed to know Monday
whether that would mean substantial layoffs. Sullivan said it would
take until the first quarter of next year to determine how the two
companies' operations would work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those issues are unresolved,'' said Paul L. Stansel,
manager of corporate communications and human resources at First
Brands. However, he added, ``The mood is cautiously optimistic.''

<P>
   PARIS _ In the spring styles on European runways, it's all in
the details. Although most designers used a light hand, they left
almost nothing totally unadorned.
</P>
<P>
   So in the months to come shoppers can expect to find clothes
trimmed with feathers, mirrors, shells, beads and flowers.
Especially flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Fabric flowers were pinned to dresses and jackets. Flowers were
embroidered, sometimes with beads, onto sweaters, filmy camisoles,
shoes and handbags. And flower prints were everywhere, usually in
the softest of pastels but in bright, bold manifestations at Gucci
and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Some form of glitter or beading appeared on day and evening
wear, but it was generally just a tracing rather than a heavy
overlay. There was also a run on tulle, which was layered over
other fabrics to mute the colors or over sequins to dull their
shine. Giorgio Armani even veiled his day clothes with tulle to
achieve a soft-focus effect.

   PARIS _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Europeans to Go Second &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The American designers' move to earlier show dates ahead of
those of the Europeans has clearly shaken the French and Italian
fashion establishments, whose leaders met here on Oct. 19,
threatening to pre-empt the Americans. The outcome of the meeting _
which included Didier Grumbach, the president of the federation of
French ready-to-wear and couture designers; Denise Dubois, the
press director of the Chambre Syndicale, the organizing body for
the French shows, and Beppe Modenese, the head of the Camera
Nazionale, Italy's fashion organizing body _ was to leave the
Americans ahead of the Europeans, at least for the fall 1999 shows
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fern Mallis, the executive director of the Council of Fashion
Designers of America, made an impromptu trip here to meet
separately with Grumbach and Modenese. ``For all these years we've
waited for the French and Italians to set their schedules,'' Ms.
Mallis said. ``We can't do that anymore. We're too big now, too
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans pre-empted the Europeans to get a jump on orders from
retailers and to burnish the reputation of American design, which
has historically been portrayed as dependent on European trends.
Now, Europeans appear worried that the switch may be successful at
their expense, and Grumbach has talked about leap-frogging ahead of
the American shows.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the Americans will remain in their preferred slot:
from Feb. 14 to 19. Italy's shows will run from Feb. 25 to March 6,
and France's from March 8 to 15 or 16, Ms. Mallis and Ms. Dubois
said. The British dates remain to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Westwood Shop for SoHo &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Westwood, England's rebellious queen of fashion, plans
to open a store in Manhattan in February at 71 Greene St. (Spring
Street). The store would be her first in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It will carry her full range of products: her top signature
collection shown on the runway here last week; her less expensive
Red label; Anglomania, her jeans line; women's accessories; men's
wear, and later in the year, her new perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The store, to feature an elevated stage surrounded by dressing
rooms, has been designed by David Collins, who worked on Ms.
Westwood's four Anglomania stores in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The boutique is expected to bring Ms. Westwood, who has begun to
expand her business significantly only in the last three years,
wider recognition in the United States. Having a store in America,
where fashion is so market-driven, would be a new experience for
the designer, whose fashions are always among the most challenging.
``I've never had pressure from the market _ from `What does the
customer want?''' Ms. Westwood said. ``So I've been able to build
up this oeuvre that is technically based. It obviously worked, or I
wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of her products are now at about $60 million a year, Carlo
Dimireo, her partner, says. ``We have the image,'' he said. ``Now
we want to provide the product.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Makeup's Neutral Palette &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Looking natural has surfaced as the makeup trend on runways here
for spring, when clothes with cool icy colors, athletic inspiration
or artistic romanticism will be in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The look _ at Valentino, Cerruti, Loewe, Givenchy, Daniel
Hechter and Costume National _ is likely to replace the plum hues
of this fall. And it goes hand in hand with shiny, classic hair.
The more neutral palette is supposed to bring forth women's
individualism, said Tom Picheux, who created several of the
runway's nude makeup looks. ``For me, it's all about keeping the
character of the girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Valentino, Picheux, who is also working on the spring Calvin
Klein advertising campaign, brushed terra cotta tones on cheekbones
for a sun-kissed look. The warmth he applied to temples, he
cautioned, is just for the runway. ``Clean the face, use a bit of
concealer if you need it, and a bit of blush,'' he said. ``Powder
should be shimmery to catch the light.'' Lips looked lightly
stained or glossed, and makeup artists applied plenty of mascara.
``That kind of makeup where everything is done is over,'' Picheux
said. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton flew to rural Maryland on Monday
to try to salvage crucial Middle East peace talks, amid signs that
a fresh terrorist attack in Israel had deeply imperiled the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As the high stakes talks staggered inconclusively toward their
sixth day, Clinton called on Jordan's ailing King Hussein to join
him in efforts to hold the fractious negotiations together, and
U.S. and Israeli officials raised the prospect that the summit
could end with only a partial Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with protocol, Israelis angrily denounced Monday
morning's attack as another in a string of tragic reminders of the
poor job Palestinians have done combating terrorism, an issue
Israel has cast as the key sticking point in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that Monday's attack ''is certainly a
complicating factor,'' in the peace talks, but he stressed that
neither Israeli nor Palestinian leaders could afford to let the
chance for peace slip from their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issues are difficult, the distrust is deep, the going has
been tough,'' Clinton said, in brief comments from the White House
South Lawn before he left by helicopter to the secluded Wye
Plantation Conference Center, where Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
began last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But,'' said Clinton, ''the parties must consider the
consequences of failure, and also the benefits of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat issued a joint statement
condemning Monday's attack in the ancient Israeli city of
Beersheba, where two grenades were tossed into a crowd, injuring
more than 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agree not to give in to the efforts of extremists to
destroy the hope for peace and security for both our peoples,'' the
leaders said, in the joint statement read to reporters by U.S.
State Department spokesman James Rubin. ''We both agree today to
intensify our efforts to achieve agreement that will lead to a
secure and lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli spokesman David Bar-Illan, however, told reporters that
Monday's terrorist attack -- the 10th against Israelis in the past
two months -- had underscored Israeli frustration over Palestinian
commitments to counter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the tenth in a series of terrorist attacks on Israel.
In none of them did the Palestinian Authority cooperate or try to
exert any effort in trying to apprehend the terrorists or
collaborate with the Israeli authority on apprehending these
terrorists,'' Bar-Illan told reporters. ''We don't feel that this
is satisfactory behavior on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the talks is the goal of Israeli troops
withdrawal from roughly 13 percent of the occupied West Bank, in
exchange for security guarantees from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Dampening expectations for the Wye talks, Bar-Illan said Israel
was ready to withdraw from some West Bank territory, but hinted
that a ''partial agreement,'' might be the best parties could hope
for this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have already committed to a withdrawal from 10 and 3
percent of the territory of the West Bank, and that will obviously
be part of a partial agreement,'' Bar-Illan said. ''The question is
what we will get from the Palestinian side. For the time being, it
is not at all clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have suggested withdrawing from 13 percent of the
West Bank, but requiring that Palestinians leave roughly one-fourth
of that as an undeveloped nature preserve, which many analysts say
could be quickly occupied by Israeli troops if security conditions
were to change in the future.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin appeared also to concede that a partial deal might be the
best possible outcome of the Wye talks, in light of the latest
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly makes it more difficult to achieve what we had
been seeking to achieve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also acknowledged earlier reports that the United States,
in cooperation with Palestinian officials, had put together what he
called ''a comprehensive, systematic package to fight terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rubin, ''The United States for many months now has put into
its initiative a comprehensive package to fight terrorism that goes
directly at all the core issues . . . and a comprehensive
infrastructure to fight terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who has been undergoing cancer treatment at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., arrived in Washington Monday afternoon
and was expected to journey to Wye soon to play a role U.S.
officials declined to describe.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Hussein has been a trusted intermediary who has
worked closely with Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   His unscripted presence at Wye, however, underscored the
diplomatic improvisation afoot in talks deemed critical to reviving
a peace process that has been stalled for most of the past 19
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been taking it one meeting at a time,'' said Rubin. ''It
remains an open question what the results will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching a land-for-peace agreement at the Wye talks would add
momentum to the peace process established in 1993 under the
so-called Oslo accords and would open the door for a next round of
``permanent status'' talks. Those negotiations, which would be
aimed at resolving a host of territorial, political and economic
issues between Israelis and Palestinians, are supposed to be
completed by May 4 of next year, under the Oslo timeline.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Call them the realists, the ones who acknowledge that
the clothes they design are destined actually to be worn by women
in real life, not just by models on the runway or in magazines.
Their challenge is in a way stiffer than that faced by the dreamers
who envision a fantasy world where clothes exist merely to be and
not to serve a particular function.
</P>
<P>
   The collections these realists produce are often dismissed as
``commercial,'' one of the most dismissive words in the fashion
lexicon. But a designer who isn't commercial often has trouble
surviving, much less thriving, in the harsh global market. Look at
Isaac Mizrahi, the most recent casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are designers who manage to combine creativity with a
sense of what women want to wear and can deliver the goods.
Americans, in particular, have this knack, which is what has made
them so attractive to European houses anxious to reach a new
audience. Marc Jacobs' highly praised spring show for Vuitton last
Monday set the pace, and the designers who showed at the end of the
week didn't disappoint. Michael Kors for Celine, Narciso Rodriguez
for Loewe, and Peter Speliopoulos for Cerruti all produced worthy
collections.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kors who scored the highest with sportswear that
transcended the genre. His colors were the height of
sophistication, tending to ivory, sand, sea foam and the blue of an
evening sky. His fabrics were superluxurious, including cashmere as
fine as chiffon, silk organza, chamois and paper taffeta, sometimes
used in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he took woven taffetas, muslins, denims and voiles,
cut them into strips and had them hand-knitted into easy sweaters
with hoods, separate cowls or mufflers. These were teamed with
knee-length skirts, cropped pants or shorts in canvas or ostrich
for day and with long skirts of ribbon-embroidered cotton or
jewel-studded organza for evening.
</P>
<P>
   The cardigans of twin sets were long and loosely belted. Coats
were cut with small shoulders and high waists. Dresses and skirts
moved slightly away from the body into the modified A-line that is
the silhouette of the season. Jewels were as discreet as beading
can ever be, used tone-on-tone: jade on green, blue topaz on sky
blue, and amethyst on the palest purple.
</P>
<P>
   It was a faultless performance, one that should please the
powers at Celine and win them many new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Loewe is known for the quality of its leathers, and Rodriguez is
using them in hip new ways. His spring show on Saturday featured
slinky jump suits in white or banana yellow leather with low-riding
tan belts; perforated shells combined with crinkled gauzy pants;
shift dresses with a smudged-looking pattern, and double-faced
suedes paired with glossy leathers for an interesting play of
textures.
</P>
<P>
   He also showed loose sweaters with a crunchy tweed texture,
matte sequins in silver or gold, and just a touch of Lurex or
beading for a hint of glamour. His was a quiet take on luxury,
always tasteful. But a bit more pizazz wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   While Rodriguez favored a lean line, Speliopoulos went from
narrow shifts to A-line and full-skirted looks for Cerruti in a
collection that mixed tradition with technology.
</P>
<P>
   There were dresses with little-girl flounces or gathers at a
slightly raised waistline. And then there were suede shifts
decorated with shiny plastic strips resembling computer graphics,
and knits with reflective glass adding glints of light.
</P>
<P>
   Sporty jackets with industrial zippers were shown with shorts or
skinny pants, sometimes decorated with round silver studs, and
leathers had perforated edges or whip-stitched seams. Cotton and
canvas fabrics were mainly in neutrals like beige, khaki and gray,
while suedes and leathers came in colors like royal blue,
butterscotch and burnt orange.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with the influence of so many Americans on the Paris
scene, European designers are going for a somewhat more casual
approach with a less put-together, sportier feel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of suits, Valentino showed unstructured cardigan jackets
over shirts and low-slung pants or skirts with movement. He
feminized the man's shirt of white cotton or taffeta with
embroidery, lace or openwork, sometimes tucking it in and sometimes
leaving it outside and worn with a heavily jeweled belt.
</P>
<P>
   He also took the off-the-shoulder gypsy blouse and transformed
it into the garb of royalty in fine tulle with embroidery, openwork
or lace inserts and then paired it with full skirts of printed silk
or organza decorated with top stitching.
</P>
<P>
   Because Valentino is a couturier, there were also glamorous
evening dresses with crystal sequins, satin latticework embroidery,
abstract splashes of coral or red on white, or encrustations of
lace. Yet, the collection was refreshingly youthful in spirit and
filled with beautiful clothes that should make the transition
easily from runway to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Lacroix is another couturier who has simplified his
ready-to-wear collection for spring, toning down the pattern mixes
and muting the decorative elements. But it would never be mistaken
for sportswear or for anything other than French.
</P>
<P>
   Capri pants were topped with a brocade jacket. Floral-print
dresses had off-the-shoulder necklines or tulle ruffles outlining a
bare armhole. A short shaped jacket and full skirt worn over
petticoats had a retro, '50s air. Another short jacket was worn
with an A-line skirt of lace. A pale blue leather jacket went over
a metallic lace dress. There were halter necklines and bustle-back
ballgowns, pointed hems that fell like ponchos, and long lace
dresses in pretty colors.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix is a designer with a fertile imagination who doesn't
limit himself to one theme but tosses in a bit of this and a bit of
that and then adds a bit more. So even when he doesn't let loose,
he serves up a rich stew.
</P>
<P>
   Herve Leger has loosened up considerably, all but abandoning the
bandage dresses that have been his trademark. Each season, he has
broadened his range, and now he has taken on a whole new attitude.
In fact, there were times when it was difficult to remember that
this was a Leger collection.
</P>
<P>
   There were men's-wear pinstripes and rainbows of color;
calf-length skirts with fullness in back; silk shirts with
rolled-up sleeves; Nehru jackets worn with cropped pants; and
patterns inspired by artists like Chagall, Kandinsky, Pollock and
Hockney.
</P>
<P>
   Leger also showed sexy, skin-baring swimsuits in orange, yellow
and emerald green, along with full-sleeved, loose coverups and some
in openwork ladder effects that bared even more than they covered.
This was the one segment of the shows that embodied the signature
look the designer seems to be evolving away from, but it is the
segment where that look is still valid.

<P>
   PARIS _ At different points in relationships, ``Je T'Aime, Moi
Non Plus'' and ``Here Comes the Bride'' are the songs against which
women play out their love lives, and it was fitting that Yohji
Yamamoto used both in his wry, magnificent show.
</P>
<P>
   Like a splendid beast rearing up on its hind legs, the show cast
its muscular power and beauty over the entire slate of runway
presentations that end here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Yamamoto's collection showed his technical virtuosity, artistry
and sense of fun. Rippling just beneath its surface was a
remarkable depth of innovation in materials, like the use of
inflatable skirts in place of crinolines, and transparent
polyurethane flowers hand-painted on chiffon.
</P>
<P>
   Renewal is the heart that keeps fashion pumping (though some
might say it is marketing), and Yamamoto, at 55, has completely
reinvented himself, a process he began only three seasons ago. As
one of four or five Japanese designers who hit a peak in the 1980s,
he helped redefine how the West views fashion, with abstract shapes
and asexual or masculine clothing. Today, femininity and
romanticism are his bywords. And he chose the wedding, the most
romantic of symbols, as his arena.
</P>
<P>
   This was a complex collection, but simply understood. Different
looks reflected the contradictions that lie within the wedding, one
of the last universal occasions of pomp and ceremony. The pomp was
underscored by a surprise model, who prompted delighted shouts from
the audience _ the very ceremonious Andre Leon Talley, a popular
editor for Vogue and Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The show roved from the delicate betrothed virgin in an ecru
tabard and short, full-skirted dress to the urbane bride in white
satin trousers to the merry widow in seductive black lace.
</P>
<P>
   As the models meandered around the rectangular runway, they
doffed gloves, hats and dresses _ some of which peeled away to
reveal another beautiful creation below _ slyly suggesting the
striptease of the wedding night. The hems of short, tiered dresses
and a lean, sweeping coat simulated the grand undulations of waves.
</P>
<P>
   Yamamoto was obviously inspired by the larger-than-life wedding
dress that ended his show last season. But all these clothes could
be worn somewhere other than to a wedding, one of several modern
notions that the designer set forth. For instance, when deflated,
the inflatable under skirt allows for easy packing, an
acknowledgment of the rising number of couples who choose to travel
away from home for their weddings. A model wearing a pretty ivory
satin ball gown with concentric seams running around the skirt
stopped center-runway and unzipped a seam. Reaching into a hidden
pocket, she pulled out her gloves, her sandals and finally, her
bouquet of flowers. All of these she put on with the attractive
result being the same as if she had spent hours preparing for her
walk down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Yamamoto's collection was a leviathan in a season when too many
collections here looked correct but comatose. In this context, Jean
Paul Gaultier's adventurous journey to China was commendable. His
collections consistently burst with glorious concepts for the
streetwise and the couture connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
   Among his audience was Sean (Puffy) Combs, the rap entertainer
and record producer, who in a shocking disregard for fashion
protocol did not attend the show dressed in Gaultier but in
Versace.
</P>
<P>
   If he was interested, Combs could have come away with some good
ideas for his own new sportswear line, called Sean John, scheduled
to be in stores next year. There was the high-waisted, wide-leg
pant, and sporty jackets with ingenious drawstring necklines, and
the sheerstocking tops that every merchant from Madison Avenue to
14th Street has copied. They were printed with colorful scenes from
Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier's trademark slit beneath the underarm in jackets
surfaced wonderfully in black suits with the billowed sleeves of
kimonos revealing a frisson of hot pink or orange lining. The
Madame Butterfly theme was offset by Greco-Roman sculpture flanking
the round, red-lacquered runway.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the relationship between China and Europe was often
uneasy, the collection, too, did not always blend smoothly.
Occasionally, Gaultier appeared to lose control of his theme, or
perhaps he did not, in the end, find it sufficiently inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier's shows, since his earliest days, have been lush
affairs, but among some of Paris' talented developing designers
there is a disquieting sense of talent being stretched too thin.
Perhaps the tendency for established designers to poach the natural
turf of the young by borrowing streetwise or abstract design
concepts has undercut the newcomers. Or maybe they are simply short
of money. The younger generation appears to be marking time until
the millennium, squirreling away ideas and energy, presenting
stingy collections with one or two concepts. Market forces may well
have a hand in this development, as fewer stores purchase entire
collections from nascent names.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Scott, a young American working in Paris, may have
presented the show of the future for budding talents, at least in
terms of scope: it opened with high-shouldered, dominatrix suits in
black and white, but a few pounding beats later, after little more
than a dozen looks, the show was over.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Ghesquiere for Balenciaga, Lamine Kouyate at Xuly-Bet
and Veronique Leroy in her signature line seemed to follow Scott's
lead. Each had one or two winning ideas, but repeated them ad
nauseam. Still, their track records insist that their slight
collections be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Ghesquiere, whose mastery of architectural lines has in the past
been breathtaking, latched on to soft, swinging skirts in crushed
white cotton over high stack-heeled boots. Dashing gauchos or
flamboyant flamenco dancers came to mind. And he was alone among
designers in taking the ubiquitous cummerbund and dropping it to
hip level.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Djellabas _ reflecting the hippie multicultural trend _ have
been a strong flash point in several collections here and in Italy,
but Kouyate's version is done like a knit T-shirt, in juicy orange
with machine embroidery and prints that simulate their traditional
hand embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leroy built her show around silky ponchos with necklines
knitted like turtlenecks in lime green, orange or black with a
sexy, broad leather belt to define the waist. This was clearly a
collection, if it could be called that, with a great sensibility,
which Ms. Leroy might have developed fully if she had had the
money. It was perfect for a bigger company: hip and wearable at the
same time, suitable for younger as well as mature women. But Ms.
Leroy's business is beleaguered by financial problems. It is a
misfortune of the current system that she has not been installed as
a designer in an ailing French house that she might restore.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging designers like Martine Sitbon, Jean Colonna and Ocimar
Versolato are trying, against the odds, to position themselves
commercially. For when the old names, some barely clinging to life,
finally let go, someone must be waiting in the wings. Ms. Sitbon
turns out reliably interesting and salable designs. Colonna and
Versolato have expanded their oeuvres in unexpected ways, and for
Colonna it was about time.
</P>
<P>
   For this collection, he went back to the beginning, so to speak,
to the time when his trademark sleaze-loving woman was a preppy
pariochial-school girl, who showed all the signs of turning bad.
You know, the one who would strip her socks off the minute she was
outside the school gates. Colonna switched the seediness of tight
black leather skirts for looser versions in satin or for chino
pants worn with vintage-style sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Versolato's transition was stickier. He expanded into day wear,
men's wear and bathing suits to round out his exquisite, steamy
evening gowns. His mastery of the thong swimsuit was not
surprising, given his Brazilian background, and there were great
leather dresses with tiny vertical perforations. But the day wear
will have to be simplified. A day suit or stretch slip dress is not
going to ever be an appropriate canvas for intricate piecework or
draping.
</P>
<P>
   The mellifluous dresses Ms. Sitbon flocked with velvet for fall
inspired her to applique bold red or black latex geometric patterns
on dresses this season. Interesting skirts in yellow or red had a
finish that looked like someone had swirled a comb through wet
paint. Nevertheless, this was a tame collection for Ms. Sitbon, who
miscalculated in thinking that beautiful, black crepe suits were
sufficiently interesting for the runway.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN VAIL FIRE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ Two days after Vail broke ground on a controversial ski
area expansion, fires erupted Monday along a nearby, mile-long
mountain ridge, destroying three major buildings and damaging four
chair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to the nation's busiest ski area, the fires leveled
the resort's ski patrol headquarters, a mountain top shelter and
picnic area, and Two Elk Lodge, a 500-seat restaurant. Ed
Nesselroad, a spokesman here for the U.S. Forest Service, the area
landowner, said, ``It's unlikely that it was a natural cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Vail, which last winter sold 1.6 million lift tickets, plans to
open on schedule, on Nov. 6, Paul Witt, a spokesman, said Monday
from the resort, 90 miles west of here. He said that the company is
evaluating damage to the chair lifts and is preparing an estimate
of the dollar losses.
</P>
<P>
   Mud on access roads, snow on the mountain top, and the
11,200-feet elevation hampered the work Monday of about 100
firefighters. Three hours before dawn, Vail fire fighters received
fire alarms from smoke detectors at the ski patrol building and at
the restaurant, according to the Eagle County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, the largest ski mountain in the United States, has the
most expensive lift ticket announced for Colorado this winter, $61.
This month, a poll of readers of Ski magazine rated Vail the top
ski resort in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fires come after months of controversy surrounding a
plan by Vail to expand into 885 acres of National Forest land.
Environmental groups have fought the expansion, arguing that it
would destroy lynx habitat and would further real estate
development and traffic congestion on the edges of the White River
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a
request for an emergency injunction, clearing the way for Vail to
start work. Racing the onset of winter, Vail started preliminary
work on Friday, largely building fences. Tree clearing for trails
and lifts was to begin later this week.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the fires, which were
condemned by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If arson is indeed the cause, we would hope that those
responsible would be brought to justice and prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law,'' said Ted Zukowski, a Boulder attorney
who represents six groups that filed suit last June to block the
expansion. ``Any purposeful destruction of public lands resources
or facilities is absolutely abhorrent to us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month, the expansion plan provoked the University of
Colorado to cancel its ski bus service from the Boulder campus to
four ski areas owned by Vail Resorts: Vail, Keystone, Breckenridge
and Beaver Creek. On Monday, Joan Schunck, a student leader of the
boycott, said, ``We condemn any action that is destructive and
dangerous to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the expansion has also come from the 11th Mountain
Alliance, a group of about 210 back country skiers and snowboarders
who complain that Vail wants to bar them from a back country area
of National Forest in order to compensate for the ski area's
expansion into possible lynx habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx have not been sighted in the disputed area since 1973. But
Zukowski noted that lynx tracks were seen there in the 1991,
adding, ``The only reason the Forest Service has not found any lynx
back there is they haven't looked.''

<P>
   When Humperdinck turned the Grimm Brothers' version of ``Hansel
and Gretel'' into an opera, he considerably lightened the bleakness
of the story and lessened the meanness of the parents, who, in the
opera, do not intentionally desert their children in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   But so many opera directors and designers just can't resist
putting the darkness back into the story, and that's what James
Robinson, in his debut with the New York City Opera, and the
designer John Conklin have done with the company's new production
of ``Hansel and Gretel'' (a joint venture with the Los Angeles
Opera). However, they have gone too far, for the production is
conceptually jumbled and dreary to look at.
</P>
<P>
   The story is intriguingly updated to 1893, the year the opera
was composed, and set in New York City during the winter. The
parents, struggling German immigrants, live in a Lower East Side
tenement. When the children get sent off by their upset mother to
scavenge for food, they wind up lost in Central Park. Cori Ellison
has prepared a very free English adaptation of the libretto filled
with clever rhymes and Manhattan references.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem is the sets of Conklin, a sometimes imaginative
designer who of late has been on a bad roll with the company. In
the first scene, a confining one-room apartment is meant to depict
the family's dire straits. But the tiny rectangular room is set
against a stage-filling black backdrop. Even the enchanted park
must be viewed through a large circular opening in that pervasive
black backdrop. Why do so many set designers equate bleakness with
blackness? I could imagine a park scene filled with color, yet
horribly creepy.
</P>
<P>
   As the children fall asleep, with the aid of the sandman here, a
mysterious lamplighter in the park (countertenor David Walker),
they sing sweetly of the angels who will protect them at night. The
angels of their dreams turn out to be nicely attired parents with
well-fed, toy-laden children. This is an idea of some poignancy,
though it has a capitalistic subtext: namely, it takes prosperity
to be a caring parent.
</P>
<P>
   The performance is essentially strong, though the boxy tenement
set distances the singers from us and hinders the projection of
sound. Lyric soprano Sari Gruber was a bright-voiced Gretel, and
the fine mezzo-soprano Theodora Hanslowe, in her company debut, was
a frisky Hansel. Joanna Johnston (also in her debut) and Victor
Benedetti were the desperate parents.
</P>
<P>
   When the vivacious, loudmouthed witch of Linda Roark-Strummer
(also in her debut) showed up, children in the audience squealed
with delight. Her candied house is a doll house that later becomes
a Victorian drawing room. The imagery was confusing, but at least
the scene has more color and energy.
</P>
<P>
   George Manahan conducted sensitively, though reining
Humperdinck's almost-Wagnerian orchestration is always difficult,
especially when the voices are youthful.

CLINTON PRODS MIDEAST NEGOTIATORS AFTER TERRORIST ATTACK DIMS HOPES
FOR ACCORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton prodded Middle East negotiators
Monday as hopes of a new peace accord still seemed distant
following another terrorist attack in Israel and four days of
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat issued a joint statement pledging
to ``intensify our efforts'' to reach an agreement following a
grenade attack by a Palestinian that wounded more than 60 people at
a southern Israeli bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel also suspended talks with the Palestinians on all
issues except security as the two sides continued to debate the
interim steps needed to abide by a 1993 peace agreement that called
for a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank.
Israel wants security guarantees from Palestinians before
committing to the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has
been tough. But the parties must consider the consequences of
failure, and also the benefits of progress,'' Clinton said Monday
before returning to the Wye River compound in Maryland where
negotiators have been meeting since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent much of the weekend shuttling between the two
sides, called on Netanyahu and Arafat to ``make the hard
decisions'' to spur the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said when we launched the talks last week, the United
States will do everything we can to help, but ultimately, only the
parties themselves can bridge their differences and put their
people on a more hopeful course,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president called the grenade attack a ``complicating
factor'' in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   He later met separately with Netanyahu and Arafat before
bringing the two leaders together for their first face-to-face
talks since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan also flew to Washington from the Mayo
Clinic in Minnesota where he is being treated for cancer. Hussein
reportedly was resting at his home in Washington but could be
available for the 70-mile trek to the Wye River conference if his
intervention might help.
</P>
<P>
   The grenade attack prompted both Israelis and Palestinians to
briefly end the news blackout on the talks imposed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As the Middle East negotiators prepared for their fifth day of
discussions, Israel announced it would only meet to talk about
Palestinian commitments for security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances for an agreement have lessened,'' said David Bar
Illan, Netanyahu's spokesman. He said the Palestinian security plan
offered with the help of the United States was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   But Agence France Press quoted a Palestinian official saying:
``Arafat will stay as long as it takes to reach a complete
agreement and Netanyahu knows he cannot leave here until such a
deal is signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel over the weekend had pushed for a partial agreement that
would leave tough issues unresolved, but Arafat rejected that
tactic and the two sides decided to extend the four-day talks.
</P>
<P>
   After the terrorist attack, Arafat called Netanyahu to condemn
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Later the two issued a joint statement read by James Rubin, the
State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to do everything possible to fight terror.
We pledge to cooperate against the threat of terrorism and
recognize that fighting terror is of vital interest for both
sides,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom from terror and violence is an essential condition of
a durable peace. At the same time, we agree not to give in to the
efforts of extremists to destroy the hope for peace and security
for both our peoples. We both agree today to intensify our efforts
to achieve agreement that will lead to a secure and lasting
peace,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint statement seemed to conflict with the sentiments
voiced hours earlier by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said it was not unprecedented for terrorist attacks to
have a ``temporary effect'' on discussions. He suggested informal
contact between the two sides could continue on issues other than
security while a formal committee met to discuss the security
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a briefing at midafternoon and then met
separately with Netanyahu and Arafat. They later got together for a
three-way discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been trying to get the peace process back
on track for more than 18 months. Negotiators are fighting a May
1999 benchmark for the conclusion of these interim peace steps.
</P>
<P>
   After that deadline, the two sides are supposed to enter into
the so-called final status talks involving critical and even more
delicate issues such as the status of Jerusalem and the creation of
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, after a series of terrorist attacks, has balked at
making its third redeployment which would turn over an additional
13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority. The
authority currently controls 3 percent of the West Bank. Other
issues, such as a Palestinian airport in Gaza, also are on the
table
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said it was ``virtually
impossible to predict'' how long the negotiations might last.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to fly to California Tuesday for a two-day
fund-raising swing for Democratic candidates. &QL;

SAN ANTONIO MUSEUM ENSHRINES NELSON ROCKEFELLER'S HOBBY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When Nelson A. Rockefeller made his final trip to
Mexico in 1978, several months before his death, his eye was drawn
to a small hacienda surrounded by a picket fence along a rural road
in Oaxaca. Atop each picket was a tall, strangely striking figurine
made of rough pottery.
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president stopped the car, walked to the door
and discovered the shop of a family of potters. Each statue on the
fence had been damaged somehow in the making and just perched on
the fence to help advertise the shop. They were evocative pieces
spanning many years, left to bake in the Mexican sun. Rockefeller
bought them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Nelson Rockefeller, folk art was an entree to the
people,'' said Marion Oettinger Jr., senior curator and curator of
Latin American art at the San Antonio Museum of Art. ``When he was
on collecting trips to Mexico, he would just plunge into the
markets. He loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, those pottery statues are part of a staggering
2,500-piece collection of folk art assembled by Rockefeller that
forms the seed of the new Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Latin
American Art at the San Antonio museum.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which is to open on Oct. 24 in a new $11 million
wing at the museum, will contain not only one of the world's
largest Latin American folk art collections, but also extensive
galleries devoted to pre-Columbian art, Spanish colonial pieces and
modern and contemporary works by Latin artists. In all, the center
will present Latin American art spanning nearly three millenniums,
from 1,000 B.C. to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it is hoped, the center will also contain a library,
research center, seminar rooms and space for visiting scholars.
``There are a lot of museums in the United States with significant
collections of pre-Columbian art,'' Oettinger said. ``Other museums
also have important folk art collections and pieces by contemporary
artists, and a handful have Spanish colonial collections. But we
will be the only one that covers all four elements. We're it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Sullivan, chairman of the department of fine arts at
New York University and a specialist in modern and contemporary art
from Latin America, called the Rockefeller folk art legacy ``one of
the truly important collections.''
</P>
<P>
   He also concurred that the center would set the museum apart
because of its significant collections in all major areas of Latin
American art. ``Their colonial art is very impressive, on the same
level as a place like the Denver Museum of Art,'' he said, adding,
``the aggregate of all that material really makes it a top place
for looking at Latin American art.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will enter through the museum and then an orientation
area. The three-story center was constructed in an L-shape to swing
around a pair of 200-year-old oak trees. The four exhibition areas
spread out from a central atrium.
</P>
<P>
   Each area has its own design motif: the doorways in the
pre-Columbian section are cut in the shape of a semihexagonal Mayan
arch; the colonial gallery is shaped like a massive barreled vault
with Romanesque arches, reminiscent of a Spanish church; the folk
areas include the burnt terra cotta colors found in adobe homes,
with doorways crowned by wooden lintels; the contemporary
collection is visually connected with tall, narrow openings
crisscrossed with lattice.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's sons, Mark and Nelson Jr., who inherited a South
Texas ranch where their father once intended to build a house,
donated money for a network of computers to lead visitors through
the center.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican folk art was only one of many enthusiasms for
Rockefeller, a lifelong collector of many kinds of art, but it was
a substantial one.
</P>
<P>
   He was a young man in the 1920s when his mother encountered
Mexican folk art at a craft show in Manhattan. The children's
playhouse at the Rockefeller estate in Tarrytown, N.Y., is still
covered with Mexican tiles and folk art motifs as a result, said
Rockefeller's daughter, Ann R. Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller first visited Mexico in 1933 and was enraptured by
the folk pieces he found in rural markets. With the help of friends
and advisers, particularly the Mexican muralist Miguel Covarrubias,
a writer and caricaturist for The New Yorker, Rockefeller began
amassing a dizzying array of pieces that he found in markets and on
subsequent excursions into the Mexican hinterland, including an
extended tour of Latin America in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a collection that he lived with,'' said Oettinger,
who wrote the text for ``Folk Treasures of Mexico,'' a 1989 book
based on Rockefeller's collection. ``You can see pieces from the
collection in some old pictures of Rockefeller at his various
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, when fascism was on the rise in Europe and
beginning to take root in parts of Latin America, Rockefeller came
to believe that the only way to combat it was to develop closer
links between the peoples of the United States and Latin America.
The best way to do that, he felt, was through an appreciation of
each other's culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father's interest was always in promoting the
interrelationship between Mexico and America,'' said Ms. Roberts,
who chose the San Antonio museum as the repository of her father's
collection. ``So I wanted the gift to go to a place where it would
work toward furthering that interrelationship.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was president of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan
he compiled an exhibition of about 5,000 pieces of art borrowed
from Mexican institutions, and established the museum's
Inter-American Fund to purchase more Latin American pieces for the
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Rockefeller's interest in Latin American affairs
brought him into the Roosevelt Administration. In 1944, he was
named Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs,
focusing on trade and diplomatic relations in the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   In his travels around Latin America he continued to forage
through local markets for art.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockefeller moved from four terms as governor of New York
through three unsuccessful presidential campaigns to a
career-capping two years as Gerald Ford's vice president, his trips
to Mexico continued. But his interests widened and many of the folk
pieces gathered in the 30s and 40s were packed away and half
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's pre-Columbian collection had already gone to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it became part of the Michael
Rockefeller wing, and most of his contemporary pieces, including
those by Latin artists, had gone to the Museum of Modern Art. But
his folk art remained, for the most part, scattered around the
Rockefeller residences or stored in crates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts decided that her father would have wanted this
particular collection kept together. ``It became my way of honoring
my father after his death,'' she said. ``It was a period in his
collecting that I felt very close to because it is what I grew up
with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So she purchased the entire collection from her father's estate
and began the task of finding a museum that would become its home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a museum that was an art museum, not only
a folk art museum, so that it would have other areas of collection,
a broader base,'' Ms. Roberts said. ``We were also looking for a
museum that was in a mixed community, that had a Latino and an
Anglo population, that already had an interest in folk art so they
weren't just kind of making it up, and that already had some kind
of relationship with its Latin community.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave about 500 pieces to the Mexican Museum in San
Francisco, which is devoted solely to folk art and was too small to
take all 3,000 pieces. The rest of the collection went to San
Antonio in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Oettinger, who began his career as an anthropologist interested
in rural Mexico, came to the museum a year later and assembled a
large exhibition, ``Mexico: Splendors of 30 Centuries,'' that was a
smashing success in San Antonio and eventually toured the nation.
That show, combined with the experience of writing the book about
the Rockefeller folk collection, led him and other officials at the
museum to expand their Latin American collection.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, along the San Antonio River north of downtown and
about a mile from the center of tourist activity along the
Riverwalk, had opened in 1981 in the abandoned Lone Star brewery.
The sprawling complex had space for a new wing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, voters in San Antonio approved a $1 million ``quality
of life'' bond issue to spur the project's capital campaign,
originally set at $10 million. The next year the Mabee Foundation
of Tulsa, Okla., offered a $1 million challenge grant contingent on
the museum's raising another $8 million by mid-1995. That goal was
eventually exceeded by $1 million, bringing the budget for the
construction, endowment and installation of the center to $11
million.
</P>
<P>
   That left only the task of choosing a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed appropriate to honor Rockefeller, both because of
his folk art collection and because of the family's support for the
museum and the center,'' Oettinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts said she and her stepbrothers also knew that placing
her father's name on the wing would raise its profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question both of the museum's generosity, a
recognition of my father's love for Latin America and his work
there, and a gift that might bring more awareness of the museum,''
she said. ``In a sense, his name on the center endorses it.''

FAT MAN ON THE LEFT - FOUR DECADES IN THE UNDERGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIONEL ROLFE  
 REVIEWED BY STEVE RUBENSTEIN  
 C.1998 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles cannot possibly be as wonderful as Lionel Rolfe says
it is. Los Angeles is not, in fact, a ``Utopia'' blessed with a
``purple cloak of poetry.'' Many people have visited or otherwise
done time in Los Angeles and can bear me out on this.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Los Angeles is a vexing, bloated, long-suffering but
vaguely likable mess. In that, it bears a striking resemblance to
Rolfe, who can write with charm and even grace if he would only
shut up once in a while and stop dropping names and babbling about
archetypes and Inner Sanctums and carrying on, in general, like an
insufferable noodge.
</P>
<P>
   Rolfe, in this collection of 16 essays that irritate, delight
and then irritate again, is the guy who knows everything, knows
everybody and, especially, knows more than you do. He calls himself
the Fat Man on the Left because he is a chunky loudmouth, like Rush
Limbaugh, whom he apparently aspires to be the political mirror
opposite of.
</P>
<P>
   He also happens to be the nephew of legendary violinist Yehudi
Menuhin, a fact he feels compelled to mention on just about every
other page and which is a big deal primarily to Rolfe. It is
certainly no big deal to Menuhin who, according to the text, has
spent most of his life ignoring his nephew or acceding to the rest
of the family in writing him out of grandpa's will, after a
previous Rolfe book that spilled family secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Rolfe does possess a dogged fondness for Los Angeles that cannot
be faked. One essay, a tour of literary Los Angeles at dusk, turns
the sleazy dumps and back alleys of Hollywood and Venice into
something truly wondrous. And his eloquent and passionate tribute
to the old county hospital where Rolfe spent a month recuperating
from abdominal surgery (``an immersion in urban reality,'' he
called it) is a lot better than the hospital itself. Best of all is
his affectionate profile of newspaper editor Scott Newhall, the
``last great frontier journalist'' and a man who believed in hiring
good writers and letting them write, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   Rolfe is easier to take in the third person than in the first.
The reporting is dead on, but the ruminations are whiny and
annoying. The constant name-dropping is maddening. Here's Willa
Cather and Yehudi Menuhin. Here's Charles Bukowski, Abba Eban and
Yehudi Menuhin again. And few readers, if any, need to know about
Rolfe's wife's affair with rock musician Frank Zappa or Rolfe's
rejection of a blind date with singer Janis Joplin ``because I
thought she was kind of ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the fat man turns out to be an oddly sympathetic soul _
a West L.A. Jewish kid who grew up delivering newspapers, eating
cherry turnovers, signing on with the Communist Party, getting
fired, writing the truth as he saw it and trying to understand why
so many folks are annoyed with him. At least the reader will have
no trouble figuring that part out.

ATTACKING GOP ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY PAYS OFF, POLL FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a finding that could spur other Democrats to make voter
distaste for an impeachment inquiry an issue in their campaigns, a
poll made public Monday found that former Rep. Jay Inslee, a
Democrat running for the House in Washington state, has gained
ground since he began running a commercial about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, found that Inslee has pulled statistically even
with the Republican incumbent, Rick White. While the race has long
been competitive, Democratic officials said that represented a
significant turnabout for Inslee, who was trailing White by several
points in a poll they conducted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll was conducted on Saturday and Sunday, about a
week after Inslee began running an advertisement castigating White
for voting for a Republican proposal to begin a broad, open-ended
inquiry into possible grounds for the impeachment of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick White and Newt Gingrich shouldn't be dragging us through
this,'' Inslee says in the 30-second commercial, which was taped
hours after the House voted, largely along party lines, to approve
the inquiry on Oct. 8. ``Enough is enough. It's time to get on with
the nation's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Washington and around the country have been
watching for reaction to the advertisement because Inslee was the
first _ and so far the only _ Democrat in a highly competitive race
to try to use a possible backlash against Republicans on the
impeachment inquiry in campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   In another move that could encourage Democrats to lash out at
the impeachment inquiry, three party strategists in Washington on
Monday made public a memorandum urging the Democratic candidates to
condemn Republicans for voting for an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates should want their election campaigns to
engage the impeachment issue: ``Do not run from it,'' said the
memorandum, written by James Carville and Stanley Greenberg, both
influential advisers to Clinton's 1992 campaign, and Al Quinlan, a
partner of Greenberg. ``The impeachment inquiry is an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum, based on a new national survey by the
consultants, advises candidates: ``The Republican Congress is
defined by the impeachment inquiry. For the overwhelming majority
of Americans, that is what the Congress has done and promises to do
in the future. The Republicans cannot escape it unless we drop the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was particular interest Monday in the Inslee poll. At
the White House, Rahm Emanuel, on his last day as Clinton's senior
adviser, described the survey as an important development and said
it would make Republicans realize that impeachment is a losing
political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sallick, a spokesman for the Democratic Campaign Committee,
said that in light of the findings many Democratic House
candidates, particularly those running against Republican
incumbents, ``are thinking very seriously'' about following
Inslee's lead. While he said there was no ``one-size-fits-all ad,''
the Inslee model ``is something campaigns may want to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the firm of Lauer, Lalley, Victoria
Inc., found that among people whom the firm considered likely to
vote, Inslee has 43 percent and White 39 percent, with 5 percent
for a third-party contender. That would still constitute a dead
heat because the sampling error of the poll of 368 likely voters is
plus or minus five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters emphasized that among independent voters who are
crucial in the contest in Washington state's 1st Congressional
District, which White represents, a plurality of 46 percent said
they were ``more likely to vote for Inslee'' because of his
criticisms of White's impeachment vote; 34 percent said they were
less likely.
</P>
<P>
   The White campaign challenged the findings and insisted that its
own polls show the two-term congressman is 6 percentage points
ahead. Connie Correll, a spokeswoman for White, said the Inslee
advertisement ``probably helps solidify a base that was already
there'' for the challenger, but did not win him new support. She
described the effort by Inslee as a desperation move.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Shorr, Inslee's media consultant, said he was particularly
heartened by the result because he had been a bit skeptical about
his own advertisement, which he said was the candidate's idea.
``It's pretty amazing,'' Shorr said. ``This is a big-time shift in
the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorr said he expects that other Democrats, particularly those
opposing Republicans who voted for the impeachment inquiry, might
try the approach. ``I feel like we're the amoeba, like we're the
test tube here,'' he said. ``Something very strange is going on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the impeachment commercial is still running, the Inslee
campaign for the last several days has been putting more emphasis
on a new advertisement that attacks White's record on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster whose firm works for
White, questioned whether raising the impeachment inquiry in
advertising would work for either party. But he made clear that he
thinks Republicans would be smarter to stick to the issues rather
than use their commercials to ridicule the president on the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to see this made into a partisan issue,''
McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, he added, to make a link between the president's
behavior and Democratic candidates. ``People in focus groups say,
`How can you blame them for things President Clinton did?'''
Instead, he said he counsels candidates to ``make a broader point
about the president's issue positions.''

<P>
   LONDON _ For more than 15 months, Mitchell Shivers, a managing
director at Merrill Lynch, and 105 of his associates here have been
readying themselves for a single date: Jan. 4, 1999. On that day,
after the year-end revelries and a feverish final weekend of
preparations, markets across Europe will reawaken to a financial
landscape the likes of which have never been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   To a drumbeat of keyboards in trading rooms and on exchange
floors across the continent, 11 currencies _ from the Spanish
peseta to the mighty German mark _ will simply disappear in
electronic transactions, to be replaced by the euro, Europe's new
and untested single currency.
</P>
<P>
   The varied currencies will survive, at least for a while, in the
shops and pocketbooks of Main Street, Europe. But in the electronic
realm, there will be one glaring anomaly: The City of London, with
its armies of investors and bankers, analysts and strategists, will
strive to continue as Europe's leading financial center, trading in
everything from metals and commodities to the most arcane
derivatives. But Britain itself will be outside ``Euroland'' _ the
term for those nations that have signed up for the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   And that has opened the City _ London's answer to Wall Street _
to the unaccustomed whiff of rivalry, notably from Frankfurt, which
waged a hard, successful fight to become the headquarters of the
European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankfurt is already the continental European financial center
where all the players have to be present,'' said Paul Achleitner,
head of the Frankfurt office of Goldman, Sachs. And, said one
British broker who insisted on anonymity, ``If Britain does not
join the euro sometime in the next three or four years, then the
whole picture could change.''
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Frankfurt's derivatives market has overtaken
London's as Europe's prime market in some contracts. The London
Stock Exchange has been obliged to strike a deal with its Frankfurt
equivalent to gain a toehold in continental Europe. And elsewhere
in Europe, markets are abuzz with talk of cross-border deals
between exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Shivers and his counterparts at big European and
American banks clustered in London, the implications are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   In a study last year, Shivers and his team identified 2,000
potential problems linked to doing business in Euroland. The budget
for addressing those problems was $65 million, with hundreds of
people drawn into the fray _ numbers replicated in banks and
financial institutions across the City.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer scale of the job, Shivers said, made the introduction
of the euro ``probably the most complex project the securities
business has ever undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings up an obvious question: How long can the
City, as an outsider, maintain its primacy?
</P>
<P>
   Talk to David Clementi, deputy governor of the Bank of England,
and the answer is clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the country is going to be outside the euro zone,
London is going to be very much in,'' he said in an interview.
``You'll be able to buy bonds and equities in euro, you'll be able
to deal in euro in London.'' So keen is the Bank of England to put
that message across that earlier this year Clementi led a team of
bankers on what he called a road show through Tokyo, Hong Kong,
Singapore, New York and Zurich to proselytize for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   And so detailed has the Bank of England's planning been, in
conjunction with big American and other banks, that it has
published a series of primers that get down to such nitty-gritty
details as an hour-by-hour timetable for the weekend preceding Jan.
4, telling bankers just when to convert their dealings into euros.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bank of England figures, Euroland will create a
single, euro-based government debt market of $2 trillion _
four-fifths the size of the U.S. Treasury market. Starting on Jan.
4, all financial dealings among 11 governments will be conducted in
euros, even though the mandatory use of euro notes and coins out on
the street will not begin until Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Pension fund assets alone are projected to grow from $630
billion to $1.8 trillion by 2001. With a population of 290 million,
Euroland's gross domestic product was $6.28 trillion in 1997,
compared with $8.09 trillion for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Who will benefit most? If size and market share offer any clues,
London is hoping the very scale of its operations will maintain its
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, some 600,000 people flock to work in its 580 banks and
other financial institutions _ almost as many people as Frankfurt's
entire population of 650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Big American banks all have their continental headquarters here.
Even after recent job cuts, Merrill Lynch alone employs 5,600. J.P.
Morgan has 3,500. Here, American bankers say, they find the legal,
accounting and market expertise they need. ``The labor force is
London's greatest strength,'' said Richard Mahony, a spokesman for
J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Since they captured the market for eurodollars _ dollars held by
banks outside the United States _ in the 1960s, London's traders
have grown to control 30 percent of global foreign exchange trading
_ a higher proportion than New York _ and institutional equity
holdings are valued at $1.8 trillion. Indeed, so important is the
City to the British economy that by some measures, financial
services and related businesses contribute more than manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly trading regulations assure that ``banks know that when
they come to London, the cards won't be stacked against them,''
Clementi said. Many bankers like the lifestyle and relatively low
taxes, not to mention the ease of communication. ``The markets have
two languages _ English and American,'' one investment banker said.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Where London has been less loquacious is in the language of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Moving faster to introduce screen-based futures trading, the
Deutsche Terminborse, Frankfurt's futures market, has just this
year overtaken the London International Financial Futures Exchange
as Europe's prime derivatives market. German traders, too, are
seeking to supplant the key London interbank offered rate with a
new benchmark for futures trading _ the Euribor, linked to 57
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Across Euroland, new alliances are springing up as traders and
investors contemplate a new reality _ not just a single, European
marketplace, but a marketplace with no currency risk attached to
cross-border investments because there will be only one currency.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish and Danish bourses have struck a deal to create Europe's
first cross-border equities market. The German and Swiss
derivatives markets have fused into a cross-border electronic
trading axis that competes with London's once-dominant futures
exchange and is seeking to expand to include the French derivatives
market and to establish a link with the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we expected the euro to do was to create more
pan-European competition _ and, lo and behold, one of the first
signs of competition is competition between the financial
centers,'' said Shivers at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying for position reflects the wide perception that the
introduction of the euro will be far more than an exercise in
bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Whole patterns of trading are threatened. ``As the products
become more European, so must it be that the players will become
more European,'' said Clementi at the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of financial frontiers will mean that rather than
looking at individual companies based in, say, France or Belgium,
entire cross-border sectors, from automotive to pharmaceutical,
will be weighed. Debt market stalwarts, like the benchmark German
Bund, will be automatically redenominated on Jan. 4. Trade among
individual currencies has all but come to a halt since May, when
European authorities, making way for the euro, froze exchange
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The impending upheavals have made few headlines in recent weeks
as the financial world has been riveted by the meltdown in emerging
markets. Yet Euroland offers a tantalizing mixture of opportunity
and risk at precisely the moment when markets are nervously waiting
to discover just how far instability will spread.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, Europe offers traders two enormous new sources of
business: a huge increase in American-style old-age planning
through investment in equity markets and mutual funds, and a drive
toward privatizations, strengthening stock markets in nations where
financing has traditionally come from banks.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's internal squabbles could also produce
instability if the euro itself is weakened by them. And the jury
seems to be out on whether European retail investors, many of them
venturing into the market for the first time in recent years, will
be scared off by the current turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lure of the euro market has already begun to exert
its pull. On July 7, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche
Borse announced an alliance enabling investors to trade British and
German blue-chip companies as a projected forerunner to a
pan-European exchange with complementary regulations and a single
index.
</P>
<P>
   This ``strategic alliance,'' said Mark Brown of ABN-Amro, ``is
the most significant step so far toward a single, pan-European
stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month the London futures exchange announced that more
of its open-outcry trading pits would close in April, to be
replaced by electronic trading. The start of electronic trading had
been scheduled for June, but was pushed forward to counter the
challenge from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the European Central Bank will be based in
Frankfurt does not necessarily mean that the central financial
activity has to move at all,'' said John Foyle, a top executive at
the London exchange.
</P>
<P>
   London's drive to capture Euroland is at odds with the
politicians' reluctance to propel Britain toward adopting the euro.
And that could prove a serious weakness. Some analysts calculate
that by being priced in sterling, British stocks will be at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is a glaring divergence of business and government
interests: London's world of finance is hectically working out how
to adjust to the euro and two-thirds of British companies in a
recent survey favor signing up for the currency while the
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has suggested that Britain
will not join Euroland before 2002 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, a lot will change as the euro forces the
consolidation not just of businesses but of Europe's 35 regional
markets _ a trend reinforced by banks' reluctance to entertain the
high costs of trading on a multiplicity of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of the euro is to strip away national
borders,'' said John St. John, a managing director at Salomon Smith
Barney here. ``There'll be no necessity in a post-euro world to
have lots of regional stock exchanges. Trading will be where you
get expertise, liquidity and prices.'' &QL;

CLINTON ATTEMPTS TO SALVAGE PEACE TALKS FOLLOWING GRENADE ATTACK IN
ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton struggled on Monday night to
salvage stalled Middle East peace talks after a Palestinian grenade
attack on Israeli civilians made success seem less likely, senior
officials from all sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his team, guided
in large part by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, decided to use the
grenade attack as the justification for a dramatic negotiating
ploy, insisting the Israel would suspend negotiations on all issues
except for security, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, however, the committee on a safe passage for
the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza met, despite
Israel's public stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli position, one official said, is designed to push
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into ``the most specific
commitments possible'' to fight terrorism, in particular the
military wing of Hamas. The Israelis want Palestinian terrorism
suspects to be extradited to Israel, specific members of the
Palestinian security forces to be arrested and tried in Israel for
terrorist acts, reductions in the number of Palestinian police and
confiscation of unlicensed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 19 months of stalemate, Clinton and his
secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, decided that with the Oslo
process ending next May 4, it was vital for American interests in
the region to press both parties to finish this interim accord, so
talks on a final settlement could begin.
</P>
<P>
   These talks, in a bucolic setting 70 miles from Washington and
secluded from the press, have dragged on since Thursday. They were
originally scheduled to end with a signing ceremony at the White
House on Monday morning, but are now likely to continue into
Tuesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans have been pushing to complete this interim
accord, one official said on Monday night that it was becoming more
likely that some form of partial accord might be reached, to try to
``lock in'' the work already done here and avoid a complete
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned here for a unscheduled fifth day of meetings
with Netanyahu, Arafat and scores of aides and experts. He met on
Monday night with the two leaders, who had not met face-to-face
since they had lunch together on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing King Hussein of Jordan flew to his Maryland home from
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and was described as ``standing by''
to try to push the leaders toward a deal. Arafat also appealed by
telephone to the Israeli president, Ezer Weizman, officials said,
and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, was also in contact with
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after an appeal to the leaders from the White House
lawn to ``consider the consequences of failure and the benefits of
progress,'' plunged back into the talks here, presiding over a
45-minute meeting of security officials and experts from the
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu of about half an
hour, then a similar meeting with Arafat, before bringing the two
leaders together on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will then take stock and decide where we go from
here,'' a senior American official said on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to fly to California on Tuesday and remain
there on Wednesday, and his spokesman said that plan had not yet
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, called the grenade
attack ``a complicating factor,'' and said: ``It certainly makes it
more difficult for us to achieve what we were seeking to achieve.''
He conceded that it could narrow American ambitions to reach a full
accord here on all the interim issues and to restart talks on a
final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are difficult,'' Clinton said. ``The distrust is
deep. The going has been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said the president was, if anything,
understating the problems. ``The two sides do not deal with each
other seriously without an American in the room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another American official described the involvement of Clinton
as a form of drug for the leaders who have built up a tolerance for
lower-ranking U.S. officials like the special envoy, Dennis Ross,
or even Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why give concessions to Ross when Albright is there?'' the
official asked. ``And why give concessions to Albright when Clinton
is there?''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the official said, he is refusing to think that
success is impossible in these talks, designed to finish an interim
accord by which Israel will withdraw from another 13 percent of the
West Bank _ including a ``nature reserve'' of 3 percent _ in return
for phased and verifiable Palestinian steps to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli official said on Monday night that ``a lot of work
is being done in the security area'' with Clinton's involvement,
but he hastened to say: ``It's not yet enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's spokesman, said bluntly that
Netanyahu believes ``that this deed, this terrorist attack,
strengthens the Israeli position in the negotiations with the
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official rejected that view, saying: ``The
attack hasn't changed what the Palestinians are prepared to give.
But it has changed the dynamics today, and it's had a negative
impact on everyone's desire to bring this to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   The grenade attack at a bus stop in the southern Israeli city of
Beersheba occurred about 2 a.m., ET, as Clinton was returning to
the White House to sleep. Early on Monday morning, Arafat condemned
the attack and promised Netanyahu that the Palestinians would
investigate it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and his ``kitchen cabinet,'' including Sharon, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky,
decided that the attack required a public reaction from them here.
Netanyahu issued a statement in Hebrew saying: ``If the
Palestinians do not fulfill their commitments on security, an
agreement is impossible. I am insisting upon it at the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   He informed Albright that the Israelis would only talk formally
about security on Monday, and he dispatched his communications
director, David Bar-Illan, Bushinsky, and his ambassador to the
United Nations, Dore Gold, to the press center at Chesapeake
College here.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan said, ``There will be no other subject discussed other
than the subject of security.'' In fact, an official said, informal
talks on other issues did go on Monday, but only intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli mood, like the American, was one of impatience.
Later, an Israeli official said: ``We really have to get serious
here. We can't let it drag on. The Americans don't appear to be
pushing Arafat at all.'' While the Palestinians ``always agree to
the principle,'' the official continued, ``it's the specifics that
are always the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the Americans appear to be protective of
Arafat, taking ``too seriously his protestations of weakness.'' He
compared Arafat's strategy to that of the former boxing champion,
Mohammad Ali, known for leaning against the ropes and absorbing
blows, to drain his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official rejected the criticism. ``The
Israelis want everything and want to give us the barest minimum,''
the official said. He expressed concern that the Israelis were
``stalling,'' having still refused to provide maps that show the
precise areas of the 13 percent withdrawal and refusing to
guarantee that a third redeployment, as called for under Oslo, will
take place once final status talks begin.

   TUREN, Indonesia _ Shrieking triumphantly and waving bloody
sickles and knives, about 30 motorcyclists drove slowly through
town in a victory celebration. Onlookers cheered and the atmosphere
was half-exultant, like that of a carnival.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also half-terrified, because one of the motorcyclists
was waving a bamboo stake on which was impaled the head of a young
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allahu akbar!'' the motorcyclists shouted, waving their
sickles in celebration at having killed a man they regarded as a
sorcerer. ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
   The parade here in this remote farm town, 400 miles southeast of
the capital, Jakarta, was part of a ferocious hysteria that is
sweeping some remote parts of Indonesia. Communities are so
terrified of black magic that vigilante groups are forming daily to
seize, torture and execute anyone suspected of being a sorcerer.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions are easily aroused, and people are attacked because
they are outsiders, lack identification or cannot quickly convince
a mob that they have business in the area.
</P>
<P>
   At least 150 people, and perhaps many more, have died so far in
the frenzy, and law and order have broken down almost completely in
some areas. The convulsions have disrupted commerce, paralyzed
travel in places and underscored the risks of social upheaval as
Indonesia grapples with economic depression and a transition away
from political dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The upheavals are a challenge to the fragile government of
President B.J. Habibie, who took office in May when the country's
longtime dictator, Suharto, stepped down. Indonesian democracy is
still in its infancy, and many people point to the latest killings
as an ominous reminder that the last political transition here, in
1965 and '66, was accompanied by violence that cost hundreds of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle of killings began with the slayings of dozens of
Muslim leaders, for reasons that are probably political but remain
unclear. These killings are attributed to people with supernatural
powers, and now the villagers' efforts to avenge the deaths with
retaliatory murders have been exploding out of control. And in an
echo of 1965, the chaos has also stirred the occasional revenge
murder by people taking advantage of the unrest to settle a score.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil is on a far smaller scale than in the 1960s but it
is just as difficult to comprehend. The epicenter has moved to the
Turen area, where five people accused of sorcery were executed by
mobs on Sunday. One was beaten to death, one was burned and three
were beheaded, with the severed heads paraded along a 40-mile
route.
</P>
<P>
   Again on Monday at least three people in the area were killed.
Two had been seized from a police car by vigilantes who reportedly
slit their throats, and the third was the man whose head was
paraded on a stake. An hour after that parade, another group of
motorcyclists drove by slowly, cheering lustily and dragging the
man's naked, headless corpse behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ninja is dead!'' the lead motorcyclist shouted
exuberantly, as passers-by waved and shouted encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninja'' is the word given here to secret assassins who are
believed to be trying to kill Muslim leaders. The original ninja
were secret Japanese fighters hundreds of years ago, and
Indonesia's ninja apparently got the name because they are feared
for their stealth and strength. But they also are believed to be
sorcerers who can vanish or turn into animals.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is so tense and fearful that even the police stay
out of sight and let the mobs rampage. Anyone who seems out of
place risks instant execution at the hands of angry crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It begins when people try to chase someone suspicious,''
explained Sukiando, a 42-year-old rickshaw driver who said he was
in the mob that beheaded one suspect on Sunday. ``Sometimes the
ninja turns into a cat, and sometimes he stays human. If he stays
human, then they cut off his head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be more heads chopped off,'' added
Sukiando, who like many Indonesians uses just one name. ``Because
in every little area, there are seven or eight ninja who go out
every night, and they've got to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gather reliable information about the
killings, because the authorities and villagers alike are often
close-lipped about them. But interviews in several areas of the
eastern part of the main Indonesian island of Java suggest that the
situation is becoming tenser almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   In a vivid demonstration of the new lawlessness, young men in
many towns and villages in eastern Java have organized themselves
into armed patrols, especially at night, to catch ninja and kill
them. Senior police officials in this area said that they could not
comment, but one officer in the town of Kepanjen said nervously
that the situation was extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night it's like a curfew,'' he said, referring to the
area around his town. ``No one goes out and there are patrols every
20 meters. Last night I had to go out for a drive, and I was
stopped and checked every 20 meters by crowds of people. Even
though I'm a policeman, some guys asked for some cigarettes that
they saw I had, and I had to hand them over. They could do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that residents had turned in eight suspected
ninja to the police, who were holding them in jail. But he said
that the eight were simply mentally disturbed and did not possess
supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no ninja here,'' he said. ``There is no such thing
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, however, believe the killings confirm the existence
of ninja and the need for extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they parade the head around, it's not meant to threaten
people,'' said Mohammed Soleh, a 34-year-old vigilante who was
cheering the procession. ``It's just meant to show everyone that
ninja do exist and that we must be on alert.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The unrest began slowly a few months ago in the area around
Banyuwangi, on the eastern tip of Java near the resort island of
Bali. Well-organized groups of assassins dressed in black _ the
ninja _ began attacking particular targets, often Muslim leaders
affiliated with the country's largest Islamic organization,
Nahdlatul Ulama.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is an overwhelmingly Muslim country, and there is no
obvious reason that Nahdlatul Ulama, primarily a religious
organization, would be a target. Still, some political motive is
widely suspected, although there is great debate and uncertainty
about what it might be.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's leader, Gus Dur, who is widely venerated in
Indonesia, said over the weekend that top politicians _ including
Cabinet members _ were behind the attacks on Muslims leaders,
although he did not say whom he meant or how he had come to that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wiranto, the army commander and perhaps the most powerful
person in Indonesia today, visited eastern Java on Sunday and
pledged to curb the killings. But he declined to comment on the
accusation that senior politicians were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to send the country toward disintegration,'' The
Jakarta Post quoted Wiranto as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The army has sent some patrols into the area, and in daytime
there is nervous traffic that evaporates at dusk. The government
says that about 150 people have been killed so far, but unofficial
estimates are higher and some of the killings go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling political apparatus sometimes engaged in
extrajudicial killings during Suharto's days, and many believe that
some political or military forces are continuing the tradition,
either to eliminate Muslim critics or to sow chaos and create the
conditions for a coup.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of weeks, the killings have spread to
encompass most of East Java, and scattered attacks have been
reported in other parts of Java as well. But the pattern has
changed, so that often those doing the killing now are the mobs
trying to find the ninja.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody now is committed to the search for ninja,'' said
Warsidi, a 55-year-old man who was eating soup and noodles from an
outdoor stall, and who took a break to watch the severed-head
parade go by before resuming his meal. ``The ninja are trying to
kill the Muslim leaders, so before the ninja can do harm, local
people are fighting back.''
</P>
<P>
   Warsidi and other vigilantes were only slightly suspicious of a
foreign reporter, apparently the first foreigner to visit the area
since the mob killings, and they were generally courteous and
mild-mannered. Their politeness seemed incongruous, considering
that they were describing their plans to behead anyone who could
not satisfactorily explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   No foreigners are known to have encountered difficulties in East
Java, and most of the killings have been in rural areas that
foreigners do not usually visit. Places like Bali and Jakarta have
not been affected.
</P>
<P>
   However, one suspected sorcerer was attacked and beaten by a
huge mob in Surabaya, the hub of the region and Indonesia's
second-largest city. Local people became suspicious of the man,
rumors started, and he was chased down, tortured, and killed by
garroting.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier in Surabaya, an undercover policeman who was
wearing black was saved from a lynching only by running into a
police station. A mob attacked and damaged the police station, but
the man was saved.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one tell who is a ninja?
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like crazy men, and we also look to see if they have
any holy writing on them, because that would mean that they
practice black magic,'' said Bantur, a vigilante rickshaw driver.
</P>
<P>
   Bantur and his friends, who said that they had all been in the
mob that beheaded a sorcerer a day earlier, clustered around to
offer a few other telltale signs. One, they said, is a reluctance
to explain one's identity or an inability to explain one's purpose
in visiting the area.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in magical powers has always been fairly widespread among
Javanese living in small towns and villages, but with the decline
of strongman rule, there seems to be an increasing willingness to
attribute problems to a sorcerer's magic _ and to settle the
problem immediately by picking up a sickle. Few people doubt that
the ninja must be dispatched quickly, because of their ability to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I saw it with my own eyes,'' said Sutaryona, a
27-year-old member of a vigilante patrol. ``There were three ninja,
and when we shone a flashlight at them, they vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, vanishing is what anyone might try to do when
approached by a mob of angry men with sickles. But fleeing is
considered proof that one is a ninja.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the failure of the dead men to vanish in time
meant that they were not ninja after all, a group of vigilantes
took the question gracefully. They carefully explained that when a
Muslim leader is present and knows about the magic, the sorcerer
cannot use it.
</P>
<P>
   So, they concluded, a suspect's failure to disappear is also
proof that he is a sorcerer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the main victims of the violence were leftists and
ethnic Chinese, but that seems not to have been repeated here. The
government has suggested that communists _ the perennial targets of
Indonesian repression _ are responsible for the ninja killings, but
nobody seems to take that very seriously, and Chinese appear to
have been spared so far.
</P>
<P>
   There are constant sightings of ninja. Near the city of Pandaan,
for example, villagers claimed they saw two ninja who, when chased,
turned themselves into cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they killed the cats, but there was no blood at all,''
whispered Tantri Irawati, a 21-year-old woman wearing a Mickey
Mouse shirt and red polish on her fingernails and toenails. ``Every
night people are so scared! I used to go to the toilet outside at
night without any fear, but now I'm too terrified. I get someone to
walk me to the outhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   One person in the area, Choirul, a 19-year-old man who is
mentally retarded, supposedly was accosted by a ninja. His speech
is barely understandable, but he sat on his porch and _ helped by
his more voluble mother _ told how a man in black had grabbed his
arm and asked him a question.
</P>
<P>
   What question?
</P>
<P>
   Choirul will not tell anyone, even his mother, and that is taken
as further proof that the ninja must have been particularly
devilish. So the neighbors have stepped up patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we catch a ninja, we'll beat him,'' said Hadi, a
25-year-old neighbor who said he arms himself with a sickle each
evening. ``People don't want the ninja arrested. They want us to
kill him right away.''

DALLAS DOCTORS REBEL AGAINST AETNA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ohio, Fla., Ga., Conn.)   (jw) 
 BY PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the biggest rebellion yet against a health
insurance company, more than 400 doctors in Dallas have terminated
their contracts with Aetna Inc.'s health maintenance organization,
and Aetna has retaliated by cutting off their access to all its
Dallas patients.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nearly 30,000 patients covered by Aetna must accept
other doctors who remain under contract to the company. Or the
patients face paying the insurgent doctors cash for their care if
they choose to remain with them, at least for the three or four
months it will take the patients to sign up with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The patients are caught in the crossfire over disputes between
the nation's fourth-largest health insurance company and one of the
numerous doctors associations that have sprung up around the nation
to help doctors build contracting influence against the insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas and in many other cities, doctors bristle most about
Aetna and its health care company, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, with 16
million subscribers to its HMOs and other types of health plans.
``Aetna's perceived as the worst kid on the block,'' said Dr. Phil
Berry, an orthopedic surgeon in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, Aetna U.S. Healthcare's chief medical
officer, said that in Dallas, as in the rest of the country, Aetna
was enrolling physicians far faster than it was losing them.
``Overwhelmingly we have been successful in negotiating with
doctors,'' he said. ``But we won't agree with everybody, every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, like most managed care companies, has been struggling
with three years of sagging profits and pressure from the investors
to control costs. Among the leading companies, physicians say,
Aetna is the most aggressive in negotiating contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have quit Aetna HMOs in Ohio, too, and the Georgia
Medical Association says that disgruntled doctors in Atlanta are
threatening to follow. In Florida last summer, Aetna averted a
rebellion only after the state ordered changes in physician
contracts that it found were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of this past year, their posture was one of
`we don't have to talk to you,' '' said Nancy Gillette, a lawyer
for the Ohio State Medical Association, which sought to intervene
for doctors. Paul Shanor, executive director of the Georgia
association, said, ``What I'm hearing is take-it-or-leave-it
negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna executives attribute some of the tension to cultural
changes at the company that began only a few years ago. Aetna Inc.,
of Hartford, Conn., once a sedate, old-line insurance company, has
refashioned itself as a managed health care company and is
digesting two big HMO company acquisitions, U.S. Healthcare two
years ago and NYLCare this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're large,'' Leibowitz said. ``We're prominent. We went
through a transformation of our business.'' He said the mergers
``contribute to a sense of change and difficulty on the part of
physicians.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Dallas, where several big groups of physicians have been
feuding with Aetna for more than a year, this month's rebellion
involves the Genesis Physicians' Practice Association, which
negotiates and manages group contracts with scores of insurers that
provide health care for the employees of Dallas businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare's contract with Genesis covered 562
physicians who collectively assumed the risk for treating Aetna HMO
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis physicians said that to monitor the cost of care and
avoid losing money under the contract, especially for the HMO
members, they needed prompt access to the information that Aetna
gathers about the treatments, medications and trips to the hospital
that patients receive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the data would take weeks and months to obtain, doctors
said, and it was rarely satisfactory. Aetna has also been
chronically slow in paying doctors' claims, a charge supported by
the high numbers of complaints against Aetna that the Texas
Insurance Commission reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the most difficult payer for us to work with,'' said
Dr. Evan Bates, an ear, nose and throat surgeon who is one of the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz attributed problems with information flow to an
intermediary that participated in the Aetna-Genesis contract and
said that the flow is being restored. He said the company has
superb data processing technology. ``There isn't anybody that can
give the information that we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes have also arisen over language in contracts that
managed care physicians must sign with Aetna. The Texas Medical
Association cites Aetna Health Plans of Texas' standard, 17-page
``Specialist Physician Agreement'' in which the association has
identified 17 provisions that it finds confusing, offensive,
misleading or legally questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions is one requiring physicians to accept
contract terms, including those covering fees, that Aetna could
subsequently change. Another says physicians must abide by the
company's review decisions to approve or deny a procedure for a
patient; yet another declares that patient care is the ``sole
responsibility'' of the physician.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious, however, is a passage that physicians call
a ``gag clause'' because, they say, it discourages them from
telling a patient of all treatment options for a disease, whether
or not the insurer approves of them.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says the clauses are very rare, a view that the
General Accounting Office has confirmed. Nevertheless, section 1.3
of the Aetna Texas contract says physicians shall not ``imply to
members that their care or access to care will be inferior due to
the source of payment.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical association's analysis of the provision says, ``The
language would stop the physician from honestly dealing with the
patient if it will harm the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz did not defend the provision. ``We do not intend any
part of the contract to be construed as a gag clause,'' he said.
Asked why the contract included the provision, he said, ``It's a
fair point.''
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons and after months of negotiations, the
Genesis group broke its contract to treat Aetna's 8,000 HMO
patients. Then Aetna invoked an ``all products'' policy, rare among
managed care companies, that meant Genesis doctors who refused HMO
patients would be denied access to patients in all Aetna plans. As
a result, close to 30,000 Genesis patients are losing their Aetna
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with losing all their Aetna patients, some of the doctors
(140 according to Aetna, fewer than 100, according to Genesis) have
signed individual contracts with Aetna and are keeping their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The other doctors are armed with contracts with as many as 60
other plans, and they are betting that since they have left Aetna,
their patients will leave, too, join another plan and stick with
their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors say their rebellion against Aetna poses a test for
patients of their loyalty to the doctors. For those patients whose
employers permit it, a switch to another plan will not take effect
until Jan. 1 or later, so in the interim the patients will have to
find some other way to pay for their care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do risk losing somewhere between 8 and 15 percent of the
market, and we do risk breaking the physician-patient
relationship'' said Dr. Ralph Turner, a gynecologist and president
of Genesis. ``We're counting on patients to be more loyal to their
doctors than to an insurance company.''

RAIN AND MASSIVE FLOODING CONTINUE IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Stymied by persistent rain, authorities searched in
vain Monday for three children swept away by flood waters during
weekend storms that killed 14 people in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a fourth of the state, or 60 counties, have been hit by
flooding, authorities said, with thousands of people forced to
evacuate their homes. The worst damage occurred along a hilly,
90-mile stretch of Texas running between San Antonio and Austin and
reaching east to Houston. As officials readied disaster-relief
requests for the federal government, the continuing rain hampered
their efforts to clean up the damage and assess its cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 15 years, and I've never seen anything like
this,'' said Mark Hanna, chief deputy of the Caldwell County
sheriff's department, which was scrambling to cope with the
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the missing children had been passengers in a Chevrolet
Suburban that was washed from a low bridge Saturday in Caldwell
County.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, who was not identified, was able to grab a log and
paddle to safety with her 5-year-old son. But an 11-year-old girl,
described as a family friend, and a 7-year-old boy were washed away
with the vehicle, which was feared submerged in waters that in some
places were 30 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing was a 6-year-old boy who was swept from his
grandfather's grasp at about noon on Saturday in Comal County,
south of Austin, said Sheriff Bob Holder. Holder said the boy's
family had been trying to escape from their car, stalled on a rural
road northeast of New Braunfels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The water here rose so fast,'' the sheriff said. ``In 15
minutes it was a world of difference.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to search for the children by air were hampered by the
rain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rural area where the child was lost, and it's very hard
to get in with any equipment,'' Holder said. ``What we're going to
have to do is wait for the water to recede and get some people on
the ground to physically walk down the area where the water
went.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The continuing bad weather also led Gov. George W. Bush to
cancel a tour of the flood-ravaged areas Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only three months ago that we were praying for rain,''
said Bush. ``And now, we've got too much rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains over the weekend soaked an area from San Antonio to
Austin, and from to Houston and Victoria. On Sunday, the heaviest
rains shifted toward Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuero, which is southeast of San Antonio, residents were
being urged to evacuate, or at least pay close attention to the
Guadalupe River, which was already 3 feet over the record flood
level of 40 feet. It was rising at a rate of 6 inches every 15
minutes, said Jo Schweikhard Moss, a spokeswoman for the Texas
Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Record flooding was also being predicted by the National Weather
Service along the Colorado River. It was expected to crest at 31 or
32 feet at Smithville, with a new record of up to 46 feet at La
Grange.
</P>
<P>
   The state received disaster declaration requests Sunday from
Comal and Hays counties and the cities of Austin, San Marcos and
New Braunfels, officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 deaths over the weekend, 12 were related to the floods
and two were the result of tornadoes, Ms. Moss said. Since Saturday
about 7,000 people have been evacuated, with 5,300 of those seeking
refuge in shelters in 51 locations.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio area, which was deluged with 20 inches of rain
in a 24-hour period, was under a state of emergency Monday. Cleanup
was being hampered by continued rain. Looting was reported in both
San Antonio and Comal County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready for a break,'' said Holder, the Comal sheriff, who
said as much as 15.5 inches of rain was reported in his county on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and homes along the Guadalupe were devastated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a tornado came through here,'' he said. ``All
that's left are the cement foundations.''
</P>
<P>

GOVERNMENT LAWYERS SAYS GATES BULLIED AND COERCED TO GET HIS WAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates, Microsoft Corp.'s billionaire chairman,
personally led a campaign of illegal bullying, coercion and
predatory pricing to undermine a rival company whose products
threatened to become more popular than his own, government lawyers
charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Opening their long-awaited antitrust case against Microsoft,
lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 states
said that Gates feared a new generation of Internet-based
computing, led by Netscape Communications Corp., could strip
Microsoft's monopoly hold on a type of software that is crucial to
the current generation of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   According to government lawyers, Gates responded with an illegal
attempt to persuade Netscape to exit certain business lines that
would compete with Microsoft. When Netscape declined, the lawyers
said, Microsoft used predatory pricing to cut off Netscape's
income, and used its market clout in an illegal effort to turn
Netscape's business partners against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's executives acted like too many of our star
athletes today,'' said Steve Houck, the lead lawyer for the states,
in his opening argument in US District Court. ``Their attitude
permeated their corporate culture. ... They would break the rules
with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's arguments came in what has become the most
closely watched antitrust case since the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T Corp.
The case could decide whether Microsoft, the world's most powerful
software company, can extend its dominance to the potentially
lucrative fields of on-line banking, Internet commerce and
interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   Houck compared the case to the landmark suit that broke up John
D. Rockefeller's oil empire in 1911. ``Antitrust students will
doubtless be studying the Microsoft case well into the 21st
century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will present its opening arguments Tuesday. ``The
facts will show that Microsoft competes fairly, and that our
actions have brought substantial benefits to consumers and software
developers,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's top lawyer, on the
steps of the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft makes Windows, a type of software called an operating
system, which allows a computer to retrieve files, store data and
handle other basic chores. Windows has been hugely lucrative for
Microsoft, and it is now a crucial component of 90 percent of all
new personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the government said, Microsoft worried that so many
people were using computers to link to the Internet that another
type of software had become important. Called a ``browser,'' it
allowed users to view material on the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   By presenting internal Microsoft memos, the government portrayed
Microsoft as fearful that the leading browser, made by Netscape,
might become more important than Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was not in court Monday. But the world's wealthiest man
appeared during the government's opening arguments when lawyers
played segments of his videotaped deposition, in an attempt to show
that he offered something less than the truth about his company's
overtures toward Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a June 1995 meeting where Microsoft allegedly asked
Netscape to abandon most of the browser market, Gates said: ``I'm
not aware of any such thing. ... It would be against the way we
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said it was a Wall Street Journal article that first
informed him that some people interpreted that meeting as an
illegal attempt to divide the browswer market. He said he was not
paying attention to Netscape at the time of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But after playing the videotape, drawn from 20 hours of
depositions by Gates earlier this year, the lead lawyer for the
Justice Department, David Boies, presented a series of memos that
showed Gates was very concerned about Netscape at the time of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a very powerful deal of some kind we can do
with Netscape,'' Gates wrote in a May 1995 memo, just before the
key meeting with Netscape executives. The memo went on to lay out a
deal that, according to government lawyers, was similar to the
market-splitting arrangement that Microsoft officials eventually
offered to Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really like to see something like this happen!!''
Gates wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said that Microsoft, which spent millions of
dollars to develop its own browser as a rival to Netscape's,
eventually decided to give it to users free. The goal was to force
Netscape to do the same thing, depriving it of a key revenue
source. The government said this was a form of predatory pricing
that ultimately harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Microsoft tried to persuade Netscape's business
partners to withdraw support for the Netscape browser, the
government said. In early 1996, for example, Gates offered to pay
America Online to promote Microsoft's browser and not Netscape's
product. Notes by an America Online official of a January 1996
meeting say that ``Gates delivered a characteristically blunt
query: how much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape??''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to crush Netscape, Microsoft would not let
computer makers give consumers a choice of which browser to use,
Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Microsoft made its browser part of its Windows
operating system, ``bundling'' the two together as a single
product. Boies said Microsoft's action did not improve its product
or help consumers. The point, he said, was merely to hurt Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be decided by US District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson. The government has not said what remedies it will seek if
it wins the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the Redmond, Wash., company fell 2 1/8 to 10215/16.

COMPAQ UNVEILS 2 NEW SERVERS THAT USE SPEED ALPHA CHIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. made good Monday on its promise to
continue supporting and developing systems that use the speedy
Alpha chip acquired when it took over Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq unveiled two file servers _ computers that serve as the
hub of business networks _ that use a new, faster version of the
Alpha chip. They are the first servers using an Alpha chip sold
under the Compaq brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and Digital customers worried at the time of the
acquisition that Compaq's alliance with chip maker Intel Corp.
would result in the Alpha's eventual demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have some very large customers who are making
large investments in Alpha servers, and they were concerned about
the future,'' said Joan Gale, a product manager for Compaq's Alpha
servers.
</P>
<P>
   She said Compaq Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer sent letters to
Alpha customers promising continued support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Alpha going far into the future,'' said Gale. ``Alpha
is going to be in the picture for a minimum of 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The two new servers introduced Monday are designed for high-end
business and scientific use, and are priced accordingly. The
AlphaServer GS60, which can hold up to 6 new Alpha 21264 chips,
comes with four gigabytes of memory and is $199,990. The GS140
starts at $399,400 and can use up to 14 Alpha chips. The chips run
at a clock speed of 575 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Although these are the first Alpha-based servers with Compaq's
name, they actually were under development at the time of the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But Compaq is continuing to develop new versions of the Alpha
and new computers built around it. Compaq will offer products that
use a 750-Mhz version of the Alpha, called the EV68. A 1,000-Mhz
version, the EV70, is scheduled for release sometime in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's development of the Alpha puts it in direct competition
with Intel. Compaq also is Intel's biggest customer for its Pentium
family of processors.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpha is a 64-bit processor, an indication of how much
information it can work with at a time. Intel is developing its own
64-bit chip, that also will be available in 2000. The Intel Pentium
chips are 32-bit processors.
</P>
<P>
   Gale said Compaq will offer computers built around both the
future Alpha and Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dual chip architecture as a strategy, where we'll be
positioning both of those two chips,'' she said. ``There's a place
for both in our future.'' &QL;

TYSON WINS RIGHT TO FIGHT AGAIN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In a contrite and emotional appearance before the
Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mike Tyson Monday won back the
right to return to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-hour hearing at the Clark County Government Center
here, the commissioners voted, 4-1, to restore Tyson's license, 15
months after they revoked it because he bit both of Evander
Holyfield's ears in a heavyweight title bout.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing relieved that the ordeal was over, Tyson hugged his
wife, Monica Turner. ``It's just great,'' Tyson said at a news
conference shortly after the hearing. ``I'd like to thank the
Nevada commission for allowing me to be able to display my skills
again. I'd like to thank everyone that's supported me.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who supported the 32-year-old boxer in his quest to
resume boxing were two legendary athletes, Muhammad Ali and Earvin
(Magic) Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers star. Ali, suffering
from Parkinson's syndrome, had a prepared statement read to the
committee by his wife, Lonnie, in which he said he thought Tyson
should get his license back. ``I have made many mistakes in my
lifetime that cost me dearly,'' the statement read. ``Let this
young man earn a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali also said that he would be available to offer Tyson advice
whenever he seeks it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made an impassioned plea with the committee to give
Tyson his license back and insured the committee that he will
personally take a role in helping Tyson manage his finances and
become Tyson's mentor. Johnson said he and Jim Jimmerson, Tyson's
Las Vegas-based lawyer, will always be there for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the decision hadn't gone his way today, me and this
gentleman would have still been here for Mike,'' Johnson said
motioning toward Jimmerson who was standing beside him. ``We'll be
there long after his career is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson still must officially apply for his boxing license.
According to Marc Ratner, the Nevada Athletic Commission executive
director, Tyson must take an HIV test and a boxing physical and pay
$25 for his license. He has to do that 30 days before he fights.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to the ring, Tyson has little or no margin for
error in Nevada. In granting Tyson his license, Dr. Elias Ghanem,
the commission chairman, issued Tyson a stern warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mike Tyson has any more problems in the ring that he is
responsible for, he'll never fight in Nevada again,'' Ghanem said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson needs to fight before the end of the year in order to
settle a $13 million lien the Internal Revenue Service has placed
against his three homes. A Dec. 5 date has been set aside for Tyson
to return to the ring, but Tyson isn't so sure he'll make that
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm prepared to fight by the end of the
year,'' Tyson said. ``I've been going through a lot
psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has a promoter's license in California and New
Jersey and is close to getting one in Nevada, said he will not be
acting as Tyson's promoter. But he certainly sounded like one
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't selected any opponents yet,'' Johnson said. ``I
know you guys think he's going to go out and fight the best. I
don't care what you guys say in the press, we're not going to rush
Mike on this. Whoever it's going to be, it's going to be the best
opponent for Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Tyson's second hearing before the Nevada commission.
The first one on Sept. 19 was continued, because the commission
wanted Tyson to undergo a battery of psychological test by
independent psychologist and psychiatrists. Those test were
conducted by six psychologists and psychiatrists at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston from Sept. 21-26. Five of the doctors
who performed the test were on hand Monday to answer the
commissions questions. And as they had in their report, they
re-affirmed that Tyson was psychologically fit to return to the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the questions from the commissioners to the
psychologists centered on whether Tyson would be likely to repeat
the foul that he committed against Holyfield. Dr. Ronald Schouten,
the Director of Law and Psychiatry at Massachusetts General, said
the doctors didn't have ``crystal balls'' and could not foresee
what would happen in the future. But they believe with continued
psychotherapy, Tyson could manage and control his anger.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Turner said her husband has already set up a weekly
schedule with Dr. Richard Goldberg, a psychiatrist at Georgetown
University Hospital whom Tyson has been seeing off and on since
last December.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, dressed in a black sports coat, white shirt and black and
white checked slacks, was not grilled extensively by the commission
members on any of the hot button issues that had followed him into
this second hearing. Sitting between his wife and Jimmerson, Tyson
was relaxed for most of the hearing, often reaching over to whisper
in his wife's ear. Tyson planted a loud kiss on her forehead when
she was talking about the incident in Maryland where he allegedly
kicked one man in the groin and punched another in the chest
following an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he doesn't recall hitting anyone. From his
recollection one of the men went and lay down in the median after
Tyson had been screaming obscenities at him. Tyson said he has met
with both men and they have made their peace with each other.
Still, a Dec. 1 hearing in a Montgomery County court has been set
in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was irate, crazy, mad,'' Tyson said. ``I really said some
bad things to those people. They were afraid of this big, black guy
using street vernacular. It was a big ugly scene. If he says I did
it, maybe I was unconscious of doing it. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Nave, who had gall bladder surgery on Saturday, left his
hospital bed Monday morning to attend the hearing and returned
immediately afterwards, didn't think that Tyson had taken full
blame for his actions. Nave kept hammering Tyson about various
comments he had read where he said Tyson blamed referee Miles Lane
and Holyfield for leading to the biting incident. He said he
thought Tyson's actions were premeditated because the second bite
occurred some time after the first. Tyson said he has never blamed
anyone but himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was messed up,'' Tyson said, using an expletive. ``It's no
one's fault but mine. Some people are sheltered and protected, born
with a silver spoon in their mouth. They don't know what it's like
to be hungry and scared and have to have courage. They know who
they are. I am no schizophrenic and no manic depressant. I'm just
me. I represent people, pimps, whores, prostitutes. I always have
to be strong, because I never know who's looking at me.''

TEXAS CONGRESSIONAL INCUMBENTS RAISING, SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN
CHALLENGERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following form nationally, congressional incumbents from Texas
are raising and spending far more money than their challengers,
according to a report made public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington, D.C.-based, non-partisan research organization that
tracks money in politics and the role it plays in congressional
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on figures as of Oct. 1 from the Federal
Election Commission, which means most of the money in the report
was given between Jan. 1, 1997 and June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among top money-raisers in Texas was House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Irving, who raised $1.6 million and spent $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, raised $978,411 and
spent $615,435. DeLay's most generous givers were from the finance,
real estate and insurance sector, which gave about $180,000, Oil
and gas interests gave $54,000.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Democrat Hillery Thomas Kemp, raised $28,238, and
spent $21,815.
</P>
<P>
   Other Texas lawmakers who raised significant sums were Democrat
Martin Frost, of Dallas, with $1.2 million ($487,558 spent), and
Republicans Joe Barton, R-Ennis, with just over $1 million
($818,039 spent), Ron Paul, R-Surfside, with $1.1 million raised
and Kay Granger, R- Ft. Worth, with $783,131 raised.
</P>
<P>
   The report classified donations from individuals and political
action committees according to general business categories, such as
agriculture, defense, energy-natural resources, health,
transportation or miscellaneous and three other groups _ labor,
ideology/single issue and other.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC requires donations of more than $200 to list the
individual's employer and occupation, but donors often leave that
part of the disclosure form blank. When that happens, congressional
staffers sometimes use ``retired'' to fill in the occupation blank
to comply with federal elections law, said Larry Makinson, the
Center's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The ``retired'' category led the list of industries and interest
groups giving money to Armey.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other Houston area candidates; Democrats Gene Green,
Ken Bentsen, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Nick Lampson, or Republicans
Kevin Brady and Bill Archer, were near the million dollar mark in
money raised, with Lampson and Bentsen at about $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee topped the list for House members with the worst
donor disclosures to the Federal Elections Commission. Eighty
percent or $123,511 of her total individual donations of $154,824
lacked even vague information about the individual's employer and
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee raised $47,000 from labor interests and fellow
Democrat Nick Lampson raised $160,000 from that sector. Bentsen
benefited most from the finance, real estate, insurance sector with
about $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Archer was the only lawmaker of the group with more out-of-state
money than Texas money: $50,252 (76%) from elsewhere, $15,850 from
within the state. He also spent $145,864, while raising only
$112,849.
</P>
<P>
   Archer is chair of the influential House Ways and Means
committee that deals with the tax code. The finance, real estate,
insurance industry sector was Archer's biggest contributor group,
giving him almost $30,000; his next largest contribution came from
the health industry, at about $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear correlation between votes during the 105th
Congress and campaign contributions to individual members,
according to Jennifer Schecter, a researcher with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Frost received $10,000 and DeLay got $6,000 in the last election
cycle from defense manufacturer Northrop Grumman, which makes the
B-2 bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Frost and DeLay both voted against a move to cut off $331.2
million for the company to build nine additional bombers. The
Center staff cite the votes as examples of correlation between
votes and contributions. Texas tied for fourth among all states in
total money raised, with $30.7 million for political campaigns. Of
that, 56 percent went to Republicans, 43 percent to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was ninth among 50 metropolitan areas listed with $6.8
million, and Dallas was eighth with $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all incumbents got campaign contributions from oil and
gas interests, as did a number of challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, oil and gas contributions to parties and individuals
from both parties totalled at $14.3 million, with Republicans
getting $10.9 million (76 percent), and Democrats getting $3.4
million (23 percent). That amount earned the industry a No. 7
ranking for contributions from industry/interest groups. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Reflecting the unstable situation in
Kosovo, the Yugoslav army deployed two battalions of soldiers,
tanks and artillery in the province in the last 24 hours, Western
diplomats said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were sent out of their barracks after the Serb
authorities had said three of their police officers were killed on
Saturday night by guerrillas of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomatic monitors in Kosovo were showing increasing
concern that the guerrillas were taking advantage of an agreement
that demands that the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, reduce
his force levels in the province or face NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomatic monitor in Pristina, capital of Kosovo,
said the Yugoslav army and the Serbian police ``were fed up'' with
the guerrillas' sniper attacks over the weekend. The three officers
were killed in one such attack. ``The Serbs felt their police were
too exposed,'' the monitor said.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said the two battalions, around Kisna Reka,
where a large number of ethnic Albanians are camped in the hills,
and Podujevo, north of Pristina, were not among those that were
required to leave Kosovo under the terms of an accord between NATO
and the Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO extended its deadline, giving Milosevic until
Oct. 27 to withdraw seven battalions of the Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army. Milosevic is being required to pull back forces that
he dispatched specially to Kosovo in February to fight the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says he has removed two battalions
from Kosovo and returned them to Serbia, the republic that
dominates Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark, was due here
on Tuesday to tell Milosevic that he had to step up the
withdrawals. Clark would remind the Yugoslav leader that the ``use
of force still looms large,'' a spokesman for the National Security
Council, David Leavy, said.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of deploying the two battalions in the last 24
hours, Leavy said that the administration drew a distinction
between the use of troops against ``external threats'' and troops
used to ``repress their own people.'' Leavy said the deployment
``only further deepens the level of noncompliance.'' Despite
Clark's scheduled visit the threat of air strikes appeared, as a
practical matter, to have almost evaporated. Dozens of officials
from Washington, the United Nations and other organizations poured
into Belgrade and Pristina on Monday to start organizing a force of
up to 2,000 international monitors and to set up offices and
housing for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   It was becoming clearer, Western diplomats said, that the
original vision of 2,000 that was agreed to in talks between
Milosevic and the U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke, was too ambitious
and that a more realistic number was fewer than 1,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it was still not clear where the U.S. component of the
group, which is supposed to verify troop levels and the storage of
weapons, would come from.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president for international operations at Military
Professional Resources Inc., Ed Soyster, said his company, which
has trained and helped equip military units in Bosnia, was
discussing with the State Department sending a team to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Soyster said that the group in Alexandria, Va., staffed by
former U.S. military officers, had not been hired and that the
Clinton administration had apparently made no decision on whom to
recruit for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic monitors who were keeping a close watch on the
freshly deployed Yugoslav army units said the soldiers had
exercised some restraint. There were reports of shelling around 5
a.m. on Monday near Kisna Reka, the monitors said. But the question
was whether the battalion there would continue to be fairly
restrained and whether the guerrillas would provoke them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also worried about the size of the deployment. ``It's
a lot of firepower to remove a few snipers,'' said one diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment near Kisna Reka was the most serious, because
2,000 refugees are camping nearby in the open, despite the
increasingly cold weather. It was becoming more obvious, diplomats
said, that the guerrillas were encouraging the refugees, who are
camping about a mile or so in the hills above their village, to
stay outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats added that the families in the camp, where
handfuls of armed guerrillas are visible during the day on the
entry road, provide good cover for the guerrillas.

SCHROEDER'S CHOICE FOR ECONOMICS MINISTER SPURNS OFFER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Throughout his campaign for chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder portrayed himself as a pragmatic ``new'' Social
Democrat who would promote economic growth while strengthening
Germany's generous social welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes for that kind of happy balance collided with reality
Monday, when Schroeder's candidate for economics minister turned
down the job on the grounds that the ministry was being
eviscerated.
</P>
<P>
   The exit of Jost Stollmann, a self-made millionaire who started
a computer company, is the strongest sign that the new government
will be more left-wing than pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   The move also suggested that much of the political power in the
government lies with Oskar Lafontaine, the more left-leaning
chairman of the Social Democratic Party who will head the Finance
Ministry, which is acquiring new responsibilities from the
Economics Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder tapped Stollmann in the summer as his Economics
Minister, hoping to demonstrate his commitment to business, high
technology and ``modern'' policies. But Stollman, 43, quickly
infuriated many party members by criticizing the country's high
taxes and ``encrusted'' economic structure.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder hastily announced that Stollman's place would be taken
by Werner Muller, a former executive at Veba AG, the huge
industrial conglomerate. Muller told reporters Monday that he had
been surprised when Schroeder called him that morning to offer the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Stollman said, ``A balanced supply and demand policy must be the
basis for a turnaround on the jobs market.'' But he added that with
the coalition government that is being formed with the Green Party
``the conditions under which the government will have to start work
are not conducive to the real goals of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three weeks since Schroeder trounced Helmut Kohl at the
polls, Lafontaine has dominated economic policy, while reformers
like Stollmann have become all but invisible.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lafontaine who hammered out tax-reform plans that would
slightly reduce the sky-high tax rates but would substantially
increase the burden on businesses and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The plan infuriated business leaders. The Federation of German
Industry called it ``worse than everything we had feared.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also Lafontaine who committed the party to reversing laws
that had chipped at job protection and sick leaves. And dispensing
with the traditional German reverence for its conservative central
bank, he repeatedly attacked the bank's hard-money policies as a
principal reason for the high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Stollmann ran afoul of Lafontaine's desire to take
over important departments in the Economics Ministry that deal with
structural economic analysis and European affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said Stollmann's departure reflected the extent to
which the new government has marginalized pro-business pragmatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms what quite a lot of people suspected from the
beginning, which is that the Social Democratic Party is not a
reform party but rather a traditional left-wing party,'' said
Thomas Mayer, who tracks the German economy for Goldman, Sachs in
Frankfurt. ``They are picking up right where they left off in the
1970s.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stollmann was not the only economics reformer in Schroeder's
camp. Another potentially important player is the man who will
oversee the chancellor's office, Bodo Hombach. Previously the state
Economics Minister in North Rhine Westphalia, Hombach has spoken
out strongly for market-oriented changes and issued a startling
call this month for what he called ``left-wing supply-side
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel, Hombach said the
country needed to reform its welfare system and, perhaps, take some
lessons from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a model, not for its rigid deregulation of the
labor market, but for its active employment policy,'' Hombach said,
adding that even jobs at McDonald's could give people a second
chance for a career. ``We can no longer afford to finance long-term
unemployment instead of work.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice nobody seems to be listening. Schroeder has said
almost nothing about deregulating labor markets or pushing through
broad welfare reforms. Among the few concrete proposals to promote
jobs are expanding training programs and increasing incentives for
older workers to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the proposals have been to redistribute the supply of
work, but we've had programs to redistribute work for twenty years
and all we have is higher unemployment,'' said Kurt Vogler-Ludwig,
a labor economist with the Institute for Economic Research, a
nonpartisan organization in Munich that advises the government on
economic policy. ``What we should be doing is increasing the demand
for new workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders have become increasingly hostile to Schroeder
and threatened to boycott the chancellor-elect's call for
roundtable discussions among government, industry and the unions on
reducing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Though Schroeder won the election, Lafontaine still controls the
party machinery. When he appeared on the stage with Schroeder in
the campaign he often received more enthusiastic applause than
Schroeder.

 &HT;    Despite owners victory, NBA season still in doubt
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although the owners won an arbitrator's ruling on
guaranteed salaries Monday, rhetoric from the NBA Players
Association and the league suggests the NBA season is a long way
from starting.
</P>
<P>
   Union executive director Billy Hunter said membership is more
resolved than ever to close ranks in the wake Dean John Feerick's
finding that guaranteed salaries cannot be paid in a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   We find ourselves in the same position we were in yesterday,''
Hunter said, adding the end result of the decision is that it is
``forcing us to fight to get a fair deal. The players won't back
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter further suggested that the players would be able to
recover the money they miss during the lockout, now in its 112th
day including two weeks of the season. Our feeling is that (when)
salary is lost the NBA should have to make up the short fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, appeared stunned by
that point of view. ``They're not entitled to get paid for games
they didn't play. That issue is over and I don't see the owners
agreeing to pay for games that weren't played.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter accused said the owners are emboldened because they are
receiving revenues from NBC and Turner Broadcasting even though
there are no games.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern countered that ``the advance on TV
revenues is a loan. We still stand ready to meet with the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   These points of conjecture show how far apart the two sides
stand today.
</P>
<P>
   The players are going to Las Vegas to have what Hunter called an
informational meeting Thursday after an executive session on
Wednesday. He said many of the game's top players, including
Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Shaquille O'Neal and Karl Malone,
would be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   NBA Commissioner David Stern said he could not understand why
the players were going to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (ruling) should have been a signal that we return to the
table today. Instead, the players are being told by their union to
miss another week of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik added, ``If the players won't come to the bargaining
table (the Feerick ruling) does us no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the owners committee would be in New York next
Tuesday to discuss several matters, including the cancellation of
more games. Another round of negotiations could start then. So far,
all games from Nov. 3 to Nov. 16 have been dropped from the
schedule, a total of seven games, or 1/12th of the season for most
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the union might decertify as it did in 1995 with the
aim of bringing new negotiators to the table in search of a deal,
Hunter was dismissive. Stern, however, was adamantly against,
saying, ``Unfair labor practice charges, arbitration,
decertification, anti-trust suits don't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has the option, however, of declaring an impasse,
opening its doors and announcing that camp is open, giving players
an opportunity to bolt the union. Then, if the players decline to
come in, the league could accuse them of striking.
</P>
<P>
   The only area in which there was agreement dealt with the danger
of antagonizing fans, Hunter saying ``the product may suffer
irreparable damage. If fans are turned off, the fact that the
players miss a few dollars won't matter because the long term
future (of the league) will be damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Corbin, a Hawks free agent and member of the union
executive board, echoed Hunter's sentiments on the resolve of
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it' s been pretty clear since the middle of September
that we want to go to work. But I also believe we're unified in
that we won't accept a hard cap. We already have a salary cap. But
in a lot of areas they do have control. We can't be responsible
(for cost controls) and share in the profits of the game. If they
have something else to offer they should do so.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the ramifications of the decision, he said, ``This puts
us back to where we were July 1. I'm sure that's what guys will
want to talk about when we meet (Wednesday and Thursday) in Las
Vegas.''

 &HT;    Board gives Tyson OK to fight
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boxing's all-time champion of pay-per-view and pay-per-chew on
Monday regained his license to earn millions. But whether Mike
Tyson can return to prominence in the heavyweight division is far
less certain than his ability to return to wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who owes $13 million to the IRS and several million to
present and former attorneys and representatives, may earn a living
again after regaining his boxing license from the Nevada Athletic
Commission by a 4-1 vote. The former heavyweight champion hasn't
fought in 16 months, since he took two bites out of Evander
Holyfield's ears in their title fight in Las Vegas, leading to a $3
million fine, a license revocation and the loss of $30 million to
$50 million in potential purses.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who pleaded with the commission to ``not torture me any
longer,'' could return to the ring as early as Dec. 5 against one
of five opponents: Lou Savarese, Frans Botha, Axel Schulz, Vaughn
Bean or Shannon Briggs. But Jay Larkin of Showtime, which will
distribute the fight on pay-per-view, said the one month
postponement of Tyson's relicensing so that he could be evaluated
by a team of physicians could push the bout back to January.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was warned by commission chairman Elias Ghanem that he was
being given a ``last chance'' to avoid WWF tactics in the ring;
otherwise, he would risk being banned permanently by the state. But
while the disqualification, consecutive losses to Holyfield and an
8-3 record in the 1990s have dented Tyson's former shield of
invincibility, the deterioration of skills hasn't affected his
marketability. Even the MGM, which had to shut down its casino for
two hours because of a riot after the bite fight and lost millions
as a result, already has maneuvered to bring Tyson back into the
fold.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's biggest potential money fight is a third meeting with
Holyfield. Holyfield reiterated Monday that his immediate goal is
to unify the championship with a fight against Lennox Lewis,
probably in March. But he left the door open to another fight with
Tyson ``in 2000'' if promoters pay him ``a lot higher than $40
million,'' a figure that had been circulated in the media.
</P>
<P>
   When initially asked about Tyson, Holyfield said, ''Right now, I
don't want to be placed in a position to take anything away from
the Lennox Lewis fight. That's the most important thing out there
for me, and I need to be focused on it.''

   But when pressed, Holyfield said a third meeting with Tyson
''will be determined by the people. People's perspective might
change depending on how Tyson looks. If he raises a lot of hoopla,
then people will say, 'Come on, give him the fight.' But if I do
that, the money is going to have to be more substantial than $40
million. I would be looking to do something no athlete has ever
done before. I'm not going to put a limit on it, but it would have
to be way up there. The way I look at it, they're going to put
Tyson in situations where he's knocking people out, and a lot of
people's mouths are gonna be dripping. Their appetites are going to
be wet. I'll be all ready to retire and they'll say, 'Oh, come on,
just one more fight.' All of these stories will be written. Well,
if the people want it, whether they say I'm greedy or not, the
money's going to be very substantial. (The year) 2000 is the year I
said I wanted to (retire) anyway. If I go out and beat him again in
2000, it would be a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has always supported Tyson being relicensed and said,
''They had no reason not to give it back to him. The man did
everything they asked him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Only commission member James Nave voted against the relicensing.
Tyson hugged supporters after the decision, including Magic Johnson
(a would-be promoter) and Muhammad Ali, whose wife, Lonnie, read a
statement by him saying: ''There are only a few punishments worse
than being denied a right to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to be resolved are promotional obligations Tyson may have
with Don King, whom he is suing for $100 million. King released a
statement in support of Tyson but would not address his business
relationship. Also pending are misdemeanor assault charges against
stemming from an auto accident in August. Tyson denies kicking one
and punching the other, as charged.
</P>
<P>
   When the commission asked Tyson about his ability to control his
temper, he reponded, I'm not going to kill anybody. I'm not a mass
murderer.''

 &HT;    Playing with a passion
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The first one was just a play-action bootleg. The safety bit
up on a fake and I'm backside with No. 5. Joe (Hamilton) just hung
it up there, and I made a move on the DB.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dez White on his 69-yard touchdown catch in the first half in
Georgia Tech's 41-38 win over Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In reaching the top of his game, Georgia Tech
sophomore receiver Dez White has relied on something more than the
usual hard work and athletic skills.
</P>
<P>
   White is a 19-year-old so confident in his spirituality that he
throws his hands and eyes skyward with every big catch. He plays
with a passion that is about more than just winning.
</P>
<P>
   In six games, White has gone from nervous freshman to star _ and
the difference in Georgia Tech's 41-38 win over then-No. 7
Virginia, the football team's biggest win in eight years. His
performance Saturday, with two touchdown catches in the final eight
minutes on plays of 35 and 54 yards, to go along with his 69-yard
touchdown catch in the first half, was amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dez White was exceptional,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   The skills White is showing can be traced to natural-born speed,
a rapport with quarterback Joe Hamilton, confidence, hard work and
passion. The passion comes from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone's heart was going to have a tough time with the
amusement-park ride of Saturday's game, it was Desiree White's.
</P>
<P>
   Dez White's mother had kept her health problems quiet for the
past six months, but at the Georgia Tech-Duke game on Oct. 4 she
suffered an episode in which she said she passed out after her
heart started racing. She was tended to by paramedics and said
afterward she was fine, but she has stayed home from work since, on
orders from her doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors aren't sure what's ailing her, White said, and what
she knows she's not willing to share completely with Dez and his
older sister, Chrystalyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enough to be concerned about,'' said Desiree White, who
was to be put on medication this week and plans to attend the
Florida State game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a fly (route). The first time I ran the play, the
safety came on a blitz and I changed my route. The second time
(backup quarterback) George (Godsey) threw over to David Powell. I
told coach (Ralph) Friedgen, 'Run it again; I'm open.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ White on his 35-yard touchdown catch with 8:13 left to cut the
Virginia lead to 38-33
</P>
<P>
   White learned about hard work from his mother, and that's what
has helped him move from struggling freshman to the answer for
Georgia Tech's receiver problems, after the departures of Harvey
Middleton and Derrick Steagall.
</P>
<P>
   White has 31 catches for 775 yards and eight touchdowns. His 243
receiving yards against Virginia broke Steagall's single-game
record of 223 yards. He needs one more touchdown to tie the school
record for touchdowns receiving in a season. He's second in the
nation in yards per catch (25), third in receiving yards per game
(129.17) and fourth in all-purpose yards per game (193).
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the seventh grade, White went to the private Bolles
School in Jacksonville, Fla., a 25-minute drive from his home in
Orange Park and played soccer and football and ran track. Desiree
White worked a full-time job as an auditor for Blue Cross/Blue
Shield and part-time on the weekends as a home health-care worker,
to pay the nearly $7,500 annual tuition for each of her two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched her work two jobs and put herself through so much to
put me and my sister in the top school,'' White said. ``I've always
promised myself I would make something of my life and make hers a
lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a simple slant. Joe's first read was to go to the other
side, but he decided to come to me. I caught it and found some open
field. Kelly (Campbell) threw a block; then Joe (Burns) threw
one.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dez White on his game-winning 54-yard touchdown catch
</P>
<P>
   Dez is short for Dezmon. The first three letters come from his
mother's name, the last three from his father's name: Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   His parents split when White was a toddler; his father moved to
California, while his mother took her two children to Florida. ``He
was into things I didn't want around the children,'' Desiree White
said. ``He was a heavy drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   White's father apparently had straightened himself out by the
time Dez was 8 and had been in touch with his son by letters, but
within weeks he was shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dez) was to see his dad on June 14; his dad was killed on May
14,'' Desiree White said. ``The first time he saw his dad from the
time he was 2, he was in a casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't understand why he didn't get a good relationship
with his dad,'' she said. ``My one concern with Dez was that he
always understand there's a consequence in life to things you do.
Things his dad did may have caused his death. His dad's life had
changed. It's up to him to carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary calls White a ``class kid'' and one of the hardest
workers on the team. He is a good student and a spiritual leader on
the team, in a position where he's matched up with the best in the
nation, such as North Carolina cornerback Dre Bly and Virginia
safety Anthony Poindexter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blessed,'' Desiree White said. ``He has been the
highlight of our family. He's either going to do it right or not at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   White has taken strength from his Christian faith since he was a
child, but he said it has intensified in his college life and shows
in his confidence on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who I'm playing for,'' White said. ``It's not the
crowd, not the fans, but the one who gave me my talent.''
</P>
<P>
   White keeps his mother's health in his prayers and is happy
because she plans to attend the Florida State game. With the
excitement she felt last week, Desiree White might as well have
been in Bobby Dodd Stadium anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have almost sawed my head off with ceiling fan
blades,'' Desiree White said. ``I'm not missing another game.''

 &HT;    Mumme does end-around on Wildcats' usual mediocrity
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the conservative SEC, Kentucky coach Hal Mumme
stands out as a riverboat gambler, an elegant swashbuckler who
won't hesitate going on fourth down or devising any number of
tricks to confound conventional strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Valdosta State coach didn't think his end-around
call that led to the winning field goal in Saturday's last-second
victory at LSU was all that extraordinary. A 38-yard run by former
LaGrange High star Quentin McCord on a long third-down play was
designed simply to get Kentucky out of its half of the field and
prevent the Tigers from having a chance to win in regulation. But
McCord, getting solid blocking around the left end, motored easily
through a vast expanse in midfield to reach the LSU 33.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Seth Hanson booted a 33-yard field goal as time
expired to give Kentucky a 39-36 triumph, and the Wildcats finally
shook a rap that they couldn't win a big game in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't consider it a gamble,`` Mumme said about ``The
Call,'' as it is being described around Lexington. ``We didn't know
we were going to get that big a gain. We were just trying to get a
first down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was McCord, a redshirt sophomore who sat out last season with
academic problems, who took the play farther than even Mumme
intended. ``When Coach gave me the call, I was thinking score,''
McCord said. ``LSU has a fast defense, and I just wanted to get by
them and keep the ball in the middle of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, which already has matched its five wins from last
season, hosts No. 11 Georgia Saturday with a chance to clinch its
first bowl trip since the 1993 Peach Bowl. The LSU win was just the
fourth on the road in the Tim Couch era, with previous victories
coming at Louisville in the season-opener and last year at Indiana
and Vanderbilt. And it takes the sting out of a heartbreaking loss
at Arkansas two weeks ago that had fans wondering if they could
make good on the exploits of their flashy, risk-taking offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since people have been looking at
football like this around here,'' said junior tackle George Massey,
part of a gradually improving defense that held LSU rushing star
Kevin Faulk to 67 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are 5-2 for the first time since 1984, and the win
at LSU was their first road victory against a ranked opponent since
1977. They won't leave Lexington for another month, with home games
against Mississippi State and Vanderbilt and an open week on tap
before they close out the regular season at Tennessee on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to win is going to help give the kids confidence,''
Mumme said. ``But you have to play every week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats gave up just 342 total yards Saturday and got a
defensive score for a fifth straight game when they returned a
blocked PAT attempt for two points. Still, LSU twice recovered from
14 down in the second half to tie the score with less than two
minutes remaining, and the game appeared headed for overtime when
Mumme quickly took advantage of an LSU time-out to set up the
end-around.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing Mumme seems to be reluctant to do is view
Saturday's win as a statement that Kentucky has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to evaluate seasons until they're over,'' he said.
``This is one of the better wins I've ever been associated with,
but I won't take it any further than that right now.

 &HT;    DeBerg recovers after shaky start
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons reserve quarterback Steve DeBerg got
off to a shaky start in relief of Chris Chandler in Sunday's 31-23
win over the Saints, but coach Dan Reeves is OK with that.
</P>
<P>
   On the Falcons' first possession, he was slow getting a handoff
to Jamal Anderson, and when New Orleans defensive tackle Wayne
Martin scooted past right guard Gene Williams and grabbed DeBerg,
the play ended up a safety.
</P>
<P>
   That reduced Atlanta's lead to 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't get any better later in the third quarter, as the
Falcons lost 15 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   But DeBerg, who retired in 1993 before jumping back into the
fray this season, got straightened out. He ended up completing
7-of-10 passes for 60 yards, an 8-yard TD pass to FB Bob Christian,
and a couple other big plays.
</P>
<P>
   His arm is not as strong as Chandler's, he's not as accurate,
he's slower, and his release isn't as quick. But DeBerg is as
cerebral as they come.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made three big plays,'' Reeves said. ''Once he got into the
flow, he was fine. If he has to play (in Sunday's road game against
the Jets), he'll be prepared, and hopefully put us in a position to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kudos
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said rookie RT Ephraim Salaam played his best game. When
rookie T Jose Portilla replaced Salaam in the fourth quarter, it
was merely because coaches want him to get some playing time. . . .
DE Chuck Smith played his best game of the year against the run,
with a team-high 11 tackles, two for losses. . . . CB Ray Buchanan
spent most of the day in single coverage on Saints WR Andre
Hastings, who had one catch for nine yards. Buchanan also defended
three passes, stripped Saints QB Billy Joe Tolliver of the ball,
one of three fumbles Atlanta recovered, and made five tackles.
Reeves agreed with the roughing-the-passer call against Buchanan,
but thought the pass interference call should have gone against
Hastings. . . . FS Eugene Robinson (nine tackles, 25-yard
interception return) also played well. The 35-year-old, 14th-year
veteran leads all active NFL players with 50 interceptions. ''We
are no fluke,'' he said. ''We're going to give the fans something
to smile about other than just the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Anderson
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will be going for a franchise-record fifth straight
game with 100 or more yards. After rushing 25 times for 132 yards
Sunday, he leads the NFC and is third in the NFL (behind Terrell
Davis and Natrone Means) with 644 yards. He's averaging 4.4 yards
per carry, and has four TDs. And Anderson has played one less game
than a lot of backs
</P>
<P>
   He has 90 percent of the Falcons' 716 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest percentage of rushing yards any player had for a
Reeves-coached team was 64.5, when Rodney Hampton had 1,182 of the
Giants' 1,833 rushing yards in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Magnificent Martin
</P>
<P>
   WR Tony Martin, who caught seven passes for 116 yards, and a
45-yard TD pass from Chandler, expects more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each week you get more comfortable,'' he said. ''I'm not
surprised by the way (Chandler throws the ball). He doesn't do it
by luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin leads the Falcons with 27 catches for 492 yards (seventh
in the NFC, and good for an 18.2-yard average), and has three TDs.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons why
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has been outgained in four of six games, including
Sunday, when the Saints had 322 yards to the Falcons' 303. So how
are the Falcons 5-1? They lead the NFL in average time of
possession (33:06), and are second with a plus-eight turnover
margin, trailing the 6-0 Vikings (plus-nine). Their wins have come
against teams that are a combined 7-25.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons distributed 61,683 tickets for the Saints game, and
there were 4,431 no-shows (or 7.2 percent), leaving an actual
attendance of 57,252. That's the most tickets distributed since an
Oct. 1995 sellout against Dallas (70,089), and it continues an
upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   For the home opener against the Eagles, the Falcons distributed
47,554 tickets, had 6,289 (13.2 percent) no-shows, and an actual
crowd of 41,265. For the Oct. 4 game against Carolina, Atlanta
distributed 52,127 tickets, had 6,937 (13.3 percent) no-shows, and
an actual crowd of 45,190.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Falcons averaged 46,928 tickets distributed, and
7,087 (15.1 percent) no-shows, and actual attendance of 39,841.
</P>
<P>
   They're averaging 53,788 distributed this year, with 5,885
no-shows (10.9 percent), with an average actual crowd of 47,902.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have sold about 54,000 tickets for the Nov. 15 home
game against San Francisco, and lower level seats are sold out. On
the flip side, sales for the next home game, Nov. 1 against St.
Louis, are lower than all other remaining home games.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons occasionally switched up their defensive line,
swapping right DE Smith and right DT Shane Dronett to the left side
and moving DE Lester Archambeau or John Burrough and left DT Travis
Hall to the right. Also, the Falcons occasionally ran a version of
the zone blitz, with defensive a defensive lineman dropping into
short pass coverage. . . . Reeves said CB Darren Anderson, who was
inactive Sunday, could be active next week after rookie CB Elijah
Williams gave up a long TD pass for the second week in a row, this
time an 82-yarder to Keith Poole. Williams was in the Falcons' dime
defense because of a back strain suffered by starting CB Ronnie
Bradford, whose status is questionable.

 &HT;    HBOC, medical field share growth, changesBy Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ HBO &AMP; Co., the company heading the flank that brought
the information technology revolution to the health care industry,
made its money and its name through aggressive acquisitions and
strong management.
</P>
<P>
   Three outside factors also helped propel its growth from a
company with $175 million in revenues to an industry leader that
took in $1.2 billion last year: the increase in managed care, more
mergers in the health care field and people's concern over rising
costs.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. said Sunday it had agreed to be bought in a stock swap
by McKesson, a San Francisco-based drug wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fitzgibbons, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, said
recently that HBO &AMP; Co. has no weak spot. The stock has appreciated
more than 1,300 percent since 1997. Its management is respected.
Integrating software from newly acquired companies is one of its
few challenges, he said. The company's products allow doctors who
are in the same health care group but working in different offices
access to the same patient information.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. grew, in part, by buying its competition: more than 15
companies between 1993 and this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, doctors offices, hospitals and health care groups
are expected to buy $17 billion worth of information technology
this year.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co.'s products turn a doctor's traditional paper-pen-based
files into electronic files stored on a computer hard drive. The
software programs can be interactive, prompting doctor's when test
results are expected back and, based on the results, what follow-up
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The need started increasing a few year's back, when Americans
started worrying about the rising cost of health care. What
Americans spend on health care shot from about 9 percent of the
gross domestic product in 1980 to 13.6 percent in 1996, according
to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing prevalence of managed care further drove the
industry. Managed care forces doctors to be concerned about
insurance coverage and what it does and does not pay for.

 &HT;    Stocks prices take a tumble after merger announcement
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of HBO &AMP; Co. and McKesson Corp. tumbled Monday
as questions were raised about the strategic fit between the
Atlanta-based health-care software company and its future partner,
the nation's leading pharmaceuticals distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger of the two, announced Sunday, will create a
new company, called McKesson HBOC, based in San Francisco, with
annual revenues of more than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. and McKesson touted the merged company Monday as the
leading health-care services firm, with a customer base that
includes 5,000 hospitals, 25,000 retail pharmacies and 35,000
physician practices.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues and profits will grow from salespeople cross-selling
the other company's products to customers, the companies said. And
earnings per share should grow at an annual rate of 35 percent,
added Mark Pulido, McKesson's CEO, who will hold that same position
with the new company.
</P>
<P>
   That growth rate should attract investors, said Charles McCall,
CEO of HBO &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts questioned whether the pairing would achieve the
revenues envisioned_ and whether HBO &AMP; Co. was selling at too low a
price. Several downgraded HBO's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is more financial engineering than real strategic
synergy,'' said analyst Charles Trafton of Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill.
McKesson, the No. 1 U.S. drug wholesaler, fell $12 11/16, or 14
percent, to $76 on Monday, while HBO, the largest software supplier
to the health-care industry, fell $4 3/8, or 15 percent, to $25
1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in HBO &AMP; Co. were the most active on U.S. exchanges, with
about 51.4 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, McKesson plans to give HBO shareholders
0.37 McKesson shares for each HBO share.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decline in McKesson's share price cut the value of the
acquisition to about $12.4 billion from more than $14 billion,
based on Friday's closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Trafton, who downgraded HBO &AMP; Co. from a ``Buy'' rating to
``Neutral,'' added: ``Strategically, why is HBO selling at this
ridiculously low valuation?... If I'm McKesson, I'm jumping up and
down, buying this company (at this price.)''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Steven Halper of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, who also
downgraded HBO &AMP; Co. from ``Top Pick'' to ``Market Perform,''
added, ``People don't see a great fit there.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger, subject to regulatory and shareholders' approval, is
expected to be concluded in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido and McCall, who will be chairman of the new company,
predicted the merger would produce synergies of $75 million in the
first year, including from cost savings and cross selling.
</P>
<P>
   One example of cross selling would be HBO &AMP; Co.'s sales force
helping to sell McKesson's robot-powered pharmacy delivery and
inventory management systems to acute-care hospitals that already
are supplied software by HBO &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term, the companies could build powerful synergies from
leveraging their financial and clinical information, said analyst
David Francis of Volpe Brown Whelan. Until then, though, the two
companies would operate as very different businesses, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, they sell to the same customers, but to a completely
different constituency within the customer,'' Francis said. A
hospital information systems officer can buy a computer system, but
isn't involved in pharmaceuticals distribution, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and Trafton noted the deal was essentially the same as
one proposed in July between the two companies. That merger plan
collapsed when word leaked out and HBO &AMP; Co. shares plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think HBO got a good price,'' said Francis, who also
downgraded HBO &AMP; Co. stock from ``Buy'' to ``Hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculated the reasons for the low price could reveal
doubts about HBO &AMP; Co.'s long-term growth potential. Francis also
noted that McCall, 54, has said he planned to retire soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to exit in a strong way,'' Francis said. ``His
(McCall's) father passed away while he was young.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. investor relations official Beth Dalton said McCall
would remain actively involved in the initial work of McKesson
HBOC. ``But over time, he will probably not be as active,'' Dalton
said.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson and HBO &AMP; Co. said they renewed their acquisition talks
last week, shortly after Cardinal Health, McKesson's largest
competitor, announced an acquisition of its own. Cardinal Health
plans to buy Allegiance Corp., which provides medical supplies and
cost-management services to the health-care industry, for about $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of McKesson and HBO &AMP; Co. approved the acquisition
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, the board of McKesson HBOC will
consist of five members from each company.

SEC CHAIRMAN IS CAUTIOUS ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said on Monday that proposals to help shore up Social
Security by looking for higher returns in the financial markets
risked leaving inexperienced investors vulnerable to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Wading into what is likely to be one of the most intensely
debated issues of the coming year, Levitt emphasized that he was
not endorsing any of the options for shoring up Social Security in
advance of the baby boomer generation's retirement. But he noted
that nearly all of the plans involve allowing individuals to invest
part of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds or permitting the
federal government itself more latitude to invest the retirement
system's trust funds, which are now held in special Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches hold considerable implications for oversight of
the markets, and Levitt said that the SEC intended to play a role
as Congress and the Clinton administration work on a plan. Earlier
this year, President Clinton said that he would convene a White
House conference on Social Security in December and that he would
like to send a proposal to Congress early next year.
</P>
<P>
   That debate will play out against a background of extraordinary
volatility and uncertainty in the global financial system and the
markets. The effects of the market's gyrations on public acceptance
of any option for Social Security are not yet clear, and Levitt
noted the development only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he focused on broader long-range issues. Giving 140
million working Americans the right and responsibility to invest
part of their Social Security payroll taxes on their own would
require increased vigilance against fraud, he said. It would also
require vastly increased education for investors about how the
markets operate and about the risks and costs of investing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And permitting the government to invest the trust funds, he
said, would require careful consideration of Washington's role as a
shareholder and the potential for political interference in
corporate governance, investment selection and the operation of the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to think long and hard about the
implications of Social Security reform,'' Levitt said in the
prepared text of a speech at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University. ``Investing Social Security in
the stock market, by its very nature, involves heightened
obligations, difficult questions and new challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that opponents of such individual accounts will try to
make the possible greed of brokers and fund managers the issue,
Wall Street has remained mostly on the sidelines as the nation has
begun debating what changes to make in Social Security, which is
projected to run short of money to pay retirement benefits in 2032.
</P>
<P>
   Moving toward individual accounts, however, could create a huge
new business for financial-services firms and set off intense
competition for the right to help manage the retirement finances of
nearly every working person.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Levitt said, any move to give individuals a broad
choice of options in how to invest their Social Security
contributions would require regulators to step up efforts at
investor protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to have self-directed individual accounts, we must
be ready to undertake an unprecedented level of broad-scale
policing of the equity markets,'' Levitt said. ``Without such
policies, fraud and sales-practice abuses may be perpetrated
against an army of novice investors. And many of those novice
investors are our society's most vulnerable citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the experience in Britain, where the government gave
individuals considerable freedom a decade ago to choose how to
handle their pensions. Some workers were besieged with sales
pitches for annuities and other products that proved riskier than
advertised, and when those investments went wrong they caused
billions of dollars in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Should the United States move toward individual accounts, Levitt
said, he would be concerned about people being confronted with
advertising infused with ``performance hype'' that could create
unrealistic expectations about returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot afford to instill in millions of new
investors a culture of seeking short-term gain at the expense of
long-term solid results,'' he said. ``That is not what Social
Security is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said that more than half of Americans do not know the
difference between a stock and a bond, and that only 16 percent say
they have a clear understanding of what an individual retirement
account is.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizing Social Security would put a premium on investor
education because it would require people to deal with issues like
management fees and annuities, under which a lump sum is traded for
guaranteed monthly payments for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unacceptably wide gap between financial knowledge
and financial responsibilities,'' Levitt said. ``Closing this
knowledge gap is among the most important problems we face today.
It becomes even more of an imperative if Social Security is
privatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also said that the idea of the federal government owning
stock in publicly traded companies is rife with potential
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could the government invest in a tobacco company?'' he asked.
``What about a company that was a toxic polluter a decade ago? More
broadly, assuming the government invests in individual equities as
opposed to market indexes, would it be able to vote its shares? If
so, how?''

 &HT;    Christian activists demand book chain pull copies from shelves
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Christian activists staged protests at several Cobb
County locations Monday and succeeded in persuading police to
investigate their claim that two books sold by a national book
store chain feature child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out before dawn Monday, the group passed out
anti-abortion literature and religious tracts to students arriving
for class at Marietta High School, north of Atlanta. The
protestors, who numbered about 15, then branched out to book stores
and an office complex where an abortion clinic operates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the demonstrators was the Rev. Phillip Benham, national
director of Operation Rescue, an organization that waged a civil
disobedience campaign against abortion clinics in Atlanta and other
U.S. cities in the late 1980s resulting in hundreds of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Police made no arrests. At two Barnes &AMP; Noble book stores, the
protesters called for a boycott of the chain, claiming two books on
its shelves contain pornographic photographs of young girls.
</P>
<P>
   When managers at one of the Barnes &AMP; Noble stores sought police
help to move the protestors from the store's parking lot, the
protesters asked the police for an investigation. Detectives from
the county's Crimes Against Children Unit are looking into the case
and will turn their findings over to Cobb County Solicitor Barry
Morgan, said police spokesman Dana Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said the detectives asked book store managers to remove
the books in question _ ``The Age of Innocence'' by photographer
David Hamilton and ``Radiant Identities'' by photographer Jock
Sturges _ from their shelves until a judge can rule on the issue.
Barnes &AMP; Noble Vice President Mary Ellen Keating said the books
were not removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that when you're carrying in stock over 75,000
titles in a store, of course there's going to be something that
offends someone,'' Keating said. ``We have received countless
requests to stop selling certain books, but we're not in the
business of censoring. Our position is that our customers decide
what they're going to buy and read.''

 &HT;    Atlanta officials give conventioneers reassuring spinBy Alfred
Charles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and tourism officials on Monday
sought to downplay fears that the city's central business district
hotels are unsafe after a weekend triple slaying in an upscale
downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The reassuring statements by the mayor and officials at the
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau appear to be an effort to
bolster confidence in the city's hospitality and tourism industry,
which officials said contributes $4.5 billion annually to the metro
Atlanta economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is an isolated incident. It is clearly not a
random act,'' Campbell said. ``We continue to believe that downtown
is as safe as any other place in the city (or) in the metro area.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police have said the three men who were killed on the
24th floor of the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers were shot to death
execution-style. As of Monday, no arrests had been made in
connection with the slayings, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings were reported on the last day of a special
promotion being conducted by the convention bureau and downtown
hotels, restaurants and shops, which were offering deep discounts
for local suburban residents who stayed, shopped or ate this
weekend in the central business district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we have someone injured, it is not good timing,'' said
Bill Howard, vice president for public relations and tourism at the
convention and visitors bureau. ``But our locals are not making any
judgment (about the safety of downtown hotels) until they find out
all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said his agency is polling participating businesses to
determine how many people participated in the special discount
promotion, called the Atlanta Homecoming Weekend, and how the
program fared.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the city's convention and visitors bureau said they
were monitoring calls from meeting planners to determine whether
the slayings at the Hilton would prompt cancellations or spark
concerns about safety.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day Monday, Howard said, ``We have had no calls of that
type.''
</P>
<P>
   But hotel operators throughout the city are nervous about the
killings, and whether they will affect the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all disappointed,'' said David B. Kenney, president of
the Atlanta Hotel Council, a consortium of city hotels. ``Anytime
you have something like that, it is difficult for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the weekend killings, Hilton officials have
told representatives of a large group of guests that are expected
to pack the hotel this week about the incident, spokeswoman Jeanne
Datz said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not recall the name of the group, but said
the hotel wanted to assure them of their safety especially in light
of national media reports that have picked up the story about the
slayings in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of guests late Sunday were surprised and angered when
they learned about the slayings because hotel officials had not
informed them about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to feel safe at night and I'm really surprised about
this,'' said Dawn Shanahan, a Memphis resident who was in town for
a computer convention. ``It's important that we know what's going
on because how do we know the killer didn't just get into the wrong
room and just kill the people who opened the door?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We directly asked the bellman what was happening and he just
said 'nothing.' As a guest I feel I have a right to know if
something like that just happened,'' said Tim Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Datz defended their handling of the situation. ``This was a
planned situation,'' Datz said. ``There was no point in alarming
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Berg, a hotel consultant with the Atlanta-based Highland
Group, said hotel mangers generally don't like to inform guests
about criminal activity provided the crime is an isolated incident
and guests by-and-large are not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want their guests to feel comfortable and secure,'' Berg
said. ``If a broad announcement would further that, they would make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although hospitality and tourism officials said they had
received no calls questioning the safety in Atlanta, they are
prepared to deal with such inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said his group plans to tell visitors about the high
level of cooperation Atlanta police extend to conventioneers and
out-of-town guests. And Howard said crime against out-of-towners
generally is limited to minor violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have rampant crime where visitors are concerned,''
Howard said. ``But has (the Hilton killings) helped the city?
Absolutely not.''

 &HT;    Game against FSU gains importance after Tech upsets UVA
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The game is still five days away, but the first salvo
has been fired from Tallahassee. Sixth-ranked Florida State isn't
one to let sleeping dogs lie, which in this case is Georgia Tech in
general and quarterback Joe Hamilton in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Seminole strongside linebacker Tommy Polley was asked about
playing Georgia Tech on Saturday and having to defend against the
option, which is Hamilton's specialty. ``Clemson tried it and
Maryland tried it,'' Polley said. ``I think Tech is going to try to
pass the ball, get the ball deep. They might try a little bit (of
option), but after we shut them out . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Seminoles blanked Clemson 48-0 Saturday night, the
last time FSU managed a shutout was against Tech, in last year's
38-0 win in Tallahassee. And Polley added this about Hamilton: ``We
put him out of the game last year, and I don't think they want to
risk it too much, him taking too much punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people around the Atlantic Coast Conference say that this
isn't the time to be playing the Seminoles. After a stunning 24-7
upset by North Carolina State on Sept. 12, FSU has quietly and
efficiently gone about the task of getting better. Much better.
Over the past five games, the Seminoles have taken care of business
against Duke, Southern Cal, Maryland, Miami and Clemson. None of
them came within two touchdowns of the 'Noles.
</P>
<P>
   FSU seems to be playing like the FSU of old, with a sticky,
omnipresent defense and a multi-talented quarterback who has made
himself an excellent passer.
</P>
<P>
   Since throwing an unheard-of six interceptions against N.C.
State, Chris Weinke has settled down and become a respected and
feared signal-caller. The 26-year-old sophomore has thrown 149
passes without an interception and has passed for 1,798 yards and
14 touchdowns. He's the only quarterback in the conference to have
thrown for more than 200 yards every game, and he's gone over the
300 yard mark his last two games.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Weinke has been, the Seminole defense has made
even greater strides. This FSU defense is straight out of the mold
that has rated the 'Noles near the top in the country over the past
decade. They rank No. 1 nationally in the fewest total yards
allowed per game at 214.1. They are third in the country in pass
defense at 119.1 yards per game and their rushing defense is 10th
nationally at 95 yards per outing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the N.C. State debacle, no one has scored more than 14,
and the Seminoles' 12.1 points allowed per game ranks sixth
nationally. ``We wanted to prove that this FSU defense is as good
as some in the past,'' noseguard Corey Simon said. ``I think we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Brian Allen had a slightly more cerebral
approach to Saturday's festivities in Atlanta. ``We've been getting
a chance to peak at them here and there,'' he said. ``They're a
good team, and they do a lot of things with their offense. It's not
just one or two players.
</P>
<P>
   ``No playing around will be going on,'' Allen said. ``We know
our conference title is on the line, and we know Tech is probably
the front-runner right now. We're going to play assignment football
against them. They're explosive and had a great win against
Virginia. We're going to have to be disciplined.''

 &HT;    Reeves says starts for Chandler, Hall 'doubtful' _ for now
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler was feeling
better Monday, but head coach Dan Reeves said he is doubtful for
Sunday's game against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll know a lot more Wednesday,'' Reeves said. ``The biggest
thing is whether he can play. We're not going to take a chance to
damage his ability to play the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler suffered a painful strained left shoulder on his
non-throwing arm and bruised tissue around the ribs beneath the
shoulder blade in Sunday's 31-23 victory over the New Orleans
Saints. He left the game late in the second quarter after
linebacker Mark Fields sacked him.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on Chandler's status won't be made until later this
week, Reeves said. He also expressed concern about the status of
left defensive tackle Travis Hall, who has a sprained ankle,
sprained knee and strained shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Chris would be listed as doubtful right
now, as would Travis Hall,'' Reeves said. ``But a lot of that can
change between now and Wednesday (when the team has its first
practice of the week).
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt encouraged by (Chandler's progress) today. There
wasn't a lot of swelling, just a lot of soreness. He didn't
separate anything or break anything or have any damage to any
tendons.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said he has range of motion with his left arm but has
to move it slowly. He is expected to miss Wednesday's practice,
maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the back of the shoulder blade and up in that area,'' he
said. ``I can't imagine not playing, but I haven't done anything
yet (like throw), so I don't know for sure. If it's deficient,
maybe they could shoot it (with pain killers).''
</P>
<P>
   That Sunday's game is against an AFC opponent, making it less
important fortiebreakers in the NFC playoff race, is not a
consideration, Reeves said. Neither is playing on the Jets'
unforgiving artificial turf, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Chandler can't play, 44-year-old Steve DeBerg, the NFL's
oldest player, will start. The Falcons will be trying to reach
their first 6-1 start in the 33-year history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are 11-4 in games Chandler starts and finishes, and
last year were 0-6 in games he missed or could not finish.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 26, is fourth on the team with 39 tackles and has two
tackles for losses, four batted balls, 19 quarterback pressures,
two sacks, one fumble forced, one recovered and two PATs blocked.

<P>
   Continental Airlines reported record third-quarter earnings
Monday, excluding a previously announced one-time charge, and
acknowledged publicly for the first time that the Clinton
administration might file suit to block Northwest Airlines from
buying a controlling stake in Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said its earnings declined 34 percent, to $73
million, because of a $77 million after-tax charge to retire older
jets. Excluding the charge, however, the airline's profit soared
more than 31 percent, to $150 million, or $1.94 a diluted share,
from $114 million, or $1.48 a share, in the comparable quarter a
year earlier. The average estimate of Wall Street analysts polled
by the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings, was $1.93 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue grew 12 percent in the quarter, to $2.11 billion,
compared with $1.89 billion in 1997 as Continental, the nation's
fifth-largest airline, continued to profit from a surge in air
travel. On average, Continental's flights were a record 76 percent
full over the summer, a level that only a few years ago seemed
unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference with reporters Monday, Continental
executives were bullish about the future. Gregory Brenneman, the
company's president and chief operating officer, said that bookings
for the fourth quarter looked strong.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Continental rose $2.125, to $41.125, on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As strong as passenger demand remains this year, however,
airline stocks have declined sharply since the summer because
investors are concerned about an economic slowdown in 1999 when the
overall number of airplanes seats is expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to outpace the industry in capacity growth,''
said Susan Donofrio, an airline industry analyst at BT Alex. Brown.
``Given the uncertainty over the economic outlook, it is definitely
a concern for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental, which prides itself on having the best labor
relations in the industry, is also in the midst of contentious
negotiations with its 1,200 commuter pilots. The Independent
Association of Continental Pilots, which represents them as well as
Continental's 5,000 main line pilots, has vowed to walk out if the
airline does not improve its offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon is drinking his own Kool-Aid if he thinks the pilot
work force is squarely behind him,'' Bill Borrelli, the union's
president, said in a recent interview, referring to Gordon Bethune,
Continental's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune said he hoped that negotiations this week would result
in an agreement with the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he expected negotiations with the Justice
Department's antitrust division over Northwest's bid to buy a 51
percent stake in Continental from Air Partners, a Texas investment
group, to be resolved ``shortly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As previously reported, the government may file suit to block
the Northwest investment and plans by the two carriers to enter
into a strategic alliance. Although one deadline for the government
passed on Monday, the two sides have agreed to keep negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we can't predict whether the Justice
Department's concerns will be addressed by agreement or by
litigation,'' Jeffery Smisek, Continental's general counsel, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   If the government does sue, Northwest and Continental are
expected to challenge the government in court because they think
they have a strong case.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune said Continental, based in Houston, would most likely
remain profitable for the foreseeable future without the Northwest
alliance but that its profits would be much greater if the deal
went forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to us,'' he said, ``but it would be
tremendously beneficial to us.''

 &HT;    Thanks to clause in contract, Manning set to ask for more money
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He probably would trade in the statistics for victories, but
Indianapolis Colts rookie quarterback Peyton Manning is racking up
yards and, as a result, will ring up big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   With his 231 yards in Sunday's tough loss at San Francisco,
Manning, the top pick in this year's NFL draft, has 1,595 passing
yards in seven games. The significance: Manning's next completion
likely will be worth more than $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the six-year, $38 million contract negotiated by
agent Tom Condon and Colts president Bill Polian, the last three
seasons of the deal are voided if Manning has 1,601 passing yards
in '98. He needs only a 6-yard dumpoff to trigger that void clause.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Colts must ``buy back'' the three voided years with an
$8.4 million bonus and salaries of $3.2 million (2001), $4.76
million (2002) and $9.5 million (2003).
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis owner Jim Irsay, it seems, will be thrilled to ante
up. Despite the team's record and Manning's struggles, most
observers see progress under coach Jim Mora. And unlike the
petulant Ryan Leaf, Manning hasn't allowed his own high
expectations to stunt his growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn by getting beat up a little, and Peyton's coming
on,'' former New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guessing 1
</P>
<P>
   He has always been one of the NFL's least imaginative offensive
coordinators, and his play-calling at the end of Sunday's game
didn't help Joe Pendry of Buffalo. With the Bills first-and-goal at
the Jacksonville 1-yard line, Pendry probably should have opted for
something that allowed quarterback Doug Flutie to get outside the
pocket _ a bootleg or rollout. Instead, he called three straight
pocket passes for Flutie, who already had four of his first 36
attempts swatted back at him. All three passes were incomplete. On
fourth down, Flutie scored untouched around left end after faking a
pitch to tailback Thurman Thomas. But it turns out Pendry hadn't
even called that play. He called a pitch to Thomas, who didn't hear
the signal and went up the middle. Flutie scored only because he
had the presence of mind to keep the ball when he turned and saw
Thomas go the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Second guessing 2
</P>
<P>
   With his team just having scored to take a 12-10 third-quarter
lead, Dallas coach Chan Gailey opted for a two-point conversion
try. Quarterback Jason Garrett's pass attempt wasn't even close,
and the Cowboys' lead stayed at two points instead of the three it
would have been if Gailey had Richie Cunningham kick the extra
point. The difference became a big one when Chicago's Jeff Jaeger
booted a last-minute field goal to give the Bears a 13-12 victory.
. . . In the dying moments of Sunday's game, Pittsburgh defensive
coordinator Jim Haslett switched physical cornerback Carnell Lake
to the opposite side of the field to cover Baltimore big-play
threat Jermaine Lewis. Had Haslett done the same a week ago and
covered wideout Cincinnati Carl Pickens with Lake instead of
DeWayne Washington, the Steelers probably would have averted a
collapse against the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Droughts ended
</P>
<P>
   When Chicago wideout Chris Penn caught a 13-yard scoring pass
from Erik Kramer 7:16 into the third quarter of Sunday's victory
against Dallas, it finally halted a dubious Bears streak. It marked
the first score of any kind in the third quarter for Dave
Wannstedt's team since Penn caught a 4-yarder on Nov. 16 against
the New York Jets. The Bears went 181:35, more than 12 full third
quarters, between the scores. . . . Bills defensive end Bruce
Smith, shut out by Jacksonville left tackle Tony Boselli, finally
got a sack on the Jaguars star. Actually, Smith used an inside
stunt, and when Boselli blocked out, Smith squeezed by left guard
Ben Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Droughts continued
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to last year, Dallas wide receiver Michael Irvin has
gone nine games in a row without a touchdown catch, the longest
such streak of his 11-year career. Irvin has 38 receptions this
year, but he is a long way from the single-season record for most
catches without a touchdown. Raymond Berry had 75 catches for the
Baltimore Colts in 1961 but didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive best
</P>
<P>
   Even minus the aid of referee Walt Coleman's officiating crew,
the comeback authored by San Francisco quarterback Steve Young in a
34-31 victory over Indianapolis was splendid. Trailing 31-17, Young
completed 11 of 17 passes for 145 yards and also ran for two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The game marked his
sixth-straight 300-yard performance, breaking a record he shared
with Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   Detroit free safety Mark Carrier, who at age 30 is becoming a
liability in pass coverage, came up big against the Packers and
Brett Favre on Thursday night. Carrier had seven tackles, a
pressure and two interceptions and defended three passes in a 27-20
victory. He nudged out Tampa Bay weakside linebacker Derrick Brooks
(17 tackles).
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   In a 41-7 loss, Washington punter Matt Turk kicked eight times
against Minnesota. He averaged 43.8 yards gross, 42.0 yards net and
limited Vikings return ace David Palmer to one runback for 14
yards. Turk knocked four punts inside the 20-yard line and did not
have a touchback.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee wide receiver Kevin Dyson actually was taken five
spots higher than Randy Moss in the '98 draft but entered Sunday's
game against Cincinnati with zero catches. In his first NFL start
the former Utah standout, who had been inactive for three of the
Oilers' first five games, had four catches for 82 yards, including
a 45-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson on track
</P>
<P>
   With 644 rushing yards in six games, Atlanta tailback Jamal
Anderson is on pace for a 1,717-yard season. That would leave him
just 2 yards short shy of the franchise record, set by Gerald Riggs
in 1985. Anderson He has accounted for 87.9 percent of the attempts
and 93.8 percent of the rushing yards by Falcons backs. He trails
only Terrell Davis (Denver) and Natrone Means (San Diego) in yards
and is fourth in the NFL in runs of 10 yards or more.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta tailback Jamal Anderson's father, James , probably will
start drawing paychecks this week as a bodyguard for boxer Mike
Tyson. . . . Former Falcons field boss June Jones became the 49th
coach to take over a team in-season since 1970, and the 16th to win
his first game. . . . Through Sunday, 44 different quarterbacks
have started at least one game.

 &HT;    Gingrich still pulling in major GOP donations
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leader of Republicans in the House of
Representatives continues to be the House's biggest magnet for
campaign contibutions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich took in more than $1 million in campaign
contributions in the three month period that ended Sept. 30,
according to his latest filing with the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich spent more than $1.7 million in the same period,
including $554,000 in contributions to Republican candidates and a
national GOP advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's opponent in Georgia's 6th Congressional District,
Gary ``Bats'' Pelphrey, reported raising just $1,550 and spending
$4,368 in the past three months. Pelphrey has $5,743 in cash for
the homestretch of his longshot campaign, while Gingrich is sitting
on $317,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other Georgia contests also show sizable money gaps.
</P>
<P>
   In the only district that appears to have a competitive
campaign, Democratic incumbent Sanford Bishop has $292,000 in the
bank for the final weeks of his campaign, more than eight times as
much as Republican challenger Joseph McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that some of the powerful interests in Georgia's 2nd
District are hedging their bets, McCormick has received political
action committee (PAC) contributions from Synovus, the
Columbus-based financial giant and Gold Kist, a large poultry
operation. Both companies' PACs have also given to Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat, in fact, collected nearly 80 percent of his
$202,000 in contributions from PACs in the past three months,
including PACs affiliated with labor unions, the tobacco industry
and farming concerns.
</P>
<P>
   After Gingrich, Republican Rep. Bob Barr was the most aggressive
fund raiser in the past quarter, posting $406,000 in contributions.
Both men have used the services of InfoCision Management Corp., an
Akron, Ohio tele-marketing company that solicits contributions for
Republican, conservative and religious causes.
</P>
<P>
   InfoCision received $279,000 from Gingrich and $207,000 from
Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Republicans, Saxby Chambliss, Mac Collins and
Charlie Norwood, gave at least $39,000 each to other GOP candidates
and the national ad campaign that is being run by Georgia colleague
John Linder.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, is overseeing a $37 million ad campaign in ket districts
around the country. Linder's report was not on file Monday at the
FEC.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. John Lewis, facing a Republican with the same
name, John Lewis Sr. (no relation), raised little money in the last
quarter, but reported $692,000 in available cash.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger's report was not available Monday.

 &HT;    New Orleans mourns murdered gospel singer
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It was called a celebration of life, but for many
mourners attending Monday's memorial service for slain gospel
singer Raymond Myles, it was a sad good-bye that came too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Myles, 41, a Grammy-nominated singer, choir leader and
keyboardist who was a regular at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
Festival and sang for President Clinton and the pope, died Oct. 11
from gunshot wounds to the chest and leg. He was dumped from his
Lincoln Navigator at Elysian Fields Avenue near the French Quarter,
miles from his apartment in eastern New Orleans. Police have not
arrested anyone or named any suspects in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a loveable person. I don't see why anybody would want
to harm him,'' said his first cousin, Jerry Williams, who came to
the service in an apron embossed with a picture of Myles and the
words ``Gone but not forgotten.'' Williams cooks for the homeless
in the St. Bernard housing project, where he and Myles grew up.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial called Myles the greatest gospel
singer to come out of the city since Mahalia Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see people smile, he wanted to make them happy,''
Morial said. ``He lived a great life and touched millions of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A flamboyant performer whose colorful costumes and flashy
jewelry led people to call him the Little Richard of gospel, Myles
had another, lesser-known vocation: Teaching. As a choirmaster and
voice teacher at Marion Abramson Senior High School, he was so
popular that students created waiting lists to get into his
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world knew Raymond as a performer, a gospel genius,'' said
Joseph Murray, principal at Abramson Senior High, speaking Monday
to about
</P>
<P>
   3,5000 mourners at the Greater Saint Stephen Full Gospel Baptist
Church. ''Each class he taught was like a performance, a mini
concert. I'd walk by
</P>
<P>
   and think, `Those kids are so lucky to have him.' Raymond
changed our school. I've never seen a man do so much and give so
much in such a short
</P>
<P>
   time.''
</P>
<P>
   Myles began singing with his mother when he was 5. He recorded
his first single when he was 12. The ninth of 10 children raised in
the St.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Housing Development, Myles begged his church, Asia
Baptist, to pay for music lessons. The church agreed, and in
return, Myles stayed with the congregation 18 years, first as a
singer then as a choir leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said his message was simple: Love,'' said Herman
``Magic''Charles, a disc jockey at WADU-FM radio, and a friend of
Myles. He stood in the back of the church Monday, singing along
with the Greater Saint Stephen choir_one of the most famous in the
city_and the Raymond Anthony Myles Singers, called the RAMS. Many
RAMS members cried as they sang to their slain leader.

SPORTS COLUMN: LEARNING PATIENCE FROM BERNIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the aftermath of Ricky Ledee's weekend World
Series ascent, a soda can was hanging from the fingertips of his
left hand, the chain holding his crucifix was drooping out one side
of his shirt, and a most interesting hypothetical was dangling in
front of his face.
</P>
<P>
   What if?
</P>
<P>
   What if Bernie Williams had just played his last game in center
field at Yankee Stadium, and the most famous of all New York City
baseball positions was soon to have a vacancy sign? Could Ledee
fill it? Would he campaign for the chance?
</P>
<P>
   He said, in a voice so soft you moved closer to hear him: ``This
is not a franchise that says, `Let the rookies play.' They want to
win every year, so maybe I just have to come and play and be
quiet.'' Which, in a manner of speaking, was Ledee's way of
asserting that he has every intention of following the quiet
example set by Williams, mentor and friend. Ledee was saying, yes,
he could be another strong, introspective presence, another
home-grown Yankee who fits this most egalitarian team like a glove.
</P>
<P>
   He could just as well do it in left field, where he's played
flawlessly in Games 1 and 2, in addition to reaching base in six of
eight times at bat. ``Myself, I wouldn't like to see him go, even
if it means more playing time for me,'' said Ledee, who turns 25
next month. ``He's too good a player, too good a person. I'd rather
keep Bernie Williams and stay in left.''
</P>
<P>
   This will all play itself out in due time, but there is more
Yankee business with the Padres in San Diego starting Tuesday night
before the Williams Watch can officially begin. First things first,
as Williams told Ledee after Williams' two-run, second-inning homer
plated the fifth and sixth Yankee runs in their 9-3 Game 2 rout
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a curtain call,'' Ledee told Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the crowd, Williams told the rookie. Just stay focused on
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did tip his cap to the outfield fans before the
following inning, but more than typically reserved, his postseason
demeanor has been mysteriously detached, the symptom of a man in
emotional retreat. Vague references to ``personal problems'' have
crept into articles, and regardless of what that means, most people
around the Yankees more than suspect that following the World
Series, Williams is as good as gone.
</P>
<P>
   As much a loss as that would be, I generally do not make it my
business to tell athletes where they should play. Williams has
labored under a string of one-year contracts, on the way to
unfettered and well-earned free agency. Under the financial gun
this season, he was the American League's batting champion. He is
30 and will never have better negotiating leverage in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Patience has been a staple Williams virtue, one he has preached
to Ledee, who has found himself stuck at various levels of the
Yankee system. Stuck in A ball, in Class AAA, behind veterans Tim
Raines, Darryl Strawberry and Chad Curtis. Stuck, what seems like
just a few minutes ago, behind his comrade rookie, Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, from Bayamon, Puerto Rico, has told Ledee, from
Salinas, Puerto Rico, to consider where Williams was five years
ago, when he was exactly Ledee's age and still struggling for
permanent Bronx residency. Jorge Posada, out of Santurce, Puerto
Rico, is the Yankees' everyday catcher of the future, and he
recently turned 27. The point is that baseball, thankfully, has not
been taken over by kids not old enough to drink, drive or deliver
in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   As much as baseball is a sport, it's a craft. Ledee's quick
lefty swing was not developed overnight. ``There have been times
when I felt like I wanted to quit,'' Ledee said. ``Bernie's helped
me through it. He's always talking to me about the game, about
personal things. He's that way as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend. Mentor. Big brother. Father figure. Maybe Williams has
been a little bit of everything. Ledee was 12 when his father,
Omar, a well-known salsa singer, fell asleep at the wheel late one
night and died in a crash. His mother, Ana, was pregnant at the
time with the second of his two younger brothers. Ledee wanted to
say that one matures rapidly as a 16-year-old professional ball
player who happens to be the family's primary wage earner.
</P>
<P>
   Every year for a long time, he has finished his minor-league
chores and gone straight home to supplement his income in the
Puerto Rican leagues, where he plays center. ``Oh, sure,'' he said
when asked if he had the range to play the position every day in
the Bronx. But why dwell on that? First things first. There's a
World Series to be won, Bernie's still here, and maybe, just maybe,
he'll stay.

 &HT;    Commentary: Braves' fall failures a matter of trivia
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can stop the e-mails, faxes and screaming banners in the sky
on the end of airplanes. I definitely hear you. So here is my
reason why the Braves of the 1990s have surpassed the Dodgers of
the 1950s as baseball's all-time busts in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a few trivia questions. If you wish to scream
in disgust along the way, you should do so in the direction of the
Braves' executive offices at Turner Field:
</P>
<P>
   Which players are tied for the lead among their peers for most
homers during the postseason with 10?
</P>
<P>
   David Justice and Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   What current player has the fifth-highest batting average in
World Series history for those with 50 or more at bats?
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   Who is known as ``Little October?''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lemke.
</P>
<P>
   What veteran has a World Series batting average that is 30
points higher than his lifetime mark and was voted by the Sporting
News as one of this year's premier utility players?
</P>
<P>
   Terry Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one more question: Do you finally realize that the
Braves' Designated Geniuses don't understand what those who run the
NFL's team of the 1980s and 1990s have known forever?
</P>
<P>
   Before each season, the 49ers operate with late January in mind.
In contrast, the Braves' Designated Geniuses construct their roster
for April through September and hope October takes care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   That is foolishness. It isn't coincidental that the 49ers have
five world championships, while the Braves managed their only one
in 1995, with those trivia answers.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Designated Geniuses said they failed to keep most of
those trivia answers to save pennies to sign their starting
pitchers. Yeah, well, the Yankees rank with the Braves in having
more pennies than anybody else in the game. The Yankees also have
dandy starting pitching. Unlike the Braves, the Yankees join the
49ers in acquiring or retaining those who are accomplished beyond
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   As I've mentioned since the Braves ousted McGriff for Andres
Galarraga before this season, it didn't matter if McGriff hit .200
for Tampa Bay and Galarraga slammed 80 homers. McGriff shows up in
October. Galarraga didn't in 1995 against the Braves during his
only time in the playoffs with Colorado. He finished with more
strikeouts than hits (six to five).
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest. During the Braves' latest collapse in the
National League Championship Series, Galarraga struggled with his
bat and his glove against San Diego. He wasn't alone in both
categories for a team that was a disappointment for a sixth time
during its seven consecutive trips to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the decade, when the Braves lost the World Series to
Minnesota and Toronto before choking against Philadelphia in the
NLCS, you could say they were building toward that world
championship over Cleveland. Now, after blowing the 1996 World
Series to the Yankees and looking rather sickly against Florida and
San Diego during the past two years in the NLCS, the Braves clearly
have another problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: The Braves' Designated Geniuses don't
understand anything I've been saying forever about their moves
involving those trivia answers.

 &HT;    Home field, good pitching a part of Padres' recipe for winning
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ They come home to their fanatical fans, to their
beautiful weather, to their loud and unforgettable rendition of
AC/DC's ``Hell's Bells'' when closer Trevor Hoffman walks on the
field for a save opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But that home-field familiarity might not be enough to save the
Padres, who trail the Yankees 2-0 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the confidence in the world back home,'' Padres
first baseman Wally Joyner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tougher road than we wanted,'' outfielder Greg
Vaughn said. ``But no one's confidence is down. We're going home,
regroup and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting is one thing; good pitching is another. And that's what
the Padres need.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of the Series, the Yankees have scored 18
runs on 25 hits and have blistered a pitching rotation responsible
for getting San Diego into its first Fall Classic since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees hitters are doing what Houston and Atlanta could not _
take the Padres staff deep into counts. Starters Kevin Brown and
Andy Ashby both appeared tired in Game 1 and Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being patient,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said.
``We are running the counts in our favor. If you do that, you can
take advantage of their mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Padres to have a chance, left-hander Sterling Hitchcock
is going to have to pitch as he did against Atlanta in the NLCS. He
gave up just one run in two victorious starts against the Braves.
Hitchcock, 3-0 this postseason, has been bothered by a cold that
has moved through the Padres team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be fine,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's just a matter of
winning. We feel like we can play with them. There's no pressure on
me; I'm not supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He expects to win now after beating the guys he's beaten,''
pitching coach Dave Stewart said. ``So he can't fool me by saying
he doesn't expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   New York would like to end the Series quickly and become the
first team with baseball's best record to win a world title since
the A's in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   For the Padres to get to starter David Cone, they also have to
get to a Yankees team that is playing with tremendous confidence.
New York won an AL record 114 games in the regular season and nine
of 11 since the playoffs started. The Yankees realize they are
close to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of catching,'' manager Joe Torre said about his
offense, which had averaged just four hits a postseason game coming
into the Series ``When everybody is swinging the bat well,
relaxation means a lot out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds favor the Yankees. Thirty-three of the 44 teams that
have led 2-0 have won. But New York also understands history. In
1996, the Yankees lost the first two games to the Braves in New
York but came back and won four straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take every game like its Game 7,'' Jeter said. ``This team
doesn't like to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got two more games to win, and it ain't going to be easy,''
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, it doesn't look good,'' right fielder
Tony Gwynn said. ``But none of you gave us a chance, anyway. It's a
four-of-seven series, and we lost the first two. Now you have to
win four of the next five, which won't be easy. But this is the
time of year that miracles happen.''

 &HT;    Williams likely to become next big-ticket free agent
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Bernie Williams might have played his last game in
Yankee Stadium. Eligible for free-agency, Williams is expected to
cause a bidding war this winter and Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner has said he will not pay more than $8.5 million a
season for the All-Star center fielder. Rumors continue to swirl
that Williams will be in an Arizona uniform next season, getting a
contract that will pay him more than $13 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he doesn't know for sure which way he is going right
now,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``We would love to have him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been able to keep the pending freedom from being a
distraction, saying, ``I can't think about my future, because this
is my future right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the front office
</P>
<P>
   Padres coach Dave Stewart continues to be praised for the job he
is doing with his club's pitching staff, but he still wants to be a
general manager some day. ``Baseball people see me as a field
person,'' Stewart said. ``'m in an ideal situation. Whether it
happens or not (to become a GM), this is a great game, and I love
being involved in it any way I can.'' NL president Leonard Coleman
said about Stewart, ``He's climbed every mountain. He'll be an
absolutely first-rate GM.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown looking better
</P>
<P>
   Despite being still bothered by the flu, Padres righthander
Kevin Brown apparently will be able to pitch Game 4 Wednesday
night. Brown also is having problems with a nasty bruise from when
he was hit by a Chili Davis line drive in Game 1. ``No question,
he's a strong possibility for Game 4,'' manager Bruce Bochy said.
The only other alternative is righthander Joey Hamilton, who has
been shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   Yankee great Joe DiMaggio continues to watch the Series games
from his hospital bed in Hollywood, Fla. DiMaggio is being treated
for pneumonia. . . . Phil Mushnick of the New York Post writing
bout Yankees announcer John Sterling, who used to be in the radio
and television booths in Atlanta: ``Not even the ALCS or the World
Series can move John Sterling to place the game above the sound of
his own voice, nor his absurd self-promotional stylings. Listening
to Sterling call a game on radio is to know only what Sterling
chooses for you to know, as opposed to what actually happened.'' .
. . San Diego's Tony Gwynn has hit safely in six of his seven
career Series games. . . . The fans in New York have continued to
ride Padres third baseman Ken Caminiti, who said, ``Basically,
they've been telling me I stink.'' They were right in Game 2, as
Caminiti's first-inning error led to three unearned runs.

 &HT;    Recent success proves this Joe is far from clueless
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It is one of baseball's great comebacks, the one Joe
Torre has made.
</P>
<P>
   When the St. Louis Cardinals, on June 15, 1995, became the third
team to fire him, it seemed that his career as a manager had ended
without distinction. His teams had won 844 games and lost 1,003,
had made the playoffs only one time in 14 seasons, had never won a
postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Torre thought, even then, that he was a good manager. But he did
not expect to get another chance to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   He was right about only the first part.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner unexpectedly hired the Brooklyn-born Torre
as New York Yankees manager after the '95 season _ a hire met with
almost unanimous derision in the Big Apple. Even Steinbrenner had
such doubt that, within weeks, he offered the job back to Torre's
predecessor, Buck Showalter. One New York tabloid announced Torre's
hiring this way: ``BOSS TABS CLUELESS JOE.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, with Torre two wins away from managing the Yankees to
their second World Series championship in three years, you pick up
the same tabs and read that he should be in the Hall of Fame
because of the combination of his managing and playing careers.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? He is exactly the same manager as when he
guided the Mets (1977-81), Braves ('82-84) and Cardinals ('90-95)
to those 1,003 losses. Now as then, he is player-friendly,
media-savvy, self-assured, strong on communication and people
skills, possessor of a wonderful feel for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' Torre, 58, says about his success as Yankees
manager, ``because you felt that everything you were doing (in
previous jobs) was the right thing, and it really wasn't turning
out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees, Torre had his greatest _ actually, his only
_ managerial success with the Braves. He made Bob Horner team
captain, helped make Dale Murphy a two-time MVP and guided a team
with almost no pitching to the NL West championship in '82 and
second-place finishes the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was fired _ a move that, 14 years later, seems utterly
irrational. The Braves didn't have another winning season for seven
years. Torre didn't have another managing job for six.
</P>
<P>
   It is no mystery why he has had such different results this time
around than the others: better players. He has the deepest, most
balanced team in the game, and he deploys the talent seamlessly. He
wins so much that he defuses one long-time bane of Yankees'
managers _ Steinbrenner. He communicates so well that he avoids
another long-time bane of Yankee managers _ clubhouse turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But managing the Yankees is not easy, and Torre _ 302-184 the
past three seasons _ is the first person in the Steinbrenner era to
make it look that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations were so high this year,'' he says,
``everybody talking about the World Series from the start of spring
training. Even before we played Texas (in the first round of
playoffs), I had family making plans to come to New York for the
World Series. ``That is pressure. But now that we are here, I feel
a great calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, better than almost anyone, knows how hard it is to
get here. It took him 36 years in pro ball _ 4,268 games as a
big-league player and manager _ to reach his first World Series.
And now he is back just two years later, guiding the winningest
team in American League history, his managerial credentials firmly,
finally established.

 &HT;    HBO &AMP; Co. merger won't take it from Atlanta
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta may be losing a corporate headquarters, but it
could gain employees as the new company McKesson HBOC takes shape.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company will have its overall headquarters in San
Francisco, where the huge pharmaceuticals distributor McKesson is
based.
</P>
<P>
   But the old HBO &AMP; Co. side of the equation _ health care
information systems _ will remain based in Atlanta, the companies
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So HBO &AMP; Co.'s plans to move headquarters from Perimeter Center
to Alpharetta's Windward area remain intact. Construction on the
500,000-square-foot building, owned by HBO, is well under way, said
Alpharetta Mayor Chuck Martin. Ground was broken in July and
relocation is planned for mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not see any significant change in Atlanta
employment,'' added Charles McCall, chairman, chief executive and
president of HBO &AMP; Co. The company still plans to hire 200 to 300
more employees in the Atlanta area, McCall said. About 1,600 of HBO
&AMP; Co.'s current 7,000 employees are based in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the headquarters move to Alpharetta was
overcrowding at the Perimeter Center site.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, McCall said that HBO &AMP; Co. planned to add
1,500 employees, with a particular need for programmers,
salespeople and service technicians.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC will be very aggressive in increasing Atlanta
employment, McCall said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, ``we don't see any significant job cuts'' in the
merger, he said.

 &HT;    HBOC: A timeline
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The story of the nation's No. 1 health-care software
company began 30 years ago, with a religious order's need to
automate its hospital accounting systems.
</P>
<P>
   And that same company, even during its high-growth years, often
has been confused with the cable TV network HBO. That identity
problem almost led HBO &AMP; Co. to change its name.
</P>
<P>
   But the corporate name earned wide recognition among U.S.
hospitals for its information systems. So Charlie McCall, the CEO
and president, and the company decided to leave the name alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to manage the confusion over the name because of
the strength it means in the marketplace,'' McCall said three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. was founded in 1974 in Peoria, Ill., by Walter Huff,
Bruce Barrington and Richard Owens _ whose last names formed the
initials ``HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   But its corporate roots extended back to the 1960s, when the
Third Order of St. Francis, a religious order that owned 11 Midwest
community hospitals, wanted to automate its patient systems.
</P>
<P>
   By 1969, the Third Order's information systems team, led by
Huff, Barrington and Owens, received a government grant to develop
an automated financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the three broke off and formed their own company, HBO
&AMP; Co. Five years later, they moved it to Atlanta, then a growing
technology hub.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in 1981. Barrington and Owens eventually
decided to retire, while Huff stayed aboard until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But the late 1980s proved a difficult time for HBO &AMP; Co. The
company successfully fended off an unfriendly takeover. It soon was
operating clumsily as three distinct businesses, each with its own
management team.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Charlie McCall joined HBO &AMP; Co. from CompuServe, in
1991, the company's revenue was stalled at about $175 million per
year. Profits were down, debt was up, and the stock price
languished in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   McCall knew a lot about computers but little about hospitals,
the company's main customers. But he soon oversaw a restructuring
where one division was sold and the other two were combined.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, health care was undergoing a revolution in the
delivery of services. McCall recognized that upheaval as similar to
that experienced in personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Employers were being socked by double-digit percentage increases
in health benefits costs. So they increasing turned to HMOs and
other managed-care plans to head off those costs.
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear to hospitals and doctors: Reimbursements
would shrink, and efficiency was demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital consolidation became an industry trend.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. took advantage of the new cost-cutting imperative. The
company showed that by linking hospitals and their clinical and
financial information, savings can be achieved. Hospital decisions
on cost and patient care could be made quickly and accurately.
</P>
<P>
   McCall steered HBO &AMP; Co. through a string of acquisitions, which
brought it new software applications. Seventeen such deals were
completed from 1993 through mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Through those purchases, HBO &AMP; Co. picked up software addressing
other pieces of the health-care puzzle: doctors offices, home care
agencies, insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The company pursued health care's ``holy grail''_ eliminating
paperwork by providing a seamless record of financial and clinical
data.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit proved successful. HBO &AMP; Co. eventually overtook its
information systems rivals to be the industry leader in revenues
and profits. It surpassed the billion-dollar mark in sales in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street paid attention to this ascent. HBO &AMP; Co. ranked
second among Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies in stock performance _
appreciating almost 1,400 percent _ in the five-year period through
1997.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co.'s market capitalization skyrocketed from about $100
million in 1991 to more than $13 billion. And for the past two
years, HBO &AMP; Co. has led all other Georgia public companies in
performance as measured by the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more growth was forecast, more deals announced. The
company reached employment of 7,000. And there was debate over who
would succeed the magician McCall, who said he planned to retire in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Then this summer brought a development that startled longtime
HBO &AMP; Co. watchers: A proposed merger with McKesson Corp., the
nation's leading drug distributor. But that deal fell through when
word leaked out, and HBO &AMP; Co.'s shares plunged.
</P>
<P>
   But new talks on a merger surfaced and were concluded swiftly
last week, preceding Sunday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The future of that marriage won't be known for some time. If
nothing else, though, the acquisition should put to rest the
remaining confusion about the corporate name. The new company will
be called McKesson HBOC, the latter part of the name referring to
HBO &AMP; Co.'s ticker symbol.

HAND GRENADES TOSSED IN ISRAELI BUS STATION WOUND 64
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEERSHEBA, Israel _ Two hand grenades, tossed into a crowded bus
station at morning rush hour Monday, wounded 64 people and
reverberated all the way to the Middle East summit in Maryland,
where Israelis responded by limiting talks with their Palestinian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, which police say was carried out by a Palestinian in
this industrial town on the edge of the Negev Desert, took place at
a critical juncture in a peace process that has been deadlocked for
19 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides fear that the gains of the 1993 peace accords will be
jeopardized if progress is not made soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are difficult, the distrust is deep, the going has
been tough,'' President Clinton said. ``But the parties must
consider the consequences of failure and also the benefits of
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis said after the attack that they would reduce the
agenda only to Israeli security issues, and declared that they did
not intend to stay ``for an unlimited period'' at the secluded Wye
Plantation, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, 70 miles east of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, which the Israelis said buttressed their position
that no progress will be made until the Palestinian Authority does
more to fight terrorism, was carried out just after 8 a.m. outside
of Beersheba's central bus station. Civilians were waiting to board
buses for work, and scores of soldiers were heading to a nearby
military base.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions shattered windows of the bus stop and storefronts,
and left scores of people bleeding on the sidewalk from shrapnel
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Cohen, a 19-year-old soldier, said she had been standing in
line for a bus when she saw a man hurl one of the grenades. The
explosion lifted her off her feet and shrapnel ripped into her
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just panic. People were running and crying ... I
thought I had lost my legs,'' she said from a hospital, where
doctors are treating the wounds to her legs.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were listed in critical condition. Thirty-two were
described as being in stable condition last night, and the rest had
been treated and released, hospital officials said. Twenty-four of
the victims were Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of the attack was hauntingly familiar to Israelis, who
have endured sporadic waves of bus bombings and suicide attacks by
Palestinian extremists in recent years that have been aimed at
shattering hopes for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The images Monday were of black combat boots removed from
wounded soldiers left discarded on the sidewalk, of municipal
workers sweeping shards of glass mixed with blood, of victims
crying in stunned disbelief while being treated by emergency
medical teams. A basketball-size crater left by a grenade was
filled with a pool of water made brown from dried blood.
</P>
<P>
   A group of civilians and soldiers overpowered the attacker, whom
Israeli officials identified as Salem Rajab al-Sarsour, a
29-year-old Palestinian construction worker from Hebron, as he
tried to flee the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The angry crowd beat him badly, witnesses said. One soldier, who
under military rules is not allowed to give his name for
publication, intervened to save the man's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have some rule of law,'' the soldier said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police and military in flak jackets and carrying
high-powered rifles descended on the scene, and detained all Arabs
in the area. Israeli television broadcast footage of troops
standing over dozens of Arab civilians lying face down on the
ground. Soldiers grabbed one Arab teenager who had refused to show
his ID card and slapped him as he yelled out to a reporter, ``I did
nothing. I did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sarsour, the only person in custody, confessed hours after
the attack, according to Israeli officials. They said there were
unconfirmed reports from the scene that he had been driven by car
to the attack site.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority president, Yasser Arafat, offered his
condolences to Netanyahu at the summit Monday. But Palestinian
officials, under Israeli and US pressure to do more to fight
terrorism, stressed that the attack had occurred inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to end terrorism, the Palestinians say, is to
create peace. This, they say, will be fostered by an Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, as called for in the 1993 accords.
</P>
<P>
   The former Palestinian spokeswoman and Cabinet minister, Hanan
Ashrawi, told CNN, ``This is mission impossible. ... To ask any
leader to guarantee the safety of every citizen in land that is not
under their control is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the bombing, Ezra Tzion, 46, swept the
shattered plate glass windows in front of the steak house he owns.
His seeming eagerness to clean up captured the resiliency of many
Israelis, who say they do not want to allow the extremists to
destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kesler, 26, a computer worker who was wounded boarding a
bus for reserve duty, said: ``They should never stop. The only way
to get peace will be to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   But with TV satellite trucks and reporters at the scene,
far-right and ultra-Orthodox protesters opposed to the peace
process demonstrated. They carried signs that depicted blood
dripping over Netanyahu and Arafat under the word ``Partners.''
They shouted, ``Death to Arafat,'' and called Netanyahu ``a
traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Goel, 34, a yeshiva student in the black hat and suit of
the ultra-Orthodox, said: ``They should stop the talks. There will
be no peace with Arafat. Clinton is wasting his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen bus drivers for Israel's Egged Bus Company shouted
back at the ultra-Orthodox. One of the men yelled angrily from a
broken window: ``Peace is a rude word for you. You'll always be
against it.''

WASHINGTON STATE IS THIS YEAR'S BATTLEGROUND OVER AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two years after California voters abolished most
affirmative action programs and a year after Houston's residents
chose to retain them, the fight has shifted to the Northwest, where
voters in Washington state are facing the only ballot initiative in
the country this year on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Initiative 200, the measure would outlaw any
preferences in state decisions on hiring, school admissions or
contracting based on race or gender. If it passes, Washington would
become only the second state to enact such a measure, perhaps
giving impetus to similar efforts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But as they listen to the two sides wage a fierce debate over
the measure, voters here could be forgiven for being confused about
exactly what is at stake on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   A blitz of advertisements in the last two weeks of the campaign
shows why:
</P>
<P>
   In one radio advertisement being aired by those who want to ban
preferences, a classroom of children is heard reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance as a little girl asks: ``Does it matter what color
someone is? Should it matter?'' A man explains that under current
state policies, someone can get a job or a contract or a spot in
school ``based on the color of that person's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a television advertisement being run by opponents of the
measure, Gov. Gary Locke stares into the camera and casts the
initiative in a very different light. The governor, a Democrat,
never even uses the words ``race'' or ``color,'' ``black'' or
``white,'' talking only about gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will roll back the progress women have made,'' Locke says,
``in getting equal pay for equal work.'' Another advertisement
shows women in the workplace _ at computers, wearing lab coats or
in hard hats _ and offers a similar warning.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that is 86 percent white, and where the biggest
ethnic minority is Asian Americans, who are not in many of the
state's main affirmative action programs, the two sides are
employing sharply contrasting strategies in their effort to win on
Election Day. And both because women can benefit from affirmative
action and because polls suggest that they are less likely than men
to think that such programs are unnecessary, opponents are focusing
their efforts on women.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure angrily denounce the appeal to women
as a distortion of what I-200 is all about, while the opponents,
just as angrily, say the emphasis on race represents an effort to
inflame racial discord in a state where affirmative action has
never been a contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   The only point on which both camps agree is that the outcome is
enormously important to their cause. With their only electoral
victory so far in California, proponents of eliminating most
affirmative action programs hope to carry momentum from a victory
here to other states, including Florida, where efforts to get a
similar measure on the ballot this year stalled.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say that if they can stop the measure in a state
like Washington, where affirmative action is not in general a
hugely divisive issue, their victory may further dampen efforts in
other states to bring the matter before voters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure's wording, the state ``shall not discriminate
against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or
group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national
origin'' in education, employment or contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, backed by contributions from some of the state's
biggest corporations, including Microsoft, Boeing and the Starbucks
coffee chain, are mounting a big advertising drive in the final
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With polls having shown all along that voters are generally
inclined to say ``yes'' when the measure's wording is read to them,
the opponents say they are trying to warn Washingtonians of what
Locke calls ``hidden consequences'' of the measure. Supporters of
the initiative say the new advertisements are an outrageous effort
to confuse the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to make this a gender issue, rather than an
issue of racial preferences, which is most of what is encompassed
by 200,'' said John Carlson, host of a talk show on an Internet
broadcast network and leader of the drive for the initiative.
``They cannot win this campaign by honestly debating the merits and
the current system of affirmative action. And so they are flailing
about like a prizefighter in the 13th round, who's lost every
round, and is now beginning to swing wildly.''
</P>
<P>
   But No!200, the main group organized to fight the measure,
accuses Carlson and Ward Connerly, the leader of the California
initiative drive and the head of a Sacramento-based group that has
paid for pro-initiative ads, of bringing needlessly divisive
politics here and ignoring the initiative's effects on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the same rhetoric as in California, which has a
completely different demographic picture,'' said Michelle
Ackermann, spokeswoman for No!200, who added that it was proper for
the group's ads to focus on women. ``The fact is, this is primarily
a gender issue in this state. It is a woman's issue. The primary
beneficiaries of affirmative action in this state are white women.
So that is what we should be discussing.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The opponents point to women such as Anne Symonds, president of
Seattle-based Symonds Consulting Engineers, a 42-employee company
here that is one of about 4,000 in the state registered as women-
or minority-owned and thus targeted in programs aimed at making
sure that such companies are represented in government contracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these programs have done is allowed us to get our foot in
the door with certain clients,'' said Ms. Symonds, who said it was
very difficult to do so when government agencies were dealing with
an established ``old-boy network'' of firms and had no obligation
to look elsewhere. She estimated that about 90 percent of her $3.5
million in billings involves government work in civil and
structural engineering.
</P>
<P>
   And, reflecting some of the more general opposition to I-200,
Ms. Symonds said, ``I'm very concerned that we're seeing a backlash
against what we have gained in the last 30 years. When you think
back to what it was like 30 years ago, we really don't want to go
there, both on women's issues and race issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents' strategy of emphasizing women's issues could well
backfire in some respects, since women's grades are better than
men's at many state universities, and opponents question whether
there is any basis to the notion that they need special
consideration in university admissions or government hiring.
</P>
<P>
   But Connerly, whose Sacramento-based American Civil Rights
Institute paid for much of the signature drive that got Initiative
200 on the ballot, said in a telephone interview that the
opponents' argument was a red herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've decided that the only way you're going to defeat this
thing is to put a white woman's face on it,'' said Connerly.
``They're trying to frighten women so enough women will vote
against it, but I personally don't think it will work. They say,
`Oh, this will endanger equal pay for equal work.' But that's
totally ridiculous _ it would seem to me that that would be blatant
discrimination, and Proposition 200 says there would be no
discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the big lie,'' added Connerly. ``But just read the
language. There is no way you can read that and say it's somehow
going to disadvantage women.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate comes against a backdrop of repeated polls here and
elsewhere that show people inclined to support measures with the
language used in California, specifically the requirement that
government ``shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential
treatment,'' but less inclined to support the measures when simply
described as banning affirmative-action programs.
</P>
<P>
   The language was a critical factor in the success of
California's Proposition 209 two years ago, while in Houston, when
the City Council changed the language to make it essentially a
referendum on ending affirmative action, the voters said no. (The
city's programs are still being challenged in a court case.)
</P>
<P>
   In a statewide poll taken two weeks ago by Mason-Dixon
Political/Media Research Inc. for several news organizations, 55
percent of Washingtonians surveyed said they would support the
measure when a summary text was read to them, and 35 percent said
they were against. When told the measure would end many
affirmative-action programs, the margin dropped to 46 percent in
favor and 40 percent opposed.

HOUSE MAY FINALLY PASS US BUDGET AND BEGIN CAMPAIGNING FULLTIME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House debate and vote on a $500 billion
spending bill will ring down the curtain for the 105th Congress
late Tuesday night and help define the choices voters face on
Election Day two weeks from today.
</P>
<P>
   The preoccupation with the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal drowned
out progress on other issues for much of the year. But talk of
scandal has been replaced in the final work days of the
congressional session by a noisy debate over governmental
philosophies and spending priorities as Congress crafted the single
bill to fund big chunks of the government through fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties finally are talking about education, Social
Security, and health care, issues that polls show strike a chord
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, with a major assist from President Clinton, switched
the subject from impeachment to education last week and succeeded
in funding a range of domestic priorities, including the $1 billion
down payment on 100,000 new public school teachers in the final
compromise version of the big appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans claimed some victories in the negotiations. The GOP
matched the increase in domestic spending with a $9 billion
increase for the Defense Department, added funds for antidrug
programs, and resisted Democrats' pleas for a special tax break to
help finance public school renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sellick, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, said that the debate in Congress was reinforcing the
three themes that have been dominant in House Democratic
advertising campaigns this year: education, Social Security, and
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the advertising more relevant when there is a fight
going on on the issues on a day-to-day basis in Congress,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements that gave the Republicans the greatest bragging
rights for this Congress, the balanced budget and tax cut agreement
of 1997, took place more than a year ago. Last week, Republicans
were frustrated at the way Democrats were prevailing in setting
spending priorities. Conservative Republicans criticized their
leaders for caving in to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and the Democratic Party got everything they
wanted, and the Republicans got nothing out of this,'' said Senator
Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was hoping his
chamber could approve the measure by voice vote and avoid a roll
call vote that might reveal splits in the GOP. The must-pass
measure is more than a spending bill; it is loaded with projects
for lawmakers' home districts and tax breaks for some businesses
and families.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans and Democrats will compete with one
another tonight for the last word in hopes of leaving behind the
impression that will influence voters in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   House members are already trying out arguments on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message that I'm bringing home is to the extent we have
accomplished anything positive, it is because the Democrats have
stood tall,'' said Representative James McGovern, a Worcester
Democrat. ``The 100,000 new teachers happened over the objections
of the Republican leadership and strong lobbying by (Speaker) Newt
Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the massive spending bill appears to have opened
an opportunity for Democrats to discuss the issues that they always
believed would help them win in November. Much as Clinton co-opted
Republican issues like balancing the budget and welfare overhaul,
Republicans are attempting to piggyback Democratic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats very clearly felt they had two silver bullets in
their pockets, education and health care,'' said Mary Crawford,
spokeswoman for the National Republican Campaign Committee. ``As it
turns out, neither is a silver bullet because we have been able to
demonstrate we have sound ideas that are in sync with what people
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Tierney, a Salem Democrat running for
reelection, said that his opponent, Peter Torkildsen, a Danvers
Republican and former two-term House member, had adopted education
and health care as his priorities as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so convinced that the only way to win is on the
Democratic message,'' said Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic priorities, including the tobacco bill,
restrictions on health maintenance organizations, and another
increase in the minimum wage wound up in the legislative graveyard.
But Democrats say that each defeat handed them a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats so totally outmaneuvered the Republicans that
they are forced to carry a Democratic message for the final two
weeks in order to survive in their own seats,'' said Representative
Edward J. Markey, a Malden Democrat.

   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton flew to a retreat on the
Maryland's Eastern Shore Monday for the fourth time in five days to
bolster Middle East peace talks, hours after a Palestinian
allegedly threw two hand grenades at a crowded bus stop in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the attack, which wounded 64 people, Israel
suspended, and then limited, negotiations at the fifth day of a
tense summit that had been already stalemated. Dropping the
official optimism that had surrounded the talks since it opened
Thursday, the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, admitted
that the grenade attack had hurt the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic and cowardly act that was committed this morning is
clearly a complicating factor,'' he said. ``It certainly makes it
more difficult to achieve what we were going to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority president, Yasser Arafat, telephoned
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from his cottage at the
Wye River conference center Monday morning to offer his
condolences. Nabil Aburdayney, Arafat's spokesman, said the attack
was ``an attempt to sabotage the peace talks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the talks did not founder completely. As the sun was setting
on the Chesapeake Bay, President Clinton managed to bring Netanyahu
and Arafat together for the first time since Friday, after he met
with each of them separately.
</P>
<P>
   Israel returned to the bargaining table early Monday afternoon,
but said it would deal only with security issues. The Israeli
delegation scuttled discussions over a new Palestinian airport and
the movement of Palestinian workers to and from the West Bank,
among other topics, until Arafat guarantees tougher treatment of
terrorists and the extradition of Palestinian criminals to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A Netanyahu adviser, David Bar-Illan, said that the attack was
the 10th in just over two months, and that the Palestinian
Authority had done little to bring terrorists to justice.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with his top Cabinet officials, Netanyahu said:
``For progress to be achieved on other issues, we must first focus
on security and terrorism. We are awaiting answers from the
Palestinians today.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Palestinian official, Yasser Abed Rabbo, dismissed
the Israeli position as ``cheap blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   The grenade attack attack buttressed Israeli arguments that any
ceding of West Bank land to Palestinians brings no guarantee of
safety from terrorism. According to one senior Israeli official, it
also ``backed Netanyahu into a corner'' by forcing him to harden
his negotiating stance for domestic political purposes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how concern for the talks, Jordan's King Hussein,
the elder statesman of the Middle East, left a cancer clinic in
Minnesota and flew to Washington to help Clinton revive the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had devoted dozens of hours to the talks since hosting
Netanyahu and Arafat at the White House on Thursday, and officials
said they still hope Israel will agree to withdraw from 13 percent
more of the West Bank, as US mediators have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials had hoped that the summit would end Sunday
night, the two contentious guests would sign a peace accord and
return to the Mideast by Monday.

67 HURT IN GRENADE ATTACK AT ISRAELI BUS STATION
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEERSHEBA, Israel _ As peace talks in Maryland entered their
fifth day, a grenade attack on a busy bus terminal in this modern
desert town Monday left 67 people wounded, one gravely, and cast a
shadow over the fragile negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   It began when a Palestinian man ran wildly through the bustling
station during the morning rush hour, drawing notice just as he
hurled a grenade at a shelter filled with young soldiers. The
soldiers heard a hissing sound and leaped to their feet screaming,
before the explosion chased and knocked them down.
</P>
<P>
   There was a silence, followed by the boom of a second grenade as
the soldiers, nose to the asphalt, realized that they were the
victims of a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Then the incident ended as sloppily as it began when the
attacker ran into a stopped bus whose driver pummeled him and held
him for the police.
</P>
<P>
   By Middle Eastern standards, it was an unsophisticated attack,
although it could not have been better timed to disrupt the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   No group admitted it. Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of the
militant Islamic organization Hamas, said he did not know if his
group was responsible, since, he said, its political and military
wings are separate. But he endorsed the attack in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The occupation exists, the resistance continues and this is a
link in a chain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the wounded were uniformed soldiers and
military students on their way back to a nearby army base and
school after a weekend break.
</P>
<P>
   Like the civilians _ commuters and bus station employees _ most
suffered superficial but painful shrapnel wounds. At noontime they
lay surrounded by flowers, relatives and army buddies at the Soroka
Hospital here, many with cellular phones tucked by their sides. All
wore tags with their victim numbers, which had been chalked into
the asphalt at the bus station, marking where they had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Tamar Glustron and Shelly Bental, both 19, friends and military
police officers, had been chatting about clothes when they first
noticed the man and heard the sibiliant sound as he pulled his
grenade key.
</P>
<P>
   Later that morning, stunned, they rested side by side in
hospital beds, pierced by shrapnel. Plastered with bandages, they
whimpered with pain and tried to put on brave faces after a visit
from President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember,'' Ms. Glustron said, ``pulling myself to my feet
and thinking: `No way. He wanted to kill me. He wanted to kill all
of us.' What for? It's for nothing that I was hurt. They feel so
helpless they know only to talk with violence. It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Hannah, sat bedside, squeezing her daughter's hand.
``The peace process should be accelerated so these things don't
happen again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, Dr. Naftali Meidan, the deputy director, said
two patients, a 14-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl, were in
serious condition after shrapnel penetrated their abdomens and
chests. A 47-year-old man was listed in critical condition after
undergoing hours of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the Palestinian, a West Bank resident, had confessed
to the attack. At a roadblock near Hebron, they later arrested four
other young Palestinian men driving an Audi, whom they suspected of
being his accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli radio report said the attacker lived in Dahariya, a
southern West Bank town under Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian security officials have identified him as Salem
Rajab al-Sarsour, 29, a construction worker and father of five from
the Palestinian side of Hebron, Reuters reported. His wife, in
traditional Islamic dress and sitting beneath a poster of Sheik
Yassin, said she would give praise to God if her husband turned out
to be the assailant _ ``a fighter for the sake of God,'' Reuters
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mordechai Nachmani, the police commander of the Negev region,
said, ``The person we are holding has told us that those who put
him up to it suggested this location as a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Israeli radio, the bus driver said, ``He ran into
the bus and fell.'' The driver, Avner Yaakov, continued: ``I fell
on him. I gave him a few good wallops, and within seconds civil
defense police had him in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Beersheba, a quiet, economically depressed town where
Israeli-born Jews, Israeli Arabs, Russian immigrants and Bedouins
coexist, has been immune from serious terrorist attacks until now,
even though it lies just south of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The usual frenzy that follows such attacks was absent. There
were few protesters, and none shouting, ``Death to the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours after the attack, as workers scrubbed blood
and flesh off the sidewalk, normal business resumed at the bus
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot function in fear,'' said Eli Cohen, 38, a bus
driver. ``I do take precautions, like looking at each passenger. If
I see someone who looks suspicious, who looks Arab or is carrying a
bag, I can stop and ask him for an ID, or take the bus right over
to the police station.''
</P>
<P>
   People even awaited their buses in the remains of the shelter
that had been blown nearly to bits. One, Sarah Waltner, a Holocaust
survivor with numbers tattooed on her forearm, perched on the edge
of a ragged chair that had lost its back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never afraid,'' she said. ``He who is destined to meet
death can't escape his destiny. What can we do? Even if it is
unusual in Beersheba, as a people we are used to it.''

PRESENT OR NOT, GATES IS CENTRAL FIGURE AT MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates didn't come to Washington Monday, and
both the government and Microsoft have made strategic decisions not
to summon him as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   But present or absent, Gates is very much at center stage in the
historic antitrust trial that began here Monday _ ``the single-most
important actor in the case,'' said New York state antitrust chief
Stephen Houck.
</P>
<P>
   During the government's opening statement, Houck attacked Gates
as the mastermind of the company's allegedly unlawful conduct,
showed unflattering videos taken during Gates' three-day
deposition, and displayed e-mail after e-mail written by and for
the Microsoft chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gates is legendary for his hands-on management style,''
said Houck, lead attorney for the 20 states and the District of
Columbia, which have joined the federal government in accusing
Microsoft of illegally anticompetitive practices. ``Mr. Gates has
personally formulated and directed key elements of Microsoft's
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government did not summon Gates as a witness, Houck
expressed shock that Microsoft didn't, either. Saying ``there is no
substitute for live testimony,'' Houck suggested that U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson should order Gates to testify at the
end of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``His failure to appear here can only be attributed to a lack of
intestinal fortitude,'' Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, the richest man in the world, has been attempting to
demonstrate that he is focused on the business of his company, and
not on the lawsuit. He has not made himself available to talk about
the case, but instead spent the last week visiting customers,
researchers, and employees in several states. He recently sent a
memo to his staff outlining his vision for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was questioned by the government for three days in late
August and early September, and yesterday the public got its first
view of that deposition in the form of four clips played in court.
The picture was unflattering _ a visibly uncomfortable Gates
appeared dwarfed and alone in a leather chair against a blank dark
background.
</P>
<P>
   By juxtaposing the clips with documents written to or for Gates
in 1995, Justice Department Special Trial Counsel David Boies
strongly suggested that Gates misreprentsed the company's practices
in his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In one clip, Gates said he was unaware of Netscape's activities
in mid-1995. The government then displayed memos written by Gates
at that time in which Gates discussed Netscape's activities.
</P>
<P>
   In another clip, Gates said he had nothing to do with setting up
a 1995 meeting between Microsoft and Netscape employees. But the
government showed a memo in which Gates seemed to be making
suggestions about what should happen at such a meeting: ``I think
there is a very powerful deal of some kind we can do with Netscape.
... I would really like to see something like this happen!!''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his deposition, Gates said his only recollection
of the Netscape meeting was ``somebody asked if it made sense for
us to consider investing in Netscape, and I said that didn't make
sense to me.'' But in a memo written by Gates in 1995, Gates said
of Netscape ``we could even pay them money _ buying some piece of
them or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officals were unimpressed by the criticism of the
company chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly unfortunate that the government is trying to
use out-of-context snippets and the deposition of Bill Gates to
prop up a lawsuit that's completely without merit,'' said company
spokesman Jim Cullinan.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyler Baker, a Dallas-based anti-trust expert, said Gates'
conduct in the deposition could influence the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge does conclude that Gates was the hands-on guy
driving the strategy for the company, and comes to the conclusion
that at his deposition he wasn't being credible, that could color
the judge's reaction to a lot that Microsoft has to say,'' Baker
said.

NEW YORK MAYOR TESTS THE POLITICAL WATERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
 HAMPSHIRE-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani set out on his
maiden voyage to New Hampshire Monday _ but don't let that make you
think he's running for president.
</P>
<P>
   He is off to Rhode Island Tuesday and two more states Wednesday,
making nearly 20 out-of-town political trips in the past six
months, but he would rather you not infer anything from that,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about running for president,'' he replied to
the fourth person who asked the question Monday, shortly after a
speech at Dartmouth College. ``Right now, I'm thinking about the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani, who has gained prominence in Republican circles
for winning twice in a traditionally Democratic city and for
cleaning up crime with what he calls ``Republican principles,'' is
certainly sounding like a candidate for something.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter Monday asked him what lessons he, an urban
mayor, could offer rural New Hampshire, he noted, ``New York is
both a city and a suburb. It may not be rural,'' he allowed, but
then added, on second thought, ``Parts of Staten Island might
qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   More teasingly, during his Dartmouth speech, when a student
asked if his policies in New York could be applied nationwide,
Giuliani replied, with a grin, ``We've never met before, right?''
Then he turned to an aide and said, ``How much do we owe him?''
Finally, he said to the audience, ``Yes.'' And the crowd _ more
than 500 students and faculty packed into an auditorium and
spilling out into the corridors _ laughed and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his intentions, Giuliani is being given the sort of
once-over that New Hampshirites are accustomed to giving
presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Several Dartmouth students said the turnout for his speech was
unusually large for any speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, in Bedford, Giuliani spoke before the
executive committee of the state's Republican Party. Steve Duprey
introduced him as one of the party's ``most dynamic leaders,'' who
``brings a message to New Hampshire that will be very well
received.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, as the members lined up to have their pictures taken
with him individually, Tom Rath, a long-active Republican in the
state, called Giuliani ``a formidable individual.'' It may be
``pretty late in the day,'' he said, for the mayor to form the sort
of network needed to run a presidential campaign, but it was not
out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Rath added, ``I cannot imagine the next Republican
administration without Rudy Giuliani having a very significant
voice in it.'' The party needs to deal with urban issues, he
explained, ``and nobody has dealt with them like he has.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dartmouth, Bedford, and here, last night, at a dinner of the
Nashua Republican Women's Club, Giuliani emphasized three basic
themes:
</P>
<P>
   First, New York is in better shape because of ``core Republican
ideas'' _ crimefighting, tax-cutting, less government, work over
welfare. Before he came along, Giuliani told the Republicans in
Bedford, ``New York City was in need of ideas that it had been
denied ... because it was in control of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   His second main point was that, regardless of its image in the
past, New York City really isn't very different from any other
American town. Its people have ``the same concerns, aspirations,
and fears as people anyplace,'' he said a number of times during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   His third main point was that the Republican Party needs more
people like Rudy Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   This last point he did not make explicitly, but it was
nonetheless clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you win an election,'' Giuliani said in Hanover, ``is
contesting for the other party's vote.'' He recalled that in 1980,
Ronald Reagan ``got elected by getting a lot of Democrats to vote
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, the mayor noted, ``I've won three campaigns in a
city as large as most states'' _ and in a city where Democrats
dominate Republicans by a 5-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   In Bedford, he said, to hearty applause, ``If we can increase
our percentage in cities, the next president of the United States
... will be a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the main reason for his trip here _ and other
states _ was to gin up support among the Republican committees to
hold the party's 2000 national convention in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter why he had come to New Hampshire, he
replied, ``I've had 10 different invitations. It seemed like now
was a good time.''

CLINTON BRINGS ARAFAT, NETANYAHU TOGETHER, BUT PROGRESS SCANT

   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton flew to a retreat on the
Maryland's Eastern Shore Monday for the fourth time in five days to
bolster Middle East peace talks, hours after a Palestinian
allegedly threw two hand grenades at a crowded bus stop in Israel.

HOUSE COMPLETES WORK ON SPENDING BILL; VOTE SET FOR TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite lede, update status of unabomber award and add 900
words.)  (lh) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From banning poison gas to financing more home care
for the elderly, lawmakers hurriedly hammered out policy issues
Monday night and put the final punctuation in the $500 billion
spending bill needed to keep the government open.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the final vote is set for Tuesday, Congress bought
itself extra time Monday by passing _ for the sixth time since the
Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year _ another measure to keep the
government running until midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress and the White House announced a general agreement
on Thursday and aides sat down to write that agreement into
specific language, the written length of the spending package has
ballooned from an estimated 3,000 pages to more than 4,000 pages,
and the cost appears to have bulked up by millions, as aides
uncovered the actual expense of many of the provisions in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an unusually disparate, catch-all package that
contains a third of the entire $1.7-trillion federal budget and an
array of policy decisions that most members of Congress will not
have a chance to read, let alone digest, until they vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last-minute additions are items like $325 million to
buy enriched uranium from Russia. As late as Monday evening,
negotiators first added but then yanked the $1 million reward in
the Unabomber case, which will go to David Kaczynski for turning in
his brother, Ted. The negotiators blamed a jurisdictional dispute
between two committees for the deletion. David Kaczynski has said
he would give the money to his brother's victims and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The major issues that congressional Republicans negotiated
Monday included home-health care, the regulation of truckers, a
provision over scrap metal and details of the 1997 Chemical Weapons
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the intense last-minute pressures being applied,
Republican leaders actually reversed a bill involving the Tennessee
Valley Authority, a bill that both houses had passed and that
President Clinton had already signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had eliminated the public subsidy for the sprawling
authority, which was created in 1933 by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt to tame the Tennessee River, provide power and spur
development in the region. But several Republicans from the area
protested in the last few days and managed to overturn the law.
They have now secured more than $1 billion over five years to help
the TVA refinance its high-interest debt and obtain a $50 million
subsidy for flood control and recreational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The new money for the TVA is part of the omnibus spending
package that Congress must pass to keep the government running. The
omnibus package is Congress' last, must-pass bill for the session,
and as such, it has become the last-chance vehicle for multiple
special interests that could not get their way otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who is chairman of the
transportation subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee,
had written a provision to tighten the safety regulations for
truckers. But the American Trucking Association, a major financial
contributor to the Republican Party, appealed to Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who deleted Wolf's provision.
</P>
<P>
   The final draft of the bill was filed Monday night with the
House, which is mandated by the Constitution to originate all
spending bills. The House is tentatively set for one hour of debate
on Tuesday night before voting.
</P>
<P>
   Once the House passes the bill, it moves to the Senate. Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has indicated that
the Senate may not insist on a roll-call vote. This means the
Senate would probably have no debate on the bill, and Senators
would not have to return to Washington, leaving passage of the bill
to a voice vote by those who chose to return.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a voice vote on such a huge package with so many
elements has raised the ire even of some Republicans. Perhaps the
harshest criticism came from Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who has
excoriated the Republican leadership as secret deal-makers and said
he would vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the founding fathers ever intended for a few
members and staff to make closed-door, arbitrary decisions on
almost one-third of the federal budget and then sneak it through on
a voice vote,'' he wrote in a letter to his colleagues Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said Lott wanted to avoid a roll-call vote
in part to avoid a public display of anger among Republicans over
the process and the result. But they also said that the complaints
were pushing Lott toward having a roll-call vote after all. In any
case, a Senate vote would probably not come until Wednesday, which
is why Congress and the White House agreed Monday night to extend
their deadline for passing the budget.

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Much of Monday's activity involved putting the finishing touches
on some of the broad-brushed agreements announced last week. This
included a $690-million antidrug package that Republicans are
hailing as one of their major achievements and as an issue where
they can distinguish themselves from Clinton, who originally sought
less than $200 million for antidrug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Indicating the sweep of the antidrug package, Republicans have
named it ``The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998.''
It provides money for ships, aircraft and state-of-the-art
drug-detection equipment and for 230 international antinarcotics
programs, a provision that has distressed some Republicans. The
bill calls for sending six Blackhawk helicopters to Colombia and
the rebuilding and export of 50 Vietnam-era UH-1H helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Some measures were of prime importance to individual members.
These included the reorganization of the State Department, a
longtime priority of Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization merges two agencies _ the U.S. Information
Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency _ into the State
Department. Helms has fought for the consolidations, saying the
foreign affairs bureaucracy was bloated. His critics view Helms as
an isolationist whose motive in the reorganization was to curtail
the involvement of the United States overseas, but he won the
crucial backing of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Some measures inserted in the final package in the last hours
were not voted on by either house, like a decision to provide more
money to the American Red Cross after a request by Elizabeth Dole,
the organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   Some measures passed only one chamber. These included a measure
passed by the House to give $1.7 billion over five years in
Medicare payments to home-health-care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is the Chemical Weapons Convention, which the
Senate passed in 1997 and the House never acted on.
</P>
<P>
   Including the convention in the omnibus package finally clears
the way for the United States to comply with the international
treaty, which bars the manufacture, stockpiling or use of poison
gas. It also allows the inspections of private U.S. chemical
companies by international inspectors, as called for in the treaty.
Without passage of the legislation, the United States has been in
technical violation of a treaty it strongly advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Jose M. Bustani, the director general of the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which oversees the treaty from
its headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands, said Monday that the
U.S. failure to pass the legislation would ``strike a fatal blow''
to the new treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at the United Nations, Bustani said other
governments were already bristling at the fact that U.S. companies
have not yet had to face inspections verifying that they were not
making weapons, as companies in their countries have faced.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would permit the inspections, but it would also
impose restrictions that Bustani and arms-control experts have
warned would undercut the enforcement of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions unilaterally give the president the right to
block surprise inspections on national security grounds and require
that all samples taken for analysis be tested in laboratories in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bustani, in a telephone interview after his address, said he
welcomed the passage of the legislation, but believed that the
Clinton administration would have to ask Congress to remove the
restrictions in the future or risk weakening the treaty. In
particular, he cited the limits on surprise inspections, something
the United States insisted on when the treaty was negotiated during
the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one country opts out of this,'' Bustani warned, ``others
will follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   In another measure of international concern, the omnibus package
also eliminates money for the U.N. Population Fund, a long-sought
goal of anti-abortion advocates who say that the agency supports
coerced abortions and forced sterilizations in China. Led by
conservatives in the House, the provision reduces to zero the $20
million that the United States contributed to the agency in the
1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill would return the United States to its
Reagan-era stance of not providing any money to the U.N. Population
Fund, which supports family planning and contraceptive activities
in poor countries. The Reagan and Bush administrations refused to
finance the agency from the mid-1980s until 1993, when that policy
was reversed by Clinton.

THREE FATAL SHOOTINGS JAR QUIET CALIFORNIA CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Drive-by shootings and tourists getting
shot in the street are not supposed to happen in this small city,
where the average house is valued at more than $500,000 and the
views of the ocean are priceless.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one homicide in Santa Monica in 1997. But in the
past week, this well-off city by the sea has been rocked by three
killings, including the slaying of a German tourist who was gunned
down during a street robbery on the last night of his American
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the week of death in Santa Monica,'' said Lisa Finn,
a resident who was taking photographs on Monday of a memorial of
flowers and candles set up for one of the victims in the parking
lot of a liquor store. ``What's going on?''
</P>
<P>
   At a crowded news conference Monday, the police tried to answer
Ms. Finn's question. They said that there was ``absolutely no
link'' between the killing of the tourist and the two other
slayings, which were part of a years-old street-gang rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Chief James Butts said the rivalry involved a Santa Monica gang
and a much larger gang from nearby Culver City and had escalated
into ``a very planned and orchestrated series of retaliations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have increased security citywide,'' Butts said. ``We
consider this to be very serious. We are out in extreme visible
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Tourists from around the world pour into
Santa Monica like the sunshine so many of them crave. They come for
the weather and the beaches and the chance to see one of the movie
stars who live here walking down the shop- and restaurant-lined
Third Street Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year nearly 2.4 million people visited Santa Monica,
leaving behind $516 million in tourist dollars. While crime has
been going down here, as in the rest of the country, as recently as
1991 there were 13 homicides. But homicides have been in the single
digits every year since. And Butts said, ``We're not an island.''
Los Angeles is just next door.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the city was concerned that the shootings might hurt
tourism, Butts said, ``This is not about public relations. This is
about public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The German tourist who was killed, Horst Fietze, 50, was a house
painter from Loebau in eastern Germany. He had saved for years to
vacation in the United States with his wife and another couple.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night, the friends were out for a walk. They were
scheduled to fly home the next day. The Germans were walking behind
a luxury hotel near the beach when they were approached by three
strangers, one of whom had a gun. The strangers demanded money.
There was a struggle, shots rang out, and Fietze's wife began to
scream. Her husband lay dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is German,'' said Ms. Finn, who also photographed a
makeshift memorial set up for Fietze, ``and his family says the
killing is really being talked about over there. My father-in-law
calls us after every disaster and tells us how awful the States
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested two people in connection with the slaying,
but released them because of lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours before Fietze was killed and about a half-mile
away, Omar Sevilla, 22, was returning to a drug-rehab center when a
car pulled up and the occupants asked him what gang he belonged to,
Butts said.
</P>
<P>
   Sevilla had been a member of the Culver City gang, known as the
Culver City Boys, but Butts said he did not know if Sevilla
responded before he was shot and killed. Peter Tigler, a member of
the Pico Neighborhood Association, where some of the shootings have
occurred, said Sevilla was related to a member of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   The killing continued on Saturday, when Juan Campos, 28, was
fatally shot in a market on Pico, where on Monday a dozen memorial
candles flickered in the wind. On a napkin placed on a bouquet of
flowers, someone had written a plea: ``Please stop the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Campos was a former gang member, the police said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday night, a 25-year-old man was shot in the back as he
entered his car, but he was not killed.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers responding to the gunfire chased a car into a
cul-de-sac. Two men, 19 and 18, got out, one of them holding an
assault rifle. The police fired. The men dropped the rifle and ran,
but were quickly captured and charged with attempted murder. They
were identified as members of the Culver City gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the publicity has implied that people are not safe
in Santa Monica,'' said a City Council member, Pam O'Connor.
``Nobody is happy about that. But this to us is an aberration and
not indicative to day-to-day living in Santa Monica.''

<P>
   LONDON _ As a Spanish judge broadened genocide charges against
him, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator detained
here for extradition hearings, indicated Monday that he would
resolutely oppose any attempt to try him in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's statement, made through his British lawyer, is the
first response since his arrest on Friday. It raised the question
of the length of the extradition hearings if the general's lawyers
use every possible form of appeal, up to the House of Lords, to
extend and challenge a process that in other recent cases has
continued for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising arrest, which came as Pinochet was recovering
from back surgery in a London clinic, has stoked a feud between the
government and opposition Conservatives. Prime Minister Tony
Blair's office insists that the detention was not a political act
and the Conservatives accuse the government of misusing the law to
political ends.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the case underscores the remarkable sea change in
political culture after last year's election, when the Labor Party
succeeded a Tory government that took no action against the general
on many previous visits here.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinochet, who once described Britain as ``the ideal place to
live'' and who provided the nation with one of its few allies in
the Falklands war, Friday's late-night arrest represented an
equally abrupt turnaround in the manner of the British authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Pinochet entered the United Kingdom with the full
prior knowledge of Her Majesty's government and with the approval
of the Foreign Office,'' his lawyer, Michael Caplan, said in the
statement. ``Upon his arrival he was treated as a VIP. Permission
for him to enter and stay in this country was stamped in his
diplomatic passport. Over recent years Pinochet has traveled
without hindrance to the U.K. on several occasions with the
approval of Her Majesty's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to extradite him from the United Kingdom will be
resolutely opposed. Both he and his family are confident of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Caplan would not answer a reporter's questions about whether
Pinochet would seek bail in the hearings or where he might be held.
He has been under police guard in the London Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish judges who are seeking his extradition have 40 days
from the time of his arrest to complete their formal request for
the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Britain rejects the argument that Pinochet is protected by
diplomatic immunity because he carries a diplomatic passport and is
a senator for life, a position he created, in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   British officials also said weighing extradition would not be
clouded by memories of the general's 17-year rule, during which his
regime shot on the streets or abducted an estimated 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet came to power in the blood-stained takeover that
toppled Dr. Salvador Allende Gossens, the left-wing leader who died
in the coup. Pinochet relinquished power in 1990, and is shielded
from prosecution in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw, who will ultimately make the decision
on extradition, said Monday in a radio interview: ``Gen. Pinochet's
record is well known. But so far as my position is concerned, I
will treat this extradition request by Spain in the same way as I
treat any other extradition request.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was initially detained on an international warrant that
alleged that he had been involved in the murder, torture and
genocide of 79 people. The Spanish judge who led the campaign for
arrest, Baltasar Garzon, said initially the victims whom he
enumerated were all Spaniards whose cases fell under Spanish
jurisdiction because of that country's genocide laws.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon widened the accusation Monday, seeking Pinochet's
detention on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism relating to
94 people, including citizens of Argentina, Britain, Chile and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This widens the request for provisional unconditional
imprisonment of Augusto Pinochet Ugarte for the reasons described
in this resolution on crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture,''
the expanded warrant said.
</P>
<P>
   It accused Pinochet of having ordered the ``physical
elimination, torture, kidnapping and disappearances'' of citizens
of other Latin American countries who were reported to have been
handed over to the Chilean secret police from 1976 to 1983.

   DENVER _ Two days after Vail broke ground on a controversial ski
area expansion, fires erupted Monday along a nearby, mile-long
mountain ridge, destroying three major buildings and damaging four
chair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to the nation's busiest ski area, the fires leveled
the resort's ski patrol headquarters, a mountain top shelter and
picnic area, and Two Elk Lodge, a 500-seat restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials would not speculate on a cause. ``It is not
impossible that this was an accident,'' said Kim Andree, a
spokeswoman at the Eagle County sheriff's office, who said that all
the buildings shared gas and electricity lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Nesselroad, a spokesman here for the U.S. Forest Service,
the area landowner, said, ``It's unlikely that it was a natural
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Vail, which last winter sold 1.6 million lift tickets, plans to
open on schedule, on Nov. 6, Paul Witt, a spokesman, said Monday
from the resort, 90 miles west of here. He said that the company is
evaluating damage to the chair lifts and is preparing an estimate
of the dollar losses.
</P>
<P>
   Mud on access roads, snow on the mountain top, and the
11,200-feet elevation hampered the work Monday of about 100
firefighters. Three hours before dawn, Vail fire fighters received
fire alarms from smoke detectors at the ski patrol building and at
the restaurant, according to the Eagle County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, the largest ski mountain in the United States, has the
most expensive lift ticket announced for Colorado this winter, $61.
This month, a poll of readers of Ski magazine rated Vail the top
ski resort in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fires come after months of controversy surrounding a
plan by Vail to expand into 885 acres of National Forest land.
Environmental groups have fought the expansion, arguing that it
would destroy lynx habitat and would further real estate
development and traffic congestion on the edges of the White River
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a
request for an emergency injunction, clearing the way for Vail to
start work. Racing the onset of winter, Vail started preliminary
work on Friday, largely building fences. Tree clearing for trails
and lifts was to begin later this week.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the fires, which were
condemned by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If arson is indeed the cause, we would hope that those
responsible would be brought to justice and prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law,'' said Ted Zukowski, a Boulder attorney
who represents six groups that filed suit last June to block the
expansion. ``Any purposeful destruction of public lands resources
or facilities is absolutely abhorrent to us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month, the expansion plan provoked the University of
Colorado to cancel its ski bus service from the Boulder campus to
four ski areas owned by Vail Resorts: Vail, Keystone, Breckenridge
and Beaver Creek. On Monday, Joan Schunck, a student leader of the
boycott, said, ``We condemn any action that is destructive and
dangerous to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the expansion has also come from the 11th Mountain
Alliance, a group of about 210 back country skiers and snowboarders
who complain that Vail wants to bar them from a back country area
of National Forest in order to compensate for the ski area's
expansion into possible lynx habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx have not been sighted in the disputed area since 1973. But
Zukowski noted that lynx tracks were seen there in the 1991,
adding, ``The only reason the Forest Service has not found any lynx
back there is they haven't looked.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ To those who know McKesson Corp. President and CEO
Mark Pulido, the deal to acquire Atlanta-based HBO &AMP; Co. doesn't
come as a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark does not want to finish second,'' said Mike Krensavage,
an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ``He has a
good track record. I would not sell him short in terms of
accomplishing the goals he's laid out _ the company does have the
potential of making the health care system more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in August 1997, McKesson's top rival, Cardinal
Health Inc., announced it would merge with Berger Brunswig. Not to
be outdone, within a month Pulido announced plans to buy
AmeriSource Health Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When federal regulators derailed that plan, citing antitrust
concerns, Pulido vowed the decision would not end his drive to grow
the company through acquisitions _ and began a series of smaller
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cardinal said it planned to buy Allegiance Corp. in a
deal valued at $5.4 billion. McKesson countered with the HBO &AMP; Co.
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Tucson, Ariz., Pulido, 46, joined San
Francisco-based McKesson in May 1996. Since then, the company's
shares have increased nearly fourfold. Last month, shares of
McKesson, the nation's largest wholesaler of pharmaceuticals,
traded at 52-week high of $96.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great job growing the company at 25 to 30 percent
annually,'' said Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido, an industry veteran, will continue to hold the position
of CEO with the new company.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson's stock closed Monday at $76, down $12.68 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both companies know what they're doing and both
companies are determined this is going to be a good deal, even if
it's not exactly obvious to the market right now,'' said
Abramowitz.

   CEO acted decisively to refocus company
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles McCall wasn't known as a turnaround artist
when he was tapped to head HBO &AMP; Co. in December 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't even know much about hospitals or the health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   What he did know was the information technology business, an
industry in which he had spent more than two decades climbing the
corporate ladder. That technical know-how, coupled with a keen
financial sense, helped McCall take HBO &AMP; Co. on a remarkable ride.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's the nation's leading health care software and
services company, with a financial track record that's made it the
top performer among Georgia public companies for the past two
years. Its shares appreciated almost 1,400 percent in the five-year
period through 1997, ranking HBO &AMP; Co. second among Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 companies in stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a dumpy little company, and then Charlie came
in,'' said Michael Samols, who follows HBO &AMP; Co. for BancBoston
Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly articulated the company's strategy and then
executed successfully,'' Samols said. ``It's not that common for
someone to stick to their strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co.'s board searched for nearly a year to find McCall, who
replaced retiring company co-founder Walter Huff. McCall's
immediate challenge was to pump new life into a complacent staff,
while overhauling an aging product line and whipping the lackluster
financials into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought his actions were radical _ but the results were
well received.
</P>
<P>
   He sold off HBO &AMP; Co.'s hardware maintenance division and
combined the two remaining divisions, laying off about 10 percent
of the 1,500-member staff and taking a major write-off.
</P>
<P>
   He shifted the company's software line from an outmoded
proprietary mainframe platform to more flexible ``open'' software
systems, which could run on different kinds of computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gutsy move to divest the company of its money-losing
businesses and then to make a bold move into the software
business,'' said Charles Trafton, an analyst with Adams, Harkness &AMP;
Hill, who said McCall's strength was having the guts ``to shed what
wasn't working and go after what he thought would.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's other key strategy _ growing the company through more
than 17 acquisitions and scores of alliances _ rounded out the
turnaround plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rest on your laurels,'' McCall said in an earlier
interview with Investor's Business Daily. ``You have to constantly
be developing new products to take back to your expanding customer
base. That's what I tried to bring here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa native has been richly rewarded for his success at HBO
&AMP; Co., where his $52.1 million compensation package made him the
highest-compensated chief executive of a Georgia-based company in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   McCall cut his teeth in the industry as a salesman for IBM after
earning a bachelor's degree in business administration from the
University of Iowa and a master's degree in business
administration/finance from Roosevelt University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years at IBM, he spent 14 years with CompuServe Inc.,
rising from a sales post to president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Now that HBO &AMP; Co. has agreed to be acquired by the nation's No.
1 drug wholesaler, San Francisco-based McKesson Corp., McCall will
become chairman of the merged company, McKesson HBOC.
</P>
<P>
   For years, McCall has talked of a plan to retire within a
five-year window.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he closed on a $3.76 million waterfront estate in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., complete with seven bedrooms, a guest house,
a five-car garage and a 20-person Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   There's 234 feet of dockage _ with room to spare after he docks
Daybreak, his 100-foot yacht.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect him to stay (with McKesson) for more than a
year,'' Samols said. ``He's made his mark. I think he's ready to
relax.''

 &HT;    Class-action suit against tobacco industry gets underway
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One in a wheelchair, others with scars from radical
surgeries, a handful of sick smokers gathered in a courtroom here
Monday for the start of the first class-action lawsuit ever to go
to trial against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with stacks of new documents from recent courtroom
battles, attorneys for as many as 500,000 Florida smokers hope to
make cigarette companies pay up to $200 billion. Their lawsuit
alleges the companies created a harmful, defective product, then
lied and conspired to cover up its addictive powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have a choice between truth and clever calculations,
between truth and public relations,'' said Stanley Rosenblatt, the
Miami attorney representing the sick smokers. ``The evidence will
show that this is an industry that has never accepted
responsibility for the devastating health consequences caused by
its products.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the five major U.S. tobacco companies and two
industry support groups today will rebut Rosenblatt's opening
statement. The trial is expected to take months. Jury selection
began in July and wasn't completed until last week, when attorneys
agreed on a panel of four men and two women_after rejecting more
than 900 other prospective jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers are on familiar turf.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them tangled last year, when Rosenblatt took a case to
trial in which airline flight attendants sued the tobacco
companies, claiming that second-hand smoke inhaled in stuffy
airliners made them ill. That claim was also a first, and while the
case never went to a jury, Rosenblatt obtained a $349 million
settlement to fund medical studies and cover the costs of the
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both sides have insisted repeatedly that there
will be no settlement in the current case.
</P>
<P>
   If Rosenblatt wins, it might open the doors to a flood of other
class action cases, which carry the potential for huge jury awards
because they often represent thousands of plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The case is separate from the national tobacco settlement
reached last year by the companies and some 40 states, which would
limit lawsuits against the industry. That agreement has yet to win
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The case also is not related to the State of Florida's $12
billion settlement with the industry, which was reached in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff in the case is Dr. Howard Engle, a retired
Miami Beach pediatrician who has emphysema and has tried
unsuccessfully to quit smoking. Other plaintiffs have lost their
vocal chords and must talk with electric buzzer devices, or have
had other disfiguring surgery as a result of what they claim are
their smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury won't hear from the plaintiffs unless the jury
finds the tobacco industry liable in the trial's first phase. Such
a finding would send the trial into phase two, in which the
individuals would make their claims to the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers are expected to rely on what has become a
standard defense: that the public has known of smoking's dangers
for decades, that their product is legal and that smokers must bear
responsibility for their decision to take up the habit.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt contests all those points, and outlined his case with
a quick history lesson for the jury.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the first medical studies in the 1940s and 1950s that
linked cigarettes to lung cancer, and held up a poster of the
tobacco industry's famous ``frank statement'' that was published in
newspapers across the country in 1954 after those health concerns
grabbed national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence will show that statement is a bald-faced lie,''
Rosenblatt said, referring to a portion of the ``frank statement''
in which the industry claimed that it shared its customers'
concerns over the health consequences of smoking. ``What has been
paramount is profits.''

 &HT;    Detectives attempt to sort out triple murder at Atlanta Hilton
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of three men shot to death execution-style in a
downtown Atlanta hotel this weekend was a Gainesville, Ga. trucking
dispatcher who had ventured to the city to see a football game with
two out-of-state clients, the victim's father said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Dover, 31, a dispatcher for a trucking broker, had made
plans to meet two Florida clients at the Atlanta Hilton and Towers
on Sunday and then all three were supposed to attend the Atlanta
Falcons-New Orleans Saints game, Clarence Dover said.
</P>
<P>
   Although police have said they believe the Sunday morning
slayings were possibly drug-related and probably not a random act,
Dover said his son was not involved in drugs or anything that would
have made him a target for such violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an awful thing that's happened to my son,'' Dover said
from his Gainesville home. ``He was not a violent person. He had
never even gotten into a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover spent the day talking to Atlanta homicide detectives as
they tried to piece together what happened on the 24th floor of the
upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Dover and two men Dover's father identified as owners of
a trucking company in central Florida were found shot to death in
room 2417 by a hotel maid.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Chief C.B. Jackson said all three had been killed
between midnight Saturday and 8 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide detectives fielded several calls from people in Florida
and Georgia who thought some of the victims might be their
relatives, said Maj. Mickey Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to get a positive I.D. on the victims yet
because we still don't feel comfortable,'' Lloyd said. ``We're
talking to several people who may be family members and friends and
we may have something at noon on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is all three men were shot in the back of the head
after being forced to strip down to their underwear, police said.
All three bodies were found close to each other, Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Kiesel, deputy chief medical examiner for Fulton
County, said it was obvious from the position of the bodies that
the killings were intentional and deliberate. He declined to
disclose other details of the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were no guests occupying the rooms adjacent to room
2417 on Sunday, Hunter George and his wife, Pat, from Birmingham,
stayed in room 2408 across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   George said the maid who found the bodies at about 8 a.m. had
knocked on his door as he was leaving to get coffee and a
newspaper, shortly before the gruesome discovery was made. George
said he told the maid he wasn't ready for his room to be cleaned.
When he returned from the lobby, he found the maid crying and being
consoled by another Hilton employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were across the hall but we didn't see anything or hear
anything,'' George said. ``It was amazing to me that you could have
three shots and not hear anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Lloyd said he hoped more information would become available
later today, including the identities of the other two men and a
motive for the slayings. ``Right now we're looking at everything
from prostitution to a robbery to drugs. We can't rule anything
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dover said he is sure it was not drugs: ``My son was not
into drugs. He was nice guy. He was just in the wrong place at the
wrong time.''

 &HT;    Injury forces Tech into team approach
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bobby Cremins' worst fears were confirmed Monday
morning when Georgia Tech star guard Dion Glover flunked an MRI
test on his injured left knee, confirming that he not only has an
anterior cruciate ligament tear but also damage to his medial
collateral ligament.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 6-foot-5 sophomore definitely will miss the
1998-99 season. The normal recuperation period for an injury of
that magnitude is 12 months, Tech basketball trainer David Chewning
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit shell-shocked,'' Cremins said. ``I've never
had this happen to a team of mine before. But Mark Price called and
said he had the same injury and he made the NBA All-Star team 14
months later.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Jones, Tech's 7-foot center, is the lone returning starter
from last year's 19-14 team. Jones averaged 6.8 points per game,
while backup forward Jason Floyd averaged 6.4 points. With reserve
guard T.J. Vines' 2.6 points per game, the Yellow Jackets enter the
season with a total of 16 points a game from its three most
experienced players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are going to have to step up,'' Cremins said.
</P>
<P>
   If Tech were to start the season tomorrow, Jones would open at
center, Jon Babul at power forward, Floyd at the No. 3 position,
Vines at shooting guard and freshman Tony Akins at point.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Collier, the 7-1 transfer from Indiana, will be eligible
after six games, taking over the power forward slot and moving
Babul to swingman.
</P>
<P>
   Cremins said Glover's injury will force him to approach the
season differently. ``We might have to play a little bit more
conservatively,'' he said. ``We're going to have to try to get the
ball inside more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows there's going to be more touches now that we
don't have a high scorer returning,'' Jones said. ``I think I'll be
able to show more, add a little more offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking we're going to have to do it as a team,'' said
Akins, who will be thrust into the spotlight immediately. ``With
Dion, if we got in trouble, we could give it to him. Now, I feel
like I'm going to have to shoot more. But I'm not thinking so much
of scoring but thinking of the ball being in my hands more.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier, once he is eligible, will join Akins as the most
scrutinized players on the floor. Collier said he can help take up
some of the scoring slack, although he averaged only 10.7 in second
year for the Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think I'm capable of being a scorer,'' he said. ``At
Indiana, it was more of a scoring-type offense, where everybody got
an equal amount of shots. Down here, they might give me some
opportunities I didn't have at Indiana.''

JONES LAWSUIT DOCUMENTS REVEAL BITTER GIVE-AND-TAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The supposedly defunct Paula Jones lawsuit produced
another burst of documentation on Monday detailing the visceral
nature of a confrontation that President Clinton said allowed Mrs.
Jones to ``rummage'' through the intimate life of the nation's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the civil suit was dismissed as without merit on April 1,
the president faced sweeping demands from Mrs. Jones' lawyers for
information about his sexual conduct over a 20-year period. The
demands included the names of women with whom he had had sexual
relations, consensual or not, as well as the names of people who
had arranged private meetings between Clinton and any female
outside his office.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers, who narrowed their requests after Clinton's
lawyers objected, also demanded the names of doctors ``who
performed surgery or other procedures on the president's
genitalia.''
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of pages of sealed documents made public Monday by
Judge Susan Webber Wright of U.S. District Court in Little Rock,
Ark., provided little substantive news, particularly since excerpts
of the depositions of Clinton, Mrs. Jones and others were released
last March. But the material offered a further measure of the
heated struggle at the heart of the lawsuit that ignited the
impeachment threat the president is now facing.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, released on the eve of the Jones lawyers' effort
to revive the suit before a federal appeals court in St. Paul,
Minn., served as a reminder of the continuing power of the Jones
accusations to haunt the president.
</P>
<P>
   His sworn testimony in the Jones suit denying an intimate
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, became the
root of perjury charges recommended to Congress last month by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   As lawyers for both sides headed to the appeals court, Mrs.
Jones' representatives continued to insist that a last-minute cash
settlement with the president was possible. But over the weekend,
the White House rejected as impractical a $2 million proposal that
demanded $1 million of the president and relied on another $1
million from Abe Hirschfeld, a New York real-estate magnate.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the appeals court will issue a decision
before Congress completes its impeachment inquiry. The president's
defenders have emphasized that the Jones lawsuit underlying the
proposed perjury allegations was dismissed. The suit's
reinstatement presumably might weaken that argument, although
Congress is not bound by any court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the newly released documentation focused on the effort
by Judge Wright to determine which side was leaking information in
violation of her order not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of affidavits, no principal on either side admitted
to being the source for any of the sensational revelations fed to
journalists during the four-year-long litigation process. For
example, the court curtailed the Jones team's requests about the
president's genitalia but not before reports of ``distinguishing
characteristics'' surfaced and were denied by Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, some of the documents are steeped in irony, if not
prophecy, as when Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, moving last Jan. 12 to
quash her subpoena from the Jones lawyers, said, ``Merely being
associated with this case, in any fashion, will leave an indelible
mark upon her.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an affidavit in which she was then publicly identified only
as ``Jane Doe No. 6,'' Ms. Lewinsky denied having a sexual
relationship with Clinton, a denial she later recanted after Starr
targeted Clinton and granted her immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones, a state employee when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas, claimed that she was sexually accosted by Clinton in a
hotel room in Little Rock in 1991 and rebuffed him, and as a result
suffered job discrimination and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he could not recollect meeting Mrs. Jones, Clinton denied
the incident and rejected her subsequent demand for an apology in
settlement negotiations. Danny Ferguson, a former Arkansas state
trooper and co-defendant in the suit, testified that he did take
Mrs. Jones to meet Clinton, but at her request, not his.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the case, Judge Wright ruled that there was no
evidence that Mrs. Jones suffered any damages even if her
accusations were presumed to be true. By then, Starr was already
conducting a separate criminal inquiry into possible perjury and
witness tampering, focusing on the president's Jan. 17 deposition
in the Jones case denying an affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In August, after seven months of flat denials, the president
reversed himself before the nation, admitting that he had been
misleading in his testimony but insisting that he was legally
correct under the narrow terms of the Jones deposition because he
had had oral sex, not intercourse, with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the skirmishing before Judge Wright, the president's legal
team objected that he was being asked broadly worded questions
about all women he had known socially or professionally across a
20-year span. This was denounced as an ``unbridled discovery into a
defendant's private consensual activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge eventually narrowed this to the question of whether he
had had any sexual relations with women who were government
employees after 1986. ``None,'' Clinton answered.
</P>
<P>
   The new documents also detail the fruitless efforts by the
president's lawyers to obtain detailed information about Mrs.
Jones' legal defense fund _ a drive that Clinton supporters
contended could supply evidence that Mrs. Jones was pressing the
suit for financial gain and political vindictiveness against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the litigation, the president's lawyers noted that Mrs. Jones
had never sought any psychological counseling or other professional
help after the alleged incident, despite her claims of severe
emotional distress. Mrs. Jones countered in a deposition: ``My only
counselors are the Lord, my husband and mother. (The Lord is
helpful but my husband can talk back.)''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers contended that her husband, Steve, was a
driving force in the suit out of personal and political animus
toward the president. ``We're going to find out everything,'' they
quoted Jones as vowing in one news interview after the U.S. Supreme
Court unanimously ruled that the lawsuit could go forward without
damaging the nation's business.

OCTOBER'S FANS CLIMB ABOARD YANKEE BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By N.R. KLEINFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing else matters. Nothing else, it seems, is
permitted to matter: only the nine-inning tallies and intervening
dramas of a handful of baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, either you're into baseball these days or you're
totally out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, and especially over the weekend when
the reality of the World Series finally manifested itself on the
field of Yankee Stadium, disparate strands of New York have been
transformed into that idiosyncratic and much-studied taxonomic
group known as the fan. Suddenly the most important thing in the
world seems to be whether a team that has already won a
preposterous 23 championships in 75 years will insist on one more.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees prepare for Game 3 on Tuesday night against the
Padres in San Diego, with New York ahead two games to none and the
scent of sweep in the air, people who all year long have paid
incidental attention to batters swatting balls and pitchers
throwing smoke have become caught up in mass homage to a team that
is nothing less than a victory machine.
</P>
<P>
   It is something that baseball does, especially in New York,
where a sense of entitlement to baseball sovereignty is almost
primal, and especially in this magical year enlivened by the
enthralling pursuit of a ghost's home run record and the voracious
accumulation of victories by a Yankee team striving to be engilded
as the greatest of all.
</P>
<P>
   People in the area have been absorbed into this deliberate,
elegant, endlessly complex pastime almost against their will,
unable to resist the ceaseless murmurings about the Series and the
mighty Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   That is how it unfolded for Marla Rodriguez, who up until now
has unapologetically loathed baseball. She is 32 and works in
sports media relations at Rutgers University. Football is her
abiding passion, entranced as she is by its savage aggression and
that ``people are always hitting each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally hate baseball,'' she said. ``It's very boring.
Nothing ever happens. It's too slow.'' Whenever someone turned a
baseball game on the television, she became angry.
</P>
<P>
   But every day in the last few weeks, wherever she went, the
banter was incessantly about the Yankees and the Series. Almost
hypnotically, she has become a full-throated Yankee rooter. Now she
turns the baseball games on. When she speaks about the team, she
refers to it as ``we.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' she said, perplexed herself. ``It's
exciting now. It's close to home. I'm starting to relate, wow, what
it's like playing for the World Series. Until a few weeks ago, I
didn't know who David Wells was. Now I know he's a big guy and he
throws a mean fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the consuming and comforting divertissement of baseball
has been seen as something of a mercy gift. So many people are by
now fully spent from hearing salacious tales of misbehavior in
Washington and hyperventilating about the capricious stock market.
They would rather dwell on who is batting .401 than their own 401.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it seems, people have grown somewhat more accustomed to
players who perpetually put on new uniforms in pursuit of Gross
National Product-like salaries. It is hard not to adore a team of
so much harmony and so little swagger, with frolicsome players
named Boomer and El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and the World Series have this consciousness-altering
effect in a way that other sports do not. The Super Bowl is big,
but it is a solitary game, not the elastic, emotional unfolding
that the World Series is, and it is not local. There is no home
team.

   ``Baseball's older,'' said Roger Angell, the New Yorker editor
who often writes about the sport. ``It has an echo, a ring to it.
It's a series. It's not one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the October idolators are of this distinctly different
subspecies from the true fan, the highly emotive, coarse-talking
enthusiast who ingests the sport on a daily basis. The true fan
knows the players, knows their averages, knows who hits in the
clutch and who chokes. Most of all, of course, the true fan knows
much more than the manager does.
</P>
<P>
   But come World Series time, anybody and everybody puts on the
cap and talks the talk. Anybody can give advice to Joe Torre and
expect him to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pablo Oviedo, 33, of Kings Park, N.Y. He came to the United
States a few years ago from Colombia. He found out who Jackie
Robinson was only when the Interboro Parkway changed its name in
his honor. No matter. Though he continues to feel the World Cup is
more exciting, Oviedo is on the Yankee express these days. He's
talking the plays, getting his grounding. He needs Torre's phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Clay, the manager of the Lids baseball cap store in the
Poughkeepsie Galleria Mall, was deluged with business for Yankee
headgear during the weekend. ``It's crazy,'' he said. ``We get
people who didn't watch a ballgame all year coming in here now and
they know the exact rotation of the players and the time of each
game.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Dwork, 33, lives in Manhattan and is the senior brand
manager for Tic-Tac breath mints at Ferrero USA. ``I've been to two
baseball games in my life and they were corporate functions, which
means I didn't watch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have an inkling of what or who a designated hitter
is.
</P>
<P>
   Details, details. She has been swept up by the mania and is
watching the games, gaining an education along with enjoyment.
``The whole city is buzzing about this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, a friend of hers who is a portfolio manager
shrugged off her investment doldrums and gave a World Series party
for about 50 people, Ms. Dwork included, in the rooftop common room
of her Manhattan high rise. The innings, in their slow and ordered
fashion, crept by. And, oh, the taut drama of it all. The Yankees
led, the Padres led, the Yankees led. Ms. Dwork sort of gave up
with the Yankees down 5-2. Then she was introduced to the grand
slam. ``I didn't realize that games could have such high scores,''
she said. Life was good. Runs were up, what matter if stocks were
down.
</P>
<P>
   There is no escaping, though, that the swelling ranks of Yankee
fans in October is not easy on the adherents who follow the team
with an intensity all season long. While perhaps they welcome the
magnified support that arrives this time of year, they also resent
that so many of the latecomers get the box seats to the Series
games while they are stuck on their couch at the biggest moment of
all.
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Levine's friends worry about her mental health, her
fealty to the Yankees is so complete. She is 20, a senior at
Columbia University, studying psychology. She makes it to virtually
every home game, settling into the harsh discomfort of the
bleachers. ``I'm a bleacher creature,'' she said proudly. She
checks into the Yankee Web site at least 10 times a day, seeing
what's up. ``When the Yankees lose, I cry,'' she said. ``I'm not
kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Her room is a shrine to the Yankees. Its walls are adorned with
Yankee posters. Its shelves are crammed with Yankee souvenirs. She
is nourished by the numbers and exploits of one baseball team.
``You should see my credit card bills,'' she said. ``It's all
Yankee tickets, Yankee food, Yankee tickets, Yankee food, maybe a
Love's drugstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she skipped classes for three days and spent 30 hours
outside Yankee Stadium in the hope of acquiring World Series
tickets, but got none. She is bitter about the interlopers who will
be there. ``I think it's awful,'' she said. ``I know the players, I
know their wives' names, I know their kids' names. Tino's wife is
Marie. Andy's wife is Laura. They have a son Josh.''
</P>
<P>
   She sighed. ``It takes a lot of work not to have a life,'' she
said. ``It's an everyday thing.''

SPANISH JUDGE EXPANDS CHARGES AGAINST FORMER CHILEAN DICTATOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Spanish judge who ordered the arrest here of the
former Chilean military dictator, General Augusto Pinochet,
expanded the charges yesterday to include the deaths of 94 people
from five different countries, including Americans.
</P>
<P>
   By specifying that Pinochet is wanted for ``genocide, terrorism
and torture,'' Judge Baltasar Garzon sought to answer criticism of
Spanish and British authorities that they had arrested Pinochet in
violation of the principle of diplomatic immunity. Under
international law, diplomatic immunity does not apply in cases of
genocide and certain human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Garzon had suggested that Pinochet was wanted for
questioning in the deaths of 79 people, but Monday's warrant added
15 more victims and clarified that they were not just Spanish
nationals but also from Britain, Argentina, Chile and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 to 1990, Pinochet ruled Chile with an iron hand,
imprisoning and, it is widely alleged, often killing political
opponents or those considered to support them. Investigations by
governments and human rights organizations found that more than
3,000 people had been killed and another 1,000 had ``disappeared''
during Pinochet's 17-year reign. Like many dictators who used
intimidation and murder to prop up their regimes in Central and
South America during the 1970s and 1980s, Pinochet negotiated an
accord in which he stepped down in return for not being prosecuted
in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   But Garzon and British officials acting with the approval of
Prime Minister Tony Blair have challenged the immunity to which
Pinochet believed he was entitled because he is a senator for life
in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet vowed Monday to fight efforts to extradite him to
Spain. Michael Caplan, a lawyer with the London firm of Kingsley
Napley, which is representing Pinochet, said the former dictator
had entered the country with the approval of the British
government, and with a diplomatic passport. Caplan said Pinochet
had been treated as a VIP until Friday night, when officers
descended on his room at the London Clinic, a hospital where he is
recuperating from a herniated disk.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Blair said British authorities had acted
legally when they received an extradition request from Spain, with
Britain among the 15 nations in the European Union. Earlier, a
British Home Office spokesman acknowledged that Pinochet had been
traveling under a diplomatic passport, but said immunity applies
only to a serving head of state or diplomats specifically assigned
to Britain. Besides that, British officials said, international law
does not recognize diplomatic immunity in cases of genocide and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of activity Monday as Chilean diplomats tried
to work out a deal by which Pinochet would be deported rather than
extradited. Mario Artaza, Chile's ambassador to Britain, emerged
after meeting with British Foreign Office officials to insist that
``Chile is not trying to shield him from the wrath of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect our institutions. We're trying to
protect someone who is traveling on a Chilean diplomatic passport.
We're trying to protect someone who is a senator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, an avowed Anglophile, has visited London regularly in
recent years. He has shopped at Burberry's, admired the city's
memorials, and said he was most attracted to Britain because it was
``civilized.'' But now Chilean diplomats accuse Britain of thumbing
its nose at one of the bedrocks of civilization _ international
law.
</P>
<P>
   Chileans are not the only ones criticizing the detention.
Michael Howard, foreign affairs spokesman for the Conservative
Party, suggested Pinochet's arrest had been aimed at appeasing
Labor Party members who say that Blair, the Labor leader, has sold
out many party principles.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Mandelson, the secretary for trade and industry and
one of Blair's closest aides, said it was ``gut-wrenching'' and
wrong to suggest that diplomatic immunity should apply to someone
with Pinochet's human rights record.

YANKS HOLD 2-0 LEAD, AND PLENTY OF CAUTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cigar was held snugly between the fingers of Orlando Hernandez
as he confidently strolled down a corridor after Game 2 of the
World Series. He had just huffed and puffed and blown the Padres
down, and the cigar was the Cuban pitcher's reward.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not as if the Yankee pitcher had just plucked it out
of a cigar box being passed around the clubhouse on Sunday night.
There was no cause for celebration after taking a 2-0 lead in the
World Series. No reason to warm up the convertibles for a parade.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knows the flimsiness of a 2-0 lead in the World
Series, it is the Yankees. It was just two years ago when the
Yankees wrote the inspirational guide on comebacks as they
recovered from a 2-0 deficit and stunned the Atlanta Braves to win
the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it can be done, because we were down, 2-0, in '96,''
Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter said after the Yankees won, 9-3, on
Sunday night. ``San Diego is not going to give up. They are going
to play every game from here on out like it's Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure of the Padres' desperation will be on display for
Game 3 in San Diego Tuesday night. David Cone will start for the
Yankees. And providing that he is healthy enough, Sterling
Hitchcock will pitch for the Padres. Perhaps going home will be the
perfect antidote for the untimely ills that have left the Padres'
pitching staff swilling chicken soup. Even Kevin Brown, the Padre
ace with the steel-plated intensity, was left popping antibiotics
before and after his unsteady outing in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one concern is this bug that's going around,'' Padre
Manager Bruce Bochy said. ``It hit the pitching staff, and that
does affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a trickle-down effect that has helped the Yankees avoid
facing the devilish stare of closer Trevor Hoffman. Either because
of sickness or the fact that the Yankees will foul off a half dozen
pitches to get the one they want, the Padre starters have worn down
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being patient,'' Jeter said. ``We are running the
counts in our favor. If you do that, you can take advantage of
their mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams was proof of that. He took the first two pitches
for strikes from the Game 2 starter, Andy Ashby, in the second
inning, then worked the count full as he fouled off several
pitches. On the ninth pitch of his at-bat, Williams drove a two-run
homer to left-center field. When Ashby was mercifully lifted in the
third inning, he had thrown 66 pitches. When Brown was taken out
after six and a third innings, he had thrown 106 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Once a starter has left early, the Padres have been forced to
use their weak middle relievers, who have come in only to make
matters worse. By the time the eighth or ninth inning rolls around,
the Yankees have built such gaudy leads that there has been no
score for Hoffman to keep tight, much less something to close.
</P>
<P>
   More than statistics alone, Hoffman's absence indicates just how
dominant the Yankees have been offensively. When the Padres have
been able to gather some runs, the Yankees have countered by
dwarfing their efforts with innings resembling football scores in
the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mind giving up a run here or there,'' Bochy said,
but big innings are a problem. ``They have hurt us the last two
games,'' he said. ``It sure is hard to overcome, especially against
a team like New York.''
</P>
<P>
   But overcome, they must. If the Padres cannot find an answer to
the dominating Yankees or a cure for what ails them, history will
wipe them away like crumbs on a table. They will become just
another team that could not come back from a 2-0 deficit. Of the 44
previous teams that have led, 2-0, 33 have gone on to win the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad it is a best-of-seven,'' Bochy said. ``Down 0-2 is
not the situation we were hoping for, but, hey, it has been
overcome before.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are plenty of Yankees who realize this; 1996 was not that
long ago. And there are plenty of Padres who remember it, too. Jim
Leyritz, for one. He was the Yankee who stuck out his bat and
bridged the gap over the impossible for his team. Leyritz is well
remembered for the Game 4 home run he hit off Atlanta's Mark
Wohlers in the 1996 World Series, a three-run, game-tying
morale-booster for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Game 3 and coming back to win Game 4, nothing
seemed unreachable for the Yankees. With the vision of 1996 as a
firm reminder, the Yankees understand that a 2-0 lead provides no
cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' Yankee Manager Joe Torre said.
``Believe me, we don't take anything for granted. The Padres are a
good team. They had a 5-2 lead on us in Game 1. They have come
through some tough series against Houston and Atlanta, so you know
how good they are.''
</P>
<P>
   They were not good enough to decode Hernandez's stuff in Game 2.
In the afterglow of his performance, he was puffing on a cigar, but
few Yankees were willing to puff out their chests and proclaim the
series over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the West Coast at 2-0, you can't be in a better
position,'' right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``But being at home is
a big advantage. Things can change in a hurry.''

GOVERNMENT LAYS OUT ITS CASE AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to change byline) (gm) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of noisy prelude, the antitrust trial
against the Microsoft Corp. opened in federal court Monday morning
with a pointed personal attack on Bill Gates, the company's
chairman, who testified in a taped deposition that he knew little
if anything about the key charges leveled against his company by
the Justice Department and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only knowledge is the Wall Street Journal article; it
surprised me'' Gates said of reports of a meeting in which his
company had offered its chief competitor in Internet software a
chance to divide the market. Gazing directly at his questioner,
brow furrowed, head tilted slightly to the left, he added, ``I was
not involved'' in discussions of the key meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Justice Department proceeded with its opening
argument over the next two hours, its lead lawyer in the case,
David Boies, presented more than a dozen memos and e-mail messages
written by Gates over the last three years, showing clearly that he
and other senior Microsoft executives not only knew about the
matters in question but had forcefully directed them.
</P>
<P>
   Using memos and documents, the government portrayed a company
obsessed with crushing its competitor, the Netscape Communications
Corp., and willing to use every tool at its disposal, including
threats and financial inducements, to force or persuade other
companies to drop any planned or existing alliances with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Gates told his questioner at another point in the deposition
that he had not even read the government's antitrust suit. As to
its central charge, illegal collusion to divide software markets,
Gates said only: ``I think somebody said that was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also said that in 1995, ``somebody came to me to ask if it
made sense investing in Netscape.'' Shaking his head dismissively,
Gates recalled, ``I said it didn't make any sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Boies displayed on a 10-foot video screen and
enlargement of a memo in which Gates wrote to Paul Meritz, a senior
Microsoft executive, that over time Microsoft might have to compete
with Netscape. ``But in the meantime we can help them,'' Gates
wrote. ``We can pay them some money.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this competition _ and central to the case _ are
browsing programs used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
Netscape got an early lead in the market with its Navigator
browser. What frightened Microsoft was that Navigator could also be
used as a ``platform,'' a layer of software on which other programs
can run. This is the main function of an operating system, a market
in which Microsoft has a monopoly with its Windows family of
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the federal courthouse Monday afternoon, William H.
Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president of law and government
affairs, said that the government's opening presentation was
``based entirely on loose and unreliable rhetoric and snippets that
were not in any reliable context.'' Microsoft will offer its own
opening remarks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same tired old allegations,'' Neukomb said.
``None of these snippets, none of this rhetoric even approaches
proof of anti-competitive conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, however, Boies had told the judge, ``It's competition
on the merits that the antitrust laws foster. But this is not a
situation of competition on the merits. This is a situation, I
respectfully submit, your honor, of clear restraint of trade.''
</P>
<P>
   In one 1995 e-mail message relating to Microsoft's effort to
push Netscape out of the market for browsers that run on Windows
computers, Gates wrote other Microsoft executives: ``I think there
is a very powerful deal we can make with Netscape. I would really
like to see something like this happen!!'' Other memos showed that
Gates was continually and personally involved.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to demonstrate a pattern of anticompetitive
behavior, Boies led Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court through a chronology of memos and messages that seemed to
show Microsoft threatening and cajoling other companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a meeting with Gates in 1996, an executive with America
Online, the nation's largest on-line service, wrote to other
executives in his company: ``Gates delivered a characteristically
blunt query: `How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?
This is your lucky day.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, one memo showed, Gates wrote to Andrew
Grove, chairman of the Intel Corp., and bluntly asked why the
company was doing software research that might conflict with
Micrsoft's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why Intel funds a program that is against
Windows,'' the message said. An Intel note a few weeks later said,
``Gates made vague threats about supporting'' Intel's competitors,
unless Intel agreed to shut down its software research.
</P>
<P>
   Intel eventually relented, but while this standoff was underway,
a Microsoft memo said, the nation's computer-manufacturing industry
was paralyzed while awaiting word on whether Microsoft deemed it
acceptable to use certain features of a new computer chip Intel was
selling. Gates wrote: ``This is good news. It means they are
listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the memos indicated that Microsoft threatened
to stop selling the Apple Computer Co. a version of Microsoft's
Office software suite, which holds more than 90 percent of that
market _ unless Apple stopped supporting Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   A central argument in the government's suit is that Microsoft
has bundled its Web browser with Windows as a tactic in its war
with Netscape. For the last year, at least, Microsoft has argued
that the browser was added to Windows only for the benefit of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, however, the Justice Department displayed
numerous internal memos indicating that the bundling was indeed a
tactical decision. The memos showed that Microsoft's leaders first
wanted to sell Interent Explorer and expected to earn $120 million
a year from the sales. Then, when the plan to push Netscape out of
competition with Microsoft failed, the company's leaders decided to
bundle the browser with Windows instead as a means of helping it
gain a majority share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In one memo, written in December 1995 _ in the thick of
Microsoft's effort to push Netscape out of the market _ Gates wrote
a memo to others in the company acknowledging that Netscape was
designing browser software ``far better than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a few months later, displayed in court Monday,
Gates said: ``Our business model works even if the Internet
Explorer software is free. We are still selling operating systems.
What's Netscape's business model look like in that case? Not very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also proffered several memos from computer
manufacturers complaining bitterly about Microsoft's licensing
restriction that prohibited them from offering Netscape if they
wanted to offer Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Hewlett Packard wrote to Microsoft
last year. ``This will cause significant, costly problems. From a
consumer perspective, it is hurting our industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had another choice of another supplier, based on your
actions here, we would take it.''

   GOVERNMENT ATTACKS GATES
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust trial against Microsoft opened Monday in federal
court in Washington with a pointed personal attack on the
credibility and integrity of Bill Gates, the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said in a taped deposition, part of which was shown in
court, that he knew little if anything about the main charges
leveled against his company. But in its opening statement, the
government sought to portray Gates as a key director of a campaign
to crush his company's main rival, Netscape Communications.
Microsoft will give its opening statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 127 pages of written testimony, James Barksdale, Netscape's
president and chief executive and the government's leading witness,
supplied a firsthand perspective of the disputed meeting between
Microsoft and Netscape that is critical to the case. The government
contends Microsoft executives proposed that the two companies
divide the market for browser software. Microsoft replies that the
prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   CAUTION ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said that proposals to help shore up Social Security by
looking for higher returns in the financial markets risked leaving
inexperienced investors vulnerable to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO MAKERS SEEK CLEANER FUELS
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to comply with federal fuel-economy and emissions
regulations even as Americans buy ever-bigger family vehicles, auto
makers have quietly begun experiments with oil companies to develop
new and potentially cleaner fuels.
</P>
<P>
   KIA BID NOW UP TO CREDITORS
</P>
<P>
   Now that Hyundai Motor has won the auction to take a controlling
stake in the bankrupt Kia Motors and its Asia Motors subsidiary, it
remains to be seen whether Kia's creditors will agree to the bid.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS FALL IN MCKESSON MERGER
</P>
<P>
   Shares of McKesson and HBO &AMP; Co. tumbled after McKesson's
proposed $14 billion acquisition of HBO left investors wondering
how the combined company's sales forces could package products as
different as drugs and computer services.
</P>
<P>
   CLOROX TO ACQUIRE FIRST BRANDS
</P>
<P>
   G. Craig Sullivan, chief executive of Clorox, has said he wants
his company to be No. 2 or better in every category in which it
competes. As part of that effort, Clorox announced it was acquiring
First Brands, the maker of Glad trash bags and STP car care
products, for $1.52 billion in stock. Shares of First Brands rose
$12.375.
</P>
<P>
   CONTINENTAL POSTS RECORD RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines reported record third-quarter earnings,
excluding a previously announced one-time charge, and acknowledged
publicly for the first time that the Clinton administration might
file suit to block Northwest Airlines from buying a controlling
stake in the carrier.

   EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan's earnings fell a greater-than-expected 60 percent

ARIZONA VOTERS CAN TAP INTERNET TO COMPARE CANDIDATES IN DOZEN
RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona voters can tap the Internet to compare the
political philosophy of candidates in a dozen races, thanks to the
National Political Awareness Test.
</P>
<P>
   Project Vote Smart, a nonpartisan, non-profit organization,
developed the test with the help of political experts nationwide.
The exam includes issues of interest to Arizona, such as a proposed
ban on cockfighting.
</P>
<P>
   Results were released Monday. They are available at
www.vote-smart.org on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two candidates for governor and Congress and 73 people
running for the Legislature took the test in Arizona. Among those
who ``flunked'' by refusing to participate were Gov. Jane Hull, and
U.S. Reps. Matt Salmon, Ed Pastor and John Shadegg.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hull, the governor's son and campaign manager, said she
declined to take the test because she was busy responding to
questionnaires from Arizona media and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a national group that is doing something that maybe is
not that relevant to the state of Arizona,'' Mike Hull said.
``We're not going to succumb to national pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of the governor's opponents _ Democrat Paul Johnson,
Libertarian Kathering ``Kat'' Gallant, Reform Party member Scott
Malcomson and independent write-in Alan White _ took the test.
</P>
<P>
   The test looks at candidates on issues from abortion to welfare.
Answers are divided into parts, giving the politicians virtually no
``wiggle room'' in revealing how they would apply public policy to
various situations, Vote Smart director Richard Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does expose candidates to analysis by their opposition,''
said Kimball, a former Arizona lawmaker and Corporation Commission
member. ``Our toughest sell is to the safely elected incumbent.
They don't want to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the test provides a political-background database on
13,000 candidates. Response from congressional candidates in
Arizona matched the national average of 72 percent while more than
half of Arizona's legislative candidates took the test.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Arizona founders of the nationally bipartisan Project
Vote Smart were Barry Goldwater, former U.S. Attorney General
Richard Kleindienst and business law Professor Marianne Moody
Jennings. National members include former U.S. Sens. George
McGovern and William Proxmire, and former national GOP Chairwoman
Mary Dent Crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who completed the test, revealing their positions to
Arizona voters in time for the Nov. 3 election:
</P>
<P>
   _Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Democratic opponent Ed Ranger and
independent challenger Bill Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   _ District 6 Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., Democratic challenger
Steve Owens and Libertarian Robert Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   _District 5 Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., Democratic opponent Tom
Volgy and Libertarian Phil Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   _District 3 Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., and Democratic challenger
Stuart Starky.
</P>
<P>
   _Shadegg's District 4 challengers: Democrat Eric Ehst,
Libertarian Ernie Hancock and Independent Doug Quelland.

TWO CLINTON BOOKS: THE LEWINSKY SCANDAL AS PRESIDENTIAL DECODER
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review)  
(jw) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The more David Maraniss writes about Bill Clinton the more he
seems to dislike him.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of articles for The Washington Post in 1992,
Maraniss wrote of candidate Clinton's ``political stamina,'' his
``natural and deserved'' popularity, his ``empathetic
personality,'' his ``intense desire to listen to people.'' ``The
loyalty and deep feelings of respect that Clinton has engendered in
scores of friends,'' he added, ``cannot be overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   Though these articles formed the basis of Maraniss' 1995
biography of Clinton, ``First in His Class,'' that book evinced a
significant shift in tone. The president's ``lifelong sense of
purpose'' now read, more clearly, as ambition; his distaste for
conflict, as glibness and a need to present people with ``the
version of himself he thought each would most admire.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new quickie book, ``The Clinton Enigma,'' Maraniss'
portrait of Clinton is even darker. He describes the president as
``a dissembler'' and ``one-man darkness unit,'' ``a personality
that explained and rationalized compulsively,'' a man whose traits
include a ``lack of normal standards of self-control'' and ``a
reliance on aides, friends and family to shield him from the public
consequences of his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   While Maraniss has always regarded Clinton as ``a protean
character who constantly adapted to his environment,'' he argues
that at a deeper level, the president seems ``incapable of learning
and changing.'' Indeed, the president now reminds him of ``Gen.
George Armstrong Custer as described by biographer Evan Connell
before the Battle of Little Bighorn, his fate determined by the
immutability of his character, reacting predictably to the same
stimuli again and again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Clinton Enigma,'' Maraniss uses this thesis to
deconstruct the president's 4{ minute speech, delivered hours after
his grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. In his view, that brief,
combative speech embodied themes and patterns evident throughout
Bill Clinton's career: it underscored his penchant for ``lawyerly
evasion'' and ``biblical semantics,'' his tendency to use carefully
chosen words to manipulate and mislead. It also highlighted,
Maraniss says, the president's proclivity for seeing everything in
political terms, and for going on the attack _ in this case,
assailing Kenneth Starr _ instead of examining his own culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly these observations will be familiar to anyone who has
read a newspaper or watched television in the last two months. What
lends Maraniss' observations added interest is his ability to put
the speech (and its subtext) in context with Clinton's entire life
by drawing upon the enormous amount of material he accumulated in
the course of writing ``First in His Class.''
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss does not simply point out the most famous corollaries
to Clinton's slyly couched denials of sex with Monica Lewinsky (his
waffling on questions concerning his smoking of marijuana and his
draft status during the Vietnam War), but goes back through the
president's entire life to show us his ongoing vacillation between
idealism and opportunism, empathy and narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that Clinton's penchant for playing the victim
(while lashing out at his enemies) stems from the random beatings
he received from his alcoholic stepfather (who whipped him ``in
moments of drunken rage, not as a means of correcting the young
man's behavior''); he argues that the president's ability to
compartmentalize different aspects of life, like his delusions of
invincibility, stems from a highly developed ability to practice
denial _ a skill honed, as a boy, growing up with an alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Stonewalling, it seems, also came naturally. Over the years,
Maraniss writes, Clinton instinctively learned to withhold
information as a means of reconciling ``the tension between reality
and image, between what he is and what he wants to be'' _ a
tension, clearly, that has never been so pronounced as it is today.
</P>
<P>
   While David Maraniss sees the president's Aug. 17 speech as a
kind of Rosetta stone to his life, the conservative commentator
William Bennett sees the Monica Lewinsky scandal as ``a perfect
snapshot'' revealing ``the essence of Bill Clinton'' and a telling
index of America's growing embrace of the ``culture of
permissiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bennett sees it, Clinton is a ``corrupt, and corrupting,
president,'' and the current scandal (along with Filegate,
Travelgate, Whitewater and questions about campaign finance
violations) reveals the worst elements of Clinton's character:
``reckless and irresponsible private behavior; habitual lying;
abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's best-selling book, ``The Death of Outrage,'' looks at
the most popular arguments advanced by the president and his
defenders and examines their implications.
</P>
<P>
   When Bennett puts aside his tendency to moralize and simply
applies common sense to the task at hand, the results can be
persuasive. To begin with, he makes the obvious point that the
current crisis is not just about sex, but involves serious
allegations of ``perjury, obstruction of justice and job offers for
silence.'' He goes on to deftly expose the hypocrisy of feminists
who were quick to assail Clarence Thomas but who have stood by
Clinton on grounds that the president's overall record on women's
issues trumps allegations of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett also eviscerates arguments that the president's current
problems have had no effect on his ability to govern, even quoting
a brief in which Attorney General Janet Reno wrote that the
independent counsel's investigation of matters involving Monica
Lewinsky and Paula Jones ``has had a substantial impact on the
president's performance of official duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, however, Bennett overplays his hand, resorting to
hectoring language and partisan logic. ``By his actions,'' he
writes of the president, ``we are witnessing an assault on American
ideals.'' And: ``Bill Clinton is a reproach. He has defiled the
office of the Presidency of the United States.'' His repeated
enumeration of the many parallels between the current Lewinsky
scandal and Watergate are not matched by a similar examination of
the many differences between the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett writes that the tactics employed by Starr, including his
decision to subpoena Monica Lewinsky's mother and demand sales
receipts of books Ms. Lewinsky had purchased at local Washington
bookstores, are ``arguably less aggressive'' than those employed by
Lawrence Walsh, the Iran-Contra independent counsel during the
1980s. In another chapter, he tries to rationalize Linda Tripp's
secret taping of conversations with her friend Monica Lewinsky,
arguing that ``there were compelling reasons that would justify her
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bennett tends to oversimplify the arguments of his
adversaries, reducing them, in summary, to paper tigers he can
easily shoot down. He writes that Clinton advocates see the
president's continued support in the polls as reflecting ``a wiser
understanding of human nature and the ways of the world, a welcome
liberation'' _ a sign that we are achieving the ``sophisticated
sensibility long ago achieved by Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments are as unnecessary as they are specious, and they
undermine the more valid points Bennett wants to make in this book.
In fact, they ratify David Maraniss' observation that ``one of the
many ironies of the Clinton tragedy'' is that ``he was always his
worst enemy, while his enemies, by overreacting, were often,
unwittingly, his strongest allies.''

ARBITRATOR RULES NBA OWNERS NOT OBLIGATED TO PAY PLAYERS UNDER
CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Skedded earlier as BKN-NBA-LABOR)  
(JT) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An arbitrator has rejected a grievance filed by the
National Basketball Players Association maintaining that players
with guaranteed contracts must be paid curing the current lockout.
The decision represented an important victory for the owners in the
labor dispute that has already brought cancellation of the first
two weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Monday, by John Feerick, dean of Fordham Law
School, means that NBA owners will not be held accountable for the
nearly $800 million in guaranteed contracts held by more than 220
players until the two sides sign a new collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the league nor the players would predict how far the
decision would go toward a belated start to the NBA season. Via
dueling conference calls within hours after the decision, the two
sides engaged in more public posturing and sounded as far apart as
they were on July 1, the day the lockout began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take great pleasure in the current decision,'' said
the NBA's commissioner, David Stern. ``Although it's better than
losing, it doesn't take us where we want to be with our players.''
</P>
<P>
   The league had previously indicated that if the arbitrator's
decision went against it, an appeal would be filed in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 players will not receive their first paychecks and
will lose 12 percent of their annual salary on Nov. 15, a harsh
economic reality that some observers believe will lead to several
players breaking ranks and the union returning to the bargaining
table with an eye more toward compromise than contention. Yet Billy
Hunter, the union executive director, said the ruling would not
lessen the union's resolve. ``We have sufficient money that can
take us as far as we have to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arbitration was a little bit like a tie game and we took a
40-foot shot at the buzzer,'' said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief
outside counsel for the union. ``We missed, but we're still tied.
We're still in the same place we were yesterday. Unfortunately, I
think this is a bad decision for the fans because I think the
league would have been more apt to reach an agreement quicker if
the players had won.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern sent a letter to Hunter Monday and requested that he mail
it out promptly to his constituency. It contained an offer to meet,
a three-part proposal and a guarantee that player salaries would
rise 20 percent, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The league apparently was trying to drive home the point that it
was not interested in trimming salaries as much as it was
determined to bring contracts in line with total revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the union contends the last time total salaries rose less
than $50 million, the average raise per year under the league's
proposal, was more than 10 years ago. To the players, the league's
proposal would erase many gains made by the players in the last
agreement, a deal that resulted in the players making 57.1 percent
of the league's total basketball-related income.
</P>
<P>
   While Stern voiced frustration over his dealings with the
current union leadership compared with previous regimes, Hunter
accused league officials of harming the image of the game with what
he called their ``hard-line bargaining approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner the owners realize this and end the lockout, the
better chance we have of avoiding enormous damage to the sport of
professional basketball,'' Hunter said. ``Sadly, what the owners
may not realize, is that if they continue to antagonize the fans,
the fact that the players may miss a few paychecks may be the least
of their worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, Hunter said, ``The product may suffer
enormous, irreparable damage. If fhe fans get turned off, they may
stay away and the long-term losses may be much more severe. I don't
think any of us want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Having already canceled its first two weeks of games, the league
will look at canceling another block of games next week.
</P>
<P>
   Feerick took the full 30 days to issue his 84-page ruling. It
was the first significant NBA case he has arbitrated since sharply
reducing Latrell Sprewell's punishment for choking his coach last
December, a ruling that angered the league and was considered a
major victory for the players association. His said his decision
Monday was founded on the basic tenants of federal labor law, which
states that employees do not get paid during a strike or lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is not sufficient to establish such a limitation
on the federal labor law right of an employer to lock out its
employees in support of its bargaining demands in a collective
bargaining negotiation following the termination of a collective
bargaining agreement,'' Feerick wrote in his conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 200 players not receiving their paychecks on Nov.
15 and talks at a standstill at least until the end of this week,
talk of union decertification abounded among several agents Monday.
The process, although long and complicated, could eventually lead
to anti-trust action brought against the league by individual
players _ a tactic National Football League players successfully
used in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an option the players have looked at from the very
beginning,'' said Kessler, who helped lead a decertification try in
1995.`I'm not going to predict when and if they're going to,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After all has been said and arbitrated, the bottom line is
that a deal still has to be done at the bargaining table,'' said
Buck Williams, the former union president. Using the widely
divergent figures in recent proposals by the two sides over a
luxury-tax system, he added, ``I think somewhere between the $2.6
million contracts the owners want to tax and the over $18 million
contracts we've proposed taxing, maybe you can find a range and a
system where both sides are comfortable.''

HOUSING INVESTIGATOR BROADENS FRAUD INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., La., Calif., Texas, Ill.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to charges that she was driven by racial
and political considerations, the United States' chief housing
investigator has broadened an inquiry into possible fraud in
housing-assistance programs to include other locales.
</P>
<P>
   Known originally as the ``urban fraud initiative,'' the inquiry
focused only on Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco. As
originally conceived by the housing investigator, Susan Gaffney,
the Department of Housing and Urban Development's inspector
general, the investigation infuriated many Democrats, who saw no
coincidence in the fact that the mayors of Baltimore, New Orleans
and San Francisco are all black Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In its new incarnation as the ``housing fraud initiative,'' it
will reflect a more suburban orientation, including central
California, the entire state of Maryland, and Long Island, N.Y.,
housing officials said Monday. New Orleans and San Francisco are
being dropped from the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the project, which is expected to last
three to five years and involve the FBI, said the newly designated
locations were not chosen because they are thought to be hotbeds of
corruption, but rather because they are big recipients of federal
money and hence appropriate subjects of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaffney told the housing subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee last week that other areas to be
investigated would be northern Texas, including Dallas and Fort
Worth; northern Illinois, including Chicago, and the city of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The HUD inspector general is appointed by the administration,
but is answerable to Congress, which is controlled by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaffney could not be reached for comment Monday evening.
When the original three targets were announced several months ago,
she denied that race or politics had played any role in the
selection.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed clear that in picking the new sites the inspector
general took pains to avert criticism that she was being soft on
Republicans. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato lives on Long Island, as does
Rep. Rick Lazio, chairman of the House Banking and Financial
Services subcommittee that has jurisdiction over HUD. And part of
central California is represented by Rep. Jerry Lewis, chairman of
the Appropriations Subcommittee before which Ms. Gaffney appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaffney told members that the newly conceived investigation
would focus more on landlord subsidies and mortgage lending, which
make up the vast bulk of HUD spending, rather than on money that
goes to city governments and housing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo had been critical of the original
investigation. His spokeswoman, Karen Hinton, said Monday night:
``We've undertaken an effective effort to clean up the department
and encourage all efforts to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse.
The total redesign of this investigation, to be based on
legitimate, factual criteria, addresses our core concerns. Now we
have to make sure that this investigation is implemented in a fair
way.''

GOVERNMENT OPENS CASE AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft, renowned as the world's most successful
software company and headed by the world's richest man, was
unsparingly depicted in court Monday as an abusive monopoly that
has demonstrated utter disregard for the law and grown rich at the
expense of its consumers and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the federal government, 20 states and the District
of Columbia spent the day outlining with broad strokes and in
meticulous detail how Microsoft allegedly has violated the nation's
most basic business laws in an attempt to maintain its monopoly on
computer operating systems and extend that monopoly into the market
for Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has used massive monopoly power to harm competition,
to harm consumers, to limit what products can come to market, and
to prevent people with new and better ideas from getting a fair
chance,'' said Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division for
the Justice Department. ``In the weeks ahead, we intend to detail
that evidence ... and what we will show is that Microsoft's illegal
deeds match its illegal words and its illegal intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against Microsoft will begin piling up as soon as
Tuesday, when James Barksdale, the chairman and chief executive
officer of the Netscape Communications Corp., is expected to be the
first government witness. In written testimony made public Monday
night, Barksdale said that in 1995, ``Microsoft made clear that if
Netscape did not agree to its plan to divide the browser market,
Microsoft would crush Netscape, using its operating monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which will make its opening statement Tuesday,
insists that it has done nothing wrong, either toward Netscape or
any other company.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the judicial day ... the evidence will show that
Microsoft is an innovative company, that we have competed
vigorously and fairly, and that our customers have had the benefit
of better and better technology and lower and lower prices,'' said
Microsoft senior vice president William Neukom.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being argued in the E. Barrett Prettyman United
States Courthouse best known as the home of the grand jury
investigating President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. Throngs of reporters, lawyers, interest group leaders and
a handful of protesters descended on the courthouse to watch the
opening day of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say the case almost certainly is headed for the Supreme
Court, and to join history books alongside Standard Oil as one of
the most important antitrust cases since the nation's laws
governing monopolies were written a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States of America vs. Microsoft Corp. will provide
the first major test of how well laws that rarely change, and
courts that move with glacial speed, cope with the fast-paced
technology industry, in which companies come and go and the
shelf-life of a product is often shorter than a congressional
session.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last at least six weeks and feature 24
witnesses and mounds of evidence culled by from millions of pages
of subpoenaed e-mail messages and memos.
</P>
<P>
   The government is seeking unspecified remedies to punish
Microsoft. Potential punishments could range from changes to the
company's operating system to a breakup of the company, although
that is considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The government will attempt to prove that Microsoft, by engaging
in illegal restraint of trade and illegal attempts to monopolize,
has violated the two key provisions of the Sherman Act, the 1890
law that forms the basis of this nation's laws to regulate business
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's executives acted like too many of our star
athletes today,'' said Stephen Houck, the New York state antitrust
chief, arguing on behalf of the states. ``Emboldened by their
success and wealth, Microsoft's executives felt they could break
rules with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In its attempt to prove that Microsoft has a monopoly, the
government cited Microsoft's 90 percent share of the market for
operating systems among Intel-based personal computers. The
government also argued that there are high barriers to entry for
the designer of any new operating system _ another sign of a
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that Microsoft illegally attempted to monopolize the
Internet browser market, the government argued that the company
forced computer manufacturers to install the company's Internet
browser by integrating it into the ubiquitous Windows operating
system. The government also argued that Microsoft used its monopoly
power to force Internet service providers, Internet content
providers, and computer manufacturers to take steps that had the
effect of promoting Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the government's case, outlined by
Justice Department special trial counsel David Boies, is
Microsoft's behavior toward Netscape, a California company that
until recently dominated the market for Internet browsers. The
government will attempt to prove that Microsoft illegally attempted
to divide the browser market with Netscape, and, when that failed,
that Microsoft set out to destroy Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony released Monday, Barksdale described a June 21,
1995, meeting at which Microsoft allegedly proposed the illegal
division of the market for browsers. Under the alleged proposal,
Microsoft would manufacture a browser for Windows 95, and Netscape
would make a browser for Windows 3.1, Macintosh and Unix systems.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Microsoft officials allegedly asked Netscape to
divide the market, an America Online executive informed about the
meeting wrote in an e-mail, ``If Netscape didn't do the deal,
Microsoft would crush them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said that after he refused Microsoft's proposal,
Microsoft announced it would give away its browser for free.
Netscape, which earned most of its revenue by selling its browser,
saw its stock price drop by $30 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft described Barksdale's written testimony as ``often
nothing more than self-serving accusations with no factual basis.''
Microsoft says it did not try to divide the browser market with
Netscape, but simply sought to explore opportunities for the two
companies to work together.
</P>
<P>
   But the government argued that Microsoft's efforts to crush
Netscape were relentless, because Microsoft feared that a dominant
browser made by Netscape, combined with a cross-platform Java
language made by Sun Microsystems, could provide an opening for a
viable competitor to Microsoft's operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Documents displayed by the government quoted one Microsoft
executive writing of developing ``a hunting list'' of Netscape
revenue sources to be eliminated by Microsoft, and another speaking
of ``cutting off (Netscape's) air supply.'' A document from America
Online quoted Gates as asking that company, ``How much do we need
to pay you to screw Netscape?''
</P>
<P>
   The government also argued that Microsoft bullied Intel, Apple,
and various computer manufacturers to prevent any success by
Netscape or Sun Microsystems. The government alleged that Microsoft
threatened to cut off a profitable Office software product for
Macintosh computers if Apple refused to cooperate, and that
Microsoft persuaded computer manufacturers to stop working with
Intel unless Intel dropped an offending software effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why Intel funds a group that is against
Windows 95,'' Gates wrote in an e-mail to Intel CEO Andy Grove in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's alleged effort to control the computer desktop
didn't sit well with Hewlett-Packard, a computer manufacturer that
wanted to alter the first screen seen by consumers. When that was
forbidden by Microsoft, the company wrote, ``from the consumer
perspective, we are hurting our industry and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly protested the changes last fall, and were flatly
refused any leeway,'' the Hewlett-Packard memo said. ``If we had a
choice of another supplier, I assure you (Microsoft) would not be
our supplier of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Houck said in his statement that consumers have been harmed by
the alleged Microsoft monopoly because by paying too much for
personal computers, which he said would be cheaper if Microsoft
wasn't charging monopoly-level prices for its operating system. He
said the overcharging has boosted Microsoft's profits, giving the
company the highest profits as a percentage of revenues of any
Fortune 500 company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Tuesday is scheduled to announce its earnings for the
quarter that ended Sept. 30, and financial analysts expect
Microsoft to meet or beat earnings estimates. The company's stock
closed yesterday at $102.9375, down 2.125, on a day when the Dow
Jones Industrial Average was up 49.69.

 &HT;    Industry slump forces cancellations
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Semicon Southwest, a trade show for
semiconductor industry equipment makers, cancel ed some programs
because of lack of attendance. Officials said the cancellations of
workshops and seminars were caused by the chip industry slump.
Companies didn't want to spend the money for travel or registration
_ some programs can cost several hundred dollars per person _ as
they try to cut costs in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a sign of the industry,'' said Stan Myers,
president of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International,
the show's sponsor. ``People are watching their budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's main event, the exposition of equipment used to make
computer chips, has attracted more pre-registered participants than
last year's show although the number of exhibitors is off.
</P>
<P>
   The show remains Austin's biggest convention.
</P>
<P>
   The group said pre-registration was up 30 percent from last year
when more than 12,000 people attended, including exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   The expo part of Semicon, which begins today, will consist of
about 800 booths where equipment makers will try to attract
business and connect with customers. That compares with 957 booths
last year when Palmer Auditorium was used for additional floor
space.
</P>
<P>
   The cancel ed programs are: ``Software Testing,'' ``The Global
300 mm Transition,'' and ``Overall Equipment Effectiveness'' today
and ``Power Quality Workshop'' Wednesday.

 &HT;    Downturn halts future of chips
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When it comes to next-generation computer
chip-making technology, Applied Materials Inc. is all dressed up
with nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest semiconductor equipment maker spent more
than $100 million in 1997 to develop advanced equipment that its
customers said they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Applied and other companies had counted on this upgrade in
chip-making technology to generate big sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   But the chipmakers, caught in the throes of a worldwide chip
slump, have postponed construction of new factories that would use
the new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have products ready to go to customers for pilot lines, but
there is only one pilot line going on right now,'' said Jaim
Nulman, head of Applied's development effort. ``It's like flying an
airplane with no airport to land on and you are running low on
fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems surrounding the shift to 300-millimeter wafers is
an example of the volatile economics that can make the chip
industry such a tough business.
</P>
<P>
   Wafers are the round pieces of silicon on which computer chips
are made. The industry has been using 200-millimeter (about 8
inches) wafers since about 1986. Using 300-millimeter (about 12
inches) wafers would produce more chips per wafer at a lower cost.
For example, a 200-millimeter wafer would have as many as 250 chips
while a 300-millimeter wafer would have 560.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of the problem, a four-hour session at the
Semicon Southwest trade show today was to have focused on the move
to 300-millimeter wafers. It was cancel ed, however, because not
enough people registered for it.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment industry's interest in 300 millimeter dropped
drastically this spring once the semiconductor industry slump was
felt in full force.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment makers dramatically slowed their research in the area
after concluding that chipmakers were unlikely to build any
300-millimeter factories in the near-term, said analyst G. Dan
Hutcheson of VLSI Research in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has come to a grinding halt as they try to
realign the strategies and try to figure out how to get from here
to there,'' Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor makers such as Motorola Inc. and Samsung
Electronics told Applied and other suppliers that they needed to be
able to shift to big 300-millimeter wafers by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   The big wafers were seen as a far more productive alternative to
200-millimeter wafers.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of equipment and materials companies got to work in the
mid-1990s on the 300-millimeter push, spurred on by semiconductor
industry groups including Sematech's International 300 Millimeter
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment and materials makers have spent at least $4 billion,
and possibly more, on the conversion project, which could become
one of the costliest industrial conversions ever when it is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The chip makers and their suppliers were betting that the
enormous growth in semiconductor demand in the early 1990s would
continue through the rest of the decade. Demand has continued to
grow, but chip factory capacity outpaced it, creating surplus
products and dramatic price declines in many kinds of
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   Chip makers had estimated that at least a half dozen test lines
would be set up worldwide to evaluate new equipment. Full-scale
production factories were expected to be built soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Only two pilot projects _ a joint venture by Siemens and
Motorola in Germany and one in South Korea by Samsung _ have been
started.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the chip equipment are projected to drop at least 12
percent from last year's total of $27.6 billion. And in August,
equipment makers received only 60 cents' worth of new orders for
each $1 in equipment sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives people some more breathing room,'' said George Lee,
a principal in Lee, Horwath &AMP; Associates of Portola Valley, Calif.
``Eventually the investments (in the new technology) will pay off,
but the payoff will be slower than companies thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson now believes it could take a decade before equipment
makers start making much profit on 300-millimeter equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, like other companies, has slowed its
investment in 300-millimeter technology as it has reduced its
spending overall, cutting 2,000 jobs across the company, including
600 in Austin. ``We have adjusted spending to meet the market
demands,'' Nulman said.
</P>
<P>
   When the semiconductor industry finally is ready to build new
factories early in the next decade, most of the largest ones will
be built to handle 300-millimeter equipment, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the big new wafer factories are projected to be
up to 30 percent more efficient in producing chips with large
production runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members have made it pretty clear that, when they need to
add new factories, most of that expansion should happen with
300-millimeter technology, because of the significant cost
advantage,'' said Frank Robertson, head of the Sematech subsidiary
that is supporting the conversion to 300-millimeter equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The new factories are expected to be more automated than current
factories _ and more costly _ potentially costing $2 billion,
compared with $1 billion to $1.5 billion for 8-inch wafer
factories.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost advantage from 300-millimeter technology could be
overstated. While the conversion to 300-millimeter equipment has
proved to be complicated and expensive, existing 200-millimeter
tools have been improved enormously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do too much, too fast,'' said Hutcheson, who said
chip makers rejected suggestions to make the transition in
incremental steps by having equipment that could handle both wafer
sizes. ``We all got too greedy. We were making too much money, and
we thought we could build this monstrosity called the
300-millimeter factory.''

CLINTON ATTEMPTS TO SALVAGE PEACE TALKS FOLLOWING GRENADE ATTACK IN
ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS grafs 1-15 for inserts, rewriting) (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton struggled on Monday night to
salvage stalled Middle East peace talks after a Palestinian grenade
attack on Israeli civilians made success seem less likely, senior
officials from all sides said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, officials announced that the talks would
continue on Tuesday, and Clinton's spokesman announced that he
would cancel a scheduled trip to California to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his team, guided
in large part by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, decided to use the
grenade attack as the justification for a dramatic negotiating
ploy, insisting the Israel would suspend negotiations on all issues
except for security, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli position, one official said, is designed to push
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into ``the most specific
commitments possible'' to fight terrorism, in particular the
military wing of Hamas. The Israelis want Palestinian terrorism
suspects to be extradited to Israel, specific members of the
Palestinian security forces to be arrested and tried in Israel for
terrorist acts, reductions in the number of Palestinian police and
confiscation of unlicensed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, called the grenade
attack, which wounded 67 at a bus terminal, ``a complicating
factor,'' and said: ``It certainly makes it more difficult for us
to achieve what we were seeking to achieve.'' He conceded that it
could narrow American ambitions to reach a full accord here on all
the interim issues and to restart talks on a final settlement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 19 months of stalemate, Clinton and his
secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, decided that with the Oslo
process ending next May 4, it was vital for American interests in
the region to press both parties to finish this interim accord, so
talks on a final settlement could begin.
</P>
<P>
   These talks, in a bucolic setting 70 miles from Washington and
secluded from the press, have dragged on since Thursday. They were
originally scheduled to end with a signing ceremony at the White
House on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans have been pushing to complete this interim
accord, one official said on Monday night that it was becoming more
likely that some form of partial accord might be reached, to try to
``lock in'' the work already done here and avoid a complete
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned here for a unscheduled fifth day of meetings
with Netanyahu, Arafat and scores of aides and experts. He met on
Monday night with the two leaders, who had not met face-to-face
since they had lunch together on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing King Hussein of Jordan flew to his Maryland home from
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and was described as ``standing by''
to try to push the leaders toward a deal. Arafat also appealed by
telephone to the Israeli president, Ezer Weizman, officials said,
and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, was also in contact with
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after an appeal to the leaders from the White House
lawn to ``consider the consequences of failure and the benefits of
progress,'' plunged back into the talks here, presiding over a
45-minute meeting of security officials and experts from the
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu of about half an
hour, then a similar meeting with Arafat, before bringing the two
leaders together on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are difficult,'' Clinton said. ``The distrust is
deep. The going has been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said the president was, if anything,
understating the problems. ``The two sides do not deal with each
other seriously without an American in the room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another American official described the involvement of Clinton
as a form of drug for the leaders who have built up a tolerance for
lower-ranking U.S. officials like the special envoy, Dennis Ross,
or even Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why give concessions to Ross when Albright is there?'' the
official asked. ``And why give concessions to Albright when Clinton
is there?''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the official said, he is refusing to think that
success is impossible in these talks, designed to finish an interim
accord by which Israel will withdraw from another 13 percent of the
West Bank _ including a ``nature reserve'' of 3 percent _ in return
for phased and verifiable Palestinian steps to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli official said on Monday night that ``a lot of work
is being done in the security area'' with Clinton's involvement,
but he hastened to say: ``It's not yet enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's spokesman, said bluntly that
Netanyahu believes ``that this deed, this terrorist attack,
strengthens the Israeli position in the negotiations with the
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official rejected that view, saying: ``The
attack hasn't changed what the Palestinians are prepared to give.
But it has changed the dynamics today, and it's had a negative
impact on everyone's desire to bring this to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   The grenade attack at a bus stop in the southern Israeli city of
Beersheba occurred about 2 a.m., ET, as Clinton was returning to
the White House to sleep. Early on Monday morning, Arafat condemned
the attack and promised Netanyahu that the Palestinians would
investigate it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and his ``kitchen cabinet,'' including Sharon, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky,
decided that the attack required a public reaction from them here.
Netanyahu issued a statement in Hebrew saying: ``If the
Palestinians do not fulfill their commitments on security, an
agreement is impossible. I am insisting upon it at the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   He informed Albright that the Israelis would only talk formally
about security on Monday, and he dispatched his communications
director, David Bar-Illan, Bushinsky, and his ambassador to the
United Nations, Dore Gold, to the press center at Chesapeake
College here.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan said, ``There will be no other subject discussed other
than the subject of security.'' In fact, an official said, informal
talks on other issues did go on Monday, but only intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli mood, like the American, was one of impatience.
Later, an Israeli official said: ``We really have to get serious
here. We can't let it drag on. The Americans don't appear to be
pushing Arafat at all.'' While the Palestinians ``always agree to
the principle,'' the official continued, ``it's the specifics that
are always the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the Americans appear to be protective of
Arafat, taking ``too seriously his protestations of weakness.'' He
compared Arafat's strategy to that of the former boxing champion,
Mohammad Ali, known for leaning against the ropes and absorbing
blows, to drain his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official rejected the criticism. ``The
Israelis want everything and want to give us the barest minimum,''
the official said. He expressed concern that the Israelis were
``stalling,'' having still refused to provide maps that show the
precise areas of the 13 percent withdrawal and refusing to
guarantee that a third redeployment, as called for under Oslo, will
take place once final status talks begin.

STOCK PRICES RISE AGAIN; DOW UP 49  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices moved higher again Monday, the sixth
advance in the last seven sessions, as investors remained
optimistic about the economic benefits of recent interest rate cuts
by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
49.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to 8,466.45. The gain left the Dow up
7.06 percent for the year and less than 10 percent below its July
17 peak.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market measures also registered gains, and small-company
stocks, battered for months this year, extended a recovery that
began earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 5.97 points, or 0.6
percent, to 1,062.39. The Nasdaq composite jumped 27.78 points, or
1.71 percent, to 1,648.73, and is now up 5 percent for the year.
And the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks surged 9.58
points, or 2.8 percent, to 352.45. Since Oct. 8, the index is up by
14 percent. Even with those gains, the small-company index is still
down more than 19 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   At just under 715 million shares, volume on the New York Stock
Exchange was comparatively light. Last Friday, 1.02 billion shares
changed hands on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   The gains Monday came on the eleventh anniversary of the 1987
crash, when the Dow index fell 508 points, or 22.6 percent, its
biggest one-day percentage decline.
</P>
<P>
   Many traders who were not in the business 11 years ago said the
anniversary meant little.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is little evidence that the third Monday in
October has stirred up bad thoughts in the stock market since Oct.
19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   According to Birinyi &AMP; Associates, the stock market research
firm, since that so-called Black Monday the Dow has risen eight
times on the third Monday of October, and declined the other three.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said they felt a bit more confident about the market's
most recent behavior since the Fed unexpectedly reduced interest
rates last Thursday, but some expressed skepticism about whether
the central bank's step was sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment though, investors seem to think the Fed is doing
the right things to prevent an economic downturn in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight session, bank and other financial service
sector stocks, beneficiaries of lower interest rates, moved higher.
So, too, did retailers. And cyclical stocks like autos, chemicals
and paper companies also did better.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, a Dow component and the nation's fourth-largest
bank holding company, rose 3], to 92~, despite a third-quarter
earnings report that was worse than expected. Even with the rise,
however, the stock remains well below its 52-week high of 148}.
</P>
<P>
   Other big banks, battered following Russia's default in August
and the resulting problems in other emerging markets, also rallied.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica rose 3\, to 52~. And the Bankers Trust Corp. was up
3], to 54}.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers gained on optimism that consumers, whose spending
represents about two-thirds of the economy, will continue to buy
goods and services at a healthy pace.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big gainers were Wal-Mart Stores, which rose 2[, to
68}. Analysts at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. added the stock to the firm's
recommended list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also raised its ratings on the Dayton Hudson Corp. and
the Costco Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Hudson rose 1 5/16 Monday, to 44 3/16. Costco jumped 2~,
to 54 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the recent turmoil may be ending, a number
of merger deals were influencing the market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Kroger, the supermarket company, fell 3 5/16, to 45
7/16, after it announced it would buy Fred Meyer, a smaller
supermarket company, in a stock deal valued at $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson, the nation's largest drug distributor, lost 12|, to 76
1/16, after it announced a deal to buy HBO &AMP; Co., the largest
supplier of computerized patient-monitoring systems, in a stock
swap valued at $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But owners of First Brands, the maker of Glad Wrap and STP oil
treatment, were smiling broadly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock jumped 12 5/16, to 35 15/16, after Clorox agreed to
buy the company for stock valued at $39 a share.
</P>
<P>
   As they sifted through the market's moves over the last week,
technicians said that it now appeared that the steep downdrafts of
September and early October may have come to an end and that the
lows were not likely to be retested anytime soon. But they said it
was too soon to say much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have finally started a fall recovery phase,'' said Richard
McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., ``but I am not
at all convinced this is a new bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said the market was probably staging what he called an
``interim'' recovery that could push the Dow up to 8,600 to 8,800
by the middle of next month.

ST. JOHN TERRELL, 81, RE-ENACTOR OF HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., N.J., Pa., N.Y., Fla., Utah)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. John Terrell, a flamboyant Chicago-born actor and impresario
who pronounced his name Sinjin and led a campaign to clear Richard
III's blackened name, died on Oct. 9 at his home outside Trenton,
N.J. He was 81, and in a tricorn and cape had crossed the Delaware
River as George Washington 25 times.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell, of Ewing Township, died from complications of
Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   During a career in which he repeatedly proved himself as a
master showman, Terrell left his mark on American culture, founding
the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa., in 1939 and creating
the once-flourishing Lambertville Music Circus in Lambertville,
N.J., a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   The still-thriving playhouse, which he started in an old grist
mill and ran for a year, has been credited with helping to touch
off the summertime stampede of artists and others that transformed
once sleepy Bucks County into a hotbed of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The music circus, a summer theater-in-the-round under a striped
tent, attracted leading performers and enthusiastic audiences for
more than two decades and inspired spinoffs and copycat tent shows.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the music circus closed in 1970, Terrell had already
created his next theatrical splash, the annual re-enactment of
Washington's famous Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Terrell, who made the first crossing with six friends
in 1953, conceived the idea as a one-shot publicity stunt for his
music circus. It proved so popular, and so effective in generating
publicity, that he continued for 25 years. When he relinquished the
role in 1978 to a longtime crewman, Jack Kelly, Princess Grace's
brother, it had become such a tradition that the re-enactment was
taken over by the Washington Crossing Foundation, which has
continued it.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell, cheerfully aware that he was recreating the established
myth rather than the probable reality, stood resolutely near the
bow year after year in the precarious pose, made famous by the
familiar Emanuel Leutze painting, that Washington would presumably
have been too ship-savvy to have adopted.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Terrell became George Washington, he was well
practiced in the embodiment of American myth.
</P>
<P>
   In a youth worthy of Norman Rockwell, for example, he actually
joined a carnival at 16, and as a high school senior, according to
his later account, became the first radio voice for the hero of
``Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy,'' preceding Don Ameche's
brother Jim, who is generally listed as the original in the 1930s
show.
</P>
<P>
   The carnival, where Terrell performed a fire-eating act that he
revisited throughout his career, seemed to have given him a fatal
taste for show business and an arrested sartorial sensibility. As a
producer his signature garb was red, plaid or both.
</P>
<P>
   After his radio run Terrell spent three years at Columbia
University, leaving without a degree to pursue the theater.
</P>
<P>
   For all his flamboyance, Terrell's work won him wide respect. He
was, among other things, a founding member of the New Jersey
Council on the Arts and a charter trustee of the American Folklife
Center at the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For Terrell, who was a familiar figure in New York theatrical
circles and once operated an off-Broadway theater, perhaps his most
ambitious undertaking was his campaign to discredit Shakespeare's
portrayal of Richard III as a hunchbacked, murderous thug who
arranged to have his young nephews murdered in the Tower of London.
</P>
<P>
   Although others have shared the view that Richard was not a
villain, Terrell said he took the matter personally because the
deed was supposedly carried out on the king's orders by a Terrell
ancestor, Sir James Tyrrel.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the historical truth, Terrell, who was a master
showman, knew how to attract attention to the case. In 1983, on the
500th anniversary of Richard's accession, he arranged for a
memorial Mass in Richard's honor at St. Patrick's Cathedral in
Manhattan. Afterward, lest the pageantry of the Catholic service
not be considered sufficiently offbeat to underscore his cause, he
held a medieval lunch at the Players Club.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, on the 500th anniversary of Richard's death on
Bosworth Field, Terrell repeated the gesture, this time moving to
Sardi's for the medieval lunch featuring wooden spoons, pewter
dishes and fare that included quail, suckling pig, ale and mead.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell, who was married twice, is survived by his wife, Mary; a
son from a previous marriage, Bartholomew of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
and two daughters, Alicia of Ewing Township and Elizabeth of Park
City, Utah.

 Handhelds That Hold Their Own Against Notebooks  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Anyone who has used a handheld PC knows the true meaning of
frustration. The screen is too small to offer more than a token
view of documents, and the keyboard is absurdly tiny. You need the
fingers of a 4-year-old to type comfortably.
<P>
   Relief is on the way, however. In the coming months, major
companies including Hewlett-Packard and Sharp will introduce the
next wave of handhelds, with bigger, sharper displays and nearly
normal-sized keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``subnotebook'' computers, which will sell for under
$1,000, use an upgraded version of Microsoft's Windows CE operating
system for handheld devices. It includes pocket versions of Word,
Excel, Access, PowerPoint and the Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Code-named Jupiter, the new Windows CE offers improved handling
of e-mail (you can now read mail attachments, for instance), and
the browser supports better security as well as Javascript.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter machines are still far from full-fledged PCs. They
lack hard drives, floppy drives and CD-ROMs, and their screens are
still a lot smaller than the ones that come with even the cheapest
notebooks. Also, you can't use any regular Windows programs with
them.
</P>
<P>
   However, many professionals may find that those drawbacks are
more than offset by the convenience factor. The new Jupiters turn
on and off instantly. At less than three pounds, they're less than
half as heavy as a regular notebook. And their batteries last 10
hours _ four to five times as long as a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   I've been testing HP's new Jupiter device, the $999 Jornada 820,
and I gotta say this is one sweet computer. Here's a brief rundown
of what makes it so cool:
</P>
<P>
   _ At 9 inches by 7 inches by 11/4 inches deep, it's small enough
to tuck into your briefcase with room left over for your lunch.
</P>
<P>
   _ The keyboard is 90 percent as big as a normal keyboard, and
you can't really tell the difference. Also, there's a special row
of keys at the top that let you quickly open the main applications.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 8.2-inch display gives you the same quality as a basic
computer screen and 256 colors.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's a built-in 56K modem, and a feature for easily
connecting to an Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   _ It includes a USB port, so you can connect the computer to any
USB peripheral, such as a mouse or printer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Windows CE software lets you synchronize data between the
Jornada and a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Jornada 820 is targeted at professionals who need to take
notes, do e-mail and edit documents, but who don't really need a
portable computer that substitutes for their regular office PC. And
it should do particularly well among road warriors, many of whom
will jump at the idea of ditching their heavy notebooks in favor of
a smaller device with a long battery life that they can use on a
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see them being a great companion for a desktop system,''
said Martin Reynolds of Dataquest. He predicted that the price of
Jupiters will fall to $500 within a few years, ``and by 2002
they'll be selling a million units a year.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a downside to the Jupiter machines, it's in the
software. Microsoft still hasn't been able to make Windows CE
exchange data with a PC as easily as one would like. And tracking
appointments and contacts is still too complicated, especially
compared to a smooth system such as the PalmPilot's.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think they're on the right track with this first
generation of Jupiter devices, I don't think they've hit a home
run,'' said analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies. Still, he
says the Jupiter ``has the potential of being a true lightweight
portable for the mainstream.''

ADVERTISING: MANY CHANGES ON MADISON AVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif., Ga., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madison Avenue bustled in recent days as a variety of
marketers made changes on advertising assignments with billings
estimated at more than $230 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest account changes comes from Hardee's Food
Systems Inc., the fast-food chain, which moved the national
creative part of its account to the Leap Partnership in Chicago
after just eight months at Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York.
Billings were estimated at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hamilton, a spokeswoman for Hardee's, a unit of CKE
Restaurants in Rocky Mount, N.C., said that although the current
campaign from Angotti, Thomas, called ``Go all out,'' had
``entertainment value and humor, it did not effectively communicate
the quality aspects of Hardee's food.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton said Hardee's recently requested a new approach
from Angotti, Thomas, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos., and
invited Leap to make proposals. Leap, a unit of Leap Group, was a
``close second'' in a previous review that ended with the selection
of Angotti, Thomas, Ms. Hamilton said. The final decision was made
by a team that included members from CKE, Hardee's senior
management and Hardee's franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   Leap, which is Hardee's sixth agency in four years, had a ``more
aggressive approach,'' Ms. Hamilton said, adding that the company's
new ads would be more focused on food. A campaign is expected to
begin in January. Western International Media in Los Angeles, also
owned by Interpublic, continues to handle the media part of the
account.
</P>
<P>
   Two other account changes are from Internet marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities in Santa Monica, Calif., named Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in
New York as the first agency to handle its integrated account, with
combined billings estimated at $15 million to $20 million. The
decision came without a review; Thomas Evans, president and chief
executive of Geocities, and Bruce Nelson, chief knowledge officer
at Y&AMP;R, have worked together before.
</P>
<P>
   The Y&AMP;R units handling the account are Y&AMP;R Advertising, for
consumer advertising research; Brand Dialogue, interactive
services; Wunderman Cato Johnson, advertising and relationship
marketing; Landor Associates, corporate design, and the Media Edge,
media research, planning and placement.
</P>
<P>
   The other Internet account changing hands is Excite Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif., which operates the Excite search engine. It
has named Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York as agency of record for
its consumer advertising account, which was handled for the last
year by the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, a unit
of True North Communications. Billings are estimated at as much as
$25 million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, was awarded
the account after a three-month review. The other participants were
not disclosed, but the trade publications said three agencies in
San Francisco were among the finalists: Citron Haligman Bedecarre,
which handled a project for Excite's classified division; Goldberg
Moser O'Neill, and TBWA/Chiat/Day, a unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another change, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in Chicago said it had
resigned the creative and strategic parts of the Midas Inc. account
after almost 14 months. Billings were estimated at $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Management changes at Midas made it ``clear to us that it is in
our best interest to part company,'' said Brian Williams, president
of the Chicago office of Foote, Cone, a unit of True North
Communications. TN Media in Chicago, a sibling True North agency,
continues to handle media buying.
</P>
<P>
   Midas, the operator of auto-repair shops, said in a statement
that it had decided to initiate a review for the duties handled by
Foote, Cone and that the agency initially ``had agreed to
participate'' but then resigned on Friday. Bob Troyer, a spokesman
for Midas in Chicago, said a ``limited number of agencies'' would
now proceed in the review, but he declined to identify them. A
decision is expected in mid-December, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Midas account has bounced from agency to agency over the
last couple of years. Before Foote, Cone, the account was handled
by the J. Walter Thompson Chicago unit of WPP Group PLC until that
agency resigned because of a conflict with its important Ford Motor
Co. account.
</P>
<P>
   Another marketer, Coca-Cola Co., has expanded its relationship
with Leo Burnett USA in Chicago by naming that agency to handle the
creative assignment for its Coca-Cola and Sprite brands aimed at
Spanish-speaking consumers in the United States. The account, with
billings estimated at $15 million, was previously handled by
Casadevall Pedreno &AMP; PRG in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a
report of the assignment this week in Advertising Age. He said that
Burnett, part of Leo Burnett Co., was awarded the additional
account without a review; it already handles general-market
creative assignments for the company's Surge, Fruitopia, Hi-C and
Minute Maid brands.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rite-Aid Inc., the drugstore chain based in Camp Hill,
Pa., has named Lowe Fox Pavlika in New York as the first agency to
handle its direct marketing. Billings were estimated at $15 million
to $20 million. Advertising continues to be handled by Marc
Advertising in Pittsburgh. Lowe Fox is part of the Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS division of Lowe Group, a unit of Interpublic.

 RealNetworks Scores Coup   By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Determined not to become Microsoft road kill, RealNetworks
announced another major partnership yesterday aimed at increasing
distribution of its audio- and video-playing software.
<P>
   The scrappy Seattle company said Netscape Communications Corp.
has agreed to bundle RealNetworks' RealPlayer with the latest
version of its popular browser suite, Netscape Communicator, which
made its debut yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came less than a month after America Online,
the leading Internet service provider, announced that it would
include the RealPlayer with its new 4.0 software.
</P>
<P>
   ``RealNetworks has scooped up the couple of relationships that
have the power to keep them absolutely front and center for both
the consumer and corporate user,'' said analyst John Powers of
BancBoston Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   The two deals should significantly boost the number of computer
users who rely on RealNetworks' software to view news and
entertainment video and listen to music and other audio on the
World Wide Web and on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   They also should help RealNetworks stave off an attack by
Microsoft, whose Windows Media Player is the only direct competitor
to the RealPlayer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and RealNetworks distribute their player software
for free over the Internet. However, Microsoft also includes its
Windows Media Player with every copy of Windows 98, which comes on
almost all new PCs.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same tactic Microsoft used to take a huge bite out of
Netscape's once-overwhelming lead in the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Microsoft owns 10 percent of RealNetworks, but in
the past year, the companies have disagreed on the technology for
Internet video.
</P>
<P>
   With 35 million users of its RealPlayer compared with 5 million
for the Windows Media Player, RealNetworks appears to be well
positioned for a standards fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly have the kind of market share that de facto
standards are built around,'' said Powers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That may help RealNetworks avoid becoming another Netscape &UR; , &LR; 
said analyst John Powers of BancBoston Robertson Stephens.
``Obviously, Microsoft has to be taken very, very seriously, but
Netscape was trying to fight a war on a lot of different fronts,''
he said. ``RealNetworks is focused on leadership in one very
defined area.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Microsoft, RealNetworks is a pipsqueak. Last year,
it had revenues of just $32.7 million, most of it from licenses on
software used to transmit audio and video across the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yet RealNetworks has proven more than willing play David to
Microsoft's Goliath. Last July, RealNetworks chief Rob Glaser went
before a congressional committee and accused Microsoft of sabotage.
He said that when the Windows Media Player is installed on a PC
that already has RealNetworks' software, the RealNetworks software
is disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft countered that RealNetworks' problem really was a bug
in its own software, and the stock market apparently believed
Microsoft. RealNetworks' stock lost one-third of its value in the
week following Glaser's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks never acknowledged the existence of a bug, and its
stock has bounced back smartly. Its stock shot up after the deal
with AOL was announced, and in the wake of yesterday's news, it
leaped again, closing up $2.50 at $37.38.

C. DAVID MARSDEN, 60, EXPERT IN CERTAIN MOVEMENT DISORDERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: England, Maryland) 
 (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. David Marsden, a British neurologist who was one of the
world's leading authorities on movement disorders like Parkinson's
disease, died on Sept. 29 at his American residence in Columbia,
Md. A resident of Ash, in Kent, England, he was 60 and had just
begun a one-year sabbatical, his first, at the National Institutes
of Health in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, said Robin Elliott,
executive director of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation in New
York; Marsden was a member of its research advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Marsden was a professor of neurology at the National Hospital
for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London and until recently, dean
of the Institute of Neurology in London. A prolific writer, he took
credit for publishing more than 1,000 papers, including 800
original papers and classic texts that underpin present concepts of
movement disorders.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved global recognition with research on the functions
and pharmacology of basal ganglia and motor physiology. His work
led to his 1972 appointment as the first Professor of Neurology at
King's College Hospital Medical School in London. At 34, he was the
youngest neurologist to hold a chair in that specialty.
</P>
<P>
   He filled the post until 1987, when he was named professor and
head of the University of London's Department of Clinical Neurology
at Queen Square. He was elected Dean of the Institute of Neurology
at the University of London in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He and a frequent collaborator, Dr. Stanley Fahn of Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, were acknowledged leaders
of research into the movement disorders. They founded the Movement
Disorder Society, of which Marsden was the first president, and
edited its journal together.
</P>
<P>
   Charles David Marsden's entry in the British ``Who's Who'' lists
``the human brain'' as his recreation. Born in 1938, he studied at
Cheltenham College, after which he earned his medical and science
degrees at St. Thomas Hospital Medical School at the University of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Marsden, who was married twice, is survived by his companion,
Dr. Claudia Kawas, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine. Other survivors include a son and three daughters from
his first marriage to Jill Slaney Bullock, a resident of Dorset:
Andrew of Bristol, Anna of Reading, Abigail of Woking, and Amy
Marsden, also of Woking, all in England; and three daughters from
his marriage to Jennifer Sandom, a resident of New Ash Green, Kent,
from whom he was separated: Lucy, 14, Alice, 9, and Jessica
Marsden, 6, all of New Ash Green; a brother, John, of Ashover,
England; and two grandsons.

 Antitrust Cases Show Tech Has Changed, But Human Nature Hasn't  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
No matter who wins, the Justice Department's antitrust trial
against Microsoft Corp. is likely to be the beginning, not the end,
of government efforts to ensure fair competition in the technology
arena.
<P>
   It's no accident that Intel Corp. will face the Federal Trade
Commission in a similar antitrust trial next year. Or that the FTC
has started looking into the business practices of Cisco Systems,
market leader in networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the leading companies in the leading industries of
our day,'' an FTC official told me during a recent trip to
Washington, D.C. ``We'd be remiss in our duties if we weren't
looking at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Their corporate adversaries have portrayed the government side
as brainless bureaucrats out to kill the goose that laid the golden
egg. I don't want to prejudge any of these cases, but I do think
that we owe these modern-day trustbusters the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents have suggested that antitrust laws, written in an
era of railroad and oil barons, have little relevance in an
industry that moves at Internet speed.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that might be true if we thought the New Economy had
wrought some fundamental changed in human nature, so that
businesses and businesspeople with market power were no longer
tempted to use bully tactics to maintain or expand their hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   But we know that isn't true. At a time when mergers are a daily
occurrence and the big keep getting bigger, it seems only logical
that more firms will breach the fuzzy barriers between fair and
unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may be the biggest company to cross this trip wire in
recent memory. But it won't be the last. Unless, of course, you
think the New Economy has ushered in an era of moderation in
business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORY PRICE HIKES? I got a rude shock when I ordered memory
chips for my Macintosh computer during the weekend. The price I was
quoted was 30 percent higher than the price printed in my catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering whether this was Mac price-gouging or a memory-chip
trend, I called chip distributors and analysts yesterday. ``Prices
have been up as much as 25 percent in some categories in the last
month,'' one distributor told me.
</P>
<P>
   But no one's sure yet whether the current price rise is a
temporary thing or the end of a 30-month slump in the memory
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been several periods in the last two and a half
years where the prices have gone up for a month or so before
falling again,'' said Mike Feibus, with Mercury Research in
Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Strong demand from computer-makers, building boxes for the
holidays, have driven memory prices higher, said Steve Cullen, a
chip analyst with the Cahners In-Stat Group, also in Scottsdale.
The real question will be, ``What happens in December and January,
when this demand falls off?'' Will prices flatten, fall or rise?
Cullen suspects that they'll flatten.
</P>
<P>
   But for home-computer hobbyists, the equation is simple. Waiting
to buy memory upgrades used to save money. Now you may have to act
sooner _ or pay more.
</P>
<P>
   BAD MORALE? Nervousness pervades the ranks of Ziff-Davis in the
wake of recent layoffs announced by the computer publishing giant.
That nervousness expresses itself in rumors, most too nutty to
print.
</P>
<P>
   But one Ziff-Davis official admitted privately that the company
knows it has a morale problem. Many of its employees have only been
with Ziff for four or five years and have never seen the company go
through this kind of cutback, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was just unfortunate timing that the cover of Biz
Excite, Ziff's new joint venture magazine, carried a headline that
read: ``Fired! 30 products that replace pricey people with cheap
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That ought to reassure the troops.
</P>
<P>
   FLORA.COM: University of California at Berkeley computer
scientist Robert Wilensky is crowing about the fact that Caltrans
has found a use for his new database on California plants.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky is working on the basic science of digital libraries.
The plant database _ created with UC Berkeley computer scientist
Ginger Ogle and U.S. Forest Service scientist Ann Denis _ began as
a simple demonstration project.
</P>
<P>
   Then Caltrans found a use for the data. Road engineers must keep
highways bordered with drought-tolerant plants to minimize erosion.
They also would like to use native plants wherever possible. But
Caltrans landscape engineers didn't have an easy way to get data on
California varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Wilensky's team put CalFlora on the Web
( &LR; elib.cs.berkeley.edu &LR; ) &LR; . &LR;  The database contains descriptions and
pictures of thousands of native plants. Wilensky said 20,000
CalTrans workers with Internet access have started using CalFlora
in their landscape planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an example of your tax dollars at work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The database isn't quite as friendly as a garden book or a good
nurseryman, but avid gardeners and landscape architects might find
it useful.
</P>

 Internet Guru's Death Shakes Up the Online World  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The sudden death of one of the Internet's founding fathers has
stunned the Web world, but is unlikely to disrupt its
privatization.
<P>
   Jon Postel, who oversaw the intricate computer system for
routing all online traffic and maintaining a lexicon of popular
domain names, died Friday night in Los Angeles from complications
following heart surgery. The ``guardian of the Internet's
infrastructure'' was 55.
</P>
<P>
   The intensely private Postel was director of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which matches popular Internet
addresses with numerical addresses, and he helped broker a
last-minute agreement on the transfer of domain-naming power from
the U.S. government to a nonprofit organization earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gray-haired, bushy bearded Postel struck a
professorial pose and was reclusive, his impact on the flourishing
nationwide network of computers that became the Internet was loud,
according to colleagues and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon Postel was an important historical figure in developing
the Net,'' said Jon Englund, organizer of Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the nine-member nonprofit group
that will be responsible for dispensing the five most popular
domain names _ .com, .org, .net, .gov and .edu. ``His impact
affects most Americans today and will continue to touch many in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Postel played a critical _ and sometimes controversial _ role in
helping stitch a consensus among the disparate factions attempting
to hammer out an agreement on domain names. His plan was criticized
by some, but ultimately Network Solutions, the government
contractor that parcels out domain names, agreed to back it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood the domain-name process had to change and
initiated that process a couple of years ago,'' said Ira Magaziner,
President Clinton's Internet adviser. ``Jon was one of the great
pioneers of the information age and made its infrastructure
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the wizard behind the curtains,'' Magaziner said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Postel's death on the eve of such an historic
transition, many said the plan will continue unabated _ primarily
because of Postel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not likely to have a significant effect,'' said Joe Sims,
a Washington, D.C., attorney who drafted the ICANN proposal with
Postel. ``His ideals and guidance brought us far down the road. He
left us in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ICANN plan, thousands of companies will be eligible to
sign up as registrars, virtually assuring consumers will pay less
than the current $70 fee for naming rights for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ceding domain-naming rights to a broad spectrum of businesses is
in harmony with the Clinton administration's hands-off Internet
policy. White House officials do not want to impede the economic
momentum of the Internet, which has helped spur growth of the
overall U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization will be unique in the world _ a
nongovernmental organization with significant responsibilities for
administering what is becoming an important global resource,''
Postel wrote in a letter to Commerce Department Secretary William
Daley this month, supporting ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   Postel's death provoked an outpouring of impromptu eulogies from
high-tech circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jon) has left a monumental legacy for all Internauts to
contemplate,'' Internet co-founder Vint Cerf said in a moving
tribute posted throughout the Internet. ``He leaves a legacy of
edited documents that tell our collective Internet story, including
not only the technical but also the poetic and whimsical as well.''

 Clorox Bags Glad Maker  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Oakland's Clorox Co. said yesterday it will boost its sales by
nearly half with its $2 billion acquisition of First Brands Corp.,
the Danbury, Conn., maker of Glad bags, STP auto products and Scoop
Away cat litter.
<P>
   The acquisition, which is expected to become final in the first
quarter of 1999, fits Clorox's strategy of buying under-marketed
brands with strong name recognition and giving them more support in
areas such as advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will make Clorox the fifth-largest consumer products
concern in the United States, bumping ahead of Colgate-Palmolive
and Ralston Purina. Clorox remains smaller than Procter &AMP; Gamble,
Sara Lee, Kimberly-Clark and Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the deal, Clorox intends to issue stock worth about
$152 million and assume $440 million in debt. Clorox's sales topped
$2.7 billion last year, while First Brands' hit $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Sullivan, Clorox's chairman and chief executive, said no
decision has been made about layoffs. But people close to the deal
expect some job loss, particularly on First Brands' side.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox said it expects to save a minimum of $90 million on an
annual basis by cutting costs and leveraging efficiencies in sales,
distribution and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will add to earnings immediately, not counting $110
million in merger-related costs.
</P>
<P>
   The combination helps Clorox meet its goal of generating at
least 20 percent of its total sales outside of the United States by
2000, compared to about 18 percent currently. In Canada, for
example, Clorox's business will double to $144 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Non-U.S. sales, particularly in Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and South Africa, represent 23 percent of First Brands' revenues.
Clorox's non-U.S. sales are concentrated in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   From a product standpoint, the combination gives Clorox the top
brand _ Glad _ in the fast-growing bags and wraps category, which
is growing about twice as fast as the grocery business in general,
said Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the First Brands and Clorox cat litter products also
will have the No.1 market share in the United States, with about
one-third of the total. Clorox markets Fresh Step litter, while
First Brands makes Scoop Away, Ever Clean and Jonny Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was enthusiastic about the announcement, driving
Clorox shares up $4.25 to $104. Stock of First Brands, whose
performance has been erratic in recent years, jumped $12.38 to
close at $36.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Warner Wilke, an analyst with Prudential Securities, is
projecting 15 to 16 percent earnings growth for Clorox in its next
fiscal year, which begins July 1, compared to a premerger estimate
of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of acquiring companies often falls on merger news
because the companies face the challenge of integrating two
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But confidence in Clorox is high because it successfully
integrated Armor All into its stable of brands less than two years
ago, said Wilke. Armor All sales are up 13 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that sales (of First Brands products) haven't been
robust, but that's where the opportunity is,'' said Wilke. ``The
brand equity is there and that's key.''
</P>
<P>
   Top brands of Clorox, the fourth-largest consumer product
company in the United States, include Clorox, Pine-Sol,
Liquid-Plumr, Soft Scrub, S.O.S, Black Flag and Kingsford.

 Turning Around Sybase  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
When John Chen joined Sybase as president a little more than a year
ago, he had a mystery to solve: How could a company with loyal
customers and a billion dollars in sales fail to make a profit?
<P>
   Chen, now chief executive of the ailing database software-maker,
found the answer in one of his chief passions: golf. Sybase was
like a player on a difficult course who used the same club no
matter what hole or hazard he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play a round of golf with one club, you don't really
maximize your chances of success,'' said Chen, who has hit the
links with the likes of Arnold Palmer and Chi Chi Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a string of money-losing quarters and a plunging
stock price. Sybase shares, which once &LR;  traded as high as $54 a
share in early 1995, closed yesterday at $6.25, up 63 cents, before
the company announced third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   After five consecutive quarterly losses and a break-even second
quarter, the Emeryville company posted a $2.2 million (3 cents a
share) profit for the three months ended September 30. That
reverses a third-quarter loss of $6 million (8 cents) the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected a break-even quarter, according to IBES
International. It was the second-straight quarter that the company
beat analysts' earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues climbed nearly 10 percent to $233 million from $210.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said the improved third quarter is a sign of better things
to come as he works to pull Sybase out of its three-year losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged at everything we've done. We made money,
and we generated cash. I'd like to see revenues go up faster, but I
think we achieved what we set out to do,'' said Chen, who jets to
Singapore today to open a new development center intended to build
business in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Sybase once was a leader in the market for database software _
software used to keep track of things like hotel reservations and
financial transactions. The company has been struggling to recover
from a strategic stumble in the mid-1990s, at the same time the
database industry has been mired in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 43, took over as CEO from Mitchell Kertzman last month
after the two had shared the job for about seven months. Chen's
first move was to create a division to make and sell database
software for laptops and other portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the company's businesses, which include selling
electronic-commerce software and consulting, will operate as a
single division, Chen said, which he hopes will provide the
flexibility and accountability the firm needs to succeed. In the
past, Sybase ran these disparate businesses as one _ selling costly
corporate databases the same way it was selling small, portable
databases, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Software for mobile and so-called embedded computers _ computing
devices that help run cars, cellular telephones, pagers and small
appliances _ has been Sybase's fastest-growing business, though
Chen declined to disclose sales figures. He's counting on the new &LR; 
 &LR; unit to jump start revenue growth and raise the company's profile
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street isn't convinced. Mobile databases, which
sell for $25 to $100 apiece, won't bring in enough revenue to turn
Sybase around, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems difficult for a company to make its fortune selling
databases that run on machines powered by AA batteries, which is
what Sybase seems to be focused on these days,'' said Merv Adrian,
database analyst at Giga Group, a research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tholemeier, who follows the database industry for First
Albany (and is one of the few analysts with a ``buy'' on Sybase
stock) said he believes that the strategy is all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going after niche markets, Tholemeier thinks that the
company should focus on existing corporate customers, selling them
consulting services, software tools and other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is going to stay low as long as these guys aren't
making a profit,'' he said. ``The company needs to make money and
support the existing universe (of customers). All these other
agendas are not going to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said analysts aren't seeing the whole picture, but he won't
reveal any more of his strategic plan until December, when he plans
to meet with analysts in New York, San Francisco and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Chen agrees that keeping customers happy is
important _ and he said he's doing that by working with developers
to boost the number of applications that run on Sybase databases.
More than 350 developers have built applications for the company's
mobile database, up 30 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the company added Web-based customer service
and it opened a technology center near Wall Street where its
financial-services customers and software developers can work
jointly on new applications.
</P>
<P>
   Chen hasn't played the role of turnaround artist before, but he
has proven that he knows how to rise to the top. He surged from
executive vice president to chief operating officer at Pyramid
Technology, a Unix workstation vendor, in 1993 and later negotiated
the sale of the company to Seimens Nixdorf Group, a German
high-tech giant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running Pyramid as a Seimens Nixdorf subsidiary,
Chen rose through the ranks to become a member of the German parent
firm's board.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, golf provided the link to Sybase _ he heard
about the job during a round with his Blackhawk neighbor, John
Acosta, Sybase's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong native, Chen came to the United States at age 16 to
attend high school because a teacher had told him it would give him
a better chance of getting into an Ivy League college. (He later
attended Brown University.) Chen was one of three Asian students at
his 1,200-student preparatory school. His English was only so-so.
Ignorant about U.S. holidays, he failed to make Thanksgiving plans
one year and spent the weekend in an unheated dorm, dining on
vending-machine food.
</P>
<P>
   But he succeeded, he said, because he had ``never learned to be
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   He's applied that same determination to the formidable task of
guiding Sybase's recovery. Chen said he had other offers after
Siemens Pyramid but chose struggling Sybase because he likes to fix
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gravitated toward Sybase because it's very complicated and
very big,'' Chen said. ``I like to solve problems.''

NOT MUCH LIKELY TO CHANGE FOR FRED MEYER, QFC AFTER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CONSTANCE SOMMER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bellevue, Wash.-based Quality Food Centers and
Portland-based Fred Meyer Inc. say they may be getting a new owner,
but not new identities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kroger Co. of Cincinnati, the nation's largest supermarket
company, announced Monday that it's struck a deal to acquire QFC's
parent company, Fred Meyer, for $13 billion in stock and assumed
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition satisfies three of Kroger's objectives, analysts
said: to remain the No. 1 U.S. grocer in a quickly consolidating
industry; to stay out of the clutches of Safeway, the western U.S.
grocer rumored to be interested in taking over its eastern
counterpart; and to better compete with Wal-Mart, which has found
booming success in a Fred Meyer-esque formula of general
merchandise coupled with grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and the acquired companies agree Fred Meyer and QFC
customers are unlikely to encounter dramatic changes at either
chain due to the merger. Both will keep their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't expect to see anything different and they
won't,'' said Fred Meyer spokeswoman Mary Burczyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for QFC is that we're still going to be a
separate operating company,'' said Mike Huse, president of the
85-store chain, which was itself acquired by Fred Meyer in March.
``The things that have been important to QFC, quality and service _
our hallmarks _ will not change with this merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket industry analyst Tom Swoffer said it's probably in
Kroger's best interest to leave QFC alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know why, if you're a company that's
acquiring such a gem like QFC, you would do anything to change
it,'' said Swoffer, with Safeco Asset Management Co. in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Echoed John Rogers, an analyst with D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in
Portland: ``QFC's success is built on the quality of all of their
perishables. The biggest thing you don't want to do in a merger is
scare away the customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new, combined company _ named The Kroger Co. and
headquartered in Cincinnati _ would control a grocery chain
spanning 31 states from Georgia to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger will swap one of its shares for each Fred Meyer share, or
45 7/16 based on Kroger's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph Pichler is trying to keep
Kroger ahead of fast-growing rival Safeway Inc. as well as discount
retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that are stocking more
groceries. Kroger said the purchase, the biggest yet in the
fast-consolidating supermarket industry, should save about $225
million a year within three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need the scale to compete with Wal-Mart,'' said money
manager Bill Cottrell at the Ohio Public Employees Retirement
System, which owns about 712,000 Kroger shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Wal-Mart had just begun to edge into the
supermarket business. Today, the Arkansas-based retail giant is
among the top five grocers in the nation, thanks to its
supercenters that sport grocery stores alongside general
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very slow growth industry, yet you have a company
who's come out of nowhere and taken a large share,'' he said.
``It's scary for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a competitor makes Fred Meyer, which also sells grocery and
general merchandise, a particularly attractive acquisition for a
supermarket-based company such as Kroger, Swoffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company may consider rolling out more Fred Meyer
stores, or stores like them, into the Southern and Midwestern
states long home to Kroger, Burczyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger shares fell 3 5/16 to 45 7/16 Monday while Fred Meyer
dropped 4 3/16 to 44 13/16 on concern that integrating Fred Meyer's
three purchases the past 18 months may hamper the combined company
and laden it with too much debt, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Fred Meyer had jumped 27 percent from Oct. 8 to Friday
on takeover speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have about $43 billion in annual
sales, 2,200 stores ranging from supercenters to convenience
stores, and 300,000 workers. The move won't affect earnings next
year and will start adding to profit in 2000, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer had 154.7 million shares outstanding, the companies
said. Fred Meyer Chairman Ronald Burkle, who will become chairman
of the new Kroger executive committee, is also the chairman of
Dominick's Supermarkets Inc., which agreed last week to be bought
by Safeway for $1.85 billion. Kroger will be headed by Pichler.
</P>
<P>
   Burkle is the head of Los Angeles-based Yucaipa Cos., a
supermarket investor that holds 23 percent of Fred Meyer's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the shadowy figure behind the throne of Fred Meyer,''
said analyst Mark Husson of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who rates Kroger
and Fred Meyer near-term ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The price for Fred Meyer tops Albertson's Inc.'s August
agreement to buy American Stores Co. for $11.8 billion, which would
have vaulted it past Kroger as the biggest U.S. grocer.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets have been combining to boost market share and cut
costs. In the past year, there have been 22 transactions valued at
about $28.06 billion, according to market research firm Mergerstat.
By comparison, from January 1992 to October 1997 there were 85
agreements totaling $9.31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More could be in the works. The 10 largest grocers control only
41 percent of the U.S. market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Another company such as Safeway may be able to make a competing
bid for Fred Meyer because Kroger can't afford to pay more than $51
a share because of their debt, Cottrell said. The purchase ``is not
very expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they don't have a collar agreement or penalty
for walking away from the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger, whose roots date back to 1883, has 1,400 markets in the
Midwest and South. It also operates convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer operates more than 800 stores, mostly in the Western
U.S. Its four main chains _ Fred Meyer Stores, Smith Food &AMP; Drug
Centers, Quality Food Centers and Ralphs Grocery _ range from
supermarkets to combination stores that sell food, furniture and
clothing.

 How to Transfer Documents to A New iMac   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Question: I have a lot of documents on my old Macintosh that   I'd
like to transfer into my new iMac. But how can I do this,   since
the iMac has no floppy drive?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Answer: Good question, which you really should be asking Apple's
grand pooh-bah, Steve Jobs, since it was his idea to leave out the
floppy. It's clear that he cares more about aesthetics than about
making life easy on customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to get the job done. You can
transfer files from your old Mac to the iMac by running a phone
cable between the computers' modems. Or, if your old Mac has an
Ethernet networking card, you can transfer directly into the
Ethernet port on the iMac, which is faster than using modems.
</P>
<P>
   For detailed instructions on both of these methods, go to the
Tech Info Library on Apple's Web site at  &LR; til.info.apple.com &LR; . In
the box labled No. 1, open the drop-down menu and choose Find
Article . The modem instructions are in article number 22229. The
instructions for Ethernet are in article 43015.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to use FreeDrive ( &LR; www.freedrive.com &LR; ), a
free service that lets you store information (up to 7.5 megabytes)
on the Web. You can upload files from your Mac, and download them
into your iMac.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: I want to purchase one of the new sub-$1,000 computers. &LR; 
 &LR; Is there any reason to choose among Celeron, Cyrix M II and AMD &LR; 
 &LR; K6-2 processors? I don't do a lot of computer stuff. I mostly &LR; 
 &LR; use e-mail, do some Web browsing (not games) and I would like &LR;   &LR; to
learn to keep financial records on the computer. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: For your needs, any sub-$1,000 should do the job. The
differences in these chips only start showing up when you need lots
of processing power, as with video and 3-D graphics. If you're
looking at a PC with a Celeron chip, make sure it's one of the
second-generation Celerons. The first ones didn't have second-level
cache, a form of memory that speeds up processing. As a result,
they were chronic underachievers. The new Celerons have a small
cache built right onto the chip, and reportedly they're pretty
quick.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: When I upgraded to Windows 98 a few weeks ago, I &LR; 
 &LR; selected the option that allows me to keep a Windows 95 backup &LR; 
 &LR; on my hard drive. Now that I see that Windows 98 is going to &LR; 
 &LR; work fine, I want to delete Windows 95, which seems to gobble &LR;   &LR; up
a lot of disk space. Can this be done safely? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You're right. The backup for Windows 95 is taking up as
much as 80 megs on your hard drive. To get rid of it, go to the
Add/Remove Programs feature in the Windows Control Panel and select
Delete Windows 98 uninstall information. (To get to the Control
Panel, click the Start button and point to Settings.)
</P>
<P>
   If for some reason that doesn't work, you can always just delete
winundo.dat, a hidden file that contains all the Windows 95 system
files. Winundo.dat is stored in your root directory (usually the C:
folder). You can remove it using Windows Explorer, but first you'll
have to configure Explorer so you can see hidden files. To do that,
choose Folder Options from the View menu, tab over to View in the
Folder Options window and choose Show All Files.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: I've noticed that a lot of new mice have a little roller &LR; 
 &LR; between the buttons. What does it do, and is it worth my while &LR; 
 &LR; to buy one when my old mouse works perfectly well? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: The roller _ also called a wheel _ lets you scroll vertically
through directories and documents. You also can press the roller
till it clicks, then scroll simply by moving the mouse forward and
backward. It saves time and also helps minimize the movement of
your arm, hand and elbow, all of which come into play when you use
regular scroll bars. Mice with rollers are made by Microsoft,
Logitech and others and start at around $30.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE TRY: A while back I mentioned a feature on the 3Com Web
site that lets you determine whether your telephone line is capable
of using a 56K modem. The address I gave came out wrong in some
newspapers that carry this column. So here's a sure-fire way to
find this feature. Go to  &LR; www.3com.com &LR; . Under Select a Product
Category, choose 56K Connectivity. Then select What do I need for
56K? One of the options will be Test Your Phone Line, which ends
with a link to the Line Test Tool.
</P>

<P>
   The latest upgrade of America Online's software _ version 4.0 _
lets you switch between screen names without signing off. That way,
you can easily use one screen name for personal mail, and another
one for business stuff. You'll find the Switch Screen Name option
in the Sign Off menu.

cutting edge, Time Out has been slow to commit wholeheartedly to
the Internet. ``I've known since the 1970s that Time Out's future
is electronic but I don't like the idea of it being for free,''
says Elliott, who started the magazine as a 21-year old college
graduate. (Jonathan Player/New York Times Photo)

   TUREN, Indonesia _ Shrieking triumphantly and waving bloody
sickles and knives, about 30 motorcyclists drove slowly through
town in a victory celebration. Onlookers cheered and the atmosphere
was half-exultant, like that of a carnival.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also half-terrified, because one of the motorcyclists
was waving a bamboo stake on which was impaled the head of a young
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allahu akbar!'' the motorcyclists shouted, waving their
sickles in celebration at having killed a man they regarded as a
sorcerer. ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
   The parade here in this remote farm town, 400 miles southeast of
the capital, Jakarta, was part of a ferocious hysteria that is
sweeping some remote parts of Indonesia. Communities are so
terrified of black magic that vigilante groups are forming daily to
seize, torture and execute anyone suspected of being a sorcerer.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions are easily aroused, and people are attacked because
they are outsiders, lack identification or cannot quickly convince
a mob that they have business in the area.
</P>
<P>
   At least 150 people, and perhaps many more, have died so far in
the frenzy, and law and order have broken down almost completely in
some areas. The convulsions have disrupted commerce, paralyzed
travel in places and underscored the risks of social upheaval as
Indonesia grapples with economic depression and a transition away
from political dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The upheavals are a challenge to the fragile government of
President B.J. Habibie, who took office in May when the country's
longtime dictator, Suharto, stepped down. Indonesian democracy is
still in its infancy, and many people point to the latest killings
as an ominous reminder that the last political transition here, in
1965 and '66, was accompanied by violence that cost hundreds of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle of killings began with the slayings of dozens of
Muslim leaders, for reasons that are probably political but remain
unclear. These killings are attributed to people with supernatural
powers, and now the villagers' efforts to avenge the deaths with
retaliatory murders have been exploding out of control. And in an
echo of 1965, the chaos has also stirred the occasional revenge
murder by people taking advantage of the unrest to settle a score.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil is on a far smaller scale than in the 1960s but it
is just as difficult to comprehend. The epicenter has moved to the
Turen area, where five people accused of sorcery were executed by
mobs on Sunday. One was beaten to death, one was burned and three
were beheaded, with the severed heads paraded along a 40-mile
route.
</P>
<P>
   Again on Monday at least three people in the area were killed.
Two had been seized from a police car by vigilantes who reportedly
slit their throats, and the third was the man whose head was
paraded on a stake. An hour after that parade, another group of
motorcyclists drove by slowly, cheering lustily and dragging the
man's naked, headless corpse behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ninja is dead!'' the lead motorcyclist shouted
exuberantly, as passers-by waved and shouted encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninja'' is the word given here to secret assassins who are
believed to be trying to kill Muslim leaders. The original ninja
were secret Japanese fighters hundreds of years ago, and
Indonesia's ninja apparently got the name because they are feared
for their stealth and strength. But they also are believed to be
sorcerers who can vanish or turn into animals.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is so tense and fearful that even the police stay
out of sight and let the mobs rampage. Anyone who seems out of
place risks instant execution at the hands of angry crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It begins when people try to chase someone suspicious,''
explained Sukiando, a 42-year-old rickshaw driver who said he was
in the mob that beheaded one suspect on Sunday. ``Sometimes the
ninja turns into a cat, and sometimes he stays human. If he stays
human, then they cut off his head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be more heads chopped off,'' added
Sukiando, who like many Indonesians uses just one name. ``Because
in every little area, there are seven or eight ninja who go out
every night, and they've got to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gather reliable information about the
killings, because the authorities and villagers alike are often
close-lipped about them. But interviews in several areas of the
eastern part of the main Indonesian island of Java suggest that the
situation is becoming tenser almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   In a vivid demonstration of the new lawlessness, young men in
many towns and villages in eastern Java have organized themselves
into armed patrols, especially at night, to catch ninja and kill
them. Senior police officials in this area said that they could not
comment, but one officer in the town of Kepanjen said nervously
that the situation was extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night it's like a curfew,'' he said, referring to the
area around his town. ``No one goes out and there are patrols every
20 meters. Last night I had to go out for a drive, and I was
stopped and checked every 20 meters by crowds of people. Even
though I'm a policeman, some guys asked for some cigarettes that
they saw I had, and I had to hand them over. They could do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that residents had turned in eight suspected
ninja to the police, who were holding them in jail. But he said
that the eight were simply mentally disturbed and did not possess
supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no ninja here,'' he said. ``There is no such thing
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, however, believe the killings confirm the existence
of ninja and the need for extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they parade the head around, it's not meant to threaten
people,'' said Mohammed Soleh, a 34-year-old vigilante who was
cheering the procession. ``It's just meant to show everyone that
ninja do exist and that we must be on alert.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The unrest began slowly a few months ago in the area around
Banyuwangi, on the eastern tip of Java near the resort island of
Bali. Well-organized groups of assassins dressed in black _ the
ninja _ began attacking particular targets, often Muslim leaders
affiliated with the country's largest Islamic organization,
Nahdlatul Ulama.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is an overwhelmingly Muslim country, and there is no
obvious reason that Nahdlatul Ulama, primarily a religious
organization, would be a target. Still, some political motive is
widely suspected, although there is great debate and uncertainty
about what it might be.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's leader, Gus Dur, who is widely venerated in
Indonesia, said over the weekend that top politicians _ including
Cabinet members _ were behind the attacks on Muslims leaders,
although he did not say whom he meant or how he had come to that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wiranto, the army commander and perhaps the most powerful
person in Indonesia today, visited eastern Java on Sunday and
pledged to curb the killings. But he declined to comment on the
accusation that senior politicians were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to send the country toward disintegration,'' The
Jakarta Post quoted Wiranto as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The army has sent some patrols into the area, and in daytime
there is nervous traffic that evaporates at dusk. The government
says that about 150 people have been killed so far, but unofficial
estimates are higher and some of the killings go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling political apparatus sometimes engaged in
extrajudicial killings during Suharto's days, and many believe that
some political or military forces are continuing the tradition,
either to eliminate Muslim critics or to sow chaos and create the
conditions for a coup.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of weeks, the killings have spread to
encompass most of East Java, and scattered attacks have been
reported in other parts of Java as well. But the pattern has
changed, so that often those doing the killing now are the mobs
trying to find the ninja.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody now is committed to the search for ninja,'' said
Warsidi, a 55-year-old man who was eating soup and noodles from an
outdoor stall, and who took a break to watch the severed-head
parade go by before resuming his meal. ``The ninja are trying to
kill the Muslim leaders, so before the ninja can do harm, local
people are fighting back.''
</P>
<P>
   Warsidi and other vigilantes were only slightly suspicious of a
foreign reporter, apparently the first foreigner to visit the area
since the mob killings, and they were generally courteous and
mild-mannered. Their politeness seemed incongruous, considering
that they were describing their plans to behead anyone who could
not satisfactorily explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   No foreigners are known to have encountered difficulties in East
Java, and most of the killings have been in rural areas that
foreigners do not usually visit. Places like Bali and Jakarta have
not been affected.
</P>
<P>
   However, one suspected sorcerer was attacked and beaten by a
huge mob in Surabaya, the hub of the region and Indonesia's
second-largest city. Local people became suspicious of the man,
rumors started, and he was chased down, tortured, and killed by
garroting.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier in Surabaya, an undercover policeman who was
wearing black was saved from a lynching only by running into a
police station. A mob attacked and damaged the police station, but
the man was saved.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one tell who is a ninja?
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like crazy men, and we also look to see if they have
any holy writing on them, because that would mean that they
practice black magic,'' said Bantur, a vigilante rickshaw driver.
</P>
<P>
   Bantur and his friends, who said that they had all been in the
mob that beheaded a sorcerer a day earlier, clustered around to
offer a few other telltale signs. One, they said, is a reluctance
to explain one's identity or an inability to explain one's purpose
in visiting the area.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in magical powers has always been fairly widespread among
Javanese living in small towns and villages, but with the decline
of strongman rule, there seems to be an increasing willingness to
attribute problems to a sorcerer's magic _ and to settle the
problem immediately by picking up a sickle. Few people doubt that
the ninja must be dispatched quickly, because of their ability to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I saw it with my own eyes,'' said Sutaryona, a
27-year-old member of a vigilante patrol. ``There were three ninja,
and when we shone a flashlight at them, they vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, vanishing is what anyone might try to do when
approached by a mob of angry men with sickles. But fleeing is
considered proof that one is a ninja.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the failure of the dead men to vanish in time
meant that they were not ninja after all, a group of vigilantes
took the question gracefully. They carefully explained that when a
Muslim leader is present and knows about the magic, the sorcerer
cannot use it.
</P>
<P>
   So, they concluded, a suspect's failure to disappear is also
proof that he is a sorcerer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the main victims of the violence were leftists and
ethnic Chinese, but that seems not to have been repeated here. The
government has suggested that communists _ the perennial targets of
Indonesian repression _ are responsible for the ninja killings, but
nobody seems to take that very seriously, and Chinese appear to
have been spared so far.
</P>
<P>
   There are constant sightings of ninja. Near the city of Pandaan,
for example, villagers claimed they saw two ninja who, when chased,
turned themselves into cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they killed the cats, but there was no blood at all,''
whispered Tantri Irawati, a 21-year-old woman wearing a Mickey
Mouse shirt and red polish on her fingernails and toenails. ``Every
night people are so scared! I used to go to the toilet outside at
night without any fear, but now I'm too terrified. I get someone to
walk me to the outhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   One person in the area, Choirul, a 19-year-old man who is
mentally retarded, supposedly was accosted by a ninja. His speech
is barely understandable, but he sat on his porch and _ helped by
his more voluble mother _ told how a man in black had grabbed his
arm and asked him a question.
</P>
<P>
   What question?
</P>
<P>
   Choirul will not tell anyone, even his mother, and that is taken
as further proof that the ninja must have been particularly
devilish. So the neighbors have stepped up patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we catch a ninja, we'll beat him,'' said Hadi, a
25-year-old neighbor who said he arms himself with a sickle each
evening. ``People don't want the ninja arrested. They want us to
kill him right away.''

EDITORIAL: THE ARREST OF GENERAL PINOCHET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   In a development sure to bring shivers to the world's dictators,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet is under arrest in a London clinic where he
went for surgery. He is held at the request of a Spanish court,
accused of genocide and the murder and torture of dozens of Spanish
and other citizens in Chile after his 1973 military coup. His
detention and possible prosecution are warranted under
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Not every dictator's crimes bear international prosecution.
There can be no place in international law for rogue nations like
Iraq or North Korea to seek the politically motivated prosecution
of current or former foreign leaders who opposed them. But the
arrest of Pinochet is based on credible allegations and evidence.
He has sufficiently intimidated Chile's civilian authorities to
escape prosecution there for the crimes of his security forces,
which murdered or caused the disappearance of more than 2,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   International law recognizes widespread murder, torture and
forced disappearance as crimes against humanity that any state can
prosecute. American courts have permitted lawsuits by foreign
citizens against foreign leaders, such as the Bosnian Serb Radovan
Karadzic, for such crimes. Last year Washington tried to persuade
Canada to prosecute the genocidal Cambodian leader Pol Pot. Given
that the world does not yet have a functioning international
criminal court, which will have broad international support and
safeguards against frivolous prosecutions, such third-country
prosecutions must continue.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's amnesty in Chile should not stand in the way of his
arrest. He issued himself the amnesty in 1978. His democratic
successors as president have not challenged it, partly out of fear
and partly because they lack the power to do so. The Chilean
Constitution, which Pinochet devised, allows him to maintain
control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's government argues that Pinochet should be protected by
diplomatic immunity, as he carries a diplomatic passport. The
relevant international convention, however, reserves such immunity
for those on diplomatic missions. Pinochet, who made himself a
Senator for Life after he stepped down as Chile's military
commander in March, traveled for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claims of both Spain and Britain that the arrest was
purely a judicial matter, political considerations certainly
weighed in _ just as the desire to avoid a diplomatic fuss kept
nations from capturing Pinochet in the past. Spain's Cabinet must
now decide whether to request his extradition, and Britain's Home
Secretary must decide whether to approve it. Both should look only
at the evidence. If it is lacking, Pinochet should go home in
peace. But that would be the only legitimate reason not to try him.

   (NYT1) LONDON -- Oct. 19, 1998 -- TIME-OUT-MEDIA, 10-18 -- Tony
Elliott, owner and founder of Time Out Group, in his London office.
For a publication that likes to promote itself as being at the
cutting edge, Time Out has been slow to commit wholeheartedly to
the Internet. ``I've known since the 1970s that Time Out's future
is electronic but I don't like the idea of it being for free,''
says Elliott, who started the magazine as a 21-year old college
graduate. (Jonathan Player/New York Times Photo)

NOMINATION FOR LUXEMBOURG AMBASSADOR DIES IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate has effectively killed the nomination of
James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg, an appointment that
would have made him the first openly gay U.S. ambassador,
congressional officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the Senate's Republican leadership had
decided not to act on the nomination of Hormel, 65, a San Francisco
philanthropist, before adjourning for the year.
</P>
<P>
   They said his nomination would be allowed to die in the Senate
along with those of Kent Wiedemann to be ambassador to Cambodia and
Diane Watson as ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven of President Clinton's other nominees for
ambassadorships or for the federal bench are expected to be
approved by the Senate before lawmakers leave Washington for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, an heir to the Hormel meat-packing fortune and a former
dean at the University of Chicago Law School, had received broad
bipartisan support in the Senate, and congressional officials
agreed that he might well have been confirmed for the ambassador's
post in Luxembourg had there been a Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, refused to
allow a vote by the full Senate. Earlier this year, Lott captured
headlines when in an interview he described homosexuals as sinners
who, like alcoholics and kleptomaniacs, could overcome their
afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that anti-gay bias continues in the United States
Senate,'' said Winnie Stachelberg, a lobbyist for the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay-rights group. ``A small minority
of senators have taken away the opportunity for an up-or-down vote
on Jim Hormel, which is all that people were asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, said that it was
``extraordinary that the Republican leadership refuses to move a
nomination that a strong majority of senators support just because
the nominee is gay.'' He said the president ``will consider all of
his options,'' including possibly renominating Hormel next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's nomination was aggressively opposed by a conservative
organization, the Traditional Values Coalition, that provided
senators with copies of sexually explicit material available in a
special gay-research center named for Hormel at the San Francisco
Public Library. Hormel has long provided financial support to
gay-rights causes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congressional officials said they did not know exactly why the
Senate Republican leadership had decided not to act on the
nominations of Wiedemann as ambassador to Cambodia and Ms. Watson
as ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia, a group of
tiny islands in the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   One Senate aide speculated that Wiedemann's nomination had been
sacrificed as a protest at the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen
of Cambodia, who seized full control in a violent coup last year.
``Since we don't have a legal government, why should we honor Hun
Sen with an ambassador,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiedemann, a career diplomat who speaks four foreign languages,
had served must recently as the senior diplomat in the U.S. Embassy
in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson, a veteran Democratic state legislator in California
and the first African-American woman elected to the state Senate,
was one of the state's most vociferously liberal lawmakers, and
congressional aides said she may have simply proved too liberal to
be acceptable to the Senate's Republican leaders.

CASTING DIRECTOR FOR `RENT' SAMPLES TALENT AT PHOENIX CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Jodi Fleisher stood in front of the table, threw back
her head full of dark curls, and started singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, mama, please!'' she cried out, in a big, polished voice.
``Oh, mama, he's a magic man.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Marshall, casting director for the musical ``Rent,'' sat
behind the table, looking Fleisher squarely in the eye. She quickly
scribbled some notes on the back of Fleisher's resume.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker had been sitting inside an empty back room at the
Phoenix Live! nightclub in the Arizona Center for two hours,
watching dozens of wannabe ``Rent-ers'' come through during an open
casting call for the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing new for Marshall. Already on this leg of her
journey, she's been through Salt Lake City, Boulder, Colo., Denver
and Tucson, listening to countless a cappella renditions of Billy
Joel and Celine Dion songs.
</P>
<P>
   No Rodgers and Hammerstein? No Lloyd Webber? Well, ``Rent'' is a
musical about contemporary young people in New York City set to a
rock-style score. Think less Mary Martin and more Alanis
Morissette.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a whole spectrum of people coming out for these,'' said
Marshall, who expected to hear more than 400 singing voices Monday.
``You get theater people and people with no experience at all. It
runs the entire gamut.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true. In the first phase of the casting call, the young
hopefuls would sing 16 measures of a song _ no show tunes or
country music, those auditioning were advised.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, they were shepherded in to sing in front of
Marshall, whose enthusiasm never flagged.
</P>
<P>
   A hip-swiveling man belting out ``Heartbreak Hotel'' with a
Southern accent?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much, that was great!'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   A barrel-chested guy with a blond goatee getting seriously into
Michael Bolton's ``When I'm Back on my Feet Again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks _ you did very well!'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a pointless exercise. From every city where open
casting calls are held, usually about five people make it into a
``Rent'' production. If it's not the Broadway show, there are two
U.S. touring companies and productions in Australia, Canada and
London's West End.
</P>
<P>
   If people make it through the a cappella stage, they get called
back to perform a song from the Jonathan Larson musical. More
callbacks will follow for a lucky few. The survivors then will go
to Los Angeles to perform for the show's directors, who make the
ultimate decision.
</P>
<P>
   University of Arizona student Eddie James made it through the
first level, thanks to a soulful rendering of the old Drifters tune
``Under the Boardwalk.''
</P>
<P>
   James' powerful voice is somewhat of a surprise, coming from a
guy who is majoring in psychology. He made the two-hour drive
simply to see how well he would fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents can sing,'' he said, clutching his callback sheet.
``My grandfather used to be a pastor, so I've sang in church. I've
never had any lessons _ I've just always been singing.''
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to keep it all in perspective. He doesn't have
dreams of an elegant lunch at the Russian Tea Room before his New
York curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord is going to lead me where he wants to lead me,'' he
said. ``If it's going to happen, it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less satisfied. Jason Heath has been on stage in
Seattle productions of ``Guys and Dolls'' and ``Annie.'' His big,
rangy voice handled ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' quite respectably, but it
just wasn't his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I got nervous,'' he said, looking at his black-booted
feet. ``Well, there's always next time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true, especially for Fleisher. The UA drama major had
tried out at the Tucson casting call, but her rendition of ``The
Power of Love'' apparently didn't impress. But after she finished
``Magic Man in Phoenix, Marshall spoke to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you sing `Amazing Grace' for us?'' she asked. ``Make it
more grounded. Sing it very simply, less girlish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher started singing the inspirational chestnut, showing off
a dark, earthy vibrato and sounding a bit like Cher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop,'' Marshall instructs. ``Sing it simply. Let it flow. No
stylization at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher starts again. With all the theatrical trappings
stripped away, she is quite effective on the gospel tune, even if
she doesn't know all the lyrics and covers with some wordless
vocalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall hands her a callback sheet. She's made it past Round
1. &QL;

KROGER TO BUY FRED MEYER, CREATING COUNTRY'S BIGGEST GROCER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kroger Co. said Monday that it would acquire Fred Meyer Inc.
in a deal that would create a supermarket giant with $43 billion in
annual revenue and 2,200 stores in 31 states.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger will pay about $8 billion in stock for Fred Meyer and
assume $4.8 billion of the company's debt, further consolidating
the grocery business and creating the largest supermarket chain in
the country. With the latest transaction, Kroger regains the spot
it lost to Albertson's Inc. as the nation's largest supplier of
eggs and milk.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition, Kroger will stretch from the fast-growing
Western markets, where Portland-based Fred Meyer is strong, to the
Midwest and the Southeast, where the Cincinnati-based company has
many stores and much visibility. The move also gives Kroger even
greater purchasing power and substantial economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will retain the Kroger name and continue to
be run from Cincinnati. Both chains' stores will retain their names
and local management teams.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer shareholders will receive one newly issued share of
Kroger stock for each Fred Meyer share, which puts the value of the
shares, based on Friday's closing price, at $48.75. After the stock
swap, Fred Meyer shareholders will own 38 percent of the combined
company.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer shares declined $4.8125 Monday, to $44.1875, and
Kroger shares closed at $45.4375, down $3.3125. The market's
initial reaction indicated that investors might have concerns about
the logistics of integrating the companies, while some might have
expected Kroger to acquire the much larger Safeway Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Still, managements of both companies called the transaction a
``powerful strategic combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Pichler, chairman and chief executive of Kroger, said,
``Together, we will have the No. 1 or No. 2 market share in 33 of
the nation's largest markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is not expected to affect Kroger's earnings per
share in the 1999 fiscal year and is expected to contribute
substantially to earnings thereafter, though the companies did not
say by how much. Kroger said it expected to save about $225 million
within three years, with approximately $75 million of that in the
first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will achieve economies of scale by leveraging purchasing,
information technology, manufacturing and distribution across a
much larger store base,'' Pichler said. Some of the cost cuts will
come from laying off an undisclosed number of office workers, but
not from job cuts at stores _ now about 90 percent of the
companies' combined work force of 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler will continue to run the combined company while Ronald
W. Burkle, chairman of Fred Meyer, will become chairman of the
executive committee of Kroger's board. Robert G. Miller, vice
chairman and chief executive of Fred Meyer, will become vice
chairman and chief operating officer of Kroger. In addition to
Burkle and Miller, four other Fred Meyer nominees will join the
Kroger board, which will be expanded to 19 directors from 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a longtime believer in consolidation in the
supermarket industry,'' Burkle said, adding that teaming up with
Kroger helps both companies because it creates a national
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was approved by both companies' boards and is subject
to shareholder and regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust problems are not expected. Where there is overlap, as
in Arizona, the stores operate different formats. For instance,
Fred Meyer operates drugstores as well as superstores that sell
everything from jewelry to Jello, while Kroger sticks mainly to
bread-and-butter items. Even so, government regulators may require
the company to sell some stores before the deal is approved, but
that is not likely to derail the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Fred Meyer, which has annual revenue around $15 billion,
operates 800 food and general merchandise stores in 12 states from
Alaska to Texas. Kroger, with revenue of $28 billion, operates
1,398 food stores and 802 convenience stores, most of them in the
Midwest and the Southeast, as well as 34 manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the combined businesses will create an industry
leader with strong management, substantial potential for earnings
growth and the store formats and locations to compete with
nontraditional food retailers, like Wal-Mart, that now sell a range
of grocery items, from lettuce to soup.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They added that one concern was whether management would be able
to integrate the combined company's far-flung operations,
especially when Fred Meyer is still trying to digest the businesses
of other chains it recently acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company acquired Quality Food Centers and Ralphs
Grocery Co. in separate deals worth about $2 billion. It also
purchased Smith's Food and Drug Centers for $1.96 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They operate different types of formats and Fred Meyer has
different operations in different markets,'' said George E.
Thompson, an analyst who follows the industry for Prudential
Securities. ``That is going to make it complicated, there is no
question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and other analysts said the benefits of the deal
outweighed the potential pitfalls. ``Kroger has made investments in
technology and systems, and they have done a lot of cost-cutting
and elimination of replicated functions throughout the organization
from a systems standpoint,'' said Bonni Z. Bleustein of Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``They also get an excellent management team
in the Fred Meyer group.''
</P>
<P>
   In purchasing Fred Meyer, Kroger also regains its long-held
bragging rights as the largest industry competitor ranked by
revenue. The distinction was grabbed in August by Albertson's when
it announced that it would acquire American Stores Co. for $8.3
billion, creating a chain with $36 billion in revenue and 2,500
stores in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
   Some other recent deals include Safeway's announcement last week
that it would acquire the Dominick's supermarket chain for $1.85
billion, and the acquisition in May by Royal Ahold of Giant Food
Inc. for $2.6 billion. Such combinations, which spread a company's
costs over a much larger store base, are expected to continue and
to make it increasingly difficult for small, independent grocers to
compete on price, marketing and store location terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independents clearly have more and more of a competitive
disadvantage,'' Ms. Bleustein said.

AUTOMAKERS EXPERIMENT WITH NEW FUELS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Okla.)   (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Struggling to comply with federal fuel-economy and
emissions regulations even as Americans buy ever bigger family
vehicles, automakers have quietly begun experiments with oil
companies to develop new and potentially cleaner fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and General Motors have already entered long-term
partnerships with oil companies, while Chrysler plans to announce
on Wednesday a program with immediate goals: testing vehicles over
the next two years that will burn a promising type of synthetic
fuel made from natural gas instead of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic fuel is similar to diesel and can be burned in
diesel engines. Chrysler's goal is to develop a new generation of
diesel engines that, using the synthetic fuel, will burn as cleanly
as the cleanest gasoline engines, said Loren Beard, Chrysler's
manager of fuels technology. Many automakers are planning to
replace some of their gasoline engines with more fuel-efficient
diesel engines. For one thing, this would allow them to build ever
bigger sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks without violating
federal fuel-efficiency rules.
</P>
<P>
   But obstacles remain. The Syntroleum Corp., which has a small
factory that will supply synthetic fuel for the tests, estimates
that mass production will push the fuel's cost down to $1.50 or
less a gallon. Still, even reducing the cost to that level will
require considerable investments in new equipment at natural gas
fields, as well as persuading service stations to set aside pumps
and tanks for the new fuel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main experiments with Chrysler will involve a blend
of only 20 or 30 percent synthetic fuel with the rest as regular
diesel, said Mark Agee, president and chief operating officer of
Syntroleum, based in Tulsa, Okla. The blend may then be competitive
in price with premium grades of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Robertson, Chrysler's vice president for engineering
technologies, predicted that premium grades of diesel, consisting
of a blend with synthetic fuel, would become available within five
years. Future diesel cars and light trucks will likely require the
premium grades, much as current models require unleaded gasoline to
reduce pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel engines produce up to 30 percent better fuel economy than
gasoline engines. But they emit more air pollution, although the
latest models are far cleaner than the sooty diesels of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic automakers are all developing diesel engines now
for large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which earn the
highest profits per vehicle. So-called light trucks _ a category
including vans as well as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks
_ are allowed to meet a lower average fuel economy than cars. But
automakers have had trouble meeting even this standard with the
recent popularity of such models as the Dodge Ram full-size pickup
and the huge Ford Expedition and Chevrolet Suburban sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and California regulators are drafting new, tougher
emissions regulations that may be hard for diesel engines to meet.
In response, automakers have been working on cleaner engines and
cleaner fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The process for making the synthetic diesel from natural gas is
loosely based on a technique first developed in the 1920s. But
tighter air quality standards and automakers' difficulties with
fuel-economy standards are forcing a reconsideration of the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already begun experimenting with the synthetic
substitutes for diesel, while GM plans to do so in the coming
months, as part of their efforts to produce an extremely
high-mileage car in cooperation with the federal government.
Because the fuel burns so cleanly, it may have applications in cars
as well as light trucks, said Sara Tatchio, a Ford spokesman.

HOUSTON AREA STRUGGLES TO ABSORB UNRELENTING RAINFALL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RAD SALLEE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Harris and surrounding counties struggled Monday to
absorb two days of unrelenting rainfall that turned many
subdivisions into lakes, swamped roads and highways and forced
scores of residents to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The official rain gauge at Bush Intercontinental Airport in
Houston measured 4.04 inches through 4 p.m. Sunday, breaking the
record of 3.36 inches set in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Although the same gauge on Monday recorded just .5 inches, other
there was significantly more at other stations. At Cypress Creek,
near Westfield north of Houston, there was almost an inch, and near
Hockley 1.3 inches, the same amount that fell at Goose Creek near
Baytown, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's forecast is a 60 percent chance of more rain.
</P>
<P>
   The worst flooding in the Houston area was north along the San
Jacinto River, Cypress Creek and Willow Creek. Some streamside
homes were evacuated by boat Sunday, and a handful of people spent
the night at emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m. Monday, the watershed of the East Fork of the San
Jacinto had gotten 14.44 inches of rain in 36 hours, the highest
total among watersheds in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The river was five feet out of its banks along Hamblin Road in
the Forest Cove and Northshore subdivisions in north Houston, where
residents had to paddle over flooded streets in boats and canoes.
Rising water poured into dozens of homes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The same happened downstream in the Rio Villa and Banana Bend
subdivisions, where the river frequently spreads into surrounding
lowland, said Frank Gutierrez, the county's emergency management
operations supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   A barge broke loose early Monday on the San Jacinto River east
of Houston, damaging a bridge support under Interstate 10 and
briefly closing westbound lanes into the city and forcing a longer
partial shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding closed Highway 59 at the San Bernard River bridge on
the Fort Bend-Wharton County line and farther south near
Hungerford.
</P>
<P>
   East of Houston in Liberty County, airboats were used Monday to
rescue four families from homes in the Cleveland area. Three other
families had been rescued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday, roads to the homes remained impassable, but no
water was in the homes. The only road into Sam Houston Lake Estates
was also impassible by most vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Another seven families in the Oak Hi area near Cleveland,
northeast of Houston, reported being stranded after a culvert on
Tree Monkey Road washed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened once before and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency helped us rebuild it, but this time there won't be a
disaster declaration and the county says they can't fix a private
road,'' said homeowner Juan Lomas, 45, a disabled trucker who uses
a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only other way out is a pasture but we would bog down in
that. We'll have to somehow find the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Area streams were expected to peak Monday and subside slowly
over the next several days. Although most of the rain had stopped
by Monday afternoon, two shelters remained on standby Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They are Rosehill Baptist Church, 18214 FM2920 in far northwest
Harris County, and First Baptist Church, 25503 FM2100 in Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   A construction worker killed in Brookshire by a tornado early
Sunday was identified by police Monday as Jose Flores Alvarez, 33,
of San Luis Potisi, between Monterrey and Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was staying at a friend's trailer south of town when the
twister hit. He was thrown more than 100 yards and killed
instantly, investigators said. The trailer was demolished and the
friend was slightly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the death and tornado damage to homes in Wimbledon
Estates north of Houston and a Katy, Texas, church west of Houston,
the Houston area did not sustain nearly the damage that was done
Sept. 11 by Tropical Storm Frances Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Splendora, New Caney and Tarkington school districts did not
have classes Monday because of roads and streets that were
impassable except by the private boats that shuttled residents in
and out of neighborhoods surrounded by water.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the light but steady rainfall Monday, officials in
those districts were unsure if classes will resume Tuesday. They
advised parents to monitor television and radio stations for
reports on school closings.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Smith, a Methodist Hospital operating room nurse who raises
a rare breed of horses called Spanish Barbs, said flood water rose
to the animals' bellies Sunday night as they stood in their stalls
at her stable near Hockley.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 exotic animals were among some 40 that passed the night
alone unharmed after fire department personnel ordered the
caretaker to leave for her own safety, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   On the barge-disabled I-10 bridge across the San Jacinto, two
lanes may be in use Tuesday, said Texas Department of
Transportation spokesman Norm Wigington.
</P>
<P>
   Eastbound traffic crosses the river on a parallel span that was
not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs will take several weeks, Wigington said, and congestion
is expected on the heavily traveled freeway, the major truck route
to Beaumont, Texas, and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Petty Officer B.G. Hemker of the Coast Guard station in
Houston read a statement saying the double-hulled tank barge
carrying liquid styrene was being pushed south by the towboat
Arabian when it hit the bridge column about 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries or pollution occurred, and the barge was freed about
9:30 a.m., he said. The cause of the collision is under
investigation, Hemker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a Coast Guard investigation and a drug test.
That is routine procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemker said the barge owner was reported as Western Towing of
Houston and the towboat owner as ``ACBL'' of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   American Commercial Barge Lines there referred inquiries to
company headquarters in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Neither company
returned calls for comment. &QL;

DEATH COMES INCH BY INCH AS SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS BECOMES AWASH IN
FLOODWATERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and JOHN GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LULING, Texas _ Juan Garza and his wife must have seen death
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Inch by inch.
</P>
<P>
   Hour by hour.
</P>
<P>
   Until Plum Creek, normally a placid stream that feeds into the
San Marcos River, became a raging river.
</P>
<P>
   And there was nothing that he _ a double amputee _ or his ailing
wife could do. With phone lines out, there was no way for the
elderly couple to call for help.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time relatives called Luling authorities Sunday
morning to register concern that they had been unable to reach the
Garzas, water had swamped all but the roof, said Tina Gillis,
director of emergency medical services for this town of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday night before the water had receded enough that
authorities could retrieve the Garza's bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis said authorities are awaiting autopsy results before
attributing the Garzas' deaths to the flood.
</P>
<P>
   But presuming they drowned in floodwaters, it would raise to 16
the number of lives claimed by severe weather since Saturday. The
Texas Division of Emergency Management said floods claimed six
people in the San Antonio area, two in Comal County and three in
Guadalupe County. Tornadoes in Waller and Navarro counties, also in
South Central Texas, each claimed one life.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least six people remain missing, including three
children, two in Caldwell County and one in Comal County. The other
three missing people also are from Caldwell County, said Linda
Kimmons, communications supervisor for the Caldwell County
sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   All of the missing, Kimmons added, ``more than likely are
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   As rain continued to soak South Central Texas and the Hill
Country on Monday, authorities were preparing once again to
evacuate residents who live along the San Marcos River and creeks
that flow into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our collective hearts go out to the people who lost their
lives and their loved ones,'' Gov. George W. Bush said as he toured
hard-hit areas of San Antonio. ``We are deeply concerned. We will
do everything humanly possible to get aid as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was to survey the damage in a helicopter but, noting that
rescue operations were ongoing, said, ``I don't want to tie up a
chopper for a photo opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasts gave little hope to the sodden Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service forecast more rain, sometimes
heavy, Tuesday for the Hill Country and South Central Texas. A
chance of showers and thunderstorms is expected through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 60 counties _ nearly one-fourth of Texas _ have reported
flooding, said Tom Millwee, state coordinator of the division of
emergency management.
</P>
<P>
   And state authorities said 7,000 Texans have been evacuated to
shelters since the flooding began Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The floods also threatened cattle. Thousands of animals were set
loose when the rain-swollen San Marcos River washed away pens,
barns and hundreds of miles of fencing.
</P>
<P>
   Extension agent Lytle Arche estimated that as many as 5,000
cattle could be roaming Caldwell County alone. He estimated at
least 10,000 more would wander from their pastures in neighboring
Guadalupe and Gonzales counties.
</P>
<P>
   The counties lie along the Guadalupe River, just east of
flood-ravaged San Antonio and New Braunfels. The river is usually
about 150 feet across. On Monday it was three miles wide in some
areas and rising.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak said the city was returning to
normal after record floods, but that considerable cleanup work
remained. The east side of the city near Salado Creek was struck
particularly hard, with damages to both businesses and homes. Some
70 barricades remained up around the city Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything humanly possible to get aid as quickly
as possible,'' Peak said.
</P>
<P>
   All across South Central Texas and the Hill Country _ from La
Grange to Del Rio _ the National Weather Service kept 32 counties
under a flash flood watch as clouds carrying light rain drifted
slowly across the region Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cool air from the north was interacting with Gulf moisture,
producing storms that stayed generally east of Interstate 35,
causing fresh woes in Comal, Guadalupe, Caldwell, Lee and Bastrop
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Water was within two blocks of downtown La Grange, where two
mobile home parks were flooded, the National Weather Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Every river, creek and stream between Austin and the Gulf of
Mexico was flooded, experts said. Numerous homes were damaged or in
danger and roads were inundated throughout the region. Flooding was
reported along the Colorado, Guadalupe, San Antonio, Brazos,
Aransas and Nueces rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Floodwaters also played havoc with utilities, transportation,
communication and commerce. The waters deposited live snakes in
trees and inside houses; caused colonies of ants and termites to
swarm to higher ground and stranded livestock and pets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton pledged Monday to help Texas
communities devastated by floods and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing for Middle East peace negotiations in eastern
Maryland, the president said James Lee Witt, director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, was working with officials in
Central and Southeast Texas to assess damage and determine what
recovery efforts are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, the nation stands ready to assist the people of Texas
in their time of need,'' Clinton said. &QL;

WASHINGTON STATE IS THIS YEAR'S BATTLEGROUND OVER AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new graf beginning ``It's the big lie.'' Adds 5 grafs

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two years after California voters abolished most
affirmative action programs and a year after Houston's residents
chose to retain them, the fight has shifted to the Northwest, where
voters in Washington state are facing the only ballot initiative in
the country this year on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Initiative 200, the measure would outlaw any
preferences in state decisions on hiring, school admissions or
contracting based on race or gender. If it passes, Washington would
become only the second state to enact such a measure, perhaps
giving impetus to similar efforts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But as they listen to the two sides wage a fierce debate over
the measure, voters here could be forgiven for being confused about
exactly what is at stake on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   A blitz of advertisements in the last two weeks of the campaign
shows why:
</P>
<P>
   In one radio advertisement being aired by those who want to ban
preferences, a classroom of children is heard reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance as a little girl asks: ``Does it matter what color
someone is? Should it matter?'' A man explains that under current
state policies, someone can get a job or a contract or a spot in
school ``based on the color of that person's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a television advertisement being run by opponents of the
measure, Gov. Gary Locke stares into the camera and casts the
initiative in a very different light. The governor, a Democrat,
never even uses the words ``race'' or ``color,'' ``black'' or
``white,'' talking only about gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will roll back the progress women have made,'' Locke says,
``in getting equal pay for equal work.'' Another advertisement
shows women in the workplace _ at computers, wearing lab coats or
in hard hats _ and offers a similar warning.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that is 86 percent white, and where the biggest
ethnic minority is Asian Americans, who are not in many of the
state's main affirmative action programs, the two sides are
employing sharply contrasting strategies in their effort to win on
Election Day. And both because women can benefit from affirmative
action and because polls suggest that they are less likely than men
to think that such programs are unnecessary, opponents are focusing
their efforts on women.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure angrily denounce the appeal to women
as a distortion of what I-200 is all about, while the opponents,
just as angrily, say the emphasis on race represents an effort to
inflame racial discord in a state where affirmative action has
never been a contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   The only point on which both camps agree is that the outcome is
enormously important to their cause. With their only electoral
victory so far in California, proponents of eliminating most
affirmative action programs hope to carry momentum from a victory
here to other states, including Florida, where efforts to get a
similar measure on the ballot this year stalled.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say that if they can stop the measure in a state
like Washington, where affirmative action is not in general a
hugely divisive issue, their victory may further dampen efforts in
other states to bring the matter before voters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure's wording, the state ``shall not discriminate
against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or
group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national
origin'' in education, employment or contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, backed by contributions from some of the state's
biggest corporations, including Microsoft, Boeing and the Starbucks
coffee chain, are mounting a big advertising drive in the final
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With polls having shown all along that voters are generally
inclined to say ``yes'' when the measure's wording is read to them,
the opponents say they are trying to warn Washingtonians of what
Locke calls ``hidden consequences'' of the measure. Supporters of
the initiative say the new advertisements are an outrageous effort
to confuse the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to make this a gender issue, rather than an
issue of racial preferences, which is most of what is encompassed
by 200,'' said John Carlson, host of a talk show on an Internet
broadcast network and leader of the drive for the initiative.
``They cannot win this campaign by honestly debating the merits and
the current system of affirmative action. And so they are flailing
about like a prizefighter in the 13th round, who's lost every
round, and is now beginning to swing wildly.''
</P>
<P>
   But No!200, the main group organized to fight the measure,
accuses Carlson and Ward Connerly, the leader of the California
initiative drive and the head of a Sacramento-based group that has
paid for pro-initiative ads, of bringing needlessly divisive
politics here and ignoring the initiative's effects on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the same rhetoric as in California, which has a
completely different demographic picture,'' said Michelle
Ackermann, spokeswoman for No!200, who added that it was proper for
the group's ads to focus on women. ``The fact is, this is primarily
a gender issue in this state. It is a woman's issue. The primary
beneficiaries of affirmative action in this state are white women.
So that is what we should be discussing.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The opponents point to women such as Anne Symonds, president of
Seattle-based Symonds Consulting Engineers, a 42-employee company
here that is one of about 4,000 in the state registered as women-
or minority-owned and thus targeted in programs aimed at making
sure that such companies are represented in government contracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these programs have done is allowed us to get our foot in
the door with certain clients,'' said Ms. Symonds, who said it was
very difficult to do so when government agencies were dealing with
an established ``old-boy network'' of firms and had no obligation
to look elsewhere. She estimated that about 90 percent of her $3.5
million in billings involves government work in civil and
structural engineering.
</P>
<P>
   And, reflecting some of the more general opposition to I-200,
Ms. Symonds said, ``I'm very concerned that we're seeing a backlash
against what we have gained in the last 30 years. When you think
back to what it was like 30 years ago, we really don't want to go
there, both on women's issues and race issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents' strategy of emphasizing women's issues could well
backfire in some respects, since women's grades are better than
men's at many state universities, and opponents question whether
there is any basis to the notion that they need special
consideration in university admissions or government hiring.
</P>
<P>
   But Connerly, whose Sacramento-based American Civil Rights
Institute paid for much of the signature drive that got Initiative
200 on the ballot, said in a telephone interview that the
opponents' argument was a red herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've decided that the only way you're going to defeat this
thing is to put a white woman's face on it,'' said Connerly.
``They're trying to frighten women so enough women will vote
against it, but I personally don't think it will work. They say,
`Oh, this will endanger equal pay for equal work.' But that's
totally ridiculous _ it would seem to me that that would be blatant
discrimination, and Proposition 200 says there would be no
discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the big lie,'' added Connerly. ``But just read the
language. There is no way you can read that and say it's somehow
going to disadvantage women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the big lie,'' added Connerly. ``But just read the
language. There is no way you can read that and say it's somehow
going to disadvantage women.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate in Washington comes against a backdrop of repeated
polls here and elsewhere that show people inclined to support
measures with the language used in California, specifically the
requirement that government ``shall not discriminate against, or
grant preferential treatment,'' but less inclined to support the
measures when simply described as banning affirmative-action
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The language was a critical factor in the success of
California's Proposition 209 two years ago, while in Houston, when
the City Council changed the language to make it essentially a
referendum on ending affirmative action, the voters said no. (The
city's programs are still being challenged in a court case.)
</P>
<P>
   In a statewide poll taken two weeks ago by Mason-Dixon
Political/Media Research Inc. for several news organizations, 55
percent of Washingtonians surveyed said they would support the
measure when a summary text was read to them, and 35 percent said
they were against. When told the measure would end many
affirmative-action programs, the margin dropped to 46 percent in
favor and 40 percent opposed.
</P>
<P>
   While the measure has consistently had wide support in the
polls, opponents say they can turn the tide in the final weeks
through heavy television advertising, which is being paid for by
contributions from businesses as well as individuals, and through
campaigning by a large roster of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   These include Locke, the state's first Chinese-American
governor, whose stance in the advertisements makes for a stark
contrast to Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican who
campaigned vigorously for the measure two years ago to ban
preferences there.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other contentious issues swirling around the
fight over I-200, which would be officially known as the Washington
State Civil Rights Act. And even if it is passed, it is likely, as
happened with California's measure, to result in a blitz of
lawsuits intended to test how its provisions are to be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, opponents say the measure is so broadly written
that a large number of recruitment programs could come under
attack, even possibly ones that are intended to help women get
services like breast-cancer screening, a claim that the measure's
supporters dismiss as ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Another question surrounding a ``yes'' vote is the status of
other programs in Washington's affirmative action policies, which
in some cases give preferences to white men. That is because state
and local governments may extend preferences to war veterans,
disabled people and low-income residents of any race, all
categories that are not covered in the language of Initiative 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something else they won't tell you about a `yes'
vote,'' said Ms. Ackermann of No!200. ``Those programs are not
affected by the initiative, so we could end up with those
quote-unquote preferences for white men still in place.''

   A United Nations special envoy said that the threat of a
confrontation between Iran and Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia
had passed. The envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, spoke in Tehran after more
than a week of shuttle diplomacy during which he sought to defuse
tensions that threatened to grow into a military clash. Iran sent
more than 200,000 troops to its border with Afghanistan after
Taliban forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
August, and a limited clash between the two sides was reported
early this month. In meetings with Taliban officials, Brahimi
gained the release of 26 Iranian prisoners and a promise by the
Taliban to hold direct talks with Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
   John E. Fagg, a retired history professor at New York University
and an author of books on Latin American and Spanish history, died
Oct. 3 at his home in Austin, Texas. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in San Saba, Texas, and received his bachelor's
degree from the University of Texas in 1938. The next year he
earned a master's degree from the University of Chicago and a
doctorate there in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, after serving in the Army Air Forces pre-flight school
during the war, he began teaching at New York University and
remained there until 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the history department from 1961 until 1969
and director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies
from 1961 to 1965 and from 1977 to 1979. He was also assistant dean
of the Graduate School of Arts and Science from 1950 to 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Fagg wrote numerous scholarly articles about modern Latin
America, 19th-century Spain and World War II. He was best known for
``Latin America: A General History,'' first published by the
Macmillan Publishing Company in 1963 with several later revised
editions.
</P>

SUSPECT SAYS SECOND MAN KILLED TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 20-year-old man accused in the torture and killing
of his former high school English teacher was in the victim's
apartment the day of the crime, his lawyers said Monday, but they
argued that the killing was done by a second defendant and that
others involved in the case might still be free.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution countered in its opening statement that the
defendant in this trial, Corey Arthur, was the gunman who fired a
single shot into the head of Jonathan Levin on May 30, 1997, after
torturing him for his automated banking card.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting arguments came on the first day of the
first-degree murder trial in a case that stunned the city and led
some teachers to question how accessible they should make
themselves to their students outside school.
</P>
<P>
   During opening arguments, a defense lawyer, Anthony Ricco,
suggested that Arthur had been taken advantage of by his
co-defendant, Montoun Hart, 26, and other accomplices who Ricco
said are still at large in the killing of Levin, a popular teacher
at William Howard Taft High School in the South Bronx and the son
of Gerald Levin, the chairman of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is going to show that Montoun Hart and others
took advantage of this young man for their own murderous
purposes,'' Ricco told jurors in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Hurley, an assistant district attorney, told jurors in
his opening statement that Arthur had a motive to kill Levin that
Hart did not have _ to eliminate the one witness who could
positively identify him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan Levin did not know Montoun Hart,'' Hurley said. ``But
he was Corey Arthur's former teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and Hart are being tried separately on charges of
carrying out the killing of Levin, 31. The police have said they
believe there are no other accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's lawyer, David Stern, said in a telephone interview Monday
that his client did not kill Levin. ``I don't believe that what
he's saying is true,'' he said, referring to the argument made by
Ricco. Hart's trial is to begin on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   New details of the crime's brutality emerged as testimony began
in Arthur's trial. Dr. John Hayes, a senior New York City medical
examiner, testified that a knife or sharp object was apparently
drawn across Levin's throat three times as his head was being held
back. The wounds were not deep enough to kill Levin, but one was 4
inches long, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' dry, technical descriptions of the wounds drew rapt
attention. He said that Levin also had been stabbed in the chest
and the back of the neck before being shot point-blank.
</P>
<P>
   Other prosecution witnesses included friends of Levin who broke
down on the stand as they recounted their frantic efforts to find
him.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Williams, a friend of Levin who is also an English
teacher at Taft, said she and other teachers knew something was
wrong when he did not show up for a gathering on May 31, a
Saturday, and then did not arrive at school the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that she and another teacher went to Levin's
apartment and called the police after frantically asking neighbors
if they had seen Levin. A neighbor with a key let them and police
officers inside, she said. ``I stepped inside the door and probably
took two or three steps,'' she said. ``Then somebody screamed.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 relatives, friends and former students of Levin
attended the opening statements. In a reflection of the disparate
worlds Levin lived in, men and women in business suits commiserated
with his former students from Taft during breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really nice teacher,'' said Annie Cabrera, 21, a
former pupil of Levin. ``He taught me a lot. I'm here to support
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the courtroom, four members of Arthur's
family sat behind defense lawyers. In his opening argument, Ricco
said Arthur had not named all his accomplices and had been made a
scapegoat by a police department under intense pressure to find
Levin's killer.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the police pressured people into making false
statements against Arthur and that he would attack the credibility
of Carlethia Weeks, a former girlfriend of Arthur who is to testify
that he told her of shooting Levin.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors on Monday painted a chilling portrait of Arthur,
who left Taft after a drug conviction in 1994. They said that he
got Levin to open the door by misleading him. An answering machine
recorded Arthur's asking Levin to pick up when he called at 4:55
p.m., saying, ``It's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, the prosecutor, said the two suspects then quickly
attacked Levin. He apparently gave up his bank code quickly, with
Hart withdrawing the money at 5:15 p.m. A witness testified Monday
that he saw Hart withdraw money from a nearby bank machine at the
time. And Hurley said that DNA tests showed that Levin's blood was
on a pair of jeans found in Hart's apartment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue of who fired the fatal shot could prove to be the
difference between a conviction on first-degree murder and one on
second-degree murder. A first-degree murder conviction carries a
sentence of life in prison without parole. A conviction for
second-degree murder carries a sentence of 25 years to life, with a
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, could have
sought the death penalty against Arthur, but chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Monday's session, members of the jury were shown a
series of photos of the crime scene. The graphic pictures showed
Levin's one-bedroom apartment, and, in its kitchen, his prone body.

TWO BAD YEARS TO BE THE N.L. CHAMP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Talk about poor timing. The San Diego Padres get to
the World Series twice in their 30-year history, and they play the
1984 Detroit Tigers and the 1998 New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're saying the two times we've gone, we've played the
best teams in baseball, you're right,'' Tony Gwynn said Monday.
``There's nothing you can do about that. You're sure not going to
give it back, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   But couldn't the Padres have won the National League pennant in
a year in which the American League winner didn't have one of the
best seasons in history?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about getting to the World Series,'' Gwynn,
the Padres' elder statesman, said. ``You can't pick. When it's time
to go, it's time to go. You have to play the cards that are
dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Tuesday night's third game of this World Series,
the cards are definitely stacked against the Padres. They are down,
two games to none, and are in danger of disappearing even faster
than their 1984 ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   That year's World Series lasted five games. The Tigers won the
first game in San Diego, the Padres won the second, and then the
Tigers went home and won all three games there. End of Series. End
of Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a team that jumped out to some unbelievable record
and never looked back,'' said Greg Booker, a relief pitcher for the
'84 Padres and the bullpen coach for these Padres. ``It was their
year. You're talking about playing a whole year with the confidence
that that team did, just like this team has here, winning a
hundred-some games. There are a lot of similarities.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers won 35 of their first 40 games, a start that not even
the Yankees (31-9) matched in this, their record-breaking year. The
Tigers finished with a 104-58 record (the Yankees 114-48), then
swept a three-game league championship series from Kansas City
before pummeling the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities Booker referred to have continued in the World
Series. Just as the Yankees had their way with Andy Ashby, the
starting pitcher in Game 2, the Tigers repeatedly drove the Padres'
starting pitcher from the game early. In five of the Padres' seven
World Series games, their starting pitcher has not made it through
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby went out after two and two-thirds, allowing seven runs,
though only four earned. In 1984, Mark Thurmond, the Game 1
starter, pitched five innings, but then Ed Whitson got only two
outs in the second game, and he was followed by Tim Lollar with one
and two-thirds innings pitched; Eric Show, who went two and
two-thirds, and Thurmond, who got only one out. The 1984 starters
combined for a 13.94 ERA, allowing 16 earned runs in 101/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that killed us in '84,'' said Bruce Bochy, the Padres'
manager, who was their backup catcher then. ``But I think the
difference is, our starters were a little intimidated by Detroit.
Our guys now aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   As bizarre as it might seem, the game the Padres won in 1984 was
the one Whitson started. The Padres, down by 3-0, struck back with
five runs, while Andy Hawkins and Craig Lefferts held the Tigers
scoreless the rest of the game.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sparky Anderson managed those Tigers, and Monday he was asked on
the telephone to compare his team and these Yankees. He never quite
got around to it. He spent the entire conversation raving about the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't talk about his catcher Lance Parrish or his right
fielder Kirk Gibson or his center fielder Chet Lemon or his middle
infield combination of Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell. He didn't
compare his closer, Willie (later Guillermo) Hernandez, to Mariano
Rivera, or his starting pitching of Jack Morris, Dan Petry and Milt
Wilcox to the Yankees' strong starting corps. He just kept raving
about the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who also played in the 1984 World Series, said he really
didn't want to talk about 1984 either; in fact, he said, ``I'm
tired of talking.'' But he would not be Tony Gwynn if he stopped
talking, so he just kept talking.
</P>
<P>
   He was raving about Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter, the first
two batters in the Yankees' lineup, and he was asked to compare
them to Whitaker and Trammell, Nos. 1 and 2 in Anderson's batting
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were different types of hitters,'' said Gwynn, the man
who was tired of talking. ``Knoblauch is the feisty guy who can
stand there, take pitches, foul pitches off, get hit by pitches,
and he can swing the bat. He's very unusual. He's a good hitter
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeter can do everything. He's polished. He can inside-out
balls. He can turn on balls, drive them. In today's game, he's your
typical 2-hitter. He does everything well. He can play hit-and-run,
has a good eye, has good bat control. He hits with some power,
drives in runs. These two guys are very unusual because they are
really polished at what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker and Trammell, Gwynn said, were two great players, but,
he said, ``They were two different types of players.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Neither one of them really stole a lot of bases.
Neither one of them was really great at bat control. They did their
own thing their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Flannery, the Padres' third-base coach, was a utility
infielder for the '84 Padres and played against Whitaker and
Trammell and the rest of the Tigers. Asked what he recalled about
the Tigers, he said: ``I can't remember. Bad things I erase out my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Flannery may soon have to erase his other World
Series experience, too.

 &HT;    Outcome of Congressional Races Uncertain
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional candidate Rudy Izzard of Abilene has
a couple of wishful thoughts about the U.S. House and its
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they get it over and done with before I get up there
because I don't want to spend a day on it,'' said Izzard, a
Republican. ``I've worked hard for this seat so I can get to
Congress and work on issues like agriculture and veterans
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Izzard, the seat he wants in Congress has been
held for 20 years by Rep. Charles Stenholm of Stamford, a Democrat
so conservative that he bucked his party on two recent bills,
voting one week to give Clinton wide authority to negotiate trade
agreements and voting the next week to launch an impeachment
inquiry. The second vote put Stenholm in the company of only 31
House Democrats and cemented his conservative label.
</P>
<P>
   But Izzard, making his second bid for Stenholm's seat in the
17th District in West Central Texas, is running in what Republicans
see as their best hope of capturing a Democratic seat in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win the Stenholm-Izzard rematch is anybody's guess. And
so it goes in U.S. House races from Abilene to Zavala. As members
head home this week to begin the final stretch of campaigning
before the Nov. 3 election, incumbents in at least a half-dozen of
Texas' 30 congressional districts face uncertain futures _ in part
because no one can predict how voters will react to a philandering
president and a popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very volatile situation,'' said Paul Frick,
political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, the national organizing and finance committee for House
Democrats. Democrats' best chance Currently, there are 17 Democrats
and 13 Republicans in Texas' congressional delegation. The
Democrats see their best shot at recapturing a Republican seat on
the outskirts of Austin, where Loy Sneary is trying to unseat Rep.
Ron Paul, R-Surfside.
</P>
<P>
   Even in that largely rural district, where relief for
drought-stricken ranchers has been a prime political issue this
year, Paul has tried to brush his opponent with Clinton tar by
deriding the appearance of U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
at an August fund-raiser for Sneary.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in the contest between Paul and Sneary will represent
the 14th District, which stretches from the Gulf Coast to the hills
of Blanco County and covers Hays County, western Travis County and
eastern Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who served in the House from 1976 to 1984, returned to
Congress two years ago after an unsuccessful presidential run as a
Libertarian. Although he was elected as a Republican, Paul's
Libertarian leanings drive his House votes and his fund raising. He
votes against anything that the Constitution doesn't specifically
authorize. For campaign money, Paul is relying on his old network
of Libertarian supporters, drawing as much as 70 percent of his
financial support from outside Texas. As of last week, he had twice
as much cash on hand as Sneary, reporting $404,478 to the
Democrat's $199,318.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Paul's iconoclastic ways, Republicans are working to
re-elect him. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, and House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., each have contributed $5,000 to
Paul's campaign from the political action committees they operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a man of principle like Ron in Congress is important,
not only for us in the leadership of the House of Representatives,
but to our nation, to Texas and to every man, woman and child in
the 14th District,'' Armey said of Paul during a fund-raising
breakfast in Victoria last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and their allies, including plaintiffs' lawyers, are
backing Sneary, a rice farmer and former Matagorda County judge.
Among Sneary's biggest financial backers are the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America, which gave $15,000, and the Texas Farm
Bureau, which contributed $14,050. A group of conservative House
Democrats, known as Blue Dogs, have kicked in $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron Paul is somebody we feel we have a very aggressive
challenge against,'' Frick said. ``Loy Sneary is one of the
stronger candidates we have.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Sneary is relying on his own agricultural
experience to appeal to voters in the largely rural district, but
he's also hammering Paul with his own votes, particularly those
that would discourage international trade that farmers need and
want. Battle of conservatives Farm and trade issues are also
dominating the Stenholm-Izzard race to represent a district that
stretches from just north of Fort Worth to within an hour of the
New Mexico border. Izzard, a dentist and rancher, took 47 percent
of the vote in 1996 to Stenholm's 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm has the incumbent's edge in finances. Last week he
reported $447,353 on hand, compared with Izzard's $173,342.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Stenholm has solidified his position in
Washington as both a powerful force in agriculture and a very
conservative Democrat. He is the highest-ranking Democrat on the
House Agriculture Committee, and he had the pull to bring
Agriculture Secretary Glickman to Texas in August to campaign for
both Stenholm and Sneary.
</P>
<P>
   Izzard will be hard pressed to be more conservative than his
opponent. Stenholm said he voted to open an impeachment inquiry of
Clinton to make the process move faster and allow ``healing to
begin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While my constituents have differing opinions about what
should happen next in this process, they are united in one desire:
to have this unfortunate episode moved out of the present
preoccupation and into past history,'' Stenholm said.
</P>
<P>
   Izzard, who is being highlighted in a generic ad paid for by the
National Republican Congressional Committee, is personally touting
his attentiveness to oil and gas interests in the district,
including his endorsement by Texas Railroad Commission Chairman
Charles Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas interests are suffering just as badly in his
district as agriculture but haven't received as much attention,
Izzard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those folks are looking for somebody who will go to Congress
on their behalf,'' he said.

 &HT;    Agreement between GM, union may save jobs
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Union leaders at two General Motors Corp. brake
factories in Dayton have reached a tentative agreement with the
automaker that could make the troubled factories profitable and
secure at least 1,700 jobs for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will keep open GM's Delphi Chassis plants on Wisconsin
Boulevard and Needmore Road until 2002, said sources close to the
factories.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement could come at a heavy price for United Auto
Workers Local 696, which has waged war with GM for three years for
the plants' survival.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the tentative local contract, workers eligible
for retirement during the next two years would be offered a $25,000
lump-sum payment as a retirement incentive. About 1,700 of the
plants' 3,400 hourly workers are eligible for retirement in the
next two years and sources close to the plants believe at least
1,000 workers would accept the retirement package.
</P>
<P>
   The contract would not require Delphi to replace the retiring
workers. However, sources close to the automotive parts company
said it is possible that additional workers could be hired if the
plants become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The plants, two of nine GM factories in the Dayton area, make
braking systems and other parts for GM and other automakers. Both
plants have sustained financial losses in recent years totaling
more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   GM hopes to reverse those losses by removing two product lines
from the plants that have been costing the company millions. As
part of the three-year contract, Local 696 has agreed to give up
the two product lines, which include anti-lock braking systems, and
not strike until 2002, the sources said. In exchange, the company
has agreed not to sell or close the plants until at least 2002, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hill, president of UAW Local 696, declined comment. Hill
and other union leaders spent most of Monday informing workers of
the agreement. More meetings are expected today, and members are
expected to vote in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Jim Hagedon also declined to discuss the details.
``We are making progress, but that's all we can confirm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its public silence, GM's support for the deal reaches
its top executives in Detroit. John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and
chief executive, and J.T. Battenberg, president of Delphi
Automotive Systems, are tentatively scheduled to tour the Dayton
plants on Wednesday and meet with local plant and union officials.
</P>
<P>
   International UAW officials in Detroit said they were aware of
the tentative agreement, but also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Local 696 has been on the national stage with GM since 1996 when
it orchestrated a 17-day strike at the brake plants that cost the
automaker nearly $1 billion by shutting down its North American
production. The brake plants figured into a 54-day labor dispute
this past summer at two GM parts plants in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting retirement incentives is not unprecedented for the
UAW, but labor experts say the contract is out of character for a
union that has taken a hard-line stance against any company offer
that could eliminate jobs. Those same experts say the $25,000
retirement offer is one of the largest they can recall being
offered in the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UAW has been reluctant to accept deals like this, but it
would be much better than seeing the plants and all those
high-paying jobs disappear,'' said John Weiler, director of the
University of Dayton Center for Business and Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reflection of the global economy, not just what's
going on in Dayton,'' Weiler said. ``It's tough for a company to
compete when they have high labor costs that pay workers $20 an
hour.

 &HT;    Kroger to acquire Portland corporation
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ After weeks of speculation that Kroger Co. might
be a takeover target, the grocery giant made its own news Monday
with a $12.5 billion acquisition that will take the Cincinnati
chain coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger, with $26.6 billion in annual sales, cemented its place
as the nation's largest supermarket chain by agreeing to acquire
Fred Meyer Inc. of Portland, Ore., for an even stock swap plus
assumption of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Directors of both Kroger and Fred Meyer have approved the deal.
The merger requires Federal Trade Commission approval, not seen as
a big hurdle because the companies mostly serve different markets.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, to be based in Cincinnati, will have 2,200
supermarkets from Alaska to Georgia. Kroger operates 1,400
supermarkets in the Midwest, South and West and is a dominant
grocer in the Dayton and Cincinnati markets.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer, with 1997 sales of $5.5 billion, has more than 800
supermarkets and combination markets in 11 Western states. The
company also operates the Merksamer Jewelers chain, which has a
store in the Dayton Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Pichler, Kroger chairman and chief executive, said the
chains compete directly only in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the acquisition will bring Ralphs Markets, a major Los
Angeles chain, back to Cincinnati control. The Fred Meyer's
subsidiary was a unit of Cincinnati-based Federated Department
Stores until 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst George E. Thompson of Prudential Securities applauded
the Fred Meyer acquisition. Thompson said he recommends aggressive
purchase of Kroger shares. He said the chains are a good match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a good deal for both companies,'' Thompson said,
adding that Fred Meyer will begin to boost Kroger earnings in the
year 2000. The merger will not dilute the value of Kroger shares,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger shares (NYSE: KR) closed Monday at 45 7/16 down 3 5/16 .
Fred Meyer shares (NYSE: FMY) closed at 44 3/16, down 4 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blamed the declines on concern about the debt Fred
Meyer will add to Kroger's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the summer, Kroger shares rose in price during
the stock market sell-off, fed by speculation that California-based
Safeway Inc. was interested in a takeover. However, last week
Safeway agreed to buy Dominick's Supermarket Inc., Northlake, Ill.,
for $1.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer has been growing through acquisitions. Last year it
bought Smith Food &AMP; Drug Centers, Ralphs and Quality Food Centers
for $6.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger hasn't made a major acquisition in several years,
focusing instead on expanding stores.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket consolidation is being propelled by the trend of
Wal-Mart, Kmart and other general merchandise retailers to open
grocery departments.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Kroger reported company-record earnings and sales
for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Net earnings for the quarter ending Oct. 3 were $117.9 million,
or 45 cents per diluted share, up from $95.8 million, or 37 cents a
share, a year ago. Sales increased 4.4 percent to $8.02 billion
from $7.69 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the first nine months of the fiscal year totaled
$259.6 million, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared with $288
million and $1.10 per share a year ago. Sales were $20.9 billion,
up from $20.1 billion last year.

SHARON'S MUSCLE EVOKES HOPES AND SOME FEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The key figure at the Middle East talks on
Maryland's Eastern Shore is probably not the president, or the
prime Minister, or even the chairman, but a veteran of the
Arab-Israeli frays who only recently became Israel's foreign
minister and showed up at the talks two days late.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings toward Ariel Sharon, the veteran soldier and
politician who was named foreign minister and chief negotiator on
the eve of the Wye talks, are distinctly ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment has raised hopes even among the most skeptical
Israeli liberals that he may become the tough pragmatist with
sufficient credibility among settlers and sufficient trust among
Arabs to deliver what the younger and more ideological Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not _ a functioning deal with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The hopes have been tempered by the awareness that Sharon is
also a hard nationalist who was at the forefront of creating West
Bank settlements in the 1970s and 1980s, who voted against his
government's decision to withdraw from most of Hebron, who has
opposed any withdrawal from more than 9 percent of West Bank
territory and who still regards Yasser Arafat as a terrorist whose
hand he will not shake.
</P>
<P>
   What is universally accepted is that Sharon, 70, is the man who
can make or break the Wye talks.
</P>
<P>
   His importance was confirmed as soon as he arrived at the
conference center, which stretches among the branches of the Wye
River. Immediately Netanyahu took him off for a walk in the woods,
presumably to get out of the range of American listening devices.
That same evening, President Clinton spent 75 minutes alone with
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Such clout is a remarkable tribute to a man held responsible for
Israel's unpopular invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and who is still
condemned by some as the defense minister who did nothing to block
a massacre in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps by Phalangist
Lebanese Christians.
</P>
<P>
   It is all the more remarkable because Sharon does not have a
real political constituency in Israel. He barely made it into
Netanyahu's Cabinet, and he has been publicly at odds with the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   What Sharon does carry is the aura of a charter member of the
``generation of giants,'' warrior-politicians like Moshe Dayan and
Yitzhak Rabin who led Israel through its first 50 years in war and
in peace with the same toughness, determination and fearlessness.
</P>
<P>
   In the endless ensuing disputes, Sharon has never concealed his
opinions, whether of Netanyahu or the negotiations set in motion by
the Oslo accords of 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he gained the respect of all sides by backing
his arguments with detailed maps and experience that couched any
concession in terms of Jewish safety, and not simply ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Sharon was late to Wye because of another engagement,
the 25th anniversary of the Israeli crossing of the Suez Canal in
the 1973 war, which he commanded, and because his first call in the
United States was on King Hussein of Jordan, who is s undergoing
treatment for cancer at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota..
</P>
<P>
   The delay was said to have irritated the Americans, given the
amount of time President Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, and Vice President Al Gore were investing in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the show of respect for King Hussein also demonstrated
Sharon's ties with a leader who could be instrumental in nudging
Arafat to an agreement. Possibly as a result, King Hussein arrived
in Washington on Monday to be near the talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eitan Haber, a close friend and the last chief of staff of the
late Prime Minister Rabin, was among the first in the Labor
opposition to hail Sharon's appointment, which he described in an
article in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot as a ``brilliant
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Israelis likened Sharon's appointment to that of Moshe
Dayan when he was brought into Prime Minister Menachem Begin's
government in 1977 and played a major role in achieving the peace
with Egypt. It was Sharon, Israelis noted further, who as defense
minister was responsible for clearing Israeli settlements from the
Sinai peninsula despite violent resistance from settlers.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached on withdrawals from the West Bank,
many Israelis believe that Sharon is the only member of the
government who has a chance of getting it accepted by nationalist
and religious Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Sharon's directness offered relief, there was no
evidence that he would use it to advance the American agenda. The
comparison with Dayan, commentators noted, overlooked the fact that
Dayan was a dovish moderate brought into a rightist government,
while Sharon is a hawk whose positions have usually been to the
right of Netanyahu's.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who saw Sharon's ascendance as a recipe for failure
was the commentator Sever Plotzer in Yediot Ahronot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter what agreements Netanyahu, Arafat and
Clinton hope to achieve at Wye Plantation,'' he wrote. ``From
today, all that matters is what Sharon wants.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``And Sharon, so I assume, wants to return from
America in one of two situations: either empty-handed (`We didn't
capitulate to the Palestinians') or in a fit of rage (`Netanyahu
capitulated to the Palestinians'). In both of these situations, he
will be the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The far-right newspaper Hatzofe summed up the sentiments of
Jewish settlers toward a man who was their hero and their potential
scourge _ ``respect him and suspect him.''

UCLA'S FATE IN THE FORMULA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Bloom is not a coach, he is not a writer, he does not
vote in the polls and he does not tabulate the computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloom has more to do with college football's national
championship than almost anyone else. He's co-creator and
unofficial secretary-general of the Bowl Championship Series
formula _ the formula that will identify the Fiesta Bowl
participants.
</P>
<P>
   While he can't prove it, Bloom believes UCLA salvaged its Fiesta
Bowl opportunity by rescheduling the canceled Miami game for Dec.
5.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would have concerned me about UCLA (not playing Miami) is
what the writers and coaches would have voted,'' said Bloom, who
doubles as an assistant commissioner for the Southeastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's Dec. 5, and UCLA is finished at 10-0 and Tennessee is
11-0 and playing in the SEC championship game that night, and if
they beat somebody, are you going to rank somebody 12-0 below
somebody 10-0?
</P>
<P>
   ``One game is not that big a deal, but 10-0 vs. 12-0? A lot of
people may think `Wow, two more games.'''
</P>
<P>
   The formula, designed by Bloom and SEC commissioner Roy Kramer,
combines top-25 rankings, computer rankings and a
strength-of-schedule quotient, then adds one point for each loss.
</P>
<P>
   The first BCS poll will be released Oct. 26, and the teams with
the fewest points in the final poll (Dec. 6) meet in the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer and Bloom designed the formula to weigh the top-25 and
computer rankings heavily; they went light on the schedule
quotient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strength-of-schedule is there to separate teams with like
records,'' Bloom said. ``It's not as important as the other
(factors).''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the Bruins, who are No.1 in the current
Seattle Times poll, No.2 in everything else. If the season ended
today, they'd play for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 1 or 2 in most every poll, you'll be 1 or 2 in the
BCS poll,'' Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloom can't answer the most important question: If the
Bruins finish 11-0 _ a big if, considering their remaining schedule
_ will they play for the national title? What if there are three
undefeated teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to measure. It depends on what everybody else
does,'' Bloom said. ``Right now, I'd say if UCLA is 11-0 and has
beaten Arizona, Oregon, USC, Cal and Washington, it'd be really
tough to knock them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible. But if Kansas State is undefeated and Tennessee
is undefeated, they've got to have some big wins to move ahead of a
team that's already second.''

ANTITRUST CASE RELIES ON EVENTS AT 1995 MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST)  
(lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's case against Microsoft is a
narrative that revolves around Netscape Communications Corp. and
the government's leading witness, James Barksdale, Netscape's
55-year-old president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In his 127 pages of written testimony, released Monday
afternoon, Barksdale supplied new details and a firsthand
perspective of a disputed meeting between Microsoft and Netscape on
June 21, 1995, at Netscape's offices in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the government contends, Microsoft executives
proposed that the two companies divvy up the emerging market for
software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web. Microsoft
replies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine business
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime executive who has worked for IBM, Federal Express and
AT&AMP;T, Barksdale described the June 1995 meeting as anything but
routine. ``I have never been in a meeting in my 35-year business
career in which a competitor had so blatantly implied that we would
either stop competing with it or the competitor would kill us,''
Barksdale stated. ``In all my years in business, I have never heard
nor experienced such an explicit proposal to divide markets.''
</P>
<P>
   If the court accepts Barksdale's version of the meeting, it will
represent a big victory for the Justice Department and the 20
states suing Microsoft. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could rule
that the meeting itself _ as a conspiracy to try to curb
competition through collusion _ is an antitrust violation.
</P>
<P>
   And the government's broader case begins with that meeting.
After Netscape spurned the offer, the government contends,
Microsoft embarked on a strategy intended to thwart competition in
the Internet software market by crushing Netscape, bundling its
browser into its Windows operating system and making restrictive
deals with personal-computer makers, online services and other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those tactics, the government says, represented an unfair use of
the market power Microsoft has as a result of its monopoly in
operating-system software for personal computers. Microsoft, the
government adds, used that power to protect its monopoly position
and to extend its reach into the fast-growing new markets for
Internet software and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The government focused on the June 1995 meeting in its antitrust
suit, filed in May, and since then additional information about the
meeting has been reported. But in his lengthy statement, Barksdale
provides, for the first time, a precise account of what he says
occurred at the meeting. He quotes what Microsoft executives said
and refers to notes taken by another Netscape executive who
attended the meeting, Marc Andreessen.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies had held talks for months about cooperating.
By the June meeting, Barksdale said, the cooperation Netscape most
sought was technical information from Microsoft that would enable
Netscape's Navigator browser to run smoothly on top of Microsoft's
industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Barksdale said, the Microsoft team, led by Dan
Rosen, proposed that Netscape not market a browser for the Windows
95 operating system, which was shipped two months later. As part of
the proposal, Microsoft would also invest in Netscape and take a
seat on the Netscape board.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale asked if Netscape's ability to obtain technical
information from Microsoft was conditioned on Netscape's accepting
the proposal. Barksdale quotes Rosen as saying, ``It certainly
isn't independent.'' Any technical information Netscape was seeking
could be obtained, Barksdale quotes a Microsoft executive as
saying, ``depending on how we walk out of this room today.''
</P>
<P>
   If Netscape rejected Microsoft's deal, Barksdale testified, the
Microsoft team told Netscape that it could expect the technical
information to be delayed for three months _ meaning that the
latest version of Netscape's browser would not be ready for the
release of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   After declining Microsoft's offer, Netscape did not obtain the
necessary information until three months later, which Barksdale
says was ``precisely what Microsoft had threatened at the June 21
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   These allegations concerning technical information are legally
significant because they portray Microsoft as using the power from
its operating-system dominance to reward allies and to punish
rivals _ something Microsoft has consistently maintained it does
not do.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, whose notes on his laptop computer are a vital piece
of the government's evidence, is said by Barksdale to be an
``extraordinarily fast typist'' _ an aside clearly intended to
deflect questions raised by Microsoft's lawyers about the
credibility of the notes.
</P>
<P>
   In his trial statement, Barksdale quoted these notes at length
including Microsoft's effort to keep Netscape out of the Windows 95
market for the browser _ or ``client'' in computer jargon. Typing
all capital letters for emphasis, Andreessen wrote that Microsoft
wanted to ``OWN THE WIN95 CLIENT MARKET AND THAT NETSCAPE SHOULD
STAY AWAY.''

 &HT;    Hard-hit section of Austin wasn't evacuated
 &HT;    By Tara Trower
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After living along Williamson Creek in South
Austin for more than 20 years, Sandy and Melvin McBee knew to watch
the water rushing behind their house. Still, they thought, city
emergency officials would warn them if the water were about to flow
into their home.
</P>
<P>
   But at about noon Saturday _ an hour and a half after flood
water reached their back yard _ the water was about ankle deep in
their three-bedroom home on Radam Circle. The McBees decided on
their own that it was time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the 1981 Memorial Day flood, the water never reached
the house,'' Sandy McBee said. ``But I always thought if it did,
someone would let us know when to evacuate, but we never heard from
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 homes along Williamson Creek, including some in the
McBees' neighborhood and the Creek Bend neighborhood about four
miles downstream, were among the hardest hit in Austin by the
flood. But while more than 500 residents were warned to evacuate
from other low-lying areas across the city, Williamson Creek
residents were not alerted.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they had some indication from a flood gauge
that there could be trouble along the creek, but resources were
already stretched to the limit answering more than 400 emergency
rescue calls, barricading flooded roads and bridges, and evacuating
areas that historically had flood problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get that much rain in a short period of time, you
have to do some triage and put your resources where there is the
highest probability of damage or injury,'' said Steve Collier, city
emergency management director. ``The information we had didn't show
anything as severe as what occurred on Williamson Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if people are expecting us to knock on every door, we just
don't have those kinds of resources and never will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city depends mainly on alerting local media to flooding
conditions; workers knock on doors only in extremely high-risk
areas, Collier said. Residents also are encouraged to listen to
their own weather radios.
</P>
<P>
   Two problems rescuers encountered were drivers who ignored
barricades and residents who chose not to leave after the Fire
Department recommended evacuation. Fire officials were called back
to rescue a number of residents from the Crystalbrook area in
Northeast Austinafter asking them to evacuate. State law prohibits
the city from forcing people to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the city received sharp criticism from a
council-appointed task force, which said the emergency response
system was unprepared to deal with major flooding. Despite heavy
damamge to homes and property, city officials say the absence of
fatalities within the city shows that the system does work.
Thirteen people died in the Memorial Day flood of 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have lots and lots of rain, there is no way to keep
it from flooding,'' Mayor Kirk Watson said. ``We are going to have
to help our neighbors rebuild, but at least we didn't have the loss
of life we've had in previous floods.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somehow it is not a surprise that Harvey Keitel is a
former Marine. Or that he longs to go to war with the Marines every
time there is action. Or that every Marine he meets is an instant
brother. ``There's been this journey, this rite of passage, of
feeling like a man,'' Keitel said last week. Ask anybody who knows
him: Harvey just loves the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   So on Nov. 10, this tough-guy actor who projects such
complicated rage on screen will head for the Hudson River and
preside over what is billed as the first U.S. Marine Corps Birthday
Ball aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid. There will be Marine
celebrations all over the world on the same day, just as there are
every year when the Marines lay down their arms, put on their dress
uniforms and commemorate the birth of the corps on Nov. 10, 1775.
(The Continental Congress commissioned a Marine battalion to fight
the British from warships; the first battle was in the Bahamas,
where the Marines went ashore and raided a British fort.)
</P>
<P>
   There has been, of course, a lot of war and history since then,
but the Marines have always inspired a cultlike devotion among
their members. They remain the smallest in number of the four
branches of the Armed Forces _ 174,000 men and women, or about 12
percent of the military _ but according to them, they're the
toughest. In recent years, the Marines were the first conventional
forces in Kuwait and Somalia. They have not been plagued by the sex
scandals of the Navy and the Air Force, and military analysts say
their training has adapted them well to the flare-ups of the
post-cold war world.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Intrepid ball has been organized by Keitel and
Gerry Byrne, the publisher of Variety and another avid former
Marine. ``We're all kind of crazy,'' Byrne said. Together, he and
Keitel have created a celebrity Marine ball. Among the former
Marines on the dinner committee: actor Gene Hackman, writer William
Styron, talk-show host Montel Williams, columnist Art Buchwald,
restaurateur Vincent Sardi and Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel's pals, actor Robert De Niro and director Martin
Scorsese, who only seem like former Marines, are expected, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an experience becoming Marines that was important to
all of us in a deeply spiritual way,'' said Keitel, who talked for
a few hours in his TriBeCa office, a big open space of black
leather furniture and exposed brick across the street from the
TriBeCa Grill. Keitel, 59, who made his reputation with De Niro in
Scorsese's ``Mean Streets'' in 1973, was unshaven, intense and
friendlier than the nasties he plays on screen. Although his career
never soared as De Niro's and Scorsese's did after ``Mean
Streets,'' he starred in the Jane Campion film ``The Piano,'' was
nominated for an Academy Award for his performance as the mobster
Mickey Cohen in ``Bugsy,'' and has carved out a niche as one of the
more watchable tough guys on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel said he couldn't explain how he did it. ``Most certainly
you're living through real emotion,'' he said. ``You don't fake
anything.'' And yet, ``having anger in one's life is not the answer
to becoming an actor. It's a much more complicated thing. There's a
mystery that happens. There's an unknown in answering your
question. That unknown is part of the answer. And I mean it. All
this mumbo jumbo is your answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Keitel grew up in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, across
the street from his parents' luncheonette, spent his days on the
Coney Island boardwalk, and was a bad student at Lincoln High
School. He transferred to Alexander Hamilton, a vocational school,
although he was unclear about what his vocation was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Maybe it was shop metal? I remember
I made a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out at 17, joined the Marines, and was stunned by the
famously brutal basic training, especially a night combat class in
which he learned to function in the dark. ``It's like an actor
creating a role,'' he said. ``You live in the circumstances of the
character.''
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1958, Keitel was sent to Beirut, where
Communists were threatening the pro-West government, then
volunteered to stay on through September. ``I was on an incredible
adventure there,'' Keitel said. ``I was excited about being a
Marine in Beirut, about protecting people, about doing what's good.
I was feeling somewhat heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   Keitel got his high school equivalency diploma in the Marines,
was discharged in July 1959, then returned to Brooklyn. He couldn't
get into college because he didn't have the grades or the money,
and so spent nearly a decade as a court stenographer while going to
auditions and acting school at night. In 1968, a young filmmaker at
New York University, Scorsese, hired Keitel to appear in a student
film he was making on weekends. Five years later came ``Mean
Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Keitel has one child, Stella, 12, from his former relationship
with actress Lorraine Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel will wear a tuxedo to the ball, not his old uniform.
``No. 1, I'm a former Marine,'' he said. ``No. 2, I couldn't fit
into my uniform.'' And he will go first as Harvey Keitel, actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long journey to go as Harvey Keitel,'' he said.
``Don't take it from me now.''

 &HT;    Flood dumps millions of gallons of sewage into waters
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ As commander of special operations for Austin's
Emergency Medical Services, Casey Ping knows that many of the
city's medical and fire crews have been vaccinated against
Hepatitis A, a liver disorder transmitted by raw sewage. But he
also knows there are no vaccines for other viruses, bacteria,
pesticides, fertilizers, oils, greases and pollutants found in
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Caldwell worries about water systems in Central and South
Texas that were ``compromised.'' That's jargon for loss of
pressure, loss of power or inundation by floodwaters. People served
by compromised systems should boil tap water before drinking it
until tests confirm that the water is safe, said Caldwell, a
manager with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Goss, director of Austin's water and wastewater utility,
has had to deal with water and wastewater problems. During the
weekend, the city's Walnut Creek sewage treatment plant released 60
million gallons of untreated wastewater, and the South Austin plant
released 6 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
   And David Bary of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is
concerned about ordinary products found in garages, kitchens and
bathrooms: paint, solvents, cleaning agents, bleach and weed
killers. Such items, if damaged or soiled in flooding, are
hazardous wastes and should not be tossed out with ordinary trash,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, rising water isn't the only hazard in a flood, as
recent days in Central and South Texas illustrate. Besides washing
contaminants from thousands of homes, businesses, lawns and streets
in the region, the floodwaters caused three oil spills and
overwhelmed sewage-treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skin is generally an effective barrier,'' said Dan Pickens, a
spokesman for the Austin-Travis County Health and Human Services
Department. ``But people need to be aware that floodwaters contain
chemicals, bacteria, viral agents and other substances that can
make them very ill. And they need to be aware of the onset of any
symptoms and seek medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators said wells submerged by floodwaters should be
disinfected. They had no precise figures for the region but
estimated that thousands of people were under boil notices.
</P>
<P>
   A boil advisory for part of Austin's Northwest Hills was
canceled at noon Monday after tests showed the water was safe. The
advisory was issued on Saturday after a section of a water main was
washed out at the intersection of Far West Boulevard and Ladera
Norte.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, which is wholly dependent on the Edwards Aquifer
for water, has not detected contamination in any of its 76 wells
despite widespread flooding, said John Boggess, a spokesman for the
San Antonio Water System. The wells are sealed to protect against
infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's Walnut Creek wastewater treatment plant received four
times its normal flow during the weekend as a result of leaks
entering sewer pipes from small cracks and large manhole openings
ripped by floodwaters. About 150 million gallons received
treatment, but 50 million gallons entered the creek on Saturday and
10 million gallons on Sunday without treatment, Goss said. The
creek flows a short distance from that point to the Colorado River.
The untreated releases were caused partly by the huge flow and
partly by debris clogging intake screens.
</P>
<P>
   The city's South Austin plant released about 6 million gallons
of untreated wastewater on Saturday, said Chris Lippe, assistant
director of treatment for the city. The EPA said it does not pursue
enforcement action against cities for flood-caused violations of
the federal Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   Such releases, while containing greater concentrations of
pollutants than treated wastewater, are nonetheless highly diluted.
Goss said the impact on the swollen river is no greater than that
of treated wastewater on the river during normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The oil spills occurred in widely scattered areas but posed no
significant threat to the environment or public health, state and
federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,400 barrels of crude oil spilled when a line to a
storage tank ruptured at a Koch Industries gathering station near
Falls City in Karnes County, southeast of San Antonio. Most of the
oil was contained by a berm around the tank, but a small amount
entered a creek, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-inch-diameter pipeline operated by Duke Energy was
broken by floodwaters 11 miles west of Sealy in Austin County, west
of Houston, releasing about 100 barrels of oil, EPA and state
Railroad Commission officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Public Safety officials conducting an aerial
survey discovered an oil spill just northwest of Luling in Caldwell
County. Fewer than 210 barrels spilled when floodwaters tipped over
a storage tank, said Julie Hillrichs, a spokeswoman for the
Railroad Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As for hazardous waste from homes and businesses, Bary of the
EPA said the agency probably would help organize collections in
flood-damaged areas.

 &HT;    Some San Marcos residents spend Monday in shelters
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ A little antsy and very frustrated, Rebeca
Zaragoza sat on the edge of a aluminum frame cotat the San Marcos
ActivityCenter, craddling her son and marking time with heavy
sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Zaragoza, her husband and three children were chased from their
trailer home Saturday afternoon by the waters of the fast-rising
river that lapped at their doorstep. They haven't wanted to return
since then.
</P>
<P>
   She and her family have gone by the trailer parked on a hilltop
trailer park and it didn't sustain much damage. But the family's
fear that the rains could bring more flooding and the river could
turn on them at any time have kept the family huddling in the
center-turned-storm shelter, waiting for skies to clear and water
to recede.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to wait it out here,'' Zaragoza, 22, said in
Spanish as she held close the youngest of her three sons, Miguel.
He had his second birthday on Sunday _ in the shelter and without
presents.
</P>
<P>
   Zaragoza's fear was not unfounded. About 40 people remained in
the shelter Monday as rain continued. The Blanco and San Marcos
rivers spilled from their banks, rising to between 20 and 28 feet,
several feet above normal levels Saturday. About 400 homes were
damaged by the waters and Monday night, 59 San Marcos homes were
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   At Strahan Coliseum on the Southwest Texas State campus,
whirring water pumps worked in the dimness of generator lights to
remove the nearly 2 feet of muck that covered the normally shiny
parquet floor. The $250,000 arena floor was built four years ago
after a water main break. Monday, the planks were severely bowed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kristie Lacaze, 29, like other residents who live
along the east side of the San Marcos River, spent the day cleaning
what was left of her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost pretty much everything,'' she said.
</P>

MARTINEZ: POWER, PRIDE AND A KEEPER AT FIRST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tino Martinez had heard the speculation about his future with
the Yankees, how it was in peril if he continued to have a dismal
post-season. He heard the speculation about how the team's
principal owner, George Steinbrenner, would trade him if the
Yankees did not win the World Series, and then sign Mo Vaughn as
Martinez's replacement. He heard the same old story and he cringed.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded as if it were rotisserie baseball. Why would the
Yankees unload Martinez, a solid run producer and a solid citizen
who is scheduled to make a relatively modest $5 million in each of
the next two seasons? Vaughn, a similar power hitter, wants at
least $10 million a season as a free agent. This switch at first
base would not make sense for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Yankees insist they have not started the
whispers, everything on the Yankees emanates from Steinbrenner, and
Martinez apparently believes that the team has discussed it.
Martinez did not try to decipher the logic. He tried to ignore the
words, but he could not. Not even after a game-winning grand slam
in Game 1 and three hits in Game 2 against San Diego lifted him
from a prolonged post-season drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to really pay attention to it, but it bothered me
because it came out now during the World Series,'' he said.
``Something like that shouldn't come out until the off season,
regardless of what's happening. I have to admit it; it bothered
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Martinez emerged from a 5-for-30 slide, any
conversations about his future should revolve around when the
Yankees will offer the 30-year-old first baseman a contract
extension. Martinez has hit .290 with 32 homers and 127 RBIs over
the last three years, very comparable to Vaughn's .326, 39 and 117,
and the Yankees have reached the post-season each year. In
addition, Martinez, who is no Gold Glove Award candidate, is also a
better fielder than Vaughn, who might be a designated hitter by
2000. To the Yankees, Martinez should be a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought Tino Martinez in, that was one of the turning
points in the organization,'' his teammate David Cone said. ``He
had big shoes to fill in Don Mattingly.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees are serious about trying to resign Bernie
Williams, they might consider spending the $10 million or $11
million on him and not on Vaughn. Losing Williams to free agency,
then signing Vaughn to make a splash and trading Martinez for a
center fielder would weaken two positions on a team that might be
recalled as one of the finest ever. Why tamper with greatness? And
why tweak the ultra-sensitive Martinez?
</P>
<P>
   ``It got in my head and it bothered me,'' Martinez said about
the Vaughn rumors. ``I just got to go out there, play the World
Series and, if it's my last series as a Yankee, enjoy it and try to
win. Then go on with my career.''
</P>
<P>
   For the cautious Martinez, mentioning the possibility of a new
baseball address was a stunning statement. As Steinbrenner walked
through the clubhouse on Sunday, he was asked if he has considered
the possibility of trading Martinez and signing Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about that,'' Steinbrenner said.
``It's crazy. That's you guys stirring it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, before he slipped into Manager Joe Torre's office,
Steinbrenner added, ``But if that's gotten him going, OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner is partly right. If Martinez needed to have his
future questioned to erupt, maybe the escalation of the rumors
about Vaughn was timely. But Martinez is too sturdy a hitter to
remain 0 for October, even if he was 21 for his first 118 at bats
with a homer and 5 RBIs as a Yankee during the post-season. Now,
Martinez has four hits in his last eight at-bats, but there is
bitterness in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need somebody trying to light a fire under me,''
Martinez said. ``I play hard every day and try to do my best
whether I'm playing well or struggling, so it's not going to pump
me up. I'm just going to play the way I like to play.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Martinez is very proud and very loyal. So proud that he once
told a reporter that he wanted the Yankees to view him as a $5
million bargain because that would mean he was doing his job. So
loyal that he stayed home in Florida to play baseball at the
University of Tampa, a Division II school, to be on the same team
with his brother, Rene.
</P>
<P>
   His pride in his ability was evident and his loyalty to the
Yankees was erratic as Martinez spoke passionately on Sunday. The
rumors about Vaughn, which are fueled by Vaughn's desire to play in
New York and his agent's close relationship with Steinbrenner, have
stung Martinez, and that is unfortunate. Maybe a World Series title
would help the hurt vanish. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here, but I don't want to be anywhere I'm not
wanted,'' Martinez said. ``If they don't want me here and they feel
they have somebody who can make the team better, then I'm all for
it. I love it here, but I don't want to be somewhere wishing I
wasn't here.''

INCUMBENTS LET NOTHING GO TO CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try to get a Washington politician to shell out a few pennies
for school books, medicine or old people, and they'll tie you to a
stake, sew a big ``L'' on your chest and light torches for the
lunatic mob chanting, ``Death to the tax-and-spend liberal!''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting the government spend a little money on people is
sacrilege even during the best of times.
</P>
<P>
   Before an election, it's a capital offense.
</P>
<P>
   These days, every politician in the land is out preaching
frugality, moderation, thrift.
</P>
<P>
   Cheapness.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they admit, the country faces challenges. But (and they
say this over and over) there is no worse sin than `'throwing money
at a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, throwing money at something that's NOT a
problem _ a feeble political opponent, for instance _ is perfectly
OK.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, one U.S. senator and all six congressmen are up for
election next month. In all but two of those ``races,'' the
incumbent is running against a no-name opponent with no money and
no chance.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped our boys in D.C. from spending fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   In District 1, Republican Rep. Matt Salmon, a staunch fiscal
conservative (most times) in a heavily Republican district, already
has blown close to a quarter of a million dollars to defeat an
opponent who's scraped together a few grand.
</P>
<P>
   In District 2, Democrat Rep. Ed Pastor is outspending his
opponent 20-to-1, knowing full well he has a voter registration
advantage that makes him unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same for Republican Rep. Bob Stump in District 3 and
Republican John Shadegg in District 4.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest federal campaign reports, Shadegg has
spent almost $250,000 to defeat a challenger with less than $20,000
in the bank and not enough Democratic voters to fill a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   For each of these guys, this isn't an election, it's a pest
control problem. Campaign strategy involves dumping a planeload of
Agent Orange on a flea. (Or is it Agent Green?)
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe faces an actual challenger in Tom
Volgy in District 5, but he'll crush the Democrat by spending at
least five times as much.
</P>
<P>
   In District 6, Democratic challenger Steve Owens has raised
almost $600,000 to unseat Republican J.D. Hayworth.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth already has spent about a million to keep his
$133,000-a-year job, and he has another half-million in the bank.
He'll probably win.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide in the last election, candidates who spent the most
money won 92 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a complicated business. Elections aren't won. They're
bought.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would a powerhouse U.S. senator like John McCain have
spent $1.3 million already to defeat a political unknown with a
fraction of the resources to waste on a campaign and not a
snowball's chance of winning?
</P>
<P>
   One big reason, of course, is that McCain is running for both
senator and president, though only one appears on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I checked with the offices of the incumbents to ask
why they're wasting all that money.
</P>
<P>
   I only got one response.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign official for Pastor told me, ``We run every campaign
the same. We tour the state and put on events and print signs and
so on, no matter who we're running against.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest didn't call back. They didn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   They fritter away all that dough because they can.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's not their money.
</P>
<P>
   They'll do anything, say anything, spend anything to get back to
Washington, D.C., where, from the comfort of their plush Capitol
Hill offices, they brush off those begging pennies for school
books, medicine or old people. &QL;

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-UNREST (Turen) _ A ferocious hysteria is sweeping some
remote parts of Indonesia. Communities are so terrified of black
magic that vigilante groups are forming daily to seize, torture and
execute anyone suspected of being a sorcerer. The victims have
little in common beyond the fact that in some way they do not fit
into their communities. At least 150 people, and perhaps many more,
have died so far in the frenzy, and law and order have broken down
almost completely in some areas. The convulsions have disrupted
commerce, paralyzed travel in places, and underscored the risks of
social upheaval as Indonesia grapples with economic depression and
a transition away from political dictatorship. By Nicholas D.
Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-MILITARY (Islamabad) _ The elected government has
recently been able to exercise its authority over the military
without dire consequences _ at least not yet. And that is a marker
of sorts in a country whose modern history has been dominated by
the struggle between military and civilian leaders. By Celia
Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-POLITIS (Frankfurt) _ Throughout the campaign, Gerhard
Schroeder portrayed himself as a pragmatist, but his incoming
government is looking more left-wing than expected. The latest
evidence that has alarmed industrialists is the refusal of the
designated economics minister, Jost Stollmann, to accept the post.
They were upset earlier by the choice of Oskar Lafontaine as
finance minister. He represents the left-leaning faction of the
Social Democrats. By Edmund L. Andrews.

<P>
   WASH-AFFIRM (Seattle) _ Two years after California voters
abolished most affirmative action programs and a year after
Houston's residents chose to retain them, voters here in Washington
are facing the only ballot initiative in the country this year
dealing with the issue. The one big thing that both camps agree on
is that the outcome is hugely important to their cause. With their
only electoral victory so far in California, proponents of
eliminating most affirmative action programs hope to carry momentum
from a victory here to other states. But opponents say that if they
can stop the measure in a state like Washington, where affirmative
action is not in general a hugely divisive issue, in large part
because the minority population is relatively small, their victory
may further dampen efforts in other states to bring the matter
before voters. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SHUTTLE-SAFETY (Undated) _ Behind the excitement of the
coming spaceflight of Sen. John Glenn is quiet apprehension about
hidden dangers. Safety experts agree that the space shuttles, like
temperamental hot rods, must run regularly or become balky and
their launching crews rusty. But the shuttles have flown little of
late. So Glenn's flight is seen, at least in theory, as unusually
risky. By William J. Broad.

<P>
   LONDON-EURO (London) _ While London's financial community is
trying to work out how to fuse with and profit from the euro, the
government of Tony Blair has ruled out British entry into the
currency bloc for at least three years. So London will strive to
continue as Europe's leading financial center, even though it will
have to remain outside ``euroland.'' By Alan Cowell.

Rockefeller assembled, opens Saturday as a new wing of the San
Antonio Museum. The center will contain not only one of the world's
largest Latin American folk art collections, but also extensive
galleries devoted to pre-Columbian art, Spanish colonial pieces and
contemporary works by Latin artists. In all, it will present Latin
American art spanning nearly three millenniums, from 1,000 B.C. to

   CHALFANT-WIT (New York) _ Somewhere between the production of
``Wit'' in Connecticut last November and the production of ``Wit''
that reopened here this month, Kathleen Chalfant says, her
performance got better. She explains that it is because her older
brother _ a mentor and close friend _ died of cancer. In ``Wit,''
Ms. Chalfant, 53, plays a woman who herself is dying of ovarian

light returned to the firmament with the emergence of the first

imagine that one day their children will find them, even though in

MORTGAGE MEASURE, PUSHED BY D'AMATO FOR A DONOR, MAY BE KILLED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.C., Mo.)   (jw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When officials with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., better known as Freddie Mac, were looking for someone in
Congress to push one of their most important bills this year, they
looked no further than an old ally and recipient of their campaign
largess: Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   And D'Amato, a New York Republican, delivered. Always skillful
at the closed-door machinations of budget making, the senator got
the Freddie Mac measure quietly tucked into a $93 billion
appropriations bill just as it was coming to the floor two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have allowed Freddie Mac to insure high-risk
mortgages in new and different ways, not just with mortgage
insurance bought from private companies. Freddie Mac officials and
D'Amato said campaign contributions had nothing to do with the
move, and contended that it would save consumers money by reducing
insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But eight companies that control the mortgage insurance business
strenuously objected to the bill the moment they discovered it.
They said it would devastate their industry _ several companies'
stocks dropped on news of the bill _ and create risky new insurance
schemes likely to benefit only Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that the insurance companies, with support from
Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who has several mortgage insurance
companies in his state, have prevailed. In one of its last acts
before recessing this week, Congress is expected to kill the
Freddie Mac measure, congressional officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the episode once again demonstrates D'Amato's ability to
help specific constituents, interest groups and companies.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the beneficiary, Freddie Mac, has had a
longstanding relationship with D'Amato, who is chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee. One of the corporation's lobbyists,
Robert Stewart Royer, is a friend and occasional poker-playing
partner of D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation has also emerged as one of the largest
contributors of soft, or unregulated, campaign contributions to
both major parties in recent years. Between 1995 and 1996, it gave
at least $35,000 to the New York State Republican Committee, which
D'Amato dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, it has given $500,000 to the Republican National
Committee and $125,000 to the Democratic National Committee, said
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks
campaign contributions. Half of Freddie Mac's Republican
contributions were directed to the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, which is helping D'Amato's re-election campaign against
Rep. Charles Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato and Freddie Mac officials said that neither the
contributions nor the senator's relationship with Royer played a
role in D'Amato's decision to push the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise the mortgage insurance companies are upset
with Sen. D'Amato,'' said Lisette McSoud Mondello, a spokeswoman
for D'Amato. ``He's been fighting them on behalf of consumers and
homeowners for two years. This law increases competition and gives
home buyers more choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon McHale, a spokeswoman for Freddie Mac, said the measure
would cut mortgage insurance premiums for the average home buyer by
$324 a year. Since people who buy mortgage insurance tend to be
young or less affluent, a saving of that size can be significant,
she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lenders generally require home buyers who cannot afford a 20
percent down payment to buy mortgage insurance, which covers part
of a lender's losses if a buyer defaults.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac is a private corporation created by Congress in 1970
with the mandate of making mortgages available to less affluent
people. It buys mortgages from lenders and resells them as
securities. That permits the lenders to get rid of higher risk
mortgages, make new loans and thereby expand the market.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say Freddie Mac's federal charter requires it to have
private insurance for mortgages with down payments of less than 20
percent. D'Amato's measure would have freed Freddie Mac from that,
allowing it to self-insure or use other, less costly forms of
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Schweppe, communications director for the Mortgage
Insurance Companies of America, said the measure would let Freddie
Mac create risky new forms of insurance while draining business
from the private market. ``This is an unprecedented expansion for a
government-sponsored corporation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McHale, the Freddie Mac spokeswoman, said the Office of
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Freddie Mac,
had endorsed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, D'Amato succeeded in getting Sen. Christopher
Bond, R-Mo., to tuck the Freddie Mac measure into the Veterans
Affairs, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill after
public debate had ended, congressional officials said.

 &HT;    Candidates switch roles in most recent face-offs
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It may be overshadowed by all the 30-second spots and
drive-time pitches, but the old-fashioned style of retail,
look-'em-in-the-teeth democracy is still available. As the
governor's race draws down to its closing days, this more intimate
brand of campaigning presents a stark contrast to the candidates'
commercial appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Barnes and Guy Millner have faced off in three very
different settings in as many days: in a debate sponsored by the
Fannin County Chamber of Commerce in Blue Ridge Saturday night; in
a forum at The Temple Sunday night; and at the Georgia Technology
Forum '98 Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In the television ads, it has been Millner who has more often
been on the offensive, attacking Barnes as soft on crime and
corrupt in his business practices. Barnes has been more laid-back:
in a recent commercial, he lets the family dog do the barking for
him as he patiently fends off the Republican's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But in each of these three encounters the roles were reversed.
It was Barnes on the attack, pouncing on any misstatements by
Millner and trying to draw him into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, although he missed few chances to call Barnes a trial
lawyer, was more conciliatory on each occasion, citing aspects of
the Democrat's platform that he likes and even applauding Barnes'
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest moment may have been in Blue Ridge Saturday night,
when Millner jumped to his feet to accuse Barnes of misquoting him
on the patient's rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quote me correctly,'' Barnes fired back. ``You've spent $5
million running me down. Why do you want to interrupt me now?''
</P>
<P>
   The three audiences were very different, but what they heard
from the candidates boils down to the same essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Millner talks about bringing a ``sense of passion'' to the job.
He'd be the globe-trotting marketeer, selling the state around the
globe, and the hard-headed businessman, forcing Atlanta and its
neighbors to work out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent has a lot of ``legislative experience,'' Millner
said at each forum, but what the state needs is ``leadership
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner frequently personalizes his goals, talking for instance
of how being in a small class helped him overcome a speech problem,
but he doesn't sketch his program out with many details. Asked
Saturday night who he was considering for chief of staff _ a key
position for a governor with no government experience _ Millner
said it would be presumptuous for him to say until he's elected.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes on the other hand is long on details while sometimes
almost stubbornly reluctant to stake out a new vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just coming up with a big new program. It's working
with what we have and expanding what we have,'' Barnes said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia were a business, he told the high-tech executives,
they'd be offering the people who are running it now big stock
options to stay. At each of the forums, he invoked the names of
Zell Miller, Joe Frank Harris and George Busbee, a line of
mind-the-store Democrats to whom he claims to be heir.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to this election probably were best summed up by Bob
Cross, one of the business leaders on a panel that preceded the
candidates Monday. Georgia, he said, is currently ``the best place
on the planet to grow a technology firm,'' but if there is one flaw
holding it back it's the ``sorry state'' of primary and secondary
public education.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make Barnes, running on that legacy of economic good
health, the better choice, or Millner, who promises another great
leap forward in education? Along with taxes _ which we'll be
getting to _ those are the big questions in this campaign.

EDITORIAL: TENSE TIMES AT THE MIDEAST SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East peace talks in Maryland are in overtime, and may
yet fail. But they were saved from extinction Monday by some
intense American diplomacy and the decision of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, not to let a new terrorist attack in Israel abort the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The grenade assault in Beersheba on Monday intensified Israel's
security concerns. The Maryland summit will not succeed unless the
Palestinians demonstrate that they are fully committed to
preventing terror attacks and cooperating with Israel to bring
suspects to justice.
</P>
<P>
   But those are not the only issues that must be resolved. The
Palestinians have grievances over Israel's failure to live up to
past commitments, including the opening of ports and industrial
facilities essential to Palestinian economic health. Israel has
also backed off the promise of one additional West Bank withdrawal
beyond the 13 percent now being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   These talks must resolve these leftover issues and lead to
immediate negotiations on claims on Jerusalem, the future of West
Bank Jewish settlements and the nature of a possible Palestinian
state. Otherwise, the Oslo agreements are likely to expire
unfulfilled next May, with potentially devastating consequences for
the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Failure in Maryland could also weaken Washington's ability to
play a constructive role in Mideast diplomacy. The Clinton
administration has invested time and prestige in these
negotiations. If the personal efforts of President Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright cannot
nudge Netanyahu and Arafat to an agreement, it is hard to imagine
what will.
</P>
<P>
   No fair-minded person expects Israel to compromise its security
or Arafat to accept humiliating conditions in exchange for Israel
keeping promises it agreed to long ago. But an anxious world
demands that both leaders keep at these negotiations and make the
reasonable compromises necessary to save a dangerously troubled
peace.

IRISH EYES SMILED, AND OTHERS, TOO 
A 34-YEAR WAIT TO GET TO THE MET 
DOWN IN FRONT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So Gerry Adams didn't win the Nobel Peace Prize last
week. But he did get Carly Simon to sing ``Happy Birthday'' to him
at a party on Saturday night at, of all places, Webster Hall, a
Greenwich Village nightclub that normally pulses to a hip-hop beat.
</P>
<P>
   This time the club was filled with lilting melodies, and Ms.
Simon and several New York-based Irish bands were on hand to wish a
happy 50th to Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Adams told the crowd that he still envisioned a united Ireland.
But mostly he nibbled the birthday cake and listened to the music.
To wall out the cares of the world for one night, a phalanx of
broad-backed, stump-necked bodyguards surrounded him the whole
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was clear that nobody was to disturb Gerry,'' said
Gregory Grene, the accordionist for the Prodigals, one of the bands
that serenaded Adams. ``It was good just to see him relax, smiling
and chatting with some of the mates around him.''
</P>
<P>
   A 34-Year Wait To Get to the Met
</P>
<P>
   Historian John Hope Franklin, a professor emeritus at Duke
University and chairman of the advisory board for President
Clinton's Initiative on Race, has finally seen the Metropolitan
Opera House at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, who lived in New York from 1956 to 1964, had attended
Met performances at the company's old house, on Broadway at 39th
Street. But he moved away before the company moved uptown in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to go to ``Carmen'' last season, but he was a
last-minute no-show. ``I had to go off with the president,''
Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Joseph Volpe saw a public-television documentary that
mentioned Franklin. ``It said he always enjoyed opera,'' Volpe
recalled, ``and in Tulsa, when he was young, he went to the opera
and had to sit in the colored section, as they called it in those
days. His parents would not go because they would not go anywhere
that wasn't integrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe invited Franklin, who asked if he could bring along
Eleanor Farrar, a former senior vice president of the Joint Center
for Political and Economic Studies. (She had invited him to
``Carmen'' last year.) Together on Friday evening they watched
Denyce Graves and Placido Domingo in ``Samson et Dalila'' from
Volpe's box. Then they went backstage and met the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What caught John Hope's attention was the fact that Volpe
started out in the opera as an apprentice carpenter,'' Ms. Farrar
said. ``John Hope said he couldn't believe that somebody would make
it that far up in the Metropolitan, something that after all is
such an exclusive club. I said to him, it's the same as with other
things in this country: only in America would you think this is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Front
</P>
<P>
   ``Move, you're in the way,'' the voice from somewhere up in the
balcony at Carnegie Hall commanded conductor Skitch Henderson, who
was standing where conductors usually stand, on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the person who cried out did not have a clear view
of actress Christine Baranski, who had been the soprano soloist
with Henderson's New York Pops on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baranski was between numbers and was telling the audience
about the $6,000 dress she was wearing. She said that she had had
it made the last time she was invited to sing at Carnegie Hall, an
appearance she never made. She said that her schedule had not
allowed her to leave Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And what about taking orders from the balcony?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's ever told me to move like that,'' said Henderson, who
was the music director of the ``Tonight'' show under Steve Allen
and part of Johnny Carson's long run behind the desk. ``I played in
saloons where they talked worse.''

OREGON AIDES WERE PURSUED BY HACKETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If imitation is a form of flattery, USC has paid
more compliments to Oregon than any other team in the Pacific-10
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ducks coach Mike Bellotti, USC coach Paul Hackett
offered jobs to Oregon defensive coordinator Bob Foster,
offensive-line coach Neal Zoumboukos and wide-receivers coach Chris
Petersen last winter.
</P>
<P>
   All three coaches remained at Oregon, but Bellotti recommended
that Hackett hire Steve Greatwood, a former Ducks assistant, who
coached at Maryland last year. Hackett took his advice and made
Greatwood his offensive-line coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a positive statement for Oregon football,''
Bellotti said. ``It says a lot about our reputation. I'm pleased
guys like Neal and Chris chose to stay in Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a former head coach at UC Davis, elected to take the
Oregon job over a similar offer from USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is one of those best-kept secrets,'' Bellotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti and Hackett have a long history. Bellotti was a wide
receiver on UC Davis' freshman team in 1970, when Hackett was the
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   So did he have any hard feelings about Hackett trying to raid
his coaching staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, Paul, we're friends, but that only goes so
far,''' Bellotti joked. ``I've always considered him a friend and a
football resource.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversifying the offense: One of the most pleased players with
USC's 42-point performance against Washington State was R. Jay
Soward. Although he didn't catch any long touchdown passes, Soward
did score twice _ on a 13-yard pass and a 26-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Soward was pleased that the Trojans demonstrated they were
capable of scoring on plays other than long passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we showed people we can play ball, too. We're not just
quick hitters,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   TV talk: Anyone wondering why Pacific-10 Conference schools like
USC agree to schedule so many night games need only consider the
financial benefits. Schools receive $240,000 for a Fox Sports
national broadcast. Schools receive $285,000 for an ABC regional
broadcast and $485,000 for an ABC game televised to more than half
of the country.

   Washington game time: USC's game against Washington at the
Coliseum on Oct. 31 will begin at 12:30 p.m. It will be televised
on Channel 7.

EDITORIAL: A GRASS-ROOTS MESSAGE ON REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ariz.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since campaign finance reform was killed in
Washington, it has been fashionable to say that the issue never had
much popular support. But that cynical view is belied by the
momentum behind two important initiatives this fall, in
Massachusetts and Arizona, where voters are being asked to create
publicly financed campaign systems that would free politicians of
their dependence on money from special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of these measures would provide a model for how to
clean up local political races and send a strong signal to
Washington to enact reform legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   Both initiatives call for extensive public money to pay for
political campaigns, to be awarded after the candidates have raised
modest sums on their own. Many state and local governments,
including New York City, have provisions for public financing. The
post-Watergate laws governing national elections also provide for
public subsidies. But in these cases, the money kicks in only when
the candidates themselves have raised large sums.
</P>
<P>
   As the last round of scandals shows, candidates have also
circumvented the law by accepting public money and then using
unregulated ``soft money'' contributions for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it will cost them money, the voters in both states
are responding positively. In Massachusetts, the money would come
in part from taxpayers checking off a box on their income-tax
returns, and in part from legislative appropriations. In Arizona,
the money would be raised by increasing the fee for lobbyists, a
voluntary tax checkoff and a surcharge on criminal and civil fines.
</P>
<P>
   Another encouraging sign is that these reforms are occurring in
one of the most conservative states in the country as well as in
one of the most liberal. It is perhaps no accident that the main
sponsors of campaign reform in Washington include Sen. John McCain
of Arizona and Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts. Nor is it
surprising that two of the seven Senate Republicans who challenged
their leadership on the issue this year came from Maine, where
similar public financing legislation was enacted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Success in Arizona, Massachusetts and other states with more
limited campaign reform measures on their ballots could build
momentum for change in Washington next year. Many incumbent
lawmakers have long argued that the public will not tolerate public
financing, by which they usually mean that they do not want to give
their challengers an equal chance. They need only be reminded that
voters can speak even more loudly than campaign donations.

ISLANDER FANS GET SHORT END OF CABLEVISION'S STICK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Islanders play Edmonton Wednesday night, it
should be televised on Cablevision-controlled Fox Sports New York.
But you never know. Cablevision has refused to show three of four
Islanders game this season on FSNY because ... well, we actually
don't know why. Executives of Cablevision and its subsidiary,
Madison Square Garden, have balked at answering any questions.
</P>
<P>
   What we know is that Cablevision-run FSNY refuses to carry
Islanders games when they conflict with Devils games. Thus, viewers
have seen only the Islanders-Boston telecast, not the Pittsburgh,
Tampa Bay and St. Louis games.
</P>
<P>
   With no conflict, Wednesday's game will be on, but
Cablevision-ruled FSNY could pull it for any reason, like maybe the
team owners' refusing to sell big-screen televisions at a
Cablevision-owned Nobody Beats the Wiz store.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when the Islanders play the Rangers, it will be
carried on MSG Network. Don't expect FSNY to carry it, even if
Howie Rose needs to work a game or two with his new announcing
partner, Joe Micheletti.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the cycle will begin anew; The Islanders-Buffalo
game conflicts with the Devils-Boston game. Guess which one isn't
likely to be televised?
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when too much power rests in one place.
Through FSNY and MSG Network, Charles F. Dolan, chairman of
Cablevision, controls the cable telecasts of the Islanders, Devils,
Nets, Mets, Yankees, Knicks and Rangers. Since 1991, MSG has
controlled the local broadcast rights of the Yankees (which were
sold to Channel 5 last month) and recently bought the local
broadcast rights of the Mets, which he will hawk to Channel 9 or
11.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a legal monopoly, as defined by the Sherman
Antitrust Act, or as interpreted by the U.S. Justice Department.
But what Cablevision has built is a de facto sports monopoly, and
it is acting as if there is no countervailing market power. It
banned Islanders games without a proper explanation or promise to
rebate even a teensy portion of subscriber fees.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way, but it will make you seethe: Cablevision,
which owns the Rangers, is determining what Islanders fans can or
cannot watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to demand that Cablevision provide justification
for what they're doing and stop the discrimination against the
Islanders,'' said David Seldin, the Islanders' president. ``Their
silence is deafening.''
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision is letting Joe Cohen, the Garden's executive vice
president, who is responsible for FSNY, act as its front man.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cohen isn't talking. Monday, however, he issued a
five- paragraph statement icily discussing viewer confusion and low
ratings when FSNY has added ``overflow'' channels to carry second
games when two teams play simultaneously. Islanders ratings, he
said, fell 35 percent on a second FSNY channel compared with
ratings on FSNY Rangers, and Nets ratings fell 50 percent. We can't
wait to see the news release when there is a conflict on MSG, and
Cohen declares it ``uneconomic'' to show the Rangers on MSG2.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen may be right that cable systems inconsistently place FSNY
and MSG's ``overflow'' channels, making it ``impossible to promote
and publicize the games.'' True, but why take it out on the fans
for a situation they can't change?
</P>
<P>
   Cohen failed to address why Cablevision made its decision and
hid in a cave, why the Islanders' underachieving advertising
suddenly irks FSNY, and why he rejected the Islanders' offer to pay
the cost of putting the opening-night game on an overflow channel.
It expressed no regret to irate fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' said Bob Gutkowski, president of the Marquee
Group, a sports marketing firm, and the former Garden president.
``It's not what it appears to be. It's not Islanders' sales.
They've always been a tough sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutkowski said the Islanders could be the focus of Dolan's plan
to re-price his sports empire into various tiers, selling games on
basic, premium or pay-per-view levels, or in team-by-team plans.
Making the Islanders a test case would be wickedly perfect because
it would exploit a team at its weakest moment.
</P>
<P>
   And where is the Fox in Fox Sports New York? When the
Fox/Liberty Networks paid $850 million for 40 percent of Rainbow
Sports, the Cablevision-controlled entity that owns the Garden and
eight regional sports channels, it did not buy the right to run
FSNY and MSG. Yet they are parts of Fox Sports Net, which preaches
the power of local sports as its mantra through its array of sports
channels. FSNY's Islander strategy is mighty antithetical to the
Fox credo.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan can do what he pleases with the Islanders. He doesn't have
to show any games. Perhaps limiting Islanders telecasts will scare
away potential buyers and lower the price tag for himself. It's
smarter to buy on the cheap than pay $13 million for the team's
cable rights into the next millennium. Heck, why not bargain-hunt
when he may end up buying the Yankees for a half-billion dollars or
more?

ANOTHER SAFETY SWITCH FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it's Tuesday, the Bruins have a new strong
safety.
</P>
<P>
   This week, redshirt freshman Jason Stephens gets his shot. He
replaces Tod McBride, who replaced All-American Larry Atkins, who
moved to free safety to replace Eric Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   The problem against Oregon _ against everyone _ was alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at Larry and he's getting out of position because he's
trying to help so many other guys line up,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said. ``Guys get misaligned and he's not able to do his job....
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in that aspect of the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were misaligned on Oregon's go-ahead touchdown in the
fourth quarter _ a 36-yard pass from Akili Smith to Tony Hartley
through the heart of the defense _ and that prevented Atkins from
properly defending the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have gotten those things out of our system by now,''
Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins began this season as he ended last: as one of the
nation's top strong safeties. After two games, he replaced
Whitfield at free safety and McBride, a converted receiver, moved
to the strong position.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted three games.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Stephens, 6-2, 188 pounds and loaded with talent, albeit
raw talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserves an opportunity,'' Toledo said. ``If we go
a couple weeks and give people chances and they keep making
mistakes, we have to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo dismissed the suggestion that reserve cornerback Marques
Anderson could solve the safety problems. Although big and fast and
physical, Anderson does not tackle well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a better cover guy,'' Toledo said. ``You can't miss any
tackles. Safety is the last line of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And for UCLA, the first line of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: A magnetic resonance imaging test confirmed
freshman tailback DeShaun Foster has a sprained medial collateral
ligament in his left knee. He is expected to miss 3-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be back for Oregon State (on Nov. 7),'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers Ramogi Huma (hip flexor) and Mike Wiley (sprained
ankle) are questionable for the Cal game.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen players have stomach flu _ the same affliction that
plagued quarterback Cade McNown before and during the Oregon game.
Even Toledo was feeling ill Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker/punter Chris Sailer is receiving 3-4 hours of treatment
per day on his injured groin and expects to play. If he must
relinquish one of his three duties, it'll be kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on kicker Chris Griffith will travel to Cal as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: Receiver Danny Farmer, linebacker Brendan
Ayanbadejo and punt returner Ryan Roques were named UCLA players of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Ayanbadejo and McNown were named Pac-10 players of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Ayanbadejo and tight end Mike Grieb will join McNown and Atkins
as captains this week.

HILLARY CLINTON URGES WOMEN TO SUPPORT SCHUMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned with Rep.
Charles Schumer for the second time in a month on Monday, assailing
Sen.Alfonse D'Amato for deluging Schumer with a ``blizzard of
negative advertising,'' and she explicitly urged women to support
the Democratic challenger in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the records of these two men _ and they've both
been in public life, so we don't have to guess _ there is
absolutely no choice,'' Mrs. Clinton declared at a fund-raiser for
the Brooklyn congressman in Manhattan on Monday morning. ``Al
D'Amato does not deserve the votes of the women in New York _ he
has consistently voted against so many issues that women care
about, that we think about.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's unusually blunt appeal to women voters _ she
assailed D'Amato for everything from opposing abortion rights to
opposing new penalties for spousal abuse _ was one sign of the
importance the two candidates attach to women in these last two
weeks of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign could be found two hours later at a medical center
in New Rochelle, N.Y., where the Republican senator trumpeted his
work on behalf of breast cancer patients, and vowed that he would
fight for $1 billion for breast cancer research next term.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, as has become the daily custom of his fourth statewide
campaign, also turned the issue of breast cancer research into an
opportunity to scold Schumer for missing votes in Congress. He said
Schumer had been absent in the House of Representatives for a vote
on a $250 billion Defense Department appropriations bill that
included $135 million for breast cancer research. The bill was
approved, 369 to 43, last month.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady made two campaign appearances with Schumer,
helping raise about $250,000 at the midtown fund-raiser, and then
joining him at Nassau Community College here.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the second time she has campaigned in the state alone
on behalf of the congressman, underscored the importance the White
House has put on winning a seat that Democrats consider vulnerable,
and, in the process, defeating the senator who led a congressional
investigations into the Clintons' Whitewater business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The president has also appeared with Schumer during this
campaign and will return once more before the end of the month,
Schumer's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Mrs. Clinton used their two appearances to discuss
the tactics of the campaign and to draw contrasts between the
congressman and D'Amato on issues of concern to women and on
education.
</P>
<P>
   To prolonged cheers at the college, Mrs. Clinton assailed
D'Amato for voting to cut various scholarship programs, like Pell
grants, while Schumer repeated what has become the cornerstone
proposal of his campaign: making college tuition tax deductible for
families with incomes up to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the mainstays of this campaign to make the cost of
all college tuition completely deductible,'' Schumer said. ``I will
fight until my last breath to make college affordable for you and
your younger brothers and sisters and our future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton echoed Schumer's remarks. ``Al D'Amato has
consistently _ not just once, but consistently _ supported cuts to
student loans,'' the first lady said. ``I don't understand that.
Why would anyone want to pull up the ladder of opportunity after
you've already climbed it?''
</P>
<P>
   The main subject of interest on Monday was how women would vote
in November. Speaking before about 150 people at a luncheon at
Sound Shore Medical Center in New Rochelle, D'Amato said he had
secured $900 million for breast cancer research since 1992, much of
which was channeled to institutions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought to see to it that $135 million this year went into
the battle against breast cancer, so that we can win it, and we are
making tremendous strides,'' D'Amato said.

 &HT;    Waters surge down Colorado and Guadalupe as Austin recovers By
Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The floods were supposed to be over in Central
Texas _ washed downstream after a frantic day of helicopter rescues
Sunday _ but some residents received a rude jolt Monday when
downpours brought a new round of flooding and rushed evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   Slow, steady showers dropped 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain across a
broad expanse of Central Texas, but a scattering of heavy storms
also raked across the area, kicking off sporadic floods in
Martindale, McMahan and other locations still reeling from the
weekend's dangerous downpours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about the time we think we have a handle on what's
happening, another cell comes over and dumps more rain,'' said Judy
Gardner, spokeswoman for the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority in
Seguin.
</P>
<P>
   With a similar weather pattern predicted for today, residents
who live in low-lying areas or near creeks were warned not to let
their guards down. Rain is expected to continue until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding was different but far more devastating in Cuero in
south-central Texas, where the Guadalupe River crested about 25
feet above flood stage Monday night, spreading into a stream three
miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Navarro and his wife, Angie, left their house at 9:30
a.m. Monday to report for duty with the Texas State Guard. Six
hours later, the couple was directing traffic about four blocks
away when they saw the gray shingles and blue trim of their house
floating down a street.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarros had moved into the home two weeks ago after renting
property in Cuero for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating,'' Angie Navarro, 39, said later. ``It was
like everything was leaving you,''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still here, we still have our health, we're still able
to help those people who can't help themselves, and that's what
we're here for,'' said Richard Navarro, 49, who was born and raised
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In the next hour, three more houses followed the Navarros' home
downstream.
</P>
<P>
   The flood had been expected as it rolled downstream from the
weekend's deluge in San Antonio, New Braunfels and San Marcos.
Still, Cuero could do little but watch its streets become rushing
rivers that carried away entire houses.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pledged Monday to help devastated communities
in Texas, as officials in Austin and Bastrop, Comal, Hays,
Caldwell, Guadalupe and Bexar counties declared local emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty counties _ nearly one-fourth of Texas _ have experienced
some degree of flooding, said Tom Millwee, state coordinator of the
division of emergency management.
</P>
<P>
   The number of confirmed deaths remained at 14 Monday. Four
people remained missing _ two children swept from a truck near
Uhland; a 6-year-old boy carried away in Alligator Creek in Comal
County; and Harvey Risien Sr., 77, who hasn't been seen since this
weekend's flood struck his house in Fentress.
</P>
<P>
   A team of divers from San Marcos is expected to begin searching
today for Devin McCoy, 7, and Heather Cottle, 11, who are believed
to have drowned after the truck they were in washed into Brushy
Creek near Uhland.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by about 15 Texas National Guard members driving
high-riding personnel carriers, 10 McMahan residents were evacuated
after floodwaters blocked road access to and from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   On the east side of Martindale, seven miles east of San Marcos,
some homes were flooded, others remained dry. Residents were
evacuated, however, amid fears that a soil-conservation dam could
burst.
</P>
<P>
   Two National Guard Black Hawk helicopters rescued nine people
from their Martindale homes on County Road 245. Although the homes
were no longer flooded, the people could not get out because of
impassable low-water crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running short on food and water, and they were
locked in by water,'' Colburn said. ``But today was our final
evacuation day, so now we know we have everybody that wants to be
evacuated or needs to be evacuated.''
</P>
<P>
   Searchers also found an abandoned car on County Road 103 Monday
but had not found its occupant. They planned to resume searching
today.
</P>
<P>
   Although at least 200 people had sought shelter at Martindale
Baptist Church over the weekend, most had either returned home,
gone to stay with relatives, or moved to a Lockhart shelter. And
law enforcement officials were at the Pecan Park Trailer Park to
keep an eye out for looters.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, officials warned that although floodwaters have
receded, motorists should not pass street barricades, which may
indicate structural problems that could collapse roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials cancelled earlier warnings about
possible water contamination in some areas of Austin. Utility crews
restored electricity and gas throughout the city Monday, however
water damage may prevent service to individual homes. Three Austin
shelters _ at Travis, LBJ and Del Valle high schools _ remained
open.
</P>
<P>
   The flood in Cuero was the worst in the city's history, sending
houses and dumpsters floating through the middle of town on the
four submerged lanes of U.S. 183.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people had been evacuated, filling the high
school and junior high and forcing relief coordinators to set up
shelters at three churches, said Luther Boysen, emergency
management coordinator for DeWitt County.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the town was under water, but the
hardest-hit area was Cuero's mostly working class black and
Hispanic south side, which was almost entirely covered with water.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Coleman said emergency management officials warned him
and his neighbors of the rising water about 9:30 a.m. Fifteen
minutes later, water was in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just packed up and left everything,'' said Coleman, a
plumber who kept only his car and the clothes on his back. ``We're
going to need some disaster assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   This morning, prison officials expect to evacuate 1,300
medium-security prisoners from the Stevenson prison unit outside of
Cuero.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the prison unit was isolated by floodwaters from the
rain-swollen San Antonio River and several creeks. First-floor
areas throughout the prison were flooded, and the convicts and 150
guards inside had sought safety on the second-floor cellblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Convicts were obeying orders, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulge of floodwater heading down the Colorado River hit
Smithville and La Grange Monday morning _ putting houses under
water but causing no serious injuries _ before sweeping toward a
rendezvous with Columbus tonight.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 Smithville families evacuated their homes in
advance of the surge.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Bob Miller said it could be several days before
city workers can evaluate the damage. ``The thing we don't know yet
is what the damage to the infrastructure is,'' he said. ``I don't
know what's left. We may have some real big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In La Grange, emergency crews rescued three well workers who
were swept away by the rising Colorado River. They were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 homes in La Grange were flooded where Bruckner's Creek
meets the Colorado River. Robert Hill's home was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping it quits raining,'' he said Monday in his empty
living room. All the furniture and appliances on the first floor_
including the piano, refrigerator and dishwasher _ were taken to
higher ground by a church group. Even the walls were bare.
</P>
<P>
   At about noon, the Hills left their home as water started to
slide under their garage door. ``I can't watch,'' said Julie Hill,
Robert's wife.
</P>
<P>
   In New Braunfels, Comal County Judge Carter Casteel estimated
Monday that 250 homes and businesses have been flooded; 100
families are in need of temporary housing; more than 300 homes and
businesses are without water, phones and other utilities; 100 homes
have been isolated due to impassable roads; and road and bridge
damage is now estimated at more than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``How bad is bad? We don't know yet,'' said Jack Colley,
assistant state emergency management coordinator.

   Residents Monday received a belated copy of the Sunday edition
of the New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung, after swelling waters from the
normally dry Comal Creek behind the newspaper offices nearly
submerged the building Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Toney, editor and publisher of the Herald, said he and
several staff members saved several computers from the swift-moving
water Saturday and set up shop in his living room, where they wrote
and reported stories. The Sunday edition was printed by a weekly
newspaper in Seguin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to us to give up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One headline on the Sunday edition read, ``Paper will print,
come hell or high water.''

<P>
   Because his nickname is Barney, Liborio Salvatore Bellomo, a
reputedly powerful New York Mafia leader, got disappointing news on
Monday: He has to stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting his claim that New Jersey authorities conducting a mob
investigation mixed him up with his cousin, who is also known as
Barney Bellomo, a federal judge in Trenton, N.J., on Monday denied
Bellomo's application to be returned immediately to his prison cell
in Atlanta, where he was serving a 10-year prison sentence for
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling cleared the way for Bellomo to be brought before a
New Jersey grand jury Wednesday with the threat that if he refuses
to testify, additional time would be tagged on to his prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a federal case in New York unrelated to the New
Jersey inquiry, Bellomo pleaded guilty to extortion and began
serving his sentence in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta. When
he was arrested in 1996 on racketeering charges in New York,
Bellomo was listed by the FBI as the acting boss of the Genovese
crime family, the nation's largest and most potent Mafia group.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the New Jersey attorney general's office transferred
Bellomo from Atlanta to the Mercer Court Jail in Trenton. State
prosecutors said they wanted to question Bellomo because a Barney
Bellomo had been implicated last year in an investigation into a
plot to extort $100,000 from an insurance company in Franklin
Lakes, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo, 41, was granted immunity from prosecution concerning
his testimony before the grand jury. But he refused to testify,
contending that he was being subjected to vile prison conditions in
New Jersey. He argued that investigators apparently had confused
him with his cousin, Liborio Thomas Bellomo, who also goes by the
nickname Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state authorities say that Liborio T. Bellomo, 39,
of Bayside, Queens, is a Genovese family associate or worker.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, if Liborio S. Bellomo receives a state jail
term for refusing to testify, that sentence will not be credited as
time served in the 10-year federal sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be called before the grand jury on Wednesday,'' Robert
Codey, the lead prosecutor in the New Jersey case, said Monday of
Liborio S. Bellomo. ``The next move is up to him.''

EDITORIAL: PLUNDERING A MUNICIPAL UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   A wave of indictments is expected when Manhattan District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau finishes investigating charges of
embezzlement and kickbacks from those doing business with at least
a half-dozen locals of District Council 37, New York City's largest
municipal union. But the urgent business of cleaning up the union
should not await the filing of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   A casual and clubby management style invited stealing from a
union treasury built on dues from some of the city's
hardest-working and lowest-paid employees. That in itself warrants
immediate intervention by the parent union, the American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees. The union should promptly
put the whole district council into trusteeship and actively
explore the possibility of new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hill, the union's politically powerful director, has not
been implicated in any criminal wrongdoing. But, as Steven
Greenhouse of The New York Times has reported, he helped invite
scandal with his languorous approach to union finances and his
curious habit of ignoring clear excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, the parent union put the local representing
cafeteria aides and crossing guards into trusteeship because it was
$10 million in debt and had not paid $500,000 in rent. In June, an
internal union panel expelled the local's president, Charles
Hughes, for cheating the union of $1.7 million, including $329,000
in credit card bills and $685,000 in fraudulent overtime. For
unknown reasons, Hill paid the overtime bill even though the
judicial panel found fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of the local representing City University's
clerical workers have demanded an inquiry into the disappearance of
$192,000. Mark Rosenthal, the new president of the motor vehicle
operators' local, complains that before he took office, $92,000 was
spent on the 1995 Christmas party and $11,000 on 250 very expensive
turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and the parent union have recently adopted stricter
financial rules. Even so, trusteeship is the only sane course until
the mess is sorted out. District Council 37 played a proud role in
helping rescue the city from financial distress a quarter-century
ago. Now its own house is in shambles.

KENNELLY AND ROWLAND REITERATE PARTY THEMES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. _ Squaring off in their fourth and final
debate, Gov. John Rowland and his opponent, Rep. Barbara Kennelly,
each took a strong party stance on Monday night, with the governor
charging Mrs. Kennelly with recycling tired Democratic themes while
she continued her charge that he was ignoring the state's neediest
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In her opening statement, Mrs. Kennelly repeated her theme of
the previous two debates, that Connecticut was becoming two states,
and that Rowland was only concerned with the prosperous half of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In Rowland's vision of Connecticut, she said, ``everybody has a
great job, everybody can see still the doctor of their choice,
every child is well-educated and protected, and our environment is
pristine. But you know and I know that's not all true,'' she told
the audience at Connecticut College.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland shot back that Mrs. Kennelly represented the past and
accused her of stealing a theme from a speech by the former New
York governor, Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the same old rhetoric and some of the old, borrowed
ideas are come back to haunt us,'' Rowland said. ``I believe this
campaign is about the rhetoric versus the record. Even the rhetoric
was borrowed. The `Tale of Two Cities' in Mrs. Kennelly's opening
remarks, and `The Tale of Two Cities' in the last debate, was Mario
Cuomo's idea in 1984, during the Democratic National Convention _
the exact same rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most tense exchange of Monday's debate, the candidates
were asked to name the groups that had made the largest
contributions to their campaign. Mrs. Kennelly charged the governor
with deliberately undermining her fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many groups make large campaign contributions to my
campaign,'' she said. ``I can remember I was told when I first was
going to run that, you know, `The usual people will give to you.
The lobbyists _ they'll give you a lot of money at the beginning.'
But of course the governor made the word go out very quickly: `This
election, you don't give to both candidates. You give to me, or
forget it.' And so a minute number of lobbyists gave to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor ignored that charge in the debate. Later, his
spokesman, Dean Pagani, said it was false.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Rowland started his answer to the question
about donors, by saying, ``The largest group that has contributed
to my campaign? The taxpayers of the state _ the people in this
community that believe that we've turned the state around over the
last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the panelists pressed for a more specific answer, asking
the candidates wheher they had received any significant
contribution from a particular business or special-interest group.
Mrs. Kennelly said she had contributions from several labor unions,
and ``thousands and thousands of contributions from individuals who
just want to see me be the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, whose campaign has been heavily financed by business
groups, said, ``There's no particular quote-unquote group.'' The
audience of 1,000, which seemed to be heavy with partisans of Mrs.
Kennelly, groaned and cackled.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly interrupted. ``Oh, come on!'' she scolded the
governor, chuckling and shaking her head. The laughter built in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to tell your supporters to quiet down a little
bit,'' the governor said. ``I know they must be getting
frustrated.'' Mrs. Kennelly leaned toward her rostrum and continued
shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also squared off over the privatization of state
services, an issue that was not discussed in their earlier debates.
Rowland said he was privatizing state computer systems, a change he
said would improve government services and make them more
inexpensive. But Mrs. Kennelly raised concerns that a privatized
system would compromise privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly also said the state had failed to do enough for
crime victims. She applauded the creation of an office to oversee
the rights of crime victims, but she said state officials had
failed to inform many crime victims of court appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming very quickly an office that has the right idea,
but it isn't being run with the greatest efficiency and
excitement,'' she said.

60 ARRESTED IN PROTEST OF DEATH OF A GAY STUDENT IN WYOMING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wyo., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What began as a rally down Fifth Avenue to mourn and
protest the bias-related killing of a gay college student in
Wyoming ended chaotically Monday night, with 60 arrests and several
injuries, after demonstrators faced off against police officers in
riot gear and on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators and police officers were slightly injured
during the loosely organized rally, whose planners did not have a
permit to march in the street. One woman was hurt by a police horse
when mounted officers were sent into the crowd to disperse the
marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The march, called to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard, 21,
who died on Oct. 12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence in
Wyoming, was billed as ``a political funeral.'' Several thousand
chanting marchers, carrying a pine coffin and memorial candles, had
planned to march down Fifth Avenue from 59th Street to 23rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The scuffling between marchers and police began when officers in
riot gear tried to keep the demonstrators on the sidewalk. About
7:30 p.m., when police had the marchers hemmed in on W. 43rd Street
between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, pushing and
shoving broke out. Soon after, a team of mounted officers stormed
the crowd. Some officers were hit by candles thrown by the
marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Finklestein, sitting on the sidewalk and nursing her
bruised and swollen right ankle, said a police horse stepped on her
foot.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the march appeared to surprise both organizers and
the police. The marchers stayed on the sidewalk at first, but when
they reached 56th Street many took to the middle of the street.
That was when the trouble began. When police spread across Fifth
Avenue several blocks to the south to keep the marchers from going
any farther, the demonstrators walked west to the Avenue of the
Americas and turned south there, halting traffic. The marchers
chanted: ``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Homophobia's got to go!''
</P>
<P>
   Several march organizers were among the first arrested, making
it increasingly difficult for those remaining to control the crowd,
said Tim Sanamour, 34, a planner who was not arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers then made their way back to Fifth Avenue and
continued south. At 43rd Street, the organizers linked hands to
block Fifth Avenue and force the marchers to turn west. This time
they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   On 43rd Street, the vanguard was met by a phalanx of police
officers in riot gear. More officers moved in from behind, penning
the marchers in.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Franklin, an organizer, said: ``They would not negotiate
with us. They would just rush the crowd. When they arrested people,
they were throwing people against the cars. It appeared to be
random who they were grabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchers reached Madison Square Park about 8:15 p.m. Once there,
they gave speeches and set up shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Many marchers said they were dismayed by how the march had
turned out. ``I expected a vigil,'' said one marcher, Fred Kaplan,
who wept as the demonstration broke up. ``We needed to mourn. I
never expected that it would end this way.''

GOVERNOR GETS PRECISE ON SECOND-TERM GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the election just over two weeks away, Gov.
George Pataki, who has largely avoided laying out a detailed agenda
for a second term, offered a few more specifics about his goals
Monday, citing a further push to reduce crime and to move welfare
recipients off the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, spent the day
campaigning upstate in support of expanded after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York City Pataki campaign headquarters, the
Republican governor collected the endorsement of three
firefighters' organizations _ the New York City Uniformed
Firefighters Association, the New York City Fire Officers
Association, and the New York State Professional Firefighters
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he told reporters who asked about his second-term
agenda, ``We're going to continue to move forward in the same areas
we've progressed in the first four years.'' He then offered more
detail than he typically has during the campaign, although many of
the goals he identified are programs already in the works or
efforts that failed during his first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to reduce violent crime,'' he said, and
cited several bills he wanted to pass, including the Juvenile
Justice Reform bill, which would strengthen penalties for juvenile
offenders but which failed to pass the Assembly last year, and
tougher laws to deal with domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wanted to work to help long-term welfare
recipients _ considered the toughest to move off the rolls _
``develop the skills and support so they can transition'' to
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also said that if he were re-elected, the state would
``lead the nation in cutting taxes every one of the next four
years,'' through tax cuts and the expansion of a
property-tax-reduction program to all homeowners. That expansion is
already scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council, held news
conferences at schools in Rochester and Syracuse to highlight his
``After 3'' proposal, which would offer after-school programs,
financed by a public-private partnership, to all children in New
York state. Trailing badly in the polls, Vallone has been unveiling
a series of dramatic policy initiatives, including a state-run
universal health care program, in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily using public schools and their resources, the
after-school initiative would offer enrichment programs in areas
like computer skills, the arts, and community service. Vallone
criticized Pataki for vetoing funds for after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the Syracuse news conference was Nicholas Dolan,
a fourth-grader who came with his mother because he had been
assigned to play Vallone in a mock gubernatorial debate at his
school. ``You don't know how lucky you are to get George Pataki to
come and debate you,'' Vallone told Nicholas. ``What's your
secret?''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has repeatedly called on the governor to agree to a
debate, and said that Pataki could set the conditions. The governor
said Monday, as he has before, that the campaigns were ``working
on'' the schedule for debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party, meanwhile, released new radio and television
advertisements intended to bolster its gubernatorial candidate, Lt.
Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross. The commercials, which is to be
broadcast statewide beginning Tuesday, showcase Ms. McCaughey Ross,
but also feature Charles Schumer, Carl McCall, and Eliot Spitzer,
the Democrats who are the Liberal Party nominees for Senate,
comptroller, and attorney general, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements are intended to counter _ and play off _
Republican Party ads that denigrate Democratic and Liberal Party
nominees for being too liberal. ``Tired of candidates who use
`liberal' as a dirty word?'' one ad asks. ``Fight back. Vote on the
Liberal Party line. `Liberal' means pro-choice. Pro-environment.
Pro-education.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross, who lost badly to Vallone in the Democratic
primary, has been keeping a low campaign profile, but behind the
scenes the Liberal Party has been busy. Unless Ms. McCaughey Ross
garners at least 50,000 votes in the election, the party will lose
its slot on the ballot for the next election.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, her husband, the financier Wilbur Ross, withdrew much
of the financing he had pledged to her campaign, leaving her with
little cash for the general election. A New York Times/CBS News
poll two weeks ago showed Ms. McCaughey Ross with 6 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chairman of the Liberal Party, Raymond Harding, has spent
much of the fall fund raising _ ``going through my Rolodex,'' he
said at one point. He said it was a new experience for the Liberal
Party to raise money for a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he said the party would be spending more than $1
million between now and the election on radio and television
advertisements, other issue ads, phone banks and a direct mailing
to 900,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement itself perhaps best sums up who is doing the
heavy financial lifting in the campaign: ``This is paid for by the
Liberal Party Campaign Committee,'' Ms. McCaughey Ross says at one
commercial's end, ``and authorized by me.''

GIULIANI IS WELCOMED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, EVEN BY RED SOX FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ If his experiences Monday are any indication,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani learned that whenever he feels unappreciated
in the harsh environs of New York City, he can always come to New
Hampshire to breathe in the restorative New England air and bask in
the admiration of others.
</P>
<P>
   They loved him in Hanover, where more than 300 students at
Dartmouth College crammed into a small auditorium to hear the mayor
brag about his accomplishments in crime reduction, welfare reform
and urban resurrection. They loved him in Bedford, where state
Republicans stood in line to have their photographs taken with him
between the American and New Hampshire flags. And they loved him
here in Nashua, where Monday night Mayor Don Davidson presented him
with the key to the city.
</P>
<P>
   And if all that did not make him feel wanted, Steve Duprey, the
Republican Party state chairman, advised Giuliani in private _ and
told the news media in public _ that the mayor should consider
running in the Republican Presidential primary in New Hampshire,
the country's first, in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conservative state, but it also has a strong wing of
moderates,'' said Duprey. ``He has a compelling message. And he's a
very adroit politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Duprey's invitation echoed another one that Giuliani received in
August from the chairman of the Republican Party in Iowa. And, in
similar fashion, the mayor demurred _ all day. At every stop he
insisted that he was not stumping for his own political fortunes;
he even corrected a questioner who described him as a candidate.
``I'm not _ I'm not _ I'm not thinking about running right now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mayor reiterated the reasons that he has given for
his many out-of-state trips in recent weeks, which include three
more _ Rhode Island, Tennessee and North Carolina _ this week
alone. He said that he was helping those Republicans around the
country who are running for office, meeting with Republican leaders
to promote political moderation as the key to presidential victory,
and lobbying for New York City as the location for the party's
convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This last mission was particularly important in New Hampshire,
because a local Republican, Ruth Griffin, is on the national
Republican Party's nine-member delegation that will choose the
convention site. Giuliani went out of his way to praise Ms.
Griffin, and with good reason; Ms. Griffin later said that she
would vote against two of the five cities being considered for the
convention, San Antonio and New Orleans. That leaves Indianapolis,
Philadelphia and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani began the day by giving a lecture at Dartmouth, in
Hanover, on freedom and responsibility. The crowd was his, as
evidenced by questions from the audience, including one that
essentially asked: To what do you attribute your success? The only
slightly critical question came from a black woman who asked what
responsibility the mayor shared for his ``contentious''
relationship with the city's black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it does exist,'' the mayor answered.
Although he did not bring up the heavy criticism he recently
received from Harlem's leaders _ for what they said was his
heavy-handed handling of a black youth rally that ultimately ended
in brief violence _ he did refer to his fractured relations to
those leaders, if only in the most general of terms. ``I think it's
because I approach things differently than some of the leaders of
some of the minority communities would want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Giuliani was applauded and cheered, which did not
surprise Linda L. Fowler, a political scientist and director of the
Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth, which invited the mayor
to campus. She said that Dartmouth was probably more liberal than
the rest of New Hampshire, and that the state's conservative
reputation was somewhat misleading. Generally, she said, ``It's
fiscally conservative and socially moderate'' _ just like Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really liked him,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Bedford, Giuliani met with Republican leaders, who asked him
questions like: How did you reduce crime?
</P>
<P>
   The only mistake that the mayor made during the adulation was to

DECAY IS SEEN IN NEW JERSEY'S PARKS

   HIGH MOUNTAIN STATE PARK, N.J. _ New Jersey's voters will soon
be asked to pass judgment on a plan to preserve a million acres of
open land. But critics say the state is not taking care of the
parkland it already has.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman is promoting her plan to save a million
acres of open space and farmland, at a cost of about $3.5 billion
over 30 years, because she feels that the state is becoming
overdeveloped. There is about 2 million acres of undeveloped land
in the state, and she wants to save half of it.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that in the state's parks, grand old buildings
are decaying and park roads, dams and hiking trails need fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Division of Parks and Forestry say this
stems from years of flat budgets, staff cuts and deferred
maintenance. The Parks Division officials have drafted a
three-year, $147 million budget for repairs, some backlogged for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But they worry privately that their repair bill faces an
uncertain future because in recent years the State Treasury
Department has provided only a fraction of the money the Parks
Division says it needs for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   When she started the open-space campaign in May, Whitman
proposed a 2-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax to help cover expenditures
of $40 million a year for park maintenance and historic
preservation, and $130 million a year for land purchases. But under
a compromise reached with the Republican-controlled Legislature,
the lion's share of money goes to land purchases, with just $6
million a year over 10 years for repairs to historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen McGinnis, chief of the governor's office of planning and
policy, called this amount a ``good start.'' Critics disagree. They
contend that Whitman is more interested in creating a legacy as a
conservationist than she is in restoring existing parks to
top-notch condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her sharpest critics in the Legislature, Sen. Robert
Littell, a fellow Republican and chairman of the Senate budget
committee, and Assemblyman Joseph Wisniewski, a Democrat, say
Whitman's priorities are reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they buy another acre of land, they need to take care
of the property they already own,'' Littell said. ``There needs to
be a large segment of money available to take care of deferred
maintenance and capital improvements. It's been neglected long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisniewski said he questioned the administration's focusing on
major land purchases and skimping on repairs. ``There's a certain
amount of duplicity here to talk about how `green' they are and not
have the will to put money up to maintain parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGinnis said she had heard the argument about reversed
priorities from park superintendents. She rejected the contention,
saying land conservation and park improvement was not an
``either-or'' proposition for the governor. Money to improve parks
will be addressed in the budget that starts next July 1, after the
administration studies the issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the need, but we want to do a very comprehensive
assessment of needs,'' Ms. McGinnis said. ``We're going to have a
first-class park system.'' She suggested that it was unlikely that
the $6 million now proposed for repairing historic park buildings
would be increased if voters approved the spending plan Nov. 3.
``The more money that's used for other purposes than land
acquisition, we're farther away from the goal to save half the
state's developable land,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The spending plan includes the sale of $1 billion in state bonds
and the use of up to $98 million a year for 30 years in money from
the state sales tax. Voters must approve use of the sales-tax money
because the governor wants to shift it from the general fund to a
dedicated fund to buy land and repay the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman angered Littell, Wisniewski and leaders of many
park-volunteer groups in June when she vetoed $4.5 million of $5
million in emergency repair money, in a year when the state budget
had a projected surplus of $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   They had wanted the money to start repairs at two landmarks now
closed because of damage from leaks: a 220-foot tower here at the
state's northwestern tip that provides breathtaking views of the
mountains and valleys of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, and
a handsome granite Tudor revival mansion that is a showcase of
Ringwood State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The cut was the latest in a string of budget setbacks for the
park system in the 1990s. Although annual park attendance has grown
in this decade by one-third, to almost 14 million people, and
parkland has already increased 11 percent, to 334,253 acres, the
park system's $24 million operating budget has increased by less
than half of 1 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight years, authorized permanent staff positions
have been cut to 422 from 548. And only 388 of those 422 positions
are now filled. In addition, for much of this decade, the state
budget provided no steady annual financing for capital improvements
and repairs, interrupting planning and forcing park officials to
rely on one-shot infusions of money from bonds for the most
critically needed repairs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the system's annual report this year, the message from
Gregory Marshall, director of parks and forestry, seemed an apology
and a plea for help. ``The ongoing problems of insufficient
staffing and funding limits our ability to fulfill the division's
potential for providing quality stewardship programs and
services,'' Marshall wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Park volunteers have seen the results of the tight budgeting.
``It's like a cancer eating away at morale,'' said Anne
Lutkenhouse, a project director of the New York-New Jersey Trail
Conference, which organized a coalition of 54 environmental and
park-volunteer groups, to appeal to Trenton for more operating and
capital money for the parks. ``Each year, we've seen the morale of
these park officials eroded. There was a can-do attitude: an
energy, creativity, and pride in their work. That sense of can-do
has been lost because of budget cuts and shrinking staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Park superintendents say that they make annual appeals to
Trenton about their repair needs, but that it sometimes takes years
for any money to trickle in. Wes Powers, a regional maintenance
coordinator in the park system, said many of the older buildings
were ``maintenance heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem that never goes away,'' Powers said. ``The
amount of dollars are just not there. It is our heritage that gets
sacrificed. It's just that simple.''

   At High Point, Littell's district, the mountaintop tower built
during the Depression in memory of war heroes has been closed for
about a year because seepage has weakened the steel staircase that
winds to the top. Some sections are corroded; some are pulling away
from the masonry wall.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Eilert of Wayne came recently with her children, Danielle,
9, and Joseph, 6, to see the three-state panorama from the top of
the tower. She was unaware the monument was closed. They settled
grudgingly, like scores of other visitors on the bright autumn day,
for the view from the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame to come to a park that should be enjoyable and
find things closed,'' Mrs. Eilert said. ``People are going to lose
interest in the parks if they are not maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ringwood State Park, home of the New Jersey Botanical
Gardens, the granite mansion, Skylands Manor, has had water seep
through cracks in the roof's thick slates.
</P>
<P>
   Plaster has collapsed from ceilings and walls in some rooms on
the second and third floors. The oak of the grand staircase has
started to rot. The building is open for tours one Sunday a month,
but only on the first floor. Other buildings, like the park's old
dairy barn and horse barn, are far more decrepit from age and rot.
</P>
<P>
   The chief ranger, Louis Casper, who oversees law enforcement in
Ringwood and in 10 nearby sister parks, said the staff of
gardeners, maintenance workers, rangers, tour guides and lecturers
for the 11 sites had been cut over the years to 22 from 72 even
though attendance had risen sharply. He and many other
superintendents now rely heavily on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues have their litanies of deterioration and scant
repair money in their parks.
</P>
<P>
   In Menlo Park, people cannot go near the 131-foot tower built to
memorialize Thomas Edison because chunks of concrete loosened by
leaks occasionally fall off its walls.
</P>
<P>
   At Wharton State Forest, the site of a Revolutionary War
ironworks, part of the Batsto Mansion built in the 1760s is pulling
away from a section added in the late 1800s, Lynn Fleming, the
superintendent, said.
</P>
<P>
   In Caldwell, the birthplace of President Grover Cleveland was
plagued by seepage, and until renovations were finished, park
officials hid cracked ceilings beneath boards.
</P>
<P>
   And at Island Beach State Park, a park-system jewel on a 10-mile
island on the Atlantic, restrooms date to the 1950s and need
replacing. Sections of roadway are deteriorating and need paving.
Bill Vibbert, the superintendent, dreams of the day he can open a
full-fledged interpretive center in an abandoned Coast Guard
boathouse. ``We just have to be patient,'' Vibbert said.
