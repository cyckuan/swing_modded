This Duke has nerves of steel

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ All night long, El Duque toyed with the Padres.
	   He didn't just beat them, he embarrassed them, made them look
like Little Leaguers hopelessly flailing away.
	   Overhand, sidearm, fastball, splitter. Orlando Hernandez's right
arm seemed to be here, there and everywhere.
	   Nerves? Hah!
	   The World Series? No problemo.
	   After escaping Fidel Castro's Cuba on a raft last winter,
everything else looks easy.
	   Now, after his 9-3 flattening of San Diego on Sunday night, the
New York Yankees are in control, in range of capping this amazing
season with their first Series sweep in 48 years.
	   ``He has so much confidence in every pitch he throws,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said, increasingly impressed by El Duque.
	   He allowed just one run and six hits in seven innings, striking
out seven. And for every one of his strikeouts, a drawing of Castro
was tacked up on the facing of the upper deck down the right-field
line.
	   Not exactly your ordinary rookie.
	   ``He had good stuff. He hit his spots,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said.
	   San Diego's best chance off him came in the first inning, when
Wally Joyner hit a drive to the right-field wall with two on and
two outs. But Paul O'Neill made a leaping catch, taking away at
least a two-run double.
	   ``I thought it may have gone out but O'Neill made a hell of a
play,'' Torre said.
	   Last weekend, the Yankees turned to El Duque when they trailed
Cleveland 2-1 in the AL championship series, when it seemed like
those 114 regular-season games were about to wash away into Lake
Erie.
	   In floats Hernandez, who throws three-hit ball for seven shutout
innings. The Indians never recovered.
	   Some veterans crumble under postseason pressure. Remember how
Dave Winfield went 1-for-22 in the '81 World Series?
	   ``I had pressure. But I had no fear,'' El Duque said that night
in Cleveland.
	   Last year, he watched from CNN's studio in Cuba as his half
brother Livan went 2-0 in the Series for Florida, getting the MVP
award following the Marlins' seven-game victory.
	   At that point, El Duque was earning 206 pesos a month, about
dlrs 10. Two months later he was on a raft, making his way to
freedom and the major leagues.
	   By June, he was in the big leagues. By September, he was 12-4.
	   And now he's at the top of the baseball world, a star as the
Yankees finish off one of the greatest seasons ever.
	   ``No, I didn't think I'd be here today,'' he said Saturday.
``But yes, I did think of finding a way to one day be here.''

Malaysian civil servants warned to stay out of anti-government
</HEADLINE>
rallies

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Moving to curb growing opposition
to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the government is threatening
to fire public workers caught at anti-government rallies, a news
report said Monday.
	   Abdul Halim Ali, chief secretary to the government, told civil
servants they were required by law to support their government and
would lose their jobs if found at street demonstrations.
	   ``If their unlawful acts result in serious consequences, they
can be sacked,'' Abdul Halim was quoted as saying in the New
Straits Times, citing a law that regulates the conduct of
government employees.
	   Protests have flared in recent weeks in support of dissident
Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired on Sept. 2 as deputy premier and
finance minister. He was subsequently arrested after launching a
reformist campaign.
	   Demonstrators have demanded Anwar's release and the ouster of
Mahathir, who has ruled Malaysia for 17 years.
	   ``No one, especially government officers, should ignore or go
against the government's wish to make Malaysia an industrialized
nation or should act in a manner that can disunite society or split
the civil service,'' Abdul Halim said.
	   He added that he had not received any reports of civil servant
involvement in the demonstrations, which have turned into massive
weekly affairs in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   At one recent street demonstration, however, government workers
were among the front line of protesters shouting ``Reforms!
Reforms!'' and ``Step down Mahathir'' in defiance of a blanket
police ban on political rallies.
	   ``I work in the government and I don't like my government,''
said a civil servant, who asked to be identified only by his first
name, Mamat.
	   Authorities recently threatened that students caught at the
political rallies would face expulsion in adherence with a
longstanding ban on student involvement in politics.
	   Meanwhile, the prime minister urged country to remain united in
the face of its worst economic crisis since independence.
	   ``We should be thankful because although the country faces
economic difficulties, our lives have not been severely affected,''
Mahathir said, adding that Malaysia was not as bad off as some of
its Southeast Asian neighbors, where many people are unable to buy
food, medicine and other necessities.
	   Mahathir, who is in Tokyo on a 5-day visit, made the remarks in
a special message in honor of Deepavali, a Hindu festival of lights
celebrated as a national holiday Monday. Mahathir is expected to
return Tuesday.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with postgame quotes &QL;

 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wonder no more why these New York Yankees are so
special.
	   From the very first inning, El Duque and Co. demonstrated for
all _ particularly the Padres _ how they've won 123 games and
staked their claim as the greatest team in baseball history.
	   Orlando Hernandez dominated on the mound, Bernie Williams and
Jorge Posada homered to lead a relentless attack and Yankees
fielding sparkled Sunday night in a 9-3 romp over San Diego for a
2-0 lead in the World Series.
	   ``This is just the way we play,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``We're just a confident club. The fact that we've won so
many times this season gives you the confidence to expect to win.''
	   After winning Game 1 by playing home-run derby, the Yankees
showed off their whole potent package in Game 2. The Padres never
had a chance, with rookie Ricky Ledee's RBI single making it 7-0 in
the third and chasing Andy Ashby, one of several San Diego pitchers
fighting a flu bug.
	   ``I'm glad it's a best-of-7 right now,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said. ``We were at least hoping to win a ballgame here.''
	   Hernandez made sure that didn't happen. The Cuban defector who
floated to freedom less than 10 months ago and helped save New
York's season with a win in Game 4 of the AL championship series
was in complete control.
	   Exactly a year after his younger half-brother, Livan Hernandez,
pitched Florida past Cleveland in Game 1 on his way to becoming MVP
of the World Series, the quirky El Duque shut down San Diego on one
run in seven innings.
	   ``We spoke over the phone today and he spoke to me a little
about how to pitch to this team,'' Hernandez said through an
interpreter.
	   By the time Posada's two-run homer in the fifth made it 9-1, the
sellout crowd of 56,692 was going crazy while several Padres
players were standing with heads down and hands on hips.
	   The Padres face a tough task in trying to regroup for Game 3 on
Tuesday night in San Diego. David Cone will start for New York
against NLCS MVP Sterling Hitchcock, a former Yankees pitcher _ of
the previous 44 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the Series, 33 have won
the championship.
	   On top of that, Hitchcock, Ashby and Game 1 starter Kevin Brown
are all ill.
	   ``Somebody spread something around,'' Bochy said. ``It looks
like it hit the pitchers more than anybody else. Brownie has a
touch of the flu. The timing is terrible.''
	   At this rate, this might have been the last game at Yankee
Stadium of the year. Yet the Yankees know how quickly fortunes can
change _ wiped out at home by Atlanta in the first two games of the
1996 Series, they came back to win four in a row for their record
23rd title.
	   ``We would love to win it in front of our fans, but we just want
to get it over with as soon as possible,'' New York shortstop Derek
Jeter said.
	   San Diego's best opportunity came in the first. Tony Gwynn got
his fourth hit of the series and Greg Vaughn walked, but right
fielder Paul O'Neill made a leaping catch as he crashed into the
wall on Wally Joyner's drive for the final out.
	   From then on, it was all Yankees. Williams hit his ninth career
postseason homer and No. 9 batter Ledee, a rookie playing with
exceptional poise, enjoyed his second straight night of getting two
hits and a walk.
	   Actually, Ashby could have had a 1-2-3 bottom of the first with
any luck. But on a night when he had a sore throat, he got no help.
	   Chuck Knoblauch's foul pop was dropped near the screen by
sliding catcher Greg Myers _ it was correctly ruled no play _ and
then the leadoff man exemplified the Yankees' patience at the
plate, drawing an eight-pitch walk.
	   Knoblauch stole second and one out later, O'Neill slapped a
grounder at three-time Gold Glove third baseman Ken Caminiti.
Despite having plenty of time, Caminiti rushed his throw and it was
too high for Joyner, an error that enabled Knoblauch to score.
	   Chili Davis and Scott Brosius added RBI singles and even though
all three runs were unearned, they counted. The Padres even looked
shaky getting the last out of the inning, when second baseman
Quilvio Veras dropped Posada's line drive and made a poor throw
barely in time.
	   ``We've been stressing trying to win the game in the first
inning _ trying to give our pitchers something to work with,''
Knoblauch said.
	   Williams' two-run homer highlighted a three-run third. Tino
Martinez and Brosius, who each had three of the Yankees' 16 hits,
singled to set up Ledee's RBI single in the third.
	   That was all for Ashby, and it wasn't until reliever Brian
Boehringer pitched a scoreless fourth that Padres pitchers retired
even two batters in a row.
	   Hernandez, meanwhile, set down 10 straight batters in the middle
innings. With his navy blue socks pulled high, his unusual array of
motions and pitches tamed hitters who had never faced him.
	   The Padres shuffled their lineup, sending seven left-handed
hitters against the righty Hernandez. It did no good, as El Duque
struck out seven and gave up six hits.
	   Mike Stanton relieved to start the eighth and San Diego scored
twice. Pinch-hitter Ruben Rivera, cousin of Yankees closer Mariano
Rivera, hit an RBI double and scored on pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney's
single.

Talks extended to Monday

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with new information on talks going past midnight,

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Prodded by U.S. mediation at the
highest levels, Middle East peace negotiations were extended until
Monday after they stalled over key elements of a land-for-peace
deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Eager to nail down a deal, President Bill Clinton and members of
his administration worked past midnight Sunday and extended the
difficult talks for at least one more day.
	   After seeing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat twice and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once, the president had a
midnight meeting with Ariel Sharon _ at the hard-line Israeli
foreign minister's request.
	   Amid reports the summit might extend well into the week, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart hedged. ``The only thing I can tell
you is we will go through tomorrow,'' he said. ``I wouldn't go
beyond that.''
	   A senior U.S. official, steering clear of any claims of progress
or optimism, said he did not think the extension necessarily
enhanced prospects for resolving some of the knotty issues.
	   ``No,'' the official replied on condition of anonymity when
asked whether the one-day extension was a signal that an agreement
was near at hand.
	   Nonetheless, the administration appealed to the two sides to
find the ``political will'' to settle issues that have generated 19
months of stalemate and extended the talks past Sunday's projected
conclusion.
	   ``It is in the best interest of the peace process and the
discussions we have been having,'' State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said at nightfall Sunday in announcing that the Israeli
and Palestinian delegations would remain overnight at the secluded
summit retreat and that there ``almost certainly'' would be talks
on Monday.
	   Clinton, in a third day of personal intervention, met over lunch
with Netanyahu for an hour and 45 minutes and then strolled along
the Wye River.
	   In early evening, Clinton turned to Arafat, meeting with him in
the president's quarters for an hour.
	   The president took a one-hour dinner break with his staff, then
met with Arafat again for an hour and 20 minutes and telephoned a
report to Netanyahu. Afterward, Sharon called on Clinton.
	   Clinton, who stayed here past 10 p.m. Saturday, was expected to
go back to Washington again later Sunday night. Rubin said he did
not know whether the president would return to the bargaining site
Monday, but that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
continuing the negotiations.
	   A significant stumbling block involved security guarantees for
Israel as part of a deal to give up land on the West Bank to the
Palestinian Authority, diplomatic sources said.
	   Palestinian sources told The Associated Press, meanwhile, that
Arafat's demand for a phased release of Palestinians held in
Israeli prisons remained unresolved. The sources, insisting on
anonymity, said that was the main request Arafat made of Clinton at
their meeting Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, the sources said, Arafat is seeking Israeli
acceptance of U.S. monitoring of Palestinian prisons to make sure
terrorism suspects are not set free. This is part of an overall
U.S. proposal for phased Israeli pullbacks linked to anti-terrorism
efforts by the Palestinians.
	   The U.S. strategy, at least for now, was to push for a full
agreement and not sign off on the approach Israel evidently favors
of ``locking in'' the issues resolved and declaring them settled.
	   On the fourth day of talks, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
rode separate helicopters to the Wye Plantations hideaway on
Maryland's Eastern Shore to work with Netanyahu and Arafat to break
the impasse.
	   Clinton conferred with Albright and other senior advisers for 40
minutes, then had lunch with Netanyahu. The Palestinian leader and
Netanyahu have not met face-to-face since Friday, and there has
been no three-way meeting, which would signal progress.
	   ``There is time to complete the work if the political will is
there to make the tough decisions,'' Rubin said.
	   While diplomatic sources said the likely result of the summit
was a partial agreement, Rubin said, ``We have no plan to defer
issues for many weeks.''
	   He also cautioned that without an accord ``there are serious
dangers ahead for the people of the Middle East,''
	   The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis.
Diplomatic sources said completing a final deal could take weeks or
longer.
	   Palestinian sources told The Associated Press the talks ``have
become very difficult,'' particularly on whether another Israeli
pullback on the West Bank would follow the one being negotiated and
on Israel's demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to Israel
for trial.
	   However, the sources, insisting on anonymity, said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Danny Naveh,
the Israeli Cabinet secretary, were working on drafts of other
provisions.
	   Also, the sources said, CIA director George Tenet had a long
meeting Saturday with Muhammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security
chief, and their ideas would be presented to the Israelis.
	   Rubin denied an Israeli army radio report that Clinton had
warned the Israelis he would support a Palestinian state if no West
Bank agreement was reached. He said that did not ``resemble any
account that I've heard at the Wye talks, and I find it difficult
to imagine.''
	   Netanyahu also denied any such pressure had been applied.
	   ``The reports are baseless, and that option was never discussed
in conversations with the prime minister and his delegation at Wye
Plantation,'' Netanyahu's office said in Jerusalem.
	   At stake was a long-sought accord that would give the
Palestinians control over more land on which they hope to establish
a state.
	   Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish another 13 percent but only
if Arafat takes stronger action against terrorists.

Yanks offense wakes up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Yankees offense is performing to the nines.
	   As in nine runs a game _ the output they have produced in each
of the last three games.
	   After an offensive slumber that saw the most prolific scoring
team in baseball muster just 27 runs in the first eight games of
the playoffs, New York has managed to come up with that same total
in the last three games.
	   ``It's nice to be able to pick up the pitchers,'' said Chuck
Knoblauch, who set the tone by drawing an eight-pitch walk to lead
off the game, stealing second, and scoring on Ken Caminiti's
throwing error.
	   ``They have been carrying us the last two weeks. It's nice to
finally give them some breathing room.''
	   New York's offensive resurgence has been keyed by quick starts.
The Yankees have scored 29 of their 54 runs this postseason in the
first three innings. They had seven runs off Andy Ashby by the end
of the third in Game 2.
	   New York has outscored the opposition 15-2 in the first inning
and has scored in the first inning in 10 of its 11 games.
	   ``Scoring early means a lot to the club,'' hitting coach Chris
Chambliss said. ``It takes the pressure off and gives everybody
confidence.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BERNIE'S FUTURE: Yankees general manager Brian Cashman's first
order of business this offseason will be trying to keep center
fielder Bernie Williams in New York.
	   Williams, the AL batting champion and MVP of the 1996 ALCS, has
avoided discussing his impending free agency.
	   ``We'll try to address it as soon as the season is over and try
to find out where he stands, where we stand,'' Cashman said before
Game 2 Sunday night. ``And hopefully the comfort levels will match
and we'll have a continuing, long-lasting relationship.''
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, has fought with Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner each winter over contracts, and the sides
didn't get anywhere last year when they discussed a multiyear deal.
	   It's unclear if Williams will give the Yankees preference in
talks once he is free to deal with any team. If Williams leaves,
New York might target Ray Lankford, who played for Joe Torre in St.
Louis.
	   ``That's why it's a juggling act,'' Cashman said. ``It's all
just part of a puzzle. And obviously, his piece is going to be a
lot bigger than everybody else's.''
	   In what the Yankees hope wasn't a sign of the future, public
address announcer Bob Sheppard skipped over Williams' name in
Saturday's lineup announcement.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IN A PINCH: The Padres' three pinch-hits in the eighth inning
tied a World Series record set by Oakland in 1972.
	   Ruben Rivera doubled and Carlos Hernandez singled off Mike
Stanton. After Stanton threw ball one to Chris Gomez, Joe Torre
brought in Jeff Nelson.
	   Bruce Bochy responded by sending in Mike Sweeney, who hit an RBI
single to tie the record.
	   Jim Leyritz earlier struck out that inning as San Diego also
tied the record for most pinch-hitters used in an inning.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TOUGH LUCK: San Diego's Wally Joyner was robbed of hits in his
first two at-bats by sterling plays in the field.
	   With two on and two out in the first, Joyner hit a shot to deep
right that Paul O'Neill caught crashing into the wall to save two
runs.
	   By the time Joyner was robbed of a single on a diving stop by
Chuck Knoblauch in the fourth, New York led 7-0.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; VAUGHN'S REVENGE: Greg Vaughn's injured quadriceps forced him
into the designated hitter slot for San Diego in Game 2.
	   Vaughn, who did not start four games in the NLCS because of the
injury, was replaced in left field by John Vander Wal.
	   ``His quad was bothering him just a little bit yesterday,''
manager Bruce Bochy said. ``This allows us to keep him off his legs
a little bit and with the day off tomorrow, hopefully this thing
will clear up.''
	   Bochy wanted to make sure Vaughn's bat would be in the lineup,
after hitting 50 homers in the regular season and two in Game 1.
	   The two shots off David Wells were especially sweet for the
Padres, who traded Vaughn to the Yankees last July only to have it
voided by George Steinbrenner because of Vaughn's injured shoulder.
	   ``Sometimes the trade that is never made is the best one,''
Bochy said. ``That is how we feel about this. We are lucky the
trade didn't happen.''
	   For his part, Vaughn holds no ill will toward the Yankees and
says he is not trying to prove a point against them.
	   ``It's not about Greg Vaughn trying to get revenge on the
Yankees for what happened last year,'' Vaughn said. ``It's about
the San Diego Padres and New York Yankees playing in the World
Series to see who can get that ring.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SHAGGING FLIES: With the series shifting to San Diego on
Tuesday, Yankees designated hitter Chili Davis has started shagging
flies and taking grounders.
	   Joe Torre said Davis could replace Tino Martinez at first base
in a double switch but would more likely see time in left if he
plays the field for the first time this season.
	   ``He has been working in the outfield and that is not out of the
realm of possibility that he is liable to play in left field,''
Torre said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ODDS AND ENDS: One night after Sammy Sosa threw out the first
pitch, Roger Maris' six children did the honor. Kevin, Randy,
Richard, Roger Jr., Sandra and Susan got a standing ovation from
the crowd at the stadium where their father broke Babe Ruth's
season home run record in 1961. ... San Diego starters have an
11.17 ERA in seven World Series games. ... The Yankees have won six
consecutive World Series games, the second longest active streak.
Cincinnati has won nine straight since losing to Boston in the
sixth game of the 1975 Series. San Diego has now lost five
straight, tying the Giants for the longest active streak.

sted third. Picks up 24th graf pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wonder no more why these New York Yankees are so
special.
	   From the very first inning, El Duque and Co. demonstrated for
all _ particularly the Padres _ how they've won 123 games and
staked their claim as the greatest team in baseball history.
	   Orlando Hernandez dominated on the mound, Bernie Williams and
Jorge Posada homered to lead a relentless attack and Yankees
fielding sparkled Sunday night in a 9-3 romp over San Diego for a
2-0 lead in the World Series.
	   ``This is just the way we play,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``We're just a confident club. The fact that we've won so
many times this season gives you the confidence to expect to win.''
	   After winning Game 1 by playing home-run derby, the Yankees
showed off their whole potent package in Game 2. The Padres never
had a chance, with rookie Ricky Ledee's RBI single making it 7-0 in
the third and chasing Andy Ashby, one of several San Diego pitchers
fighting a flu bug.
	   ``I'm glad it's a best-of-7 right now,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said. ``We were at least hoping to win a ballgame here.''
	   Hernandez made sure that didn't happen. The Cuban defector who
floated to freedom less than 10 months ago and helped save New
York's season with a win in Game 4 of the AL championship series
was in complete control.
	   Exactly a year after his younger half-brother, Livan Hernandez,
pitched Florida past Cleveland in Game 1 on his way to becoming MVP
of the World Series, the quirky El Duque shut down San Diego on one
run in seven innings.
	   ``We spoke over the phone today and he spoke to me a little
about how to pitch to this team,'' Hernandez said through an
interpreter.
	   By the time Posada's two-run homer in the fifth made it 9-1, the
sellout crowd of 56,692 was going crazy while several Padres
players were standing with heads down and hands on hips.
	   The Padres face a tough task in trying to regroup for Game 3 on
Tuesday night in San Diego. David Cone will start for New York
against NLCS MVP Sterling Hitchcock, a former Yankees pitcher _ of
the previous 44 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the Series, 33 have won
the championship.
	   On top of that, Hitchcock, Ashby and Game 1 starter Kevin Brown
are all ill.
	   ``Somebody spread something around,'' Bochy said. ``It looks
like it hit the pitchers more than anybody else. Brownie has a
touch of the flu. The timing is terrible.''
	   At this rate, this might have been the last game at Yankee
Stadium of the year. Yet the Yankees know how quickly fortunes can
change _ wiped out at home by Atlanta in the first two games of the
1996 Series, they came back to win four in a row for their record
23rd title.
	   ``We would love to win it in front of our fans, but we just want
to get it over with as soon as possible,'' New York shortstop Derek
Jeter said.
	   San Diego's best opportunity came in the first. Tony Gwynn got
his fourth hit of the series and Greg Vaughn walked, but right
fielder Paul O'Neill made a leaping catch as he crashed into the
wall on Wally Joyner's drive for the final out.
	   From then on, it was all Yankees. Williams hit his ninth career
postseason homer and No. 9 batter Ledee, a rookie playing with
exceptional poise, enjoyed his second straight night of getting two
hits and a walk.
	   Actually, Ashby could have had a 1-2-3 bottom of the first with
any luck. But on a night when he had a sore throat, he got no help.
	   Chuck Knoblauch's foul pop was dropped near the screen by
sliding catcher Greg Myers _ it was correctly ruled no play _ and
then the leadoff man exemplified the Yankees' patience at the
plate, drawing an eight-pitch walk.
	   Knoblauch stole second and one out later, O'Neill slapped a
grounder at three-time Gold Glove third baseman Ken Caminiti.
Despite having plenty of time, Caminiti rushed his throw and it was
too high for Joyner, an error that enabled Knoblauch to score.
	   Chili Davis and Scott Brosius added RBI singles and even though
all three runs were unearned, they counted. The Padres even looked
shaky getting the last out of the inning, when second baseman
Quilvio Veras dropped Posada's line drive and made a poor throw
barely in time.
	   ``We've been stressing trying to win the game in the first
inning _ trying to give our pitchers something to work with,''
Knoblauch said.
	   Williams' two-run homer highlighted a three-run second. Tino
Martinez and Brosius, who each had three of the Yankees' 16 hits,
singled to set up Ledee's RBI single in the third.
	   That was, 24th graf pvs

Halligan boosts Kiwis for Britain tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Kiwi rugby league star Daryl
Halligan has changed his mind and decided to join New Zealand on
its tour to Britain later this month.
	   The Canterbury goalkicking ace said he was unlikely to go on the
tour after replacing injured Matthew Ridge for third test loss
against Australia on Friday.
	   But after discussing the matter with his wife, Halligan decided
to make himself available and was named Monday in the squad for the
three-test series.
	   ``We're just delighted to have him join us for the tour,'' Kiwi
coach Frank Endacott said Monday. ``I really didn't want us going
over there without a recognized goalkicker and having Daryl just
gives us that extra because we'll be up against a British side that
will have all their players available.''
	   Three rookies were named in the squad with junior Kiwis Ali
Lautiti, who made an enormous impact at the Auckland Warriors this
year, and Canberra winger Lesley Vainikolo joined by Illawarra-St
George forward Craig Smith.
	   The rest of the squad is predictable with Endacott retaining the
17 from last Friday night's test plus Nigel Vagana, who missed out
on the interchange bench.
	   Wigan's Henry Paul, who missed the tests against Australia
because of the British Super League playoffs, will join the Kiwis
after the final against Leeds.
	   Auckland Warriors prop Quentin Pongia will captain the side
after Ridge announced his international retirement.
	   ``I think it is an exciting team with a good balance of
experience and a lot of excellent young talent,'' Endacott said.
	   ``It sets us up well for the future with young guys in the
forwards like Tony Puletua who is only 19, Nathan Cayless who is
20, Ali Lautiti and Lesley Vainikolo who are just as young, as well
as Craig Smith who finally gets his chance.''
	   The Kiwis will leave Friday.
	   Squad: Richie Barnett (Sydney City), Sean Hoppe (Auckland),
Lesley Vainikolo (Canberra), Kevin Iro (St Helens), Nigel Vagana
(Auckland), Ruben Wiki (Canberra), Daryl Halligan
(Canterbury-Bankstown), Robbie Paul (Bradford), Gene Ngamu
(Auckland), Stacey Jones (Auckland), Logan Swann (Auckland),
Stephen Kearney (Auckland), Jarrod McCracken (Parramatta), Nathan
Cayless (Parramatta), Tony Iro (Adelaide), Craig Smith (St
George-Illawarra), Tony Puletua (Penrith), Ali Lautiti (Auckland),
Quentin Pongia (Auckland, captain), Joe Vagana (Auckland), Syd Eru
(Auckland), Henry Paul (Wigan).

Source: Vietnam Central Committee sets growth target for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Communist Party Central Committee has
set Vietnam's economic growth target for 1999 at 5 percent to 6
percent, a government source said Monday.
	   The figure, which is expected to be approved by the National
Assembly at a month-long session that starts Oct. 28, was
established at a Central Committee plenum that ended Saturday.
	   The 1998 target originally was 9 percent, but the figure was
downgraded in July to between 6 percent and 7 percent as the impact
of the Asian economic crisis hit the country increasingly hard.
Government figures say growth has been 6 percent so far this year.
	   In addition, the government has said the growth target is only a
goal, not a figure that must be achieved, as was the case before
Vietnam began switching from a central command economy to a market
economy a decade ago.
	   Some economists have said the growth figures have been inflated
and the 1999 target is believed to be optimistic. Unemployment has
been rising, and growth in both exports and foreign investment has
slowed dramatically.
	   Fearing higher costs of dollar-denominated debts and needed
imports, the government has taken a cautious approach in dealing
with the regional economic crisis.
	   It has kept inflation largely in check by allowing small
periodic devaluations of the dong instead of the heavy plunges that
other countries' currencies suffered. But that also has made its
exports relatively more expensive.

Two death sentences issued for Vietnam drug traffickers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Hanoi court has sentenced two convicted
drug traffickers to death and two associates to life in prison,
local press reports said Monday.
	   All four men, who had been charged with dealing in 360 grams
(12.7 ounces) of heroin, have 15 days to appeal.
	   In July 1997, Vietnam's legislature toughened penalties on drug
trafficking: trafficking in or possessing one kilogram (2.2 pounds)
of opium or 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of heroin is punishable by death
or life imprisonment.
	   Despite the government's intensified effort to fight drugs,
abuse is on the rise and spreading to schools. Official statistics
say Vietnam has 134,000 drug addicts, with 70 percent under age 30.
	   The Labor newspaper reported Monday that drug rehabilitation
facilities in Hanoi over the past five months have provided
treatment for 756 drug addicts, including 31 government employees.

Hurricane Lester turns out to sea, Madeline churns toward coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Madeline was centered near latitude 21.3 north, longitude
106.5 west. Lester was centered near latitude 14.3 north, longitude
99.7 west. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG BULL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAZATLAN, Mexico (AP) _ Officials warned residents on Mexico's
western Pacific coast to prepare for Hurricane Madeline after the
storm changed course and headed for this resort city.
	   Hurricane Lester, which had threatened the southern Pacific
coast in Oaxaca and Guerrero states, also took a turn, heading
westward on a path that could take it out to sea. Hurricane
warnings were discontinued from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, but ships
were advised to stay in port.
	   The first to feel Madeline's wrath was expected to be prisoners
at a penal colony on the Maria Madre island, about 100 miles south
of Mazatlan. The hurricane was expected to pass over that and two
other islands.
	   Madeline, with 85 mph (135 kph) winds, was located about 35
miles (55 kilometers) south of the islands Sunday night and was
moving north at 3 mph (5 kph). The storm originally had been
heading toward landfall further south of Mazatlan.
	   A spokeswoman for the Interior Secretariat, which oversees
prisons and domestic security, said she had no information on how
many prisoners were on the island or what precautions had been
taken in advance of the storm.
	   A hurricane warning was in effect for a stretch of the Pacific
coast from Mazatlan, 530 miles (850 kilometers) northwest of Mexico
City, to an area south of Puerto Vallarta.
	   Just south of Mazatlan, authorities of neighboring Nayarit state
went house to house in coastal communities to warn people about the
hurricane and army troops prepared to aid residents, the government
news agency Notimex reported.
	   Hurricane Lester was 180 miles (290 kilometers) south of the
resort city of Acapulco, moving west near 8 mph (13 kph), according
to the National Weather Service in Miami. But it warned that a
northward deviation from its course could bring Lester, with its
105 mph (170 kph) winds closer to the coast.
	   In Acapulco, where more than 150 people died a year ago when
Hurricane Pauline swept the city, authorities evacuated 125 people
living in low-lying areas.
	   ``Even though there hasn't been any rain yet, we don't want the
hurricane to take us by surprise,'' said Melquiades Olmedo,
Acapulco civil defense director.
	   The weather service said Lester could gather strength over the
next day and cause heavy rains, flash flooding and mud slides along
the coast.

goals for the Bruins, who improved their lifetime record against
the Sharks to 9-1-3 with a 53-33 scoring advantage in those games.
	   Tallas, starting in place of regular goaltender Byron Dafoe,

Another 5,000 policemen to patrol violent Karachi streets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Another 5,000 policemen will be
deployed on the streets of Karachi in an attempt to quell the
relentless bloodletting among ethnic rivals, officials said Monday.
	   The police force is currently about 27,000 strong, assisted by
another 15,000 paramilitary Rangers.
	   Karachi, a city of 14 million people, is wracked by relentless
killings often involving rival groups of an ethnic party known as
the Muttahed Qami Movement.
	   The movement, which represents Indian Muslims who settled in
Pakistan at the end of British colonial rule in 1947, split into
rival groups several years ago and they routinely clash for control
of the city.
	   During the weekend Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited Karachi
and vowed to put an end to the killings that have terrorized entire
neighborhoods. It was after Sharif's trip to Karachi that the
provincial government decided to increase its police force, said
the officials, who asked not to be identified.
	   ``Anti-state elements have their own agenda and they want to
push the country toward destruction,'' the independent newspaper
The News quoted Sharif as saying. The prime minister, however, did
not identify the ``anti-state elements''.
	   Pakistan's largest city, Karachi is the nation's financial and
commercial hub and generates about 70 percent of the government's
revenue.
	   However, ethnic related disturbances routinely interrupt
business, which economists estimate has cost the national exchequer
billions of rupees (dollars).
	   On Saturday a former governor of southern Sindh, of which
Karachi is the capital, Hakim Said was gunned down outside his
office by masked men who escaped.
	   His death galvanized the city and generated rallies and protest
demonstrations throughout the country on Sunday.
	   On Sunday in the eastern Punjab capital of Lahore scores of
people held a memorial service for Said as well as for a militant
religious leader, Maulana Mohammed Abdullah who was killed in the
federal capital of Islamabad also on Saturday.
	   The small, but powerful religious group, Jamaat-e-Islami called
for the government to step down saying Pakistani lawmakers had
failed to stop crime.
	   ``The law of the jungle is the law of the land today,'' Jamaat
leader Hafiz Idrees was quoted as saying.
	   More than 600 people have been killed in ethnic related violence
in Karachi so far this year. Religiously motivated violence between
rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim militants also has left hundreds of
people dead in Pakistan, most of them in the eastern Punjab
province.

U.N. says Cambodia losing momentum in fight against poverty
</HEADLINE>

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Continuing political instability is
eroding gains made in the battle against poverty in Cambodia, the
U.N. Development Program warned Monday.
	   ``The momentum achieved in the fight against poverty _ surely
the only legitimate fight in today's Cambodia _ is being lost,''
said UNDP chief representative Paul Matthews.
	   Noting that significant progress had been made to develop
Cambodia since a 1993 election ended decades of civil war, Matthews
called on the country's bickering political parties to work
together to reduce poverty and protect the environment.
	   ``Whatever the divergence in rhetoric, the manifestos of the
main political parties all pledge to reduce poverty and to preserve
the environment,'' he told a conference observing the International
Day for the Eradication of Poverty.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party
opposition are locked in a tense stalemate over the formation of a
new government following July's disputed election.
	   Hun Sen's party won a majority of seats in parliament, but not
the two-thirds needed to form a government alone.
	   The opposition, claiming Hun Sen's victory was achieved through
fraud and intimidation, refuses to cooperate until its allegations
are thoroughly investigated.
	   Matthews said the instability was having a negative impression
on major aid donors.
	   Many donors halted aid after Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup d'etat last
year.
	   The political crisis that followed, along with the Southeast
Asian economic crisis, are making Cambodia's attempts to alleviate
widespread poverty more difficult, he said.
	   Cambodia ranks 140 out of 174 countries measured by the UNDP's
human development index _ a calculation including gross national
product per capita, life expectancy and literacy _ making it one of
the world's poorest countries.
	   During the poverty day observance, the UNDP released its annual
human development report for Cambodia. This year's report focused
on the plight of women in the country.
	   Cambodian women play a larger role in the work force than in any
other Southeast Asian country, but face severe wage discrimination
and are poorly represented in the higher levels of administration
and politics, the report noted.
	   Shortcomings in Cambodia's health services have had a drastic
impact on women, according to the report. The country has the
highest maternal mortality rate in the Asia-Pacific region, with
473 mothers dying for every 100,000 live births.
	   Acting Minister of Planning Soy Sem pledged at the conference to
recommend programs that will target women in Cambodia's five-year
socioeconomic development plan.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Rescue teams ended their search for
survivors Monday with the hoisting of the last car of a train that
jumped its tracks and crashed into a north Egyptian town, killing
about 50 citizens.
	   The train injured 101 people when it derailed in Kafr el-Dawar,
about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of the port of
Alexandria, at 5:10 p.m. local time (1510 GMT) on Sunday, said
Nabih Yousef Shaltout, the head of health care in the local
province of Buheira.
	   Five mangled bodies were found beneath the last three carriages
to be hoisted by a mobile crane. With the 47 fatalities reported by
Shaltout earlier, the death toll reached 52, but this was not
confirmed officially.
	   Residents of Kafr el-Dawar cast doubt on reports of some 50
dead. Those who helped transport the casualties to hospitals said
they had seen well over that number.
	   Residents also accused the authorities of neglect.
	   ``No one came until 8:15,'' said Khaled Mohammed Lotfi.
``Everyone you see working here is a local man. We asked them to
call the defense ministry to bring in soldiers to help, but they
called us crazy.''
	   Shaltout said most of the dead were bystanders in the town,
while most of the injured were passengers on the train.
	   The train, which was traveling south from Alexandria, left the
rails when the driver changed tracks ``at high speed,'' the
Interior Ministry said in a statement.
	   A teenager who saw the crash, Hany Roushdy, said the train was
moving very fast.
	   ``It did not seem to able to stop. It shot off the tracks and
went towards the town square,'' he said.
	   The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, hit a war
memorial in the square and slammed into seven shops, witnesses
said.
	   When the train hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,''
said Roushdy, 18.
	   A businessman in the square, Mustafa Attiya, said he heard girls
screaming. ``I turned around and saw the train shoot across and hit
the girls.''
	   The train snared the leg of a fruit vendor. Taxi driver Saeid
Saleh said the merchant was screaming ``Help me! Help me!''
	   People did manage to free him, but he emerged with blood gushing
from his leg, Saleh said.
	   A crane was brought in to hoist the locomotive and the first two
passenger cars, which had overturned.
	   As hundreds of townsfolk tried to break through a cordon of riot
police armed with shields and bamboo canes, other citizens
responded to calls for blood and other things.
	   Residents donated 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of blood in the
first few hours after the crash, Shaltout said.
	   ``Police asked me to buy 45 coffins and shrouds for the dead,''
said Ahmed Mohammed Abdallah, an inhabitant of Kafr el-Dawar.
	   Some people tore their clothes into bandages to staunch the
bleeding of the wounded, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   But there were angry scenes outside the local hospital where
police armed with automatic rifles kept relatives at bay.
	   ``I just want to ask about my family,'' yelled one man at an
officer.
	   ``Don't drive me crazy. I have my orders not to let anyone in,''
the officer shouted back.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   It is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and
between the carriages of such commuter trains.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995 when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

Bills knock Jaguars from unbeaten ranks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, UPDATES with late games, no pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ Doug Flutie's 1-yard bootleg
touchdown run with 13 seconds left gave Buffalo a 17-16 victory
over previously unbeaten Jacksonville on Sunday.
	   Flutie, who made his first NFL start in more than nine years,
made the plays when it counted despite completing less than half of
his passes.
	   Trailing 16-10, the Bills (3-3) took possession with less than
two minutes left. Flutie found Thurman Thomas for a pair of short
passes before hitting Eric Moulds with a 38-yarder.
	   It appeared Moulds had scored for the second time in the game,
but the ball was marked at the 1. On a fourth-and-1, Flutie
bootlegged untouched into the end zone to hand the Jaguars their
first loss in six games. Steve Christie's extra point made it
17-16.
 &UR; Falcons 31, Saints 23 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, the Falcons improved to 5-1 for the second time in
franchise history and proved they can win without Chris Chandler.
	   Healthy through the first five games, Chandler was knocked out
late in the first half with bruised ribs and a sprained left
shoulder. But the Falcons went on to beat New Orleans with
44-year-old Steve DeBerg at quarterback.
	   The Atlanta defense stifled the Saints over the final two
quarters and even scored a touchdown on Eugene Robinson's 25-yard
interception return with 10:37 remaining, sending New Orleans to
its third straight loss after a 3-0 start.
 &UR; Oilers 44, Bengals 14 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, the Oilers, who lost their first two
games in Nashville, scored on their first six possessions in
routing Cincinnati.
	   Steve McNair, with his two starting receivers out with injuries
and bandaged from wrist to elbow, ran for a touchdown and threw for
another.
	   Al Del Greco kicked three field goals and backup running back
Mike Archie even got into the action with an 18-yard TD toss in the
Oilers' best offensive performance this season.
	   The Bengals (2-4) couldn't get anything going behind Neil
O'Donnell and Carl Pickens.
 &UR; Bucs 16, Panthers 13 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Tampa Bay rallied from a 10-point,
fourth-quarter deficit to beat winless Carolina on Trent Dilfer's
29-yard touchdown pass to Karl Williams with 1:39 remaining.
	   Steve Beuerlein, making his second start since Kerry Collins was
demoted to third-string quarterback and subsequently released,
marched Carolina into position for a 47-yard field-goal attempt.
But John Kasay's kick sailed wide left with five seconds left.
	   The victory evened Tampa Bay's record at 3-3. The Panthers (0-6)
lost their eighth straight game dating back to last season.
 &UR; Vikings 41, Redskins 7 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Randall Cunningham threw two touchdown passes
and Leroy Hoard ran for two as Minnesota scored 41 consecutive
points against reeling Washington.
	   The Vikings (6-0), off to their best start since 1975, sacked
Gus Frerotte five times. That helped make up for an inconsistent
day by the offense as the Vikings remained the only unbeaten team
in the NFC.
	   With Frerotte misfiring all afternoon in his first start since
Week 1, the Redskins (0-7) managed only 177 yards and nine first
downs as they continued their worst start since the 1961 team lost
its first nine games.
	   Frerotte was 10-for-26 for 117 yards and an interception.
 &UR; Giants 34, Cardinals 7 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Danny Kanell passed for a
career-high 259 yards and three touchdowns, and New York's
under-fire offense gained a season-high 390 yards against Arizona.
	   As usual, the defense also contributed as the Giants (3-4) ended
a two-game losing streak and handed the Cardinals (3-4) their 14th
loss in the last 15 games at Giants Stadium.
	   Defensive tackle Robert Harris got 2 1/2 of New York's eight
sacks, which matched its season high, and the Giants limited
Arizona to 194 yards.
 &UR; Steelers 16, Ravens 6 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, the Steelers barely moved the ball as Jerome
Bettis sat out with an injury and Kordell Stewart stayed in his
season-long slump, but Baltimore's offense was even worse.
	   It was a pattern the Steelers (4-2) have followed all season _
score just enough points to give one of the NFL's best defenses a
chance to win. The Steelers, the league's second lowest-scoring
team, have only 66 points in their four victories and have scored
no more than 20 points in any win.
	   The Ravens (2-4), who led 6-3 at the half failed to score a
touchdown for the second straight week; they lost 12-8 to Tennessee
last week.
 &UR; 49ers 34, Colts 31 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Steve Young passed for two touchdowns and
scored on fourth-quarter runs of 1 and 23 yards as San Francisco
rallied from a 21-0 deficit against upset-minded Indianapolis.
	   Young also led the 50-yard drive ending in Wade Richey's 24-yard
field goal with five seconds remaining, giving the 49ers (5-1)
their only lead of the day over the Colts (1-6).
	   Peyton Manning, the top pick in the draft who came in with a
league-high 14 interceptions, tied a Colts rookie record with three
touchdown passes, connecting with Marvin Harrison on scores of 61,
6 and 4 yards. He finished 18-of-30 for 231 yards.
	   But Young, who also set an NFL record by throwing for more than
300 yards in a sixth straight game, was a little bit better.
 &UR; Chicago 13, Dallas 12 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Jeff Jaeger kicked two fourth-quarter field goals,
including the winning 29-yarder with 11 seconds left for Chicago
over Dallas.
	   It was Chicago's second victory in a row over the Cowboys (4-3)
at Soldier Field.
	   Trailing 12-10 with 5:10 left, the Bears (2-5) got the ball back
at their own 20. Erik Kramer found rookie tight end Alonzo Mayes
for 22- and 19-yard catches, moving Chicago to the Dallas 29. After
a series of short runs by Edgar Bennett got the Bears to the 11,
Jaeger kicked the winning field goal.
 &UR; Dolphins 14, Rams 0 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Miami pitched its second consecutive home shutout and
Dan Marino threw two touchdown passes against St. Louis.
	   The Dolphins (4-2), who blanked Pittsburgh 21-0 at home Sept.
20, haven't given up a point at Pro Player Stadium in 10
consecutive quarters. Miami has allowed just 70 points this season,
fewest in the NFL.
	   The Rams (2-4) totaled just 204 yards, punted eight times and
were shut out for the first time since San Francisco beat them 34-0
in the second game of 1996.
	   Marino's 1-yard touchdown pass to Oronde Gadsden with six
seconds left in the first half broke a scoreless tie. Rookie John
Avery added his first NFL touchdown on a 19-yard pass from Marino
with 10 minutes to go.
 &UR; Chargers 13, Eagles 10 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, the San Diego defense covered for a sluggish
offense and made June Jones a winner in his coaching debut for the
Chargers.
	   San Diego (3-4) ended a four-game slide with the victory over
the Eagles (1-6), who have won just once in their last 10 games
dating back to last year and haven't won on the road since 1996.
	   Jones, named the Chargers' interim coach when Kevin Gilbride was
fired five days earlier, looked on as John Carney kicked his second
field goal of the game, a 26-yarder with 7:18 remaining, to snap a
10-10 tie.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Rescuers retrieved five bodies
Monday from the choppy seas off Malaysia's western coast and said
10 other people were still missing after a passenger boat capsized,
the national news agency reported.
	   Sixteen others on the boat, which was carrying mostly workers
from a holiday resort on Pulau Besar island to the mainland, swam
to safety when the vessel sank around midnight Sunday, Bernama news
agency said.
	   The area is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the capital,
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Of the bodies recovered, two were of men and three of women.
Police identified two as being those of Hazimah Harun and Suraya,
both employees at the Bandar Nusa Island Resort in Pulau Besar. The
other three were yet to be identified, police said.
	   Divers from the police and fire department were trying to locate
the capsized boat. They feared passengers may be trapped inside it.
	   Among the missing were nine men, including the captain of the
boat, and six women, Bernama reported.
	   The cause of the disaster was not immediately known, but the
boat reportedly sank in rough seas.

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton made an
exceptional effort to unsnarl Middle East peace negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians. He worked into the early
morning hours Monday on a land-for-peace deal that was stalled over
security and other key issues.
	   Still, there was no sign of a breakthrough as the president
boarded his helicopter to return to Washington close to 1:30 a.m
Monday.
	   The parties' differences over security and other key issues were
resisting American prodding at the highest levels, and Clinton was
expected to return later Monday for more talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   After seeing Arafat twice and Netanyahu once, the president had
a midnight meeting with Ariel Sharon _ at the hard-line Israeli
foreign minister's request _ which ran past 1 a.m.

Malaysian leader to Africa: Asian way still a good strategy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The strategies used to propel Asia to economic
prosperity are still valid despite the region's plummet into
financial crisis, Malaysia's leader told a conference on African
development Monday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the Second Tokyo
International Conference on African Development that African
countries could benefit from studying East Asian economies.
	   ``Adopting the Asian approach and the Asian way towards
development is still a good strategy,'' Mahathir told the
conference, which gathered representatives from 82 countries and 40
organizations.
	   Mahathir, whose own country is facing mounting economic
problems, blamed the region's turmoil on out-of-control capitalism
rather than structural defects in the countries' economies.
	   ``Currency trading and raids in the stock market are not the
fault of Asians or their ways or their value system,'' said
Mahathir. ``Any country subject to such destructive attacks will
fail.''
	   Mahathir is on a five-day trip to Japan to meet with business
leaders and bankers _ his first trip abroad since a political
crisis erupted over his ouster and arrest of his former protege,
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The Malaysian leader, in power for 17 years, has blamed
international currency traders and market players for the demise of
Asian economies rather than the domestic mismanagement or
corruption that others have pointed to.
	   Mahathir said that despite the region's problems, it should get
more involved in helping Africa develop.
	   ``It is timely that the Asian countries like Japan and to a
lesser extent Malaysia and others should stretch out a helping
hand,'' he told the conference.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Rescue teams Monday ended their search for
survivors of a train wreck in northern Egypt that killed about 52
people.
	   At least 100 people were injured when a train derailed in Kafr

Sunday afternoon, said Nabih Yousef Shaltout, the medical director

Russian soldier released from Chechen captivity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian soldier captured this summer and taken
to the breakaway republic of Chechnya has been released in an
exchange for a Chechen convict in Russia, a news report said
Monday.
	   Capt. Medzhid Kurbanov was handed over to Russian officials
Sunday in Dagestan, which borders Chechnya. He was in such poor
condition after two months in captivity that he had difficulty
recognizing his own father, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   There were no details about the Chechen convict who was
released.
	   Kidnappers have taken hundreds of people hostage in Chechnya and
surrounding areas, usually for ransom, since the region's two-year
war for independence from Russia ended in 1996. Chechnya runs its
own affairs, but Moscow still considers it part of Russia.

Taiwan affirms talks with China, but remains wary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Taiwanese envoy's path-breaking visit to
China held out hope for improved relations between the
long-estranged rivals, but uncertainties remain and some analysts
said Monday they see few signs of lessening confrontation.
	   Amid sometimes pointed discussions, the two sides failed to
bridge wide differences that led to a three-year freeze in
relations, although they agreed to keep talking.
	   ``Such frank exchanges of opinions are something to be
affirmed,'' Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of Taiwan's government
Mainland Affairs Council, said Monday after Taiwan's chief envoy,
Koo Chen-fu, wrapped up his five-day trip to China.
	   But Sheu noted at a news conference that China did not make any
adjustments to its claim that Taiwan is a part of China with no
right to sovereignty.
	   Koo argued during meetings with his Chinese counterpart, Wang
Daohan, that Taiwan is a sovereign state and will accept no other
status. Koo cited the 1945 Potsdam pact that handed the island to
the Republic of China, the official name Taiwan has adopted, from
its former colonial ruler, Japan.
	   Speaking to the Chinese leaders in Beijing as well as to a home
TV audience that has been wary of the talks, Koo said at the end of
his trip on Sunday that reunification must wait until China has
democracy. Koo said before leaving the Chinese capital that he
dared not hope that the trip would soon break the ice between
Taiwan and China, but he hoped that a thaw could eventually begin.
	   Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the mainland to Mao
Tse-tung's communist forces after a civil war in 1949, and took
refuge on the island.
	   Both sides claimed for years to be the legitimate government for
all of China, but rulers of mainland China fear Taiwan is
abandoning its old doctrine of reunifying with the motherland after
becoming a full-fledged democracy in recent years.
	   Taiwanese newspapers hailed Koo's visit as a first step to
improving ties, but they remained wary about how to proceed.
	   ``The impact of the mainland trip has yet to be assessed, but
the interactions during these five days will no doubt be an
important chapter in history,'' the China Times said in an
editorial.
	   The newspaper, one of Taiwan's two largest dailies, called for
both sides to further negotiate a plan ``that takes into
consideration both history and reality'' so they can resolve the
sovereignty dispute.
	   The rival United Daily News urged Taiwanese to watch for Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming trip to Japan, to see whether
he would seek Japan's support to further back its claim to Taiwan.
	   Political scientist Kuo Cheng-liang, who traveled with the
Taiwanese delegation to Beijing, called the trip a setback for
Taiwan, which had hoped to coax Chinese leaders into accepting the
``new thinking'' of accepting Taiwan as its equal.
	   ``With the abortion of the new thinking,'' Kuo wrote in the
China Times, ``political dialogue has virtually broken off and the
two sides shall go back to their former diplomatic wrestling.''
	   Many Taiwanese are withholding judgment on the talks for now.
But some were antagonized by the televised comments from Chinese
officials restating China's claim over Taiwan.
	   ``Those comments really made me angry,'' said Mary Chiu, an
office worker. ``You have no choice but to deal with your neighbor.
But if he continues to be so domineering, do you still want to make
friends with him?''

Thai villager who lost land hangs himself near Government House
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A 62-year-old Thai villager who said
bureaucrats stole his land, hanged himself outside the government's
executive office building Monday, police said.
	   Choom Sakhorn, from the province of Sisaket, 430 kilometers (267
miles) northeast of Bangkok, hanged himself from a tree across the
street from Government House, where Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
and his Cabinet conduct state business, at about 3 a.m.
	   Choom had traveled to Bangkok several times during the past year
to petition the Land Department to regain his land. He said local
Land Department officials had conspired with businessmen to cheat
him out of the holding, which he valued at 370,000 baht (dlrs
9,736), police said.
	   The Land Department, part of the Interior Ministry, conducted an
internal investigation and concluded its officials had done nothing
wrong.
	   Academics, law enforcement officials and real estate consultants
have said land ownership titles are a major source of corruption
money in Thailand.
	   Several times during the past five years, tens of thousands of
farmers have protested outside Government House, chiefly over land
rights.
	   They have demanded compensation for land appropriated by the
government or businessmen, or else made worthless as a result of
development projects.

Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin craves freedom at home
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The small woman rose trembling from a
prayer mat and tearfully gazed at a steel-framed photo of her
daughter, the besieged author Taslima Nasrin.
	   ``I've prayed for her long life. Let Allah take care of my
daughter,'' Eid-ul-Ara Begum murmured.
	   Not far from her apartment in downtown Dhaka's Shantinagar _
which, ironically, means ``peaceful neighborhood'' _ dozens of
Islamic extremists were in the street demanding death for her
daughter.
	   ``Hang the infidel!'' the protesters shouted, even though the
blasphemy charges Nasrin faces for allegedly insulting the Koran
carry a penalty of only two years in jail.
	   Nasrin, a poet, essayist and novelist, fled her homeland four
years ago because of similar protests that erupted after a
newspaper quoted her as saying Islam's holy book should be
rewritten.
	   She said she was misquoted, but she stood her ground in arguing
that many women are abused in this predominantly Muslim country and
should have more rights.
	   Ending her self-exile in September, Nasrin came home to be with
her 60-year-old mother, who has colon cancer. She has had to remain
in hiding ever since.
	   ``I want my freedom back,'' Nasrin told The Associated Press in
a telephone interview from her hideout. ``This is my country and
I've every right to freely live here.''
	   She said she had had enough of living far from the Bangladeshi
readers she considers her main audience and the Bangladeshi
subjects closest to her heart. But she was not sure how long she
would be able to stay.
	   The extremist Muslims demanding her death are a tiny minority,
but they are promising to stage bigger and bigger protests to
embarrass the government and keep police busy.
	   Authorities fear a repeat of 1994, when thousands of
demonstrators disrupted the streets of Dhaka until then-Prime
Minister Khaleda Zia ordered Nasrin's arrest. The writer first went
into hiding, then surrendered to the High Court, which granted her
bail and permission to leave the country.
	   Now that she is back, Zia's successor, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, has shown little interest in pursuing the blasphemy case.
	   Nasrin, a physician-turned-author, has angered some Muslims with
blunt writing on the problems of women in Bangladesh. She relates
in graphic detail about the rape and harassment of women, and about
men who force their wives to have sex against their will.
	   ``To men, our women are nothing but a dress,'' Nasrin concludes
in one of her newspaper articles. ``They discard the women like
they do with an old dress.''
	   In her book ``Nirbachito Column,'' a compilation of newspaper
essays that first made her famous in Bangladesh, she tells of an
18-year-old woman who was beaten by her husband, a devout Muslim,
for refusing to have sex one night when she was sick.
	   Nasrin writes she was shocked when the man said it was a Muslim
woman's religious obligation to have sex with her husband no matter
when and how many times.
	   Such themes earned her a large number of admirers, especially
among young women.
	   ``She does have important things to say for our women, who are
abused every day, everywhere,'' said Nazneen Afroz, a high school
student. ``She has given a voice to the voiceless.''
	   Others say Bangladesh may not be ready for Nasrin.
	   ``She raises too many issues too early,'' said Ayesha Khanam, a
leader of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, the country's largest women's
rights group. ``Attacking Islam does not serve our purpose.''
	   Nonetheless, liberals in Bangladesh have denounced the
anti-Nasrin campaign and are urging the government, led by a
progressive-minded Muslim woman, to protect her.
	   The attacks on Nasrin come from nearly two dozen groups that
want women to stay at home most of the time and wear veils when
they do venture out.
	   Bangladesh is governed by a secular constitution promising equal
rights to women and men. But the government tries to balance its
ideals with the emotions of its citizens.
	   A 1993 Bangladeshi ban on Nasrin's novel, ``Lajja'' (``Shame''),
remains in place.
	   The novel criticized Muslims for attacking minority Hindus in
retaliation for the destruction of a mosque by Hindu zealots in
neighboring India in 1992. The government said the book might
incite Hindu-Muslim tensions.

Yeltsin cancels meetings Monday, still recovering from cold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin canceled meetings
with senior leaders Monday because he is still recovering from a
cold, a news report said.
	   The president is feeling the lingering effects of a respiratory
infection, but his health is ``satisfactory,'' said presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushin, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin had been scheduled to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Boris Pastukhov, the minister in charge of relations
with the former Soviet republics.
	   The president's latest illness forced him to cut short a visit
to Central Asia last week, and he spent most of the week at a
country residence outside Moscow. The president also has canceled a
trip to Malaysia for a summit next month.
	   According to Yeltsin's office, the president will return to work
in the Kremlin on Tuesday, where he will meet with Primakov and
other officials.
	   Yeltsin has been plagued by recurring health problems in recent
years. He had heart bypass surgery two years ago, and has made
fewer and fewer public appearances since then. Each new ailment
rekindles speculation about his fitness to govern.
	   The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious health
problems and will serve out the final two years of his term.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise in afternoon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, midafternoon dollar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the Japanese
yen Monday as worries about the American economy gained the upper
hand over those about Japan's. Tokyo stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 114.28 yen as of midafternoon, down 2.16 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of
115.25 yen late Friday.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 286.66
points, or 2.16 percent, to finish at 13,567.20 points. On Friday,
the key index closed up 285.17 points, or 2.19 percent.
	   One major reason behind the dollar's drop was technical, dealers
said. Market players who had been waiting to sell the dollar have
finally started to do so to guard against a further fall.
	   Heightened worries about the future of the American economy were
another factor, they said.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise move last week to cut two
key short-term interest rates was an attempt to encourage spending
and consumer confidence, but it had the effect of renewing worries
about the domestic economy.
	   Expectations the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again
helped weigh down the dollar. Lower interest rates tend to push a
nation's currency down.
	   ``Financial market confusion in the U.S. will likely continue
for some time,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign
exchange at ABN Amro Bank in Tokyo. ``As long as there is
instability, there will be dollar-selling pressure.''
	   Rising Tokyo share prices also helped boost the yen and push the
dollar lower.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 16.24 points, or 1.61 percent, to 1,022.92
points. The TOPIX closed up 26.57 points, or 2.71 percent, on
Friday.
	   ``It makes you think that, at last, Japan-selling is ending and
that Japan-buying is beginning,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign
exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   Stocks started higher following the passage of Japanese bank
reform legislation last Friday, which will make available a pool of
public funds of up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 524.9 billion) to
cash-strapped banks.
	   ``The market is also being helped up by the relative stability
of overseas markets,'' said Naoki Takahashi, manager at Marusan
Securities.
	   In New York Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.40
points to 8416.76.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.830 percent from Friday's finish of 0.865 percent,
driving its price up to 108.67 yen from 108.33 yen.

Two explosions at Beersheba central bus station; dozens injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with assailant caught and handed to police &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP) _ An assailant threw two hand grenades
into the central bus station in this desert town during morning
rush hour Monday, and at least 30 people were injured by the
blasts, witnesses and radio reports said.
	   One of the injured was in serious condition.
	   The assailant, apparently an Arab, was caught by passers-by who
wrestled him to the ground and handed him to police.
	   The attack coincided with a make-or-break Mideast peace summit
at Wye plantation outside Washington. A key issue on the agenda is
Israel's demand that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror
attacks in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
said he will not hand over West Bank land until he receives
ironclad guarantees from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu was woken up by aides and briefed
about the attack.
	   The blasts went off shortly after 8 a.m. (0600 gmt) in the
central bus station of Beersheba, a town in the southern Negev
Center.
	   Israeli radio reports said at least 30 people were injured and
received treatment at Sorokka Hospital in Beersheba. Most suffered
minor injuries. Paramedics from the Magen David Adom emergency
service said at least one person was in serious condition.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility. Israel has
been on high alert for a possible terror attack for the past month
after the Islamic militant group Hamas said it would carry out
bombings in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the killings of two Hamas
top fugitives by Israeli troops in September.

Fire kills two soldiers in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fire that gutted an army barracks in Russia's Far
East killed two soldiers, a news report said Monday.
	   The two soldiers in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk were killed when fire
engulfed their barracks late Sunday night, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Firefighters were called in to battle the blaze, but could not
control it and the entire barracks burned down.
	   Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is the capital of Sakhalin Island, located off
Russia's Pacific coast. The region has been plagued by forest fires
in recent months.

Tropical storm Babs heads towards central Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Just days after a major typhoon
killed dozens of people, tropical storm Babs crept towards the
central Philippines on Monday, picking up strength after
momentarily loosing steam, weathermen said.
	   At noon (0400 GMT), Babs, with maximum sustained winds of 75 kph
(46 mph) and gusts of up to 120 kph (75 mph), was over the Pacific
Ocean about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east southeast of Borongan
town in Eastern Samar province, said forecaster Rene Molina.
	   Molina said the storm would begin to be felt in Samar by late
Monday or early Tuesday after having stalled at sea for several
days.
	   Molina said Babs, the ninth storm to hit the country this year,
was likely to pick up speed and strength as it neared Samar. It was
moving at a speed of 11 kph (7 mph).
	   As Babs approached, disaster officials continued to look for
about 65 people still missing after Typhoon Zeb slammed the
northern Philippines last week.
	   Zeb killed at least 74 people and forced more than 415,000
others to flee their homes at the height of its onslaught. Most of
those who fled have returned to repair their damaged homes.
	   The typhoon destroyed an estimated 1.5 billion pesos (dlrs 35
million) worth of property and crops in 1,087 northern villages in
the country's tobacco- and rice-growing region, officials said.
	   After hitting the Philippines, Zeb moved on to skirt Taiwan,
where 18 died, before cutting a swath across Japan. At least 12
people were killed in Japan.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, with one lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the
former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.
	   Chilean officials, meanwhile, issued strong protests and sent a
delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet's release. The
former strongman's son vowed to hire top attorneys to defend his
82-year-old father, who ruled Chile with an iron fist for 17 years.
	   British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private
London hospital in response to a request from Spain, which wants to
question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade
after he seized power in 1973. Pinochet had gone to the hospital to
have a back operation Oct. 9.
	   ``The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be
claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this
country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff,'' Trade Secretary
Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television
interview Sunday.
	   Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledged Sunday that
Pinochet entered Britain on a diplomatic passport, but said, ``That
does not necessarily convey diplomatic immunity.''
	   The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting on
official business and accredited diplomats have immunity.
	   Pinochet has been a regular visitor to Britain, generally
without publicity. His arrest this time appeared to reflect a
tougher attitude toward right-wing dictators by Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party government, which replaced a Conservative Party
administration 18 months ago and promised an ``ethical'' foreign
policy.
	   However, Michael Howard, a Conservative spokesman and former
Cabinet minister, said he was concerned that Pinochet was arrested
as a result of pressure from Labor lawmakers and lobby groups.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest, saying the
Spanish magistrate's arrest order was tantamount to not recognizing
Chile's institutions.
	   ``Spain also lived under an authoritarian for 40 years and many
of its present institutions are inherited from that regime,'' Frei
said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending the Ibero-American
Summit.
	   ``Would a Chilean court be allowed to start a trial for abuses
that occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime (of Francisco
Franco)?'' Frei asked. ``It is only for Chilean courts to try
events that occurred in Chile.''
	   Franco's reign ended in 1975.
	   Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest
``an insult'' and thanking the Chilean government, rightist
politicians and the military for their support.
	   In London, police guards were deployed Sunday outside the London
Clinic, where Pinochet is believed to still be a patient.
	   About 100 Chilean demonstrators pleased with the arrest gathered
outside, chanting and waving placards bearing faded black and white
portraits with the caption ``Disappeared in Chile.''
	   Across the Atlantic, the Chilean capital of Santiago was the
scene of dueling demonstrations Sunday, reflecting the
long-standing division of public opinion over Pinochet.
	   The rallies were mostly peaceful, although riot police used tear
gas and water cannons on some pro-Pinochet protesters trying to
break through police lines into the British embassy on Sunday
evening. No arrests or injuries were reported.
	   The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet's release,
Santiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, said Chilean
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Any legal defense would be up
to Pinochet's family.
	   Pinochet's son, Augusto, said the family would hire ``the best
legal team available in London.''
	   Several right-wing Chilean politicians, including some who held
posts in the Pinochet regime, also were flying to London to show
their support to their former boss.
	   Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday to
formally apply for extradition. The final decision lies with
British Home Secretary Jack Straw.
	   There was no immediate word on when Pinochet would be
questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said questioning was not expected for a week or two.
	   Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime
marked by disappearances and deaths of political opponents.
	   His arrest was prompted by applications last week to question
him by two Spanish judges investigating human rights violations.
One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also wants to question Pinochet about
the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina.
	   The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about
allegations that he killed Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and
1983.
	   In Chile, seven Spaniards have been identified as missing or
dead under the Pinochet regime, including two Catholic priests and
a U.N. official.
	   According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299
political opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term.
	   Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March,
has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life under
a new constitution that his government crafted.
	   He is also covered under an amnesty for crimes committed before
1978 _ when most of the human rights abuses took place.

APEC summit facing some unusual risks and opportunities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The last time the Asia-Pacific region held its
annual summit to promote free trade, Japan's prime minister assured
everyone that his economy wouldn't be the next victim of Asia's
financial crisis.
	   Canada, the host country, was criticized by some in Canada for
cracking down on demonstrations against Suharto, Indonesia's
iron-fisted ruler at the time.
	   And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy
were the envy of the planet, joined everyone else in urging
countries such as Thailand and South Korea to bite the bullet and
comply with the tough economic reforms that the International
Monetary Fund was demanding.
	   My, how the challenges have grown, as the 21-nation Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum prepares for its November summit in
Malaysia.
	   Japan _ the world's second largest economy, and Asia's financial
anchor _ is suffering through its worst recession since World War
II, and that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his
job.
	   Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years, was driven out of
power by a violent, pro-democracy movement, and the world's fourth
most populous country is in real trouble financially.
	   Wall Street is now coping with a steep downturn. And even though
Clinton has promised to attend the APEC meeting, some people wonder
how he can do that while facing an impeachment inquiry back home,
thanks to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
	   Worse still, Asia's economic crisis is showing signs of going
global, and more and more economists are criticizing the IMF for
the way it is handling its bailouts.
	   Other well-respected economists are going even further,
questioning whether a free-market philosophy doesn't leave some
countries too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculators.
	   In fact, Malaysia isn't the only country trying self-defense
mechanisms such as capital controls. Hong Kong recently spent a
fortune investing in its stock market to ward off speculators.
	   And Washington is trying to figure out what to do with hedge
funds after watching its Federal Reserve help bail out a major one
that was going under, and seeing the investments of others send the
U.S. dollar into a tailspin against Japan's yen.
	   Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who made
one of his typical anti-free-market comments during last year's
summit, probably could have opened this year's with an ``I told you
so.''
	   But even he is having major domestic problems. Mahathir, 72, who
is widely credited with creating modern Malaysia during his 17
years in power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his expected successor, in
an apparent dispute over how to battle the country's economic mess.
	   Instead of stepping aside, Anwar launched a reform movement
across Malaysia that quickly led to big rallies demanding that
Mahathir step down.
	   The prime minister used riot police to thwart the protests, and
jailed Anwar, charging him with corruption and sex crimes, and
scheduling his trial for Nov. 2.
	   The trial will be interrupted during the Nov. 12-18 APEC
meetings, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and his reform movement
already have been criticized by APEC members such as Australia,
Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States.
	   President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia and Philippine President
Joseph Estrada consider Anwar a friend, and Estrada won't say
whether he plans to attend this year's APEC summit.
	   John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador for APEC, recently
acknowledged that it won't be easy for APEC members to meet in
Malaysia as the Asian crisis ``ricochets around the world with no
clear sign what will happen next.''
	   But he also said the leaders of the 21 APEC members should aim
for a productive meeting.
	   Wolf said such gatherings give members a chance to discuss IMF
bailout strategies and the free-market philosophy, to resolve
bilateral disputes, and to continue to reduce tariff rates to help
struggling countries improve their exports.
	   ``This has been a lousy year in general. It has affected all of
us. It has set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet to solve
the crisis right away,'' said Wolf. ``But we should welcome the
chance to work together and to develop a sense of what's
possible.''
	   So far, APEC has been criticized for doing little during the
financial crisis. But next month it hopes to complete a plan that
would lift trade barriers in nine key industries: environmental
products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry,
medical goods, chemical products and telecommunications.
	   Besides the United States, APEC, which accounts for half of all
global trade _ consists of these members:
	   Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.
	   During the Malaysia meeting, APEC also will include three new
members: Russia _ one of the latest victims of the financial crisis
_ Vietnam and Peru.

	   KAFR EL-DAWAR, Egypt (AP) _ Rescue teams ended their search for
survivors Monday after lifting the last car of a train that jumped
its tracks and crashed into a north Egyptian village, killing at
least 47 people.
	   An additional 100 people, most of them villagers, were injured
when the derailed in Kafr el-Dawar, about 30 kilometers (18.6
miles) southeast of the port city of Alexandria, at 5:10 p.m. local
time (1510 GMT) on Sunday, said Nabih Yousef Shaltout, the head of
health care in the local province of Buheira.
	   Five mangled bodies were found beneath the last three carriages
to be lifted by a mobile crane. With the 47 fatalities reported by
Shaltout earlier, the death toll could reach 52, but this was not
confirmed officially.
	   Residents of Kafr el-Dawar suggested that the toll could be
higher. Villagers who helped transport the casualties to hospitals
said they had seen many more bodies.
	   Residents also accused the authorities of neglect.
	   ``No one came until 8:15,'' said Khaled Mohammed Lotfi.
``Everyone you see working here is a local man. We asked them to
call the Defense Ministry to bring in soldiers to help, but they
called us crazy.''
	   Shaltout said most of the dead were bystanders in the town and
that most of the injured were passengers on the train.
	   As the last body was recovered, a resident of the village named
Hamdi Kamel said ``all there was was chunks of flesh.''
	   The train, which was traveling south from Alexandria, left the
rails when the driver changed tracks ``at high speed,'' the
Interior Ministry said in a statement.
	   A teen-ager who saw the crash, Hany Roushdy, said the train was
moving very fast.
	   ``It did not seem to able to stop. It shot off the tracks and
went towards the town square,'' he said.
	   The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, hit a war
memorial in the square and slammed into seven shops, witnesses
said.
	   When the train hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,''
said Roushdy, 18.
	   A businessman in the square, Mustafa Attiya, said he heard girls
screaming. ``I turned around and saw the train shoot across and hit
the girls.''
	   The train snared the leg of a fruit vendor. Taxi driver Saeid
Saleh said the merchant was screaming ``Help me! Help me!''
	   People did manage to free him, but he emerged with blood gushing
from his leg, Saleh said.
	   A crane was brought in to hoist the locomotive and the first two
passenger cars, which had overturned.
	   As hundreds of villagers tried to break through a cordon of riot
police armed with shields and bamboo canes, other citizens
responded to calls for blood and other donations.
	   Residents gave 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of blood in the first
few hours after the crash, Shaltout said.
	   ``Police asked me to buy 45 coffins and shrouds for the dead,''
said Ahmed Mohammed Abdallah, a resident of Kafr el-Dawar.
	   Some people tore their clothes into bandages to staunch the
bleeding of the wounded, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   But there were angry scenes outside the local hospital where
police armed with automatic rifles kept relatives at bay.
	   ``I just want to ask about my family,'' yelled one man at an
officer.
	   ``Don't drive me crazy. I have my orders not to let anyone in,''
the officer shouted back.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   It is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and
between the carriages of such commuter trains.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995, when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

Cardinal Sin to stay longer in hospital due to fever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's influential Roman Catholic
archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin has developed pneumonia while in the
hospital and will have to remain there a while longer, his
spokesman said Monday.
	   Msgr. Socrates Villegas said the 70-year-old prelate ``developed
a pulmonary congestion due to his disposition to retain fluids in
his body.''
	   Villegas said Sin continues to undergo regular dialysis due to
renal problems and doctors are monitoring his condition.
	   Sin was hospitalized Sept. 28 with fever and stomach pains after
a tube inserted in his peritoneum, the membrane lining the
abdominal cavity, apparently introduced bacteria into his system,
church officials said.
	   Sin helped bring about the ouster of strongman Ferdinand Marcos
in 1986 when he called for citizens to support a military revolt
against the president. Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in
the streets, forcing Marcos from power.
	   He continues to be heavily involved in political and social
issues in the Philippines, Asia's only predominantly Catholic
country.

	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Brian McBride scored two goals and the
Columbus Crew kept their championship hopes alive with a 4-2
victory over two-time Major League Soccer champions D.C. United on
Sunday in Game 2 of the Eastern Division finals.
	   The defeat broke United's streak of 13 straight playoff
victories and evened the best-of-3 series. The deciding game will
be played Wednesday in Washington, with the winner advancing to the
MLS Cup championship game next Sunday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,
Calif., against the Chicago Fire.
	   McBride chased down a loose ball in the box and pushed a shot
past D.C. goalkeeper Tom Presthus from 10 yards out in the 8th
minute. Thomas Dooley made it 2-0 in the 37th minute on a header
from seven yards out off a cross from Jason Farrell.
	   McBride got his fourth playoff goal and the game-winner in the
47th minute, fighting off two defenders and flicking a header
inside the far post from 12 yards.
	   Reserve Tony Sanneh put United on the scoreboard with a header
off a cross by defender Jeff Agoos in the 65th minute.
	   Roy Lassiter made it 3-2 in the 77th minute after Carey Talley
intercepted a rushed pass from Dooley.
	   MLS scoring leader Stern John put the game away in the 81st
minute with a header off a cross by Robert Warzycha.
	   The game, which was the last the Crew will play in Ohio Stadium,
featured an MLS record 50 fouls and seven yellow cards as the teams
battled in a steady rain. Columbus will have its own
soccer-specific stadium next season.

	   BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP) _ A Palestinian threw two hand grenades
into the central bus station in this desert town during morning
rush hour Monday, and at least 45 people were injured, including
more than 20 soldiers. Two victims were in serious condition.
	   The assailant was wrestled to the ground by passers-by.
	   The attack coincided with a make-or-break Mideast peace summit
at Wye plantation outside Washington. Israeli negotiators said the
blasts strengthened Israel's determination not to compromise on
demands that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror attacks.
	   The explosions went off shortly after 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) in
Beersheba, a town in the southern Negev Center.
	   Witnesses said the assailant, who apparently came from the West
Bank's Hebron area, carried hand grenades in a bag. Israel radio
quoted police as saying the suspect wanted to harm Israeli
soldiers.
	   The radio said one grenade hit a bus full of passengers, but
exploded some distance away.
	   After the blasts, army-issue olive duffel bags and clothes were
strewn on the pavement near one of the glass-covered bus stops. A
soldier's polished black boots, with the socks stuffed inside, were
left behind on a traffic island.
	   Officials at Sorokka Hospital in Beersheba said 45 people were
injured, including two who were in serious condition. Most suffered
only minor injuries.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Israel has been
on high alert for a possible terror attack for the past month after
the Islamic militant group Hamas said it would carry out bombings
in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the killings of two Hamas top
fugitives by Israeli troops in September.
	   At the Mideast summit, a key issue on the agenda is Israel's
demand that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror attacks in
Israel. Netanyahu has said he will not hand over West Bank land
until he receives ironclad guarantees from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu was woken up by aides and briefed
about the attack.
	   The Palestinians' security chief in the West Bank, Col. Jibril
Rajoub, said terror attacks also harmed the Palestinians because
they made it more difficult to reach a peace agreement.
	   ``Both sides must move to implement the agreement,'' Rajoub told
The Associated Press. ``Israel must understand that security comes
through peace.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Opening a conference on African development,
Japan's prime minister said Monday that his country's economic
problems will not interfere with its economic aid to African
nations.
	   Premier Keizo Obuchi told the 2nd Tokyo International Conference
on African Development that Japan's and other Asian countries'
commitment to the continent will not waver.
	   ``Japan is faced with a severe financial situation,'' Obuchi
told the gathering of 82 countries and 40 organizations. ``But we
will continue to take initiatives to aid Africa.''
	   The gathering, which follows one held five years ago in Tokyo,
will focus on the role of education, women, agriculture and
private-sector investment in development.
	   The issue of aid to Africa comes at a tough time for Japan,
which is grappling with its deepest recession since the end of
World War II. Unemployment and bankruptcy debt are at record highs.
	   Japan's economic problems are part of the year-old Asian
financial crisis, which has crippled several economies in the
region and now threatens Russia, Latin America _ and Africa.
	   Growth forecasts for Africa have been slashed from 4 percent to
just over 1 percent as sluggish global demand has imposed lower
prices on African commodity exports, said James Gustave Speth,
administrator of the United Nations Development Program.
	   ``The highest costs of the financial crisis are being paid by
the poor,'' he told the conference.
	   Despite the problems, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
told the group that Africa can still learn a lot about economic
development from Asia.
	   ``Adopting the Asian approach and the Asian way toward
development is still a good strategy,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir, whose own country is facing mounting economic
problems, blamed his region's turmoil on out-of-control capitalism
rather than structural defects in the countries' economies.
	   ``Currency trading and raids in the stock market are not the
fault of Asians or their ways or their value system,'' said
Mahathir. ``Any country subject to such destructive attacks will
fail.''
	   Mahathir said that despite the region's problems, it should get
more involved in helping Africa develop.
	   ``It is timely that the Asian countries like Japan and to a
lesser extent Malaysia and others should stretch out a helping
hand,'' he told the conference.
	   Obuchi said Japan will extend financial and technical support
for a plan to send 2,000 people from African countries for training
in Asia in the next five years, Kyodo News reported. Japan
currently accepts 1,000 people a year for technical training.
	   Japan will also work toward an Asia-Africa business forum to
spur private-sector investment in Africa, he said.
	   Japan also plans to support the ``self-help'' efforts of African
countries and urge other developed nations to help solve or prevent
regional conflicts in Africa, Obuchi said.
	   Participants in the conference include U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and the leaders of Swaziland, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana,
Djibouti, Mozambique, Botswana and Benin.
	   The conference is expected to issue an ``Agenda for Action''
Wednesday aimed at halving the number of people living in absolute
poverty by 2015 through economic growth and sustainable
development.
	   The event is jointly staged by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.

Second Test heading toward a draw

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia was likely to keep its 1-0
lead in the three-match series in tact against Pakistan as the
second Test appeared to be heading toward a draw on Monday, the
fifth and final day.
	   At lunch, Australia was 93 for two, an overall lead of 112 runs
with eight second innings wickets in hand. The visitors ended their
first innings declaring at 599 for four declared.
	   Pakistan replied with a strong 580 for nine declared in its
first innings.
	   First innings triple century-maker Mark Taylor was unbeaten on
42 while Mark Waugh was with him on 14 at lunch.
	   Spectators were watching to see whether Taylor would break
England's Graham Gooch record for the highest number of runs in one
Test. Gooch scored 333 and 123 in a Lord's Test against India in
1990 for an accumulated run total of 456 runs.
	   Taylor, who scored unbeaten 334 in the first innings needs
another 81 runs in the remaining two sessions to surpass Gooch's
record.
	   Taylor has thus far made 376 in two innings and is just four shy
of Greg Chappell's 380-run mark. Chappell scored (247 not out) and
133 in his two innings against New Zealand at Wellington in 1973-74
season and is second behind Gooch.
	   Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed got both the wickets in the first
session after Australia resumed at 21 for no loss. The leg-spinner
bowled 14 overs in the first session. He trapped Michael Slater leg
before for 21 and then first innings centurion Justin Langer (14)
was neatly caught by Yousuf Youhanna at forward short leg.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 100 students protested near the
presidential palace Monday, demanding that some of Indonesia's oil
profits be returned to their province of Riau on Sumatra Island.
	   ``We want President B.J. Habibie to fulfill his promise to
return 10 percent of the money taken from our oil-rich province,''
said a spokesman for the protesters, who identified himself only as
Andi.
	   Dozens of security personnel pushed away the protesters as they
marched from the National Monument northward toward the palace. The
protesters then marched about three kilometers (2 miles) to the
office of the Legal Aid Foundation.
	   The protesters, who called their group the Communication Forum
of Riau Students, claimed that Habibie, who succeeded autocratic
leader Suharto in May, has pledged to share earnings from natural
resources between the central government and provincial
governments.
	   Many groups have complained that during past decades, natural
resources in the provinces have been unfairly exploited by the
central government and certain well-connected groups.
	   Suharto resigned amid a crippling economic crisis and widespread
student protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.

	   First innings triple century-maker Mark Taylor was unbeaten on
42 while Mark Waugh was with him on 14 at lunch.
	   Spectators were watching to see whether Taylor would break
England's Graham Gooch record for the highest number of runs in one
Test. Gooch scored 333 and 123 in a Lord's Test against India in
1990 for an accumulated run total of 456 runs.
	   Taylor, who scored unbeaten 334 in the first innings needs
another 81 runs in the remaining two sessions to surpass Gooch's
record.
	   Taylor has thus far made 376 in two innings and is just four shy
of Greg Chappell's 380-run mark. Chappell scored (247 not out) and
133 in his two innings against New Zealand at Wellington in 1973-74
season and is second behind Gooch.
	   Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed got both the wickets in the first
session after Australia resumed at 21 for no loss. The leg-spinner
bowled 14 overs in the first session. He trapped Michael Slater leg
before for 21 and then first innings centurion Justin Langer (14)
was neatly caught by Yousuf Youhanna at forward short leg.

Official: Ecstasy from Myanmar will soon flood the Thai market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The designer drug ecstasy is being
produced at jungle laboratories in Myanmar and could soon flood
Thailand, driving down the price and making it more readily
accessible, a senior anti-narcotics official said Monday.
	   Thai intelligence units have reported that the Wa ethnic group
in northern Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been producing
ecstasy for quite some time and plans to market the illegal drug in
Thailand next year, said Sorasit Sangprasert, deputy
secretary-general of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board.
	   ``We are afraid that this will drive down the price and make it
even more accessible for Thais,'' said Sorasit.
	   The street value for an ecstasy tablet from Europe is about
1,200 baht (dlrs 30), while one from the Wa is about 400 baht (dlrs
10), he said.
	   He called the development a ``grave concern'' for Thailand.
	   The Wa are believed to be the top traffickers of heroin in
Myanmar, which vies with Afghanistan for the title of world's
biggest exporter of the drug. The Wa also make large quantities of
methamphetamine, a stimulant, which is mostly exported to Thailand.
	   Ecstasy, also called MDMA, is chemically related to amphetamines
but requires a more sophisticated manufacturing process.
	   Thai narcotics officials intercepted a small shipment of Wa-made
ecstasy, which laboratory tests revealed to be of much lower
quality than that from Europe, the main source of the drug, said
Sorasit.

China approves new mandate for securities market regulator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's government has approved a
sweeping new mandate for its securities market regulator in a
long-awaited move aimed at unifying oversight functions in its
fledgling securities industry, state media reported Monday.
	   The new arrangement gives the China Securities Regulatory
Commission full regulatory authority over both China's securities
and futures, effectively ending a period in which the markets and
brokerage and investment houses were regulated by several different
government entities.
	   The expanded oversight functions are part of efforts to end
widespread market abuses such as price manipulation and insider
trading that have long existed due to the murky regulatory
environment, officials at the CSRC said Monday.
	   Under the new regime, the CSRC will be charged with formulating
all new securities market laws and policies, and with approving and
regulating all issuance and trading of stocks, convertible bonds,
investment funds and futures contracts.
	   The new mandate also formally puts the CSRC in charge of the top
personnel at the country's two stock exchanges, futures exchanges
and local market regulatory offices.
	   The body also becomes responsible for approving the
qualifications of all senior personnel at mainland-based securities
and futures brokerages, the reports said.
	   The CSRC has also won authority for regulating the overseas
operations of all domestic stock and futures brokerages and the
domestic operations of all foreign brokerages in China.
	   The mandate makes the CSRC China's only body that can approve
institutions to release market statistics and information, a move
aimed at cracking down on information providers that release
inaccurate information to move markets in their favor.
	   Since 1991, the number of listed companies in China has soared
to more than 800 from just 10, while total market capitalization
has leaped to some dlrs 250 billion from just dlrs 145 million,
giving China one of largest markets in Asia, even though China's
exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen remain largely closed to foreign
funds.

Hyundai selected as successful bidder for bankrupt Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statements by creditor banks and Hyundai
president, grafs 8-10; minor editing throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Outbidding Ford Motor Co. and two
domestic competitors, Hyundai Motor Co. was tentatively selected
Monday as the winner in an auction to take over bankrupt Kia Motors
Corp.
	   The selection of Hyundai, South Korea's No. 1 car maker,
however, is subject to approval by creditor banks, which had made
no secret of their hope that cash-rich Ford would win the auction.
	   Hyundai's bid beat offers by the U.S. auto giant and South
Korea's Daewoo Motors Co. and Samsung Motors Inc., Kia officials
said.
	   Kia's collapse last year was widely believed to have triggered
South Korea's economic crisis, forcing the country to call in the
International Monetary Fund for rescue measures.
	   The government had backed Ford in the hope it would pump much
needed hard currency into the country and boost foreign investor
confidence in its economy.
	   South Korean media widely reported even before Monday's
announcement that creditor banks would reject selection of a local
company to take over Kia.
	   But Kia officials said Ford was disqualified because it offered
to buy the stock of Kia's commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors, at a
price lower than its face value of 5,000 won (dlrs 3.78).
	   The state-run Korea Development Bank, representing about 50
creditor banks, said it would take about a week to decide whether
to accept Hyundai's bid.
	   Meanwhile, Hyundai president Chung Mong-kyu told a news
conference his company would seek investments from Ford and other
foreign and domestic automakers in its takeover bid.
	   Chung said Hyundai demanded that creditors write off 7.3
trillion won (dlrs 5.5 billion) of Kia's debt of dlrs 8.4 billion.
Hyundai already owes its own creditors 7.81 trillion won (dlrs 5.58
billion), compared with assets of 9.5 trillion won (dlrs 6.79
billion).
	   Kia officials said the selection of Hyundai was made by two
neutral, outside companies _ Anderson Consulting Co. of the United
States and Banque Nationale de Paris of France.
	   Kia officials said Hyundai submitted the best combination of
requested debt reductions and stock price bids for Kia and Asia
Motors.
	   Without giving any reasons, Kia officials said they decided not
to disclose details of the auction, including debt write-offs. The
auction was the third since August.
	   ``Now, it's up to creditor banks whether to award the bidding to
Hyundai or Ford,'' Lee Jong-dae, Kia's chief planning official,
said.
	   The national Yonhap news agency, quoting unidentified sources,
said creditor banks have reservations about the amount of debt
write-off demanded by Hyundai.
	   In two previous failed auctions, creditor banks offered to write
off dlrs 2.1 billion of Kia dlrs 8.4 billion debt. But the
potential buyers all demanded further debt reduction.
	   ``It's no secret that creditors want Ford to take over Kia,''
said Ji Seung-chul, an analyst at LG Securities Co. ``Creditors
want an early debt payment, which makes Ford the best contender.''

Iran standoff with Taliban religious militia defused
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ After more than a week of diplomacy
that took him to the headquarters of Afghanistan's Taliban
religious militia, the United Nations special envoy said Monday
that the danger of a military confrontation between Iran and the
Taliban army had past.
	   ``Inshallah (God willing) that is behind us,'' Lakhdar Brahimi
told a news conference in the federal capital on the eve of his
departure for Iran.
	   His meetings with the Taliban resulted in the release of 26
Iranian prisoners, an inquiry into the killings in August of eight
Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist in northern Afghanistan
as well as a promise by the Taliban to hold face-to-face talks with
Iran.
	   The stand off between Iran and the Taliban resulted in the
deployment of more than 200,000 Iranian soldiers to their eastern
border with Afghanistan and generated fear of an all out war
between the hostile neighbors.
	   Of his visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Brahimi said ``they
realized that the situation has been extremely dangerous ... and
(now) they realize the need to move from this defused situation to
a real and genuine peace in Afghanistan.''
	   Now U.N. officials want to begin negotiations with the Taliban
for the return of its international staff to their country.
	   An estimated 50 foreign U.N. workers were pulled out of
Afghanistan on Aug. 21 after an Italian U.N. worker was shot and
killed in Kabul in apparent retaliation for the U.S. missile attack
on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   ``We want to make sure our staff is safe to go back,'' said
Sarah Russell, a U.N. spokeswoman in Pakistan.
	   Currently the United Nations and the Taliban are holding
negotiations in Pakistan to try to get security guarantees and
assurances that ``there are mechanisms in place for investigating,
finding and conducting a fair trial,'' said Russell.
	   The United Nations also wants equal access to women and girls,
adequate health care for women and a guarantee that its
international Muslim women staff will be allowed to work in
Afghanistan
	   But it's likely that security guarantees alone will be enough to
get the United Nations back into Afghanistan.
	   ``We feel it is important to have an international presence
there ... we have to be there to have a dialogue,'' said Russell.
``Our Afghan staff need the support of the international staff.''
	   The Taliban rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, while their
opponents the remaining 10 percent.
	   But the fighting rages and Brahimi said the key to peace is
``genuine representation of the people of Afghanistan in a
political process.''

Serb military force moves out of its barracks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with two Serb journalists reported missing &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb army tanks and other military
vehicles were seen rumbling toward the site of an attack on Serb
police, leading to fears of a retaliatory strike against ethnic
Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
	   In Belgrade, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported Monday
that two of its journalists _ reporter Nebojsa Radosevic and
photographer Vladimir Dobricic _ went missing en route to the scene
of the attack and may have been kidnapped by ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
	   The battle unit moved out of its barracks Sunday in the
provincial capital Pristina and headed west down the main highway
through the Komorane police checkpoint, Western observers said
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The tanks' ultimate destination was not known but the observers
speculated they were moved in response to recent attacks on police
by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   NATO has threatened airstrikes unless Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic keeps his promise to reduce the number of army
troops and Serb police in Kosovo to the levels they were at before
he launched a crackdown in February. So far, nobody has specified
exactly what those levels were.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Milosevic's crackdown _
most of them ethnic Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of thousands
more have fled their homes to escape the violence.
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most want independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
	   Three Serb policemen died over the weekend and two others were
badly wounded by a grenade attack on a police outpost in Orlate, 30
kilometers (20 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The Serb-run Kosovo Media Center reported a dozen other attacks
around the province, including one on the Komorane police
checkpoint. There was no word on casualties.
	   In Belgrade, Tanjug said the two Serb journalists left Pristina
by car Sunday to check out the reported attack on the police but
never reached their destination and never returned to the Kosovo
capital.
	   A Serb reporter from Radio Pristina and his driver disappeared
in August and are believed to have been kidnapped by the KLA.
	   Meanwhile, an advance team for the 2,000-strong monitoring force
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
arrived Sunday in Pristina.
	   ``We hope that the overall presence of the OSCE can act in a
stabilizing fashion and hopefully we'll resolve many of the
issues,'' said John Sandrock, the American heading the Vienna-based
OSCE's mission support section. He said the OSCE mission had a
one-year mandate, which could be extended.
	   Serb officials blamed the stepped up violence on the KLA.
	   But Hydajet Hyseni, spokesman for the United Democratic
Movement, which is openly supportive of the KLA, accused the police
of attacking the ``innocent Albanian population,'' and said the KLA
only shot back in self-defense.
	   The United States and NATO have reported significant pullbacks
by Yugoslav forces in recent days but say numbers still exceed the
level required by the agreement reached last week between Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   NATO has extended a deadline for compliance until Oct. 27.

Hanson's defeat will be good for tourism, industry leader says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist politician Pauline
Hanson had damaged Australia's reputation as one of the world's
best tourist destinations, but her defeat in elections Oct. 3 was
making marketing of the nation easier, an industry leader said
Monday.
	   ``There is absolutely no doubt in our view that the policies of
One Nation and Pauline Hanson caused considerable damage to our
image worldwide, particularly throughout Asia ... but also in
Europe,'' said John Morse, managing director of the Tourism Council
of Australia.
	   ``What was under threat was the notion that Australia is a
friendly and welcoming country. The One Nation defeat at the
election really sent a very strong message to the world and we can
now move ahead with confidence ... (in) our promotion of Australia
as a friendly destination, as a welcoming destination.''
	   Hanson's One Nation attracted about 9 percent of the vote
nationally in the election. Hanson lost her seat in Parliament, and
only one One Nation candidate was elected.
	   Hanson's words were widely reported around the world, and
particularly in Asia, after she made a speech to Parliament in 1996
claiming Australia was being ``swamped'' by Asians and criticizing
Australia's Aborigines.
	   Opponents feared she would win substantial power in the
election, after One Nation collected about 23 percent of the vote
in a Queensland state election in June.
	   The conservative coalition of Prime Minister John Howard was
re-elected in the national poll, with a reduced majority.
	   Morse launched a new campaign Monday that he said was designed
to entice Asian tourists focusing on the ``emotional and spiritual
benefits'' of vacationing in Australia.
	   Morse said the campaign was the result of extensive research
conducted in Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Singapore and Hong Kong.
	   The Asian economic crisis has hurt tourism, with the number of
Asian tourists visiting Australia declining by 25 percent in the
year to June 30, 1998, he said.
	   ``You have to remember that that is up against a background of
five years of what can only be described as phenomenal growth. ...
Our view is if something dramatic happens, unless there is a global
recession or other factors which we're not aware of, next year
we'll start to see a return to growth again,'' Morse said.

Report: At least 420 killed in Nigerian pipeline fire

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Firefighters were battling a gasoline-fed
inferno that swept through several villages and reportedly killed
more than 422 people after thieves apparently trying to siphon fuel
from a pipeline sparked an explosion.
	   The fire, which began late Saturday, was still blazing Sunday
night. It was unclear, however, if it continued to burn into Monday
morning. While initial reports said the pipeline was carrying oil,
Monday newspaper reports said it was refined gasoline.
	   An official death toll was not available, but the Lagos-based
Guardian newspaper reported Monday morning that its reporters had
counted 400 bodies at the scene near the town of Jesse, about 300
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos. The newspaper said it
had confirmed at least 22 other people had died in area hospitals.
	   Other unconfirmed newspaper reports put the death toll at more
than 500 people.
	   Among the dead were vandals _ including children _ whose corpses
were found still clutching plastic cups, funnels and jerry cans
intended to collect fuel from the pipeline. Many other victims were
farmers and villagers sleeping in their homes.

Taliban fighter planes pound opposition troops in fresh fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's opposition alliance
repulsed an attack by the hard-line Taliban Islamic militia in
northern Afghanistan's Baghlan province, an opposition spokesman
said.
	   ``Fighter planes of the Taliban bombed our positions several
times in Baghlan province and launched a major offensive on the
ground, but our fighters repulsed the attack,'' an opposition
spokesman who identified himself only as Arif told The Associated
Press.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Taliban.
	   Arif said the Taliban fighters attacked the strategic Andarb
district of Baghlan province to push towards the Khawak pass, but
opposition fighters repulsed their offensive.
	   The area is about 110 kilometers (65 miles) from the capital
Kabul.
	   Fighting raged in the area, but there were no immediate casualty
figures.
	   On Sunday several rockets pounded Kabul killing at least three
people and wounding several more.
	   The opposition forces loyal to Ahmed Shah Massood's
Jamiat-e-Islami are trying to regain some of the lost ground.
	   Massood was the defense minister in the ousted government of
president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
	   The Taliban rule 90 percent of Afghanistan and the opposition 10
percent.

Law of the jungle rules the autobahn _ and Germans like it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Fixes typo in 7th graf in `metal' &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Driving on the broad, well-maintained
autobahns in Germany can be a test of nerves. The road rules here
have more to do with the law of the jungle than any German sense of
order.
	   With no speed limit, everyone's out to prove who's the fastest.
	   Big sedans and zippy roadsters rocket along at 200 kph (125 mph)
or more, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to fill the rearview
mirror of lesser models that wander into the fast lane to pass a
truck or other slowpoke.
	   Some dart back behind whatever they were trying to get around,
duly intimidated. Those who don't get quickly out of the way must
endure a tailgater flashing his lights until they do.
	   There's even a pecking order of sorts: Volkswagen drivers pull
aside for an Audi, Audi for BMW, and BMW for Mercedes _ depending,
of course, on the driver's testosterone level. Other makes squeeze
in where they can, but everyone bows to the occasional Porsche.
	   ``I love driving really fast,'' says Peter Kadel, a sales
director from Heidelberg who stopped at a rest stop near Bonn in
his purple BMW. ``The faster I drive, the safer I am, because then
I concentrate completely.''
	   But the time-honored tradition of pedal to the metal faces an
uncertain future under the incoming center-left government. The
ecology-minded Greens, the likely junior partner, are especially
intent on slowing down traffic and raising gas taxes to break the
German love affair with their cars.
	   Tabloid headlines expressed shock when the Greens proposed a 100
kph (60 mph) limit. Daytime TV talkmeisters skipped the usual sex
and relationship fare to do shows with themes like ``I drive as
fast as I want.''
	   Self-described ``car-man'' Gerhard Schroeder, who sat on
Volkswagen's supervisory board until he was elected chancellor last
month, quickly squashed the discussion, warning against anything
that might hurt the auto industry.
	   On Saturday, the two parties reached a deal that gives
municipalities more leeway to reduce speeds on city streets, while
leaving the autobahn alone _ for now.
	   Both sides remain open for an eventual ``harmonization'' of
traffic laws with the rest of the European Union, where speeds are
generally capped at around 130 kph (80 mph).
	   ``I'm optimistic that we're going to have a European solution,''
Greens leader Gunda Roestel said, despite the fact that the Social
Democrat expected to become transport minister, Franz Muentefering,
seemed less determined.
	   Studies have shown slower driving is generally safer driving,
but Germans passionately defend their status as the only country in
Europe without a superhighway speed limit. ``Free driving for free
citizens'' is the rallying cry for speed junkies who see themselves
as defenders of a basic human right.
	   ``Personally, I don't understand why other countries have speed
limits,'' says Wolfgang Wuthe, spokesman for Germany's highly
revered ADAC auto club, when asked to explain why Germany doesn't.
	   ``Why should you put a speed limit on the safest roads in the
country,'' asks Franz-Josef Schneiders, spokesman for the federal
Transportation Ministry. ``It's not necessary.''
	   Of course, about 30 percent of the 11,000 kilometers (6,800
miles) of the German autobahn system already has a permanent speed
limit, mainly through urban areas and dangerous stretches. Another
20 percent is temporarily limited _ due to construction or when
weather is bad.
	   On the rest, the government ``recommends'' drivers not exceed
130 kph (80 mph). But hardly anyone listens.
	   Even as the roads get more crowded and the stretches where
drivers can really floor it shrink, support for autobahn limits has
dropped, from 71 percent in 1991 to about half in a poll this year.
	   Some speed limit advocates blame German carmakers for fueling
the lust for speed with advertisements for sleek, fast cars, like
tobacco companies hawking cigarettes.
	   ``That's why it's so hard to stop,'' says Werner Winkler, a
traffic psychologist in Hanover. ``An addiction can't be cured by a
ticket.''
	   Yet in a society where everything from shopping hours to
acceptable names for children is strictly regulated _ and accepted
_ many Germans view the wide open autobahn as a last escape.
	   Manfred, a Muelheim lawyer who only gave his first name, doesn't
like the ``stress'' of autobahn driving, but notices that no one
rides his tail when he's in his Mercedes convertible coupe.
	   ``Germans are under pressure from the government, under pressure
from their employer,'' he explains at the reststop. ``They have no
say in their profession or at home. But on the autobahn, they can
let it all out.''

Emotional John Paul marks 20 years as pope
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Seated in front of a crowd of 75,000
well-wishers in St. Peter's Square, an emotional Pope John Paul II
asked for prayers so that he could fulfill ``until the end'' his
mission as pope.
	   During three days of celebrations for the 20th anniversary of
his election as pope, John Paul received congratulations from heads
of state, was feted by his Polish countrymen and reached out to his
worldwide flock.
	   ``I ask from the heart for your prayers so that God may give me
the strength and his spirit so that I may fulfill until the end the
mission entrusted to me,'' John Paul said in German, one of four
languges he used Sunday at a Mass marking the anniversary of his
Oct. 16, 1978 election.
	   In a high-point, the pope wiped away a tear as he hugged, one by
one, 40 Roman schoolchildren who had waved colored scarves in a
dance of joy for him on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.
	   ``After 20 years of service on Peter's seat, on this day I
cannot help but ask myself some questions,'' the pope said.
	   ``Have you been a diligent and vigilant master of the faith of
the church?''
	   And, another question to himself: ``Have you tried to satisfy
the expectations of the faithful of the church and also the hunger
for truth that we feel in the world, outside of the church?''
	   His thin, white hair tossed by a warm breeze, the 78-year-old
pope offered no answers.
	   The frail pope has been slowed by a series of ailments and the
burdens of office, but he has shown every intention of battling his
physical problems to lead his church into 2000, the start of
Christianity's third millennium.
	   ``The people's prayer supports he who has the task of guiding
them,'' said the John Paul, who walks with difficulty and has a
constant hand tremor.
	   Among the 20,000 who came from the pope's homeland for the
anniversary was Warsaw Cardinal Jozef Glemp, who, in an interview
published Sunday in Rome's La Repubblica newspaper, said the pope
had considered resigning in 1981 to help Poles struggling against
communism.
	   Asked if it was true that John Paul told Moscow he was ready to
quit and return to Poland if Soviet troops invaded his homeland,
Glemp replied: ``Yes. That was a hypothesis that in several moments
had great basis.''
	   Glemp spoke of the pope's distress over the martial-law
crackdown on the Solidarity free trade movement in 1981. ``The Holy
Father in those days was very troubled and worried about the fate
of his country,'' Glemp said. ``He was ready to do anything, even
leaving the leadership of the church in order to be able to defend
the freedom of his country.''
	   ``As we all know, naturally, there was no invasion, and, I
believe, thanks in part to the determination shown by the pope,''
Glemp said.

Two explosions at Beersheba central bus station; dozens injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hospital officials saying 51 injured, Hamas
reaction, quote from Netanyahu's spokesman; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP) _ A Palestinian threw two hand grenades
at passengers waiting in a crowded bus station during Monday
morning rush hour, and at least 51 people were injured, including
many soldiers. Two victims were in serious condition.
	   The assailant was wrestled to the ground by passers-by.
	   The attack came at a critical time in a make-or-break Mideast
peace summit at Wye plantation outside Washington. A spokesman for
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the blasts strengthened
Israel's determination to stick to demands that the Palestinians do
more to prevent terror attacks.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas,
said that ``what happened this morning is part of our continued
resistance to the occupation of our land,'' but stopped short of
directly claiming responsibility for the attack.
	   Hamas has threatened to carry out terror attacks in Israel to
avenge the killing of two fugitives by Israeli troops last month.
	   The explosions went off shortly after 8 a.m. (0600 gmt) in the
central bus station of Beersheba, a town in the southern Negev
Desert.
	   Witnesses said the assailant, who came from the West Bank town
of Dahariya near Hebron, carried hand grenades in a bag.
	   He threw the grenades at a crowded bus stop where passengers
were waiting, among them many soldiers. Israel radio quoted police
as saying the suspect wanted to harm soldiers.
	   The radio said one grenade hit a bus full of passengers, but
exploded some distance away.
	   After the blasts, army-issue olive duffel bags and clothes were
seen strewn on the pavement near a glass-covered bus stop. A
soldier's polished black boots, with the socks stuffed inside, were
left behind on a traffic island.
	   Officials at Sorokka Hospital in Beersheba said 51 people were
injured, including two who were in serious condition. Most suffered
minor injuries.
	   At the Mideast summit, the key issue is Israel's demand that the
Palestinians do more to prevent terror attacks in Israel. Netanyahu
has said he will not hand over West Bank land until he receives
ironclad guarantees from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky quoted the prime minister as
saying that ``the attack strengthens the Israeli position in the
negotiations with the Palestinians.''
	   Dahariya, the reported hometown of the assailant, is in a part
of the West Bank where Israel retains full security control, while
Palestinian police deal with maintaining order.
	   Israeli hardliners demanded that Netanyahu break off the
negotiations at Wye plantation, but Bushinsky said Israel would not
leave prematurely.
	   The Palestinians' security chief in the West Bank, Col. Jibril
Rajoub, said terror attacks also harmed the Palestinians because
they made it more difficult to reach a peace agreement.
	   ``Both sides must move to implement the agreement,'' Rajoub told
The Associated Press. ``Israel must understand that security comes
through peace.''
	   On Sunday evening, shots were fired at a vanload of Palestinian
laborers and three passengers were wounded. The driver of the van
said Israeli troops opened fire after the vehicle skirted a West
Bank roadblock. The army said soldiers were not involved.

Blair will try to break deadlock on decommissioning of weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair will try to get the
Northern Ireland peace process back on schedule when he holds
separate meetings Monday with Protestant and Catholic leaders about
the decommissioning of weapons.
	   Blair has summoned David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist
Party, and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness to his Downing Street
office.
	   ``Obviously the prime minister will be pressing the
decommissioning issue and seeking to crack it,'' said Blair's
spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   McGuiness is expected at 11:15 p.m. (1015 GMT) and Trimble is to
meet with Blair at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT), the spokesman said.
	   Blair hopes to take advantage of renewed optimism following the
award Friday of the Nobel Peace Prize to Trimble and John Hume,
Catholic leader of the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party.
Blair's spokesman said the Nobel recognition could ``act as a
spur'' to break the deadlock.
	   A Northern Ireland administration of Protestants and Catholics
is supposed to hold an inaugural summit with the Irish Republic's
government by Oct. 31, one of the few specific deadlines within
April's historic peace accord.
	   But the potential 12-member administration has yet to be
appointed because two key politicians _ Trimble and Sinn Fein party
leader Gerry Adams _ can't agree whether the Irish Republican Army
must start disarming first.
	   The agreement says only that disarmament should happen by May
2000. But Trimble, chief representative of the north's British
Protestant majority, insists the IRA must demonstrate it has
renounced violence before Adams' IRA-allied party will be eligible
to participate in the new government.
	   The IRA is sticking to a July 1997 cease-fire but insists it
won't disarm, and Sinn Fein argues it shouldn't be responsible for
what the IRA does. But Sinn Fein has assigned McGuinness to work
with the official commission on surrendering weapons.
	   The Ulster Volunteer Force and the other major outlawed
pro-British group, the Ulster Defense Association, have observed a
truce since 1994 but are similarly determined to retain their less
elaborate arsenal.
	   Trimble, who is under pressure from his party to force the
decommissioning issue, has cited the Nobel prize as an added
incentive for the IRA to start disarming now.
	   ``I hope it's not premature in the sense that I hope the
republican movement will not let down everyone in Northern Ireland
who wants to see progress,'' Trimble said during a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview on Sunday.
	   But while Trimble contends that decommissioning should already
be under way, he downplayed the importance of the Oct. 31 deadline
for setting up the executive body.
	   Instead, he talked about meeting the target date of February
when Britain is due to transfer powers to the new Northern Ireland
government.
	   But Sinn Fein said McGuinness would impress on Blair the
``imperative'' of getting the executive body established by the end
of the month.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on Sunday urged all the
parties to ``adopt a generous and forthcoming approach'' on the
weapons front and said it would be ``perverse'' if the issue was
allowed to destroy the peace process.

200 troops revolt, block roads in western Georgia
</HEADLINE>

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ More than 200 Georgian soldiers revolted
Monday, blocking roads in a western region with stolen tanks,
trucks and machine guns in support of the country's late
ex-president, officials said.
	   President Eduard Shevardnadze demanded that the mutinous
soldiers lay down their weapons and return to their barracks, and
threatened to use force if they continued with the revolt.
	   ``The (government) powers are controlling the situation,''
Shevardnadze said on state television.
	   Shevardnadze, who has survived assassination attempts and a
several rebellions, put Georgian troops to combat readiness, said
presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.
	   Russian television reported that by midday Monday the soldiers
had removed the tanks and stopped blockading the roads. But it was
not clear whether they had agreed to end the rebellion.
	   The revolt began when soldiers from a tank brigade in the
western town of Senaki took over their garrison and stole 10 tanks,
two armored personnel carriers, and more than 50 machine guns, said
Abashidze.
	   Some of the soldiers then blocked two roads leading to the port
city of Poti with seven of the tanks, Abashidze said.
	   The rebel soldiers were negotiating with government officials,
television reports said. Earlier, the soldiers shot at the car of a
government official coming to talk to them, but no one was wounded,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Georgian Defense Minister Maj. Gen. David Tevzadze and the
Minister of State Security, Lt. Gen. Dzhemal Gakhokidze, were both
sent to the scene.
	   The mutiny was being led by Akakiyev Eliyava, a military
commander who is also a supporter of the late president Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, Abashidze said.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1994.
	   His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze, and the
current president blames Gamsakhurdia's supporters for the Feb. 9
attack on his motorcade that left two of the president's bodyguards
dead. At least eight suspects have been arrested.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late afternoon dollar, bonds, new comments, other
details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar continued its plunge against the
Japanese yen Monday on worries about instability on American
financial markets. Tokyo stock prices rose sharply.
	   The dollar cost 114.72 yen in late afternoon, down 1.72 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of 115.25
yen late Friday. It now has lost a total of 5.00 yen in three
sessions in Tokyo.
	   In Monday's Tokyo trading, the dollar ranged between 113.81 yen
and 115.90 yen.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 286.66
points, or 2.16 percent, closing at 13,567.20. On Friday, the key
index had climbed 285.17 points, or 2.19 percent.
	   One major reason behind the dollar's drop was technical, dealers
said. Market players who had been waiting to sell the dollar have
finally started to do so to guard against a further fall.
	   Heightened worries about the future of the American economy were
another factor, they said.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise move last week to cut two
key short-term interest rates was an attempt to encourage spending
and consumer confidence, but it had the effect of renewing worries
about the American economy.
	   Expectations that the Fed may cut interest rates again helped
weigh down the dollar. Lower interest rates tend to push a nation's
currency down.
	   ``Financial market confusion in the U.S. will likely continue
for some time,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign
exchange at ABN Amro Bank in Tokyo. ``As long as there is
instability, there will be dollar-selling pressure.''
	   Rising Tokyo share prices also helped boost the yen and push the
dollar lower.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 16.24 points, or 1.61 percent, to 1,022.92. It
had gained 26.57 points, or 2.71 percent, on Friday.
	   ``It makes you think that, at last, Japan-selling is ending and
that Japan-buying is beginning,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign
exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   Stocks started higher following the passage of Japanese bank
reform legislation last Friday, which will make available a pool of
public funds of up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 524.9 billion) to
cash-strapped banks.
	   ``The passage of the recapitalization bill has helped to ease
worries about banks,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager at Ryoko
Securities.
	   Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange totaled
about 470 million shares, little changed from 468.99 million
Friday. Advances exceeded declines 804 to 323, while 156 issues
were unchanged.
	   ``The market is also being helped up by the relative stability
of overseas markets,'' said Naoki Takahashi, manager at Marusan
Securities.
	   In New York Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.40
points to 8,416.76.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.815 percent from Friday's finish of 0.865 percent,
driving its price up to 108.82 yen from 108.33 yen.

Two explosions at Beersheba central bus station; dozens injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hospital officials saying 51 injured, Hamas
reaction, quote from Netanyahu's spokesman; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP) _ A Palestinian threw two hand grenades
at passengers waiting in a crowded bus station during Monday
morning rush hour, and at least 51 people were injured, including
many soldiers. Two victims were in serious condition.
	   The assailant was wrestled to the ground by passers-by.
	   The attack came at a critical time in a make-or-break Mideast
peace summit at Wye plantation outside Washington. A spokesman for
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the blasts strengthened
Israel's determination to stick to demands that the Palestinians do
more to prevent terror attacks.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas,
said that ``what happened this morning is part of our continued
resistance to the occupation of our land,'' but stopped short of
directly claiming responsibility for the attack.
	   Hamas has threatened to carry out terror attacks in Israel to
avenge the killing of two fugitives by Israeli troops last month.
	   The explosions went off shortly after 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) in the
central bus station of Beersheba, a town in the southern Negev
Desert.
	   Witnesses said the assailant, who came from the West Bank town
of Dahariya near Hebron, carried hand grenades in a bag.
	   He threw the grenades at a crowded bus stop where passengers
were waiting, among them many soldiers. Israel radio quoted police
as saying the suspect wanted to harm soldiers.
	   The radio said one grenade hit a bus full of passengers, but
exploded some distance away.
	   After the blasts, army-issue olive duffel bags and clothes were
seen strewn on the pavement near a glass-covered bus stop. A
soldier's polished black boots, with the socks stuffed inside, were
left behind on a traffic island.
	   Officials at Sorokka Hospital in Beersheba said 51 people were
injured, including two who were in serious condition. Most suffered
minor injuries.
	   At the Mideast summit, a key issue is Israel's demand that the
Palestinians do more to prevent terror attacks in Israel. Netanyahu
has said he will not hand over West Bank land until he receives
ironclad guarantees from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky quoted the prime minister as
saying that ``the attack strengthens the Israeli position in the
negotiations with the Palestinians.''
	   Dahariya, the reported hometown of the assailant, is in a part
of the West Bank where Israel retains full security control, while
Palestinian police deal with maintaining order.
	   Israeli hardliners demanded that Netanyahu break off the
negotiations at Wye plantation, but Bushinsky said Israel would not
leave prematurely.
	   The Palestinians' security chief in the West Bank, Col. Jibril
Rajoub, said terror attacks also harmed the Palestinians because
they made it more difficult to reach a peace agreement.
	   ``Both sides must move to implement the agreement,'' Rajoub told
The Associated Press. ``Israel must understand that security comes
through peace.''
	   On Sunday evening, shots were fired at a van full of Palestinian
laborers and three passengers were wounded. The driver of the van
said Israeli troops opened fire after the vehicle skirted a West
Bank roadblock. The army said soldiers were not involved.

Turkey says military action against Syria possible if diplomacy
</HEADLINE>
fails &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ While officials from Turkey and Syria
prepared to meet Monday to ease tensions, Turkish officials
indicated that it could still take military action against Syria if
it failed to satisfy demands to clamp down on Kurdish rebels.
	   ``Where diplomacy ends whatever is necessary must be done,''
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told TRT television in an interview
aired late Sunday.
	   High-ranking security officials were scheduled to meet at a
secret location to address Turkey's concerns that Syria is
sheltering rebels responsible for cross-border attacks.
	   Turkish officials said they would require proof that Syria was
closing down alleged Kurdish rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled
Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Turkey also accuses Syria of sheltering
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Reports suggested talks would take place at a border checkpoint
inside Turkey.
	   Relations between the two neighbors deteriorated sharply in the
past few weeks after Turkey suggested it might take military action
against Syria. The threat raised fears of a regional war.
	   ``Syria has made terrorism a vehicle for its foreign policy,''
Sezgin said. ``We are demanding that Syria stop giving support to
terrorism, stop providing logistic assistance, and just end their
support.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to an upsurge in violence
in Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency canceled two relief convoys
Monday and sent a team to investigate reports of tanks appearing
near a camp of ethnic Albanian refugees.
	   The convoys, organized by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, were supposed to have gone to a village near the western
Kosovo town of Klina and to Streoc, south of the province's second
largest city, Pec.
	   Traveling there would require the convoys to pass through the
Serb police checkpoint at Komorane, near the scene of weekend
attacks against Serbian forces, UNHCR spokeswoman Laura Boldrini
said.
	   The U.N. agency also sent a team to Kisna Reka, where 3,000
refugees live in a makeshift camp in the mountains, to check
reports that Serbian tanks advanced on the area last night,
Boldrini said.
	   She said the UNHCR had reports of widespread shelling during the
night, but added those reports were unconfirmed.
	   Separately, police reported that two journalists from the
government's Tanjug news agency went missing Sunday in the Magura
area, southwest of Pristina. Two others from Radio Pristina, a
journalist and his driver, have been missing since August.
	   The reports of military activity near the refugee colony
appeared connected to the movement of Yugoslav army tanks and other
armor close to the area of a deadly attack Saturday on Serb police.
	   Three Serb policemen died Saturday and two others were badly
wounded by a grenade at a police outpost in the town of Orlate, 30
kilometers (20 miles) southwest of the capital Pristina.
	   The Serb-run Kosovo Media Center in Pristina reported a dozen
other attacks around Kosovo. There was no word of casualties. Serb
officials blamed the stepped up violence on the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army. But KLA supporters said the guerrillas were
shooting back in self defense.
	   Western observers said the armored battle group moved out of its
base in the provincial capital of Pristina on Sunday and headed
westward down a main highway through the Komorane checkpoint about
20 miles (30 kms) to the west.
	   Its ultimate destination was not known, but the observers
speculated the military unit was moved in response to the KLA
attacks.
	   The troop movements come despite the continued threat of NATO
airstrikes. Fearing a NATO attack, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed last week to withdraw his forces from Kosovo. The
alliance has given him until Oct. 27 to comply.
	   It was not clear how many troops had been moved out of Pristina
on Sunday. But because the force is normally stationed in the
capital, it would not have to withdraw from the province under the
pullback plan.
	   The plan, negotiated by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, seeks to
end the bloodshed in Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian
province of Serbia. Serb-led Yugoslav launched a crackdown against
ethnic Albanian militants in the province in February following
attacks on police and soldiers.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Milosevic's crackdown _
most of them ethnic Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of thousands
more have fled their homes to escape the violence.
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most want independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
	   Amid the threat of new conflict, more members of an advance team
of an expected 2,000 unarmed international monitors arrived Sunday
in Kosovo.
	   The team was sent by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is responsible for verifying that
Milosevic sticks to the agreement.
	   Principal among the demands is that he decrease the number of
troops and police to levels before the February crackdown. So far,
nobody has specified exactly what those levels are.
	   The United States and NATO have reported significant pullbacks
by Yugoslav forces in recent days but say numbers still exceed the
level required by the Belgrade agreement.
	   NATO plans for air attacks on Yugoslavia remain on hold after
the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body, extended
the deadline for compliance from last Saturday to Oct. 27.
	   Asked if his current mission would have an effect on the rising
number of attacks, John Sandrock, the American heading the
Vienna-based OSCE's mission support section, said: ``We hope that
the overall presence of the OSCE can act in a stabilizing fashion
and hopefully we'll resolve many of the issues.''
	   He said the OSCE mission had a one-year mandate, which could be
extended.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Nicolae Ceausescu's smiling face has
sprung up around Bucharest again.
	   The Romanian Worker Party is using a poster of the former
Communist dictator to woo voters in the city's Oct. 25 mayoral
elections.
	   ``Remember all I did for the Romanian people,'' reads the
nostalgic message. ``If you are sorry I am gone, vote for Romanian
Worker Party candidate.''
	   Gherghina Dima, one of 20 candidates running for mayor says she
hopes the idea will catch on with voters.
	   People have gotten poorer in recent years as Romania struggles
to retool its economy along market lines. Purchasing power is down
and the average monthly salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs 128).
	   ``They shot me. Do you live any better?'' asks Ceausescu smiling
in a propaganda pose.

Romanians caught at Hungary's border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Fifty-eight Romanians were found in two
trucks trying to illegally enter into Hungary, a newspaper said
Monday.
	   The incident occurred at Nagylak, 280 kilometers (200 miles)
southeast of Budapest, on Saturday, when border guards officials
opened a truck carrying rattan to Italy, Nepszabadsag quoted border
guards spokesman, Agoston Wentzel as saying.
	   The Romanians paid dlrs 500-900 to the human smugglers, they
told Hungarian authorities.
	   The border violators will soon be extradited to Romania.

Report president's top adviser resigns amid controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian President Liamine Zeroual's top
adviser, under attack for months by some of the nation's leading
newspapers, has resigned, the president's office announced Monday.
	   The resignation caps nearly six months of controversy
surrounding Gen. Mohamed Betchine that some observers interpret as
the reflection of a power struggle within the military
establishment -- the real source of power in this North African
nation preparing for early presidential elections.
	   Betchine's resignation came a day after Justice Minister Mohamed
Adami, also caught up in controversy, announced his resignation.
	   Zeroual, a retired general, last month announced he would cut
short his five-year presidential term, holding early elections
before the end of February. His term was to end in the year 2000.
	   Zeroual unflinchingly defended Betchine, a personal friend.
	   Betchine, presidential adviser since April 1994, has been
criticized by the press on a variety of counts, including alleged
abuse of power connected to commercial interests and and alleged
torture during riots in October 1988, when he headed the country's
intelligence apparatus.
	   Speaking out against charges for the first time since the
controversy surrounding him erupted last June, Betchine defended
himself in an interview last week in the newspaper ``Demain
l'Algerie.''
	   ``My enemies think they are pushing me to react .... They are
highly mistaken,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Some newspapers have charged that Adami, justice minister since
January 1996, had sexual relations with prisoners and prostitutes.
	   Both Betchine and Adami are leading members of the National
Democratic Rally party, considered Zeroual's party.
	   The wrangling within the power elite has all but overshadowed
recently an Islamic insurgency that is in its seventh year.
Violence has left an estimated 75,000 people dead.

Hundreds of refugees caught entering German illegally over weekend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WAIDHAUS, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian state police apprehended 37
ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province at
Georgenberg on the Czech border Monday.
	   Police in Waidhaus said the refugees apparently had been
traveling two days in the back of a windowless truck to reach the
Czech border, where smugglers brought them into Germany overnight
and abandoned them.
	   Among the group were nine children and eight women. All were
shipped back to the Czech Republic immediately.
	   Under German asylum law, refugees who can be shown to have
arrived from a safe third country are sent back there if they want
to apply for asylum.
	   In Bonn, the Interior Ministry said 706 people in all, mostly
from Kosovo and Romania, were caught trying to enter Germany
illegally over the past three days.
	   Officials said 167 were immediately sent back to the country
they arrived from.
	   They included 78 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo found crammed in
the back of a small truck in Tirschenreuth, 15 kilometers (9 miles)
from the Czech border early Saturday.
	   In a move to stop a flood of refugees, 26 people smugglers were
arrested in the crackdown coordinated between police of nine
European Union countries, a ministry statement said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A week after a political agreement
intended to stop Kosovo's fighting, a central region resembled a
war zone on Monday with tanks positioned openly and a U.N. relief
agency postponing two convoys.
	   A surge of weekend violence brought more Serbian army troops to
the area southwest of Pristina that was the front line of fighting
before the agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and Western powers.
	   Reports of shelling and shooting, along with the Serbian army
deployment along the road from Komorane to Malisevo, caused the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to call off two convoys of
relief supplies headed to western Kosovo on a route through
Komorane.
	   The agency also sent a team to Kisna Reka, a village in the area
with 3,000 Albanian refugees living in the nearby woods, to see
whether the Serbian army was approaching the makeshift refugee
camp.
	   Reporters traveling outside Pristina heard the thud of mortars
on Monday.
	   In Geneva, agency spokeswoman Judith Kumin said the team saw
many displaced people who told of shooting during the night.
	   The team has no comment on military matters, she said, but added
the UNHCR planned to send out the two convoys on Tuesday along with
two others already scheduled for that day.
	   In the mountains above Kisna Reka, ethnic Albanian guerrillas of
the Kosovo Liberation Army showed journalists what they said were
newly deployed Serbian tanks and other armored vehicles.
	   Since the agreement, the Serbs have been entering villages and
taking civilians, said a KLA officer who gave his name as Shaban.
	   ``We respect the agreement, but they are provoking us all the
time,'' he said. ``Despite any agreement, we have a right to defend
ourselves and our people.''
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most want independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Milosevic's
crackdown on separatists, and hundreds of thousands more have fled
their homes to escape the violence.
	   Milosevic agreed last week to reduce his forces in Kosovo to the
levels before the February offensive he launched against ethnic
Albanian separatists. NATO has given him until Oct. 27 to comply.
	   The troops who moved out of Pristina to the southwest on Sunday
are normally stationed in the capital, and therefore could remain
in the province under the withdrawal plan.
	   Three Serb policemen died last weekend and two others were badly
wounded by a grenade in the worst of what officials said were more
than a dozen attacks around Kosovo.
	   Serb officials on Monday again blamed the violence on the KLA,
saying the guerrillas want to provoke a fight that would bring NATO
intervention.
	   ``Remnants of the destroyed Albanian terrorist gangs in the last
few days have conducted armed attacks and provocations in order to
jeopardize the realization of the agreement,'' Serbia's Information
Ministry said.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana mentioned the attacks on
Serbs in Paris on Monday after meeting with French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine. ``I think there are provocateurs and provocations,
but we must continue to hold the line'' and carry out the accord,
he said.
	   A 2,000-member international verification force is being
organized by the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia is keeping its
word. About 25 members of an advance team for the monitors were in
Kosovo on Monday.

Italian leader steeped in communism since childhood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Italy-Politics
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Massimo D'Alema, the first ex-Communist to be tapped
to form a postwar government in Italy, was steeped in Communist
dogma and backroom politics from childhood.
	   When he was 13, his father, Giuseppe D'Alema, a longtime
Communist lawmaker and hardliner, brought him to a party congress.
Young D'Alema gave flowers to Palmiro Togliatti and got a pat on
the cheek in return.
	   Togliatti was one of the founders of the largest Communist party
in the West and served as a Cabinet minister in 1947, the last time
the Communists entered a government in Italy before Cold War
politics banished them to the opposition benches.
	   After the fall of the Berlin Wall it was D'Alema who helped
guide the party's transformation. It changed its name in 1991 to
the Democratic Party of the Left, relegated the hammer-and-sickle
to the edge of the new party flag, accepted privatization of state
industry and other free-market ideas.
	   A dry wit with a sharp tongue, the 49-year-old D'Alema is prone
to unusually frank words for an Italian politician, but he also can
clear the air when backrooms gets thick with tension, a trait that
wins praises even from rivals.
	   ``He has the tendency to know how to reconcile the
irreconcilable, to put together the devil and holy water,'' was the
recent assessment by Luciano Sardelli, a conservative who lost to
D'Alema in 1996 parliamentary elections in their district in
Gallipoli, southeastern Italy.
	   The key to D'Alema's success in forming a government lay in his
ability to get former Christian Democrats together in the political
bed with a group of hard-line Communists who stuck to a Marxist
line when the new leftist party was formed in 1991.
	   Born in Rome in 1949, D'Alema joined in the youth protests of
the late 60s while a philosophy student at Pisa University.
	   His father was a rival in the Communist youth federation, a
training ground for future party leaders, of Enrico Berlinguer, who
went on to bring the party to the brink of power in the late 1970s.
In 1975, Berlinguer tapped the young D'Alema to lead the
federation, his first prominent party post.
	   From there, D'Alema's rise was steady. In 1986, he became part
of the secretariat and the next year was elected to his first seat
in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   He directed the party's newspaper, L'Unita, raising Marxist
eyebrows when he began publishing stock tables.
	   Re-elected to Parliament in 1992, he became the Democratic Party
of the Left's Chamber whip and two years later captured the party's
No. 1 post, secretary.
	   But D'Alema was frustrated in another prestigious position --
head of Parliament's joint commission for institutional reforms.
Even D'Alema's skills of persuasion couldn't stem bickering from
the right to the left over how to modernize Italy's political and
bureaucratic system.
	   A widower, he married Linda Giuva, who works in the state
archives. The D'Alema's have two children.
	   After politics, perhaps D'Alema's next passion is sailing his
16-meter (52-foot) boat Ikarus. Pasta and fish lunches at a seaside
trattoria have been a favorite setting for political chats.

Top seeded Korda toppled by Safin in the first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) - Russian junior Marat Safin
crushed top-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-2 Monday
in the first round of the dlrs 1 million IPB Czech Indoor tennis
tournament.
	   Korda started the match with several unforced errors and soon
lost his serve to the 18-year-old Russian. Safin gained a 3-1 lead
and comfortably won the first set, capitalizing on his powerful
serve and clever play on the net.
	   Safin waisted no time with Korda in the second set, beating him
in less than 30 minutes.
	   The Australian Open Champion, who is 9th in ATP rankings this
year, lost his third consecutive first-round match in an ATP event
and has now little chance to qualify for the ATP World Championship
in Hannover.
	   In a match of poweful baseliners, seventh-seed Thomas Enquist of
Sweden had the stronger nerves and better concentration to outplay
doubles specialist Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands 3-6, 6-4, 6-4
after almost two hours.
	   Also Monday, eighth-seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat
Australian Andrew Ilie 6-4, 6-4, France's Guillaume Raoux defeated
Mikael Tillstroem of Sweden 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), home-crowd
favorite Jiri Novak rallied to beat wild card holder Nicolas Kiefer
of Germany 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 7-6 (7-2) and Wayne Black of Zimbabwe
overpowered Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-3.
	   The tournament's favorite, second seed Andre Agassi of the
United States, is scheduled to play his first-round match against
Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen Wednesday.

	   KUTAISI, Georgia (AP) _ Mutinous soldiers in Georgia surrendered
to government troops after a one-day revolt Monday and agreed to
return to their garrison after clashes near the country's
second-largest city that killed at least one soldier.
	   The rebel troops released two government officials they had
taken hostage and gave up control of a village they had seized in
this mountainous former Soviet republic, according to Teimuraz
Shashiashvili, governor of the region.
	   More than 200 soldiers fiercely opposed to President Eduard
Shevardnadze took over their garrison in the western town of Senaki
on Monday and advanced toward the heart of Georgia, blocking roads
with stolen tanks, trucks and machine guns. Government troops
poured into the area to defend it.
	   Shevardnadze, who has survived assassination attempts and
several rebellions, put Georgian troops on combat readiness, said
presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.
	   Shevardnadze demanded that the mutinous soldiers lay down their
weapons and return to their barracks, and he threatened force if
they refused.
	   Troops were sent to intercept rebels on the road to Georgia's
second-largest city, Kutaisi, but were forced to retreat. Rebels
seized the village of Gubi, just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from
Kutaisi, police said.
	   About 50 civilians joined the rebels in Gubi, police said. Small
groups of civilians were also fleeing villages and towns taken over
by rebels.
	   After talks with government negotiators, the rebel troops agreed
to return to their garrison at Senaki, Shashiashvili said.
	   ``Georgia today has escaped civil war,'' he said.
	   One government soldier was killed in fighting around the town of
Khoni, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Khutaisi, and two were
wounded, said Health Minister Avtandil Dzhorbenadze.
	   At least four rogue troops were killed when government troops
destroyed a tank they had been driving, military officials said. It
was unclear whether the rebels suffered any other casualties.
	   Another group of mutinous soldiers blocked two roads leading
westward to the Black Sea port city of Poti with seven of the
stolen tanks, but they also surrendered, Shashiashvili said.
	   ``It would be unjustified irresponsibility on the part of
Georgia's president and the defense minister if we allowed that
heavy machinery and vehicles with armed adventurers into Georgia's
second-largest city,'' Shevardnadze said in a national television
address.
	   Security was tightened around key buildings in Tbilisi, the
capital, including the government headquarters, parliament and
broadcasting center.
	   The soldiers stole 10 tanks, two armored personnel carriers, and
more than 50 machine guns from their garrison, Abashidze said.
	   The soldiers shot at the car of a government official coming to
talk to them, but no one was wounded, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Georgian Defense Minister Maj. Gen. David Tevzadze and the
Minister of State Security, Lt. Gen. Dzhemal Gakhokidze, were both
sent to the scene.
	   Shashiashvili, who also took part in the talks, said he was
briefly detained by rebels, but then allowed to leave.
	   The mutiny was being led by Akakiy Eliava, a military commander
who is also a supporter of the late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia,
Abashidze said.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1994.
	   His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.
Shevardnadze blames Gamsakhurdia's supporters for the Feb. 9 attack
on his motorcade that left two of Shevardnadze's bodyguards dead.
At least eight suspects have been arrested.
	   The speaker of the Georgian parliament, Zurab Zhvaniya, said the
rebels were demanding the restoration of Gamsakhurdia's parliament.
He said the rebels issued a statement warning Russian troops not to
intervene.
	   Several foreign leaders have telephoned Shevardnadze to express
support, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Russia's Foreign
Ministry issued a statement appealing for settling the conflict
peacefully.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Germany's new government is expected to be younger and include
more women _ five instead of two _ than the outgoing center-right
administration. A look at Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's
likely Cabinet choices:
 &UR; FOREIGN:
	   Joschka Fischer, 50, Greens, also to be vice chancellor. Once
leftist radical, has steadily nudged the environmentalist party
away from pacifist roots and toward power. Committed by Schroeder
to continuity in foreign policy. Wore white sneakers when sworn in
as Hesse state environment minister in 1985, now prefers designer
suits.
 &UR; FINANCE:
	   Oskar Lafontaine, 54, Social Democrat party chief. Competes with
Schroeder for power. Supports strong social welfare state, but also
fiscal discipline. Wants to give average earners more spending
power to boost the economy and fight unemployment.
 &UR; INTERIOR:
	   Otto Schily, 66, Social Democrat. Defense attorney for left-wing
terrorists in the 1970s. Now in line to oversee federal law
enforcement. So strong on law and order that party liberals
mistrust him.

expert. Pledges no major changes in defense policy. Has been
party's leader in parliament.
 &UR; ENVIRONMENT

power plants. Bicycles to work, now will use armored limousine.
 &UR; LABOR:
	   Walter Riester, 55, Social Democrat. Deputy head of Germany's
biggest industrial union, IG Metall. Schroeder's point man for
planned talks with industry on combating unemployment.
 &UR; ECONOMY:
	   Werner Mueller, 52, non-partisan. Hastily joined Cabinet on
Monday after withdrawal of Schroeder's first choice, computer
entrepreneur Jost Stollmann, who called for radical welfare-state
reforms. Former power industry executive who has advised Schroeder
on energy policy.
 &UR; HEALTH:
	   Andrea Fischer, 38, Greens. Youngest Cabinet member, practices
saxophone after dark in her lawmaker's office in Bonn. Party expert
on social affairs.
 &UR; CONSTRUCTION-TRANSPORTATION:
	   Franz Muentefering, 58, Social Democrat. Managed party's
election campaign. Oversees final phase of government's return to
prewar capital Berlin next year.

former communist East Germany. Wants more liberal parental leave
laws.

Opposition coalition claims victory over incumbents in Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

latest from party headquarters, other &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition claimed victory
Monday in Macedonia's parliamentary elections, but the ex-communist
incumbents disputed the claim and appeared to be backed by
electoral officials.
	   The two rival camps, ruling Social Democrats and a reformist
opposition coalition, both claimed their tally of the votes was
correct under Macedonia's complicated counting system. But the
state electoral officials hinted late Monday they would side with
the incumbents' interpretation.
	   The dispute could lead to political tension in Macedonia, the
only former Yugoslav republic which gained independence without
bloodshed in 1992. The opposition _ the ultranationalist VMRO-DPMNE
and The Democratic Alternative _ indicated it would not give up
their proclaimed triumph.
	   Official results are required by law to be released by Tuesday,
but delays were feared.
	   Under the complex procedure, only about a third of the 120
legislative seats were up for grabs in Sunday's vote. The rest will
be determined in a second round of voting Nov. 1.
	   The opposition, led by former top Yugoslav official Vasil
Tupurkovski, said it had secured 44 seats in the assembly. But the
ruling Social Democrats contended the opposition total was only 15
_ the same as their own. They cited a requirement that turnout in
each municipality must be at least a third of registered voters.
	   State electoral officials did not announce any results, but
commission chief Ljiljana Ristova appeared briefly before reporters
to offer the commission's interpretation of the dispute, which
supported the incumbents'.
	   Ethnic Albanian parties said they had won 22 seats.
	   The incumbents led the country peacefully to independence from
Yugoslavia. But the opposition coalition, comprised of younger
politicians, is striving for radical political and economic
reforms.
	   ``This is a great victory and we hope for an even better outcome
in the second round,'' Ljuben Paunovski, the opposition coalition's
spokesman told Macedonian television.
	   Media reported that the latest unofficial turnout figure was as
high as 70 percent. The Macedonian election commission reported no
serious irregularities at the polls.
	   The representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the vote, reported a
``significant improvement'' compared to the previous election in
1994.
	   Mark Power Stevens, head of the 180-person mission, said his
teams noted some problems and incidents in the election campaign,
but that the overall atmosphere was satisfactory.
	   After the second round, parliament seats are to be distributed
according to a combined system _ 85 seats are to follow a majority
model while the remaining 35 would be distributed on a proportional
basis among parties whose candidates have won at least 5 percent of
the votes.
	   A total of 38 parties contested the elections, all focusing on
the country's economic woes during the campaign.
	   Macedonia, with a population of about 2 million, was the poorest
of all six republics in the former Yugoslav federation and its
economy remains feeble with 30 percent unemployment and an average
salary of dlrs 210 a month.
	   Situated near the volatile Serbian province of Kosovo in
Yugoslavia, Macedonia has disputes with all of its neighbors, and a
restive ethnic Albanian minority.

New German chancellor accused of abandoning his `new center'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks finished, no details released &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Having campaigned as a new-style,
business-friendly Social Democrat, Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder is finding it hard to stick to his ``new center''
approach under pressure from his party's traditional left-wing.
	   Hours before he was to finalize his Cabinet list Monday, the
political outsider Schroeder wanted as economics minister said he
wouldn't take the job.
	   Jost Stollmann, a millionaire computer entrepreneur, said he was
unhappy with plans to take European economic policy from his
bailiwick and give it to the Finance Ministry.
	   He also attacked the left-leaning government agenda sealed over
the weekend by the Social Democrats and their junior partner, the
Greens, saying it would result in higher tax burdens on small
firms.
	   ``This country needs a policy of modernization and renewal,'' he
said. ``I hope that Schroeder will be able to push through his
ideas of the `new center' because that is the right kind of
policy.''
	   The coalition partners ended their final round of talks late
Monday saying the agreement was finished, although they still had a
few deputy secretary posts to fill. Details were to be released
when the deal is signed Tuesday.
	   At a news conference earlier, Schroeder played down Stollmann's
complaints, saying he as future chancellor had to take a bigger
picture view of government policy.

Russian lawmakers suggest Yugoslavia join ex-Soviet defense union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new last graf with new Yugoslav ambassador to Russia,
Milosevic's brother, arriving in Moscow. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslavia should join a mutual defense pact among
former Soviet republics to deter possible NATO airstrikes, Russian
lawmakers suggested Monday.
	   A Russian parliamentary delegation that has just returned from
southern Yugoslavia's Kosovo province also said Russia should
provide military assistance to the government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``Since we have such close, friendly political relations with
Yugoslavia, it would be strange not to increase economic
cooperation, including military and technological cooperation ...
so that in the face of NATO threats Yugoslavia has something to
defend itself with,'' said Nikolai Bezborodov, deputy head of
parliament's defense committee.
	   Russia shares Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion
with Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and strongly
opposes NATO's proposed airstrikes.
	   Western governments have warned that NATO might take military
action against Yugoslavia following its crackdown against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Twelve former Soviet republics _ all except the Baltics _ signed
a deal on mutual defense aid when they formed a loose coalition
after the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Seeking to expand Russia's international influence, some Russian
politicians have been suggesting that other countries also join.
	   Lawmakers also said Yugoslavia should join a closer union
between Russia and Belarus.
	   The idea was proposed by the leader of the Serbian Radical
Party, Vojislav Seselj, lawmakers told a joint news conference.
	   ``It would be the most adequate response'' to NATO's potential
strikes against Serbia, said Sergei Baburin, hard-line deputy
speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, who led
lawmakers' delegation to Kosovo.
	   ``We have received full proof that NATO wants to be the
policeman of Europe,'' Baburin added.
	   The Russian delegation will recommend that parliament attempt to
send military aid to Yugoslavia, lawmakers said.
	   However, Russia's foreign and defense policy is controlled by
President Boris Yeltsin, and parliament has little say in the
matter.
	   The proposals for military aid came as delegation members
expressed doubts that an agreement reached last week would hold.
	   Even as they praised Russia's role in bringing about the
agreement, lawmakers warned that without further progress, NATO may
go ahead with airstrikes.
	   ``If this pause is not filled with real negotiations, the
possibility of the resumption on the crisis would be very high,''
said pro-government lawmaker Vladimir Lukin.
	   Echoing their leaders in Moscow, a group of leftist party bosses
in the Ural Mountains have presented a letter to the U.S. and
British consuls in the region, protesting ``aggressive actions by
the United States and NATO,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``We demand an end to political and diplomatic violence, as well
as blackmail, in talks with the Yugoslav leaders,'' read the
statement by the Ural branches of the Russian Communist Workers
Party, the Union of Soviet Officers, and the Working Urals
movement, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Also Monday, the new Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow arrived in
the Russian capital. Borislav Milosevic is the brother of the
Yugoslav president.

Former Chilean dictator says he'll fight extradition and win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with new info and quotes throughout &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet
vowed from his hospital bed Monday to fight attempts to extradite
him to Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, and
said in a statement issued by his lawyers that he is confident of
winning.
	   Chile's ambassador delivered a formal protest to the Foreign
Office, declaring Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity by placing him under arrest at a Spanish magistrate's
request.
	   Spain, meanwhile, increased the charges to genocide _ for which
there is no diplomatic immunity.
	   In the statement issued through his lawyers _ his first public
comment since police arrested him in his bed Friday night _
Pinochet said he would resolutely oppose extradition.
	   ``Upon his arrival he was treated as a VIP,'' said the statement
by the London law firm Kingsley Napley. ``Permission for him to
enter and stay in this country was stamped in his diplomatic
passport.''
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized for as
long as two more weeks, now faces a long battle through British
courts to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who
instigated the extradition proceedings, and a humiliating
appearance before London's Bow Street magistrate's court.
	   Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture and other human
rights abuses against political opponents.
	   A Chilean government report after he left office said 4,299
political opponents were killed or vanished during his rule. He
remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March.
	   Both Britain and Chile appear ready to dig in for a long
dispute.
	   After a 70-minute meeting at the Foreign Office ended in
deadlock, Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza told reporters that Chile
is trying to protect its institutions.
	   Pinochet is immune from prosecution in Chile as a
senator-for-life, and he arrived here on a diplomatic passport.
	   ``The government of Chile is not trying to shield Mr. Pinochet
from the wrath of the law,'' the ambassador said. ``This is really
a matter of international law and processes.''
	   Britain says diplomatic immunity is reserved for accredited
diplomats or foreign government officials on official visits, which
doesn't cover Pinochet.
	   Artaza said that Pinochet, who underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9,
did not fully appreciate what was happening when he woke to find
police in his room with the arrest warrant.
	   ``He was under sedation and he had been interrupted from his
sleep,'' Artaza said. ``He didn't understand what was going on and
the doctors treating him were taken out from his room.''
	   In Spain on Monday, the lead magistrate in the case, Baltasar
Garzon, widened the basis of his original detention request to
include charges of genocide, torture and murder in the
disappearance of 94 people, mostly Chileans.
	   The original arrest warrant was for questioning about an
unspecified number of Spaniards who were killed or vanished in the
first decade after Pinochet seized power in 1973.
	   Lawmakers of the opposition Conservative Party charged Prime
Minister Tony Blair's 18-month-old Labor Party government with
``gesture politics.''
	   In Conservative government days, Pinochet was welcomed on
regular visits that included having tea with former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and staying in a five-star hotel. He had also,
unlike other Latin American leaders, supported Britain in its 1982
war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands.
	   Tory legislator Alan Clark, a former defense minister, called
the arrest ``monstrous.''
	   ``It shows that if something's politically correct, or they deem
it to be, the government will simply fall over themselves to
appease any particular lobby,'' Clark said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
	   The move appeared to be popular, however. Most callers to a Sky
TV phone-in Monday supported Pinochet's arrest, and newspapers
carried detailed accounts of killings and torture in Chile in the
'70s and '80s.
	   London's liberal Guardian newspaper commented that Pinochet's
``discreet love affair with England'' had gone horribly wrong.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The status Monday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's
deadline _ pushed back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of
airstrikes for his crackdown in Kosovo:
	   _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   A new wave of violence over the weekend killed three Serb
policemen and wounded two, and both sides claimed a series of
attacks by the other that could not be independently confirmed.
	   No fullscale fighting has occurred in a month, but the weekend
violence brought more Serb army troops into central Kosovo on
Monday.
	   _ Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before the
crackdown began Feb. 28:
	   NATO spy planes continued flying over Kosovo to check on the
status of pullouts. NATO says more Serb troops and police remain in
the province than are permitted.
	   Troops based in Pristina who were deployed in central Kosovo on
Sunday and Monday are allowed to be in the province.
	   _ Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for the start of talks has been announced. The two sides
have been holding separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill.
	   _ Help refugees return to their homes:
	   Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many
remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in
massacres of civilians.
	   _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   The U.N. refugee agency postponed two convoys Monday to assess
the security situation after the weekend violence. It said it
planned to send out the postponed convoys on Tuesday, along with
two other scheduled convoys.
	   _ Cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav visas and
plan to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _ Allowing 2,000 international monitors into Kosovo to verify
that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   An advance team for the monitors, to be overseen by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, arrived
Saturday. OSCE officials in Pristina said 25 team members were in
the province as of midday Monday.

Former fund manager faces criminal charge in investment scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former fund manager at Morgan Grenfell has been
charged with conspiracy to defraud as part of a scandal that cost
the investment bank millions, the Serious Fraud Office said Monday.
	   Peter Young was released on conditional bail to appear back in
the City of London magistrates court on Nov. 10.
	   He was charged under the Financial Services Act along with three
others, Stewart Armer, Erik Langaker and Jan Helge Johnsen. Court
papers did not provide any additional information about the other
three men, and no one from Morgan Grenfell could be reached for
comment.
	   Young got into trouble by filling three big investment funds
with stocks that were of uncertain value because they were not
traded on any exchange.
	   Morgan Grenfell vastly overestimated the value of the funds, and
a crisis erupted when investors learned about the irregularities
and began panic-selling in September 1996.
	   Trading in the funds was halted for three days and resumed only
after Morgan Grenfell's parent company, Germany's Deutsche Bank,
paid 180 million pounds (dlrs 293 million) to buy some of the
questionable stocks and bring the funds into compliance with London
regulations.
	   Morgan Grenfell eventually was fined a record 2 million pounds
(dlrs 3.25 million) and had to repay 200 million pounds (dlrs 325
million) to investors.

Iraq steps up campaign against U.N. monitors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials lashed out at U.N. arms
monitors Monday, saying that they act unprofessionally and in one
case turned on music and danced as they examined a missile
production site.
	   Iraq repeatedly has accused U.N. weapons inspectors of espionage
and on Aug. 5 ordered an end to surprise inspections by the arms
experts, effectively banning all searches for elements of its past
weapons programs.
	   Iraq has recently mounted a campaign to discredit the remaining
inspectors, who are only allowed to visit weapons sites where the
United Nations already has surveillance equipment installed.
	   One Iraqi official, Kahlil Hameed, accused the monitors of
turning on cassette recorders and dancing in August while examining
a missile site.
	   Hammed also said monitors used their personal cameras to take
photographs of civilians, passing cars and visitors to the missile
production site that he administers.
	   Iraqi authorities arranged the interview with Hameed to back up
accusations by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that the inspectors
engaged in espionage. Aziz made that claim in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan released Saturday.
	   U.N. weapons officials in Baghdad were not available for
comment.
	   Sudat Mohammed of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate,
which coordinates activities for the remaining 40 inspectors in
Iraq, said that some inspectors carried cameras and photographed
army movements and activities in and around Iraqi weapons sites.
	   ``Incidents like this unfortunately indicate that the inspectors
use the authority and mandate given to them in a bad manner to
collect information,'' Mohammed said.
	   In a related development, the official Iraqi News Agency said
Monday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his cabinet reviewed
the inspections.
	   The cabinet also reviewed contacts with Annan to resolve the
current row over spot inspections, the agency reported.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions against
Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will
not be lifted until the inspectors verify that Baghdad has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.

Tyson tells commission `Please don't torture me'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with 25 grafs to UPDATE with more detail; Ali comments. &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson pleaded with boxing officials Monday
to stop ``torturing'' him and allow him to return to the sport he
once dominated.
	   Tyson told the Nevada Athletic Commission that he has suffered
enough for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a title fight
last year and that he needs to box to make a living. Muhammad Ali
agreed, testifying that Tyson has made mistakes but deserves
another chance.
	   ``There are only a few punishments worse than being denied a
right to make a living,'' Ali said in a statement read by his wife,
Lonnie, who sat next to the ailing boxing great. Ali was banned
from the sport for 3 1/2 years for refusing military induction.
	   In one pointed exchange with commissioner James Nave, Tyson said
he was humiliated by the hearing and the psychological tests the
commission told him to undergo last month.
	   ``Please don't torture me any longer, sir,'' Tyson said. ``I
made a mistake. Other fighters have made more.
	   ``I'm just a human being trying to live my life.''
	   With a couple of hundred people watching, Tyson said he has no
one to blame but himself for biting Holyfield, but he once again
said he was reacting to what he thought were intentional head-butts
from the champion.
	   Tyson also denied accusations that he punched and kicked two men
following a fender-bender in Maryland in August. The commission has
said that the case, set for trial in December, is important to its
decision on whether to give the boxer back the license it revoked
when he bit Holyfield.
	   ``I'm not going to kill anybody. I'm not a mass murderer,''
Tyson told the commissioners when asked about his ability to
control his temper.
	   His wife, Monica, who was in the car with Tyson, told the
commission she never saw her husband hit anybody following the
accident.
	   Tyson's hearing came one month after he was told to undergo the
psychological tests to help the officials make their decision.
	   The doctors who examined Tyson tried to reassure the
commissioners that the fighter most likely won't snap again in the
ring, a conclusion they outlined in their report, released last
week.
	   Dr. Ronald Schouten, one of five doctors who examined Tyson at
Massachusetts General Hospital, told the commissioners Monday that
the boxer's low self-esteem was a ``chronic situation'' but that he
could be helped through treatment.
	   He said Tyson was so upset by losing his license that he most
likely would not do anything to jeopardize it in the future.
	   ``The impact of losing his license has been devastating,''
Schouten said. ``He wants his job back.''
	   Tyson lawyer James Jimmerson opened the hearing by reminding the
commissioners that his client has done everything asked of him. He
said Tyson was approaching the hearing with a sense of ``honesty,
fairness and doing the right thing.''
	   ``You have his livelihood and his life in your hands,''
Jimmerson said.
	   Tyson sat next to his wife, Monica, at a table in front of the
commissioners. He stared at the doctors intently as they testified
and occasionally leaned over to whisper to his wife, a physician.
	   If he gets his boxing license back, Tyson will fight once again
_ perhaps as early as December. A loss will put him out of the
sport for at least another year.
	   Tyson is taking a calculated gamble he can get three votes from
the five-member commission to resurrect a career that seemed doomed
after he bit Holyfield 15 months ago.
	   ``I don't know, but I'm hopeful,'' Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel
said before the hearing. ``I think our chances are better than they
were before.''
	   The five-day exam was what commissioners wanted when they
recessed a six-hour hearing Sept. 19 without making a decision on
Tyson's license.
	   But a clean bill of mental health won't be enough to get Tyson
back the license that was revoked when he also comes with questions
about a Maryland traffic altercation still hanging over his head _
questions that he refused to answer in his first Nevada hearing a
month ago; questions that will have to be answered if he is going
to fight again.
	   Tyson's advisers pushed for the earliest possible hearing so
that Tyson could fight before the end of the year, probably Dec. 5
at the MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
	   If the gamble fails, he will be banned from the sport for at
least another year _ a crippling blow for an aging heavyweight who
owes the Internal Revenue Service dlrs 13 million in unpaid taxes
despite having made more than dlrs 100 million in purses since his
release from prison in 1995.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ While hundreds of people cheered,
24 army officers convicted of participating in last year's bloody
coup were hooded, tied to poles and executed by soldiers shooting
volleys of machine-gun fire.
	   Repeated rounds of gunfire were needed to kill some of those
executed, who included two former chiefs of defense staff and Col.
F.Y. Koroma, the brother of former junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny
Paul Koroma, who has gone into hiding with the remnants of his
ousted forces.
	   The former soldiers were dressed in black shorts and black
short-sleeved shirts _ except for the one woman, Major Kula Samba,
who wore a green checked dress.
	   A hood was placed on each person's head as they stepped out of
an armored vehicle at a military barracks a few miles (kilometers)
west of Freetown, then each was walked to one of the 24 poles, set
in large drums and lined up on a rifle range. The group was shot
together.
	   Hundreds of local residents cheered as the shots rang out, and
some shouted ``well done and thank you!''
	   Journalists were also allowed to witness the executions, which
took place at the Juba 7th Battalion military barracks.
	   Later, hundreds of civilians lined the streets of Freetown to
try to catch a glimpse of trucks carrying the corpses to a
cemetery.
	   Those executed were among 34 officers sentenced to die by a
military court last week for crimes linked to the May 25, 1997 coup
that toppled President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. The remaining 10
officers had their death sentences commuted to prison terms, an
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The punishments were carried out despite international appeals
for clemency by human rights groups and foreign governments.
	   ``We understand the demand within Sierra Leone for justice to be
seen to be done following the appalling and brutal butchery carried
out under the junta,'' Foreign Office minister Tony Lloyd said in a
statement, noting his telephone appeals for clemency had been
rejected. ``But the country needs to embark on a proper process of
reconciliation.''
	   England, the former colonial ruler of Sierra Leone, became
embroiled in a dispute earlier this year over the extent to which
official assistance had been given to the Sandline International
British military consulting group, which helped restore Kabbah to
power.
	   Sierra Leonean law does not allow convicted military officers a
chance to appeal and only the president can overturn their
sentences.
	   The development came as another 16 civilians were convicted
Monday in a Freetown High Court on treason, murder and arson
charges linked to the coup. Three people were found not guilty in
the case. Sentencing was postponed until Tuesday.
	   The latest ruling brings the number of convicted junta
collaborators to 34 civilians and 34 military officers _ who face
likely execution by firing squad or hanging. A number of other
suspects remain on trial and hundreds languish in prison without
being charged.
	   The most prominent treason accused is former rebel leader Foday
Sankoh, who was allied with the junta and appeared in court last
week facing charges including crimes against humanity.
	   Although the elected president's return to power early this year
was hailed as a victory for democracy in West Africa, fighting
between Kabbah's forces and ousted junta fighters and their rebel
allies continues in the east of the country.
	   Kabbah was returned to power by a Nigerian-led West African
intervention force.

	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) _ Russian junior Marat Safin upset
top-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-2 Monday in the
first round of the dlrs 1 million Czech Indoor tournament.
	   Korda started the match with several unforced errors and soon
lost his serve to the 18-year-old Safin.
	   Safin gained a 3-1 lead and easily won the first set,
capitalizing on his powerful serve and clever play at the net.
	   Safin wasted no time in the second set, beating Korda in less
than 30 minutes.

lost his third consecutive first-round match in an ATP event and

Nine parties to contest Nigerian elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nine parties, including Nigeria's largest
opposition groups, have been allowed to register for local
elections in December _ a forerunner to this West African country's
ground-breaking presidential polling early next year, officials
said Monday.
	   National Electoral Commission chairman Ephraim Omukese Akpata
told journalists that the nine registered parties had fulfilled
criteria ensuring they have measurable support around Nigeria,
which since colonial times has been fiercely divided along ethnic
and regional lines.
	   Another 14 parties were excluded from running in the December 5
local government elections and the February 27 presidential poll
because they were too small or failed other requirements, Akpata
said without elaborating.
	   ``All the parties that are registered have scaled the ladder
that constituted the commission's screening exercise,'' Akpata said
during the brief announcement.
	   He took no questions from journalists and there was no immediate
reaction from the parties.
	   Registration for parties and voters ended Monday evening despite
complaints of a scarcity of registration materials that prevented
large numbers of people from signing up.
	   Officials said more people may be given the chance to register
in January prior to the presidential elections.
	   Since taking power in July, military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar has promised a sweeping democratic transition resulting in
a handover of power to elected civilians by the end of May.
	   There are no early favorites and many people are expected to
vote on regional and ethnic lines. Nigeria's military leaders,
primarily Muslims who hail from the north, have ruled the country
for all but 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   Abubakar took over in early June following the sudden death of
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   The mainly Christian south, where most of the country's oil
wealth is found, has long complained of military corruption and
misrule that has drained the region's resources and left many
people miserably poor.
	   Among the most well-known parties registered are the Alliance
for Democracy, a party believed to have strong support in Nigeria's
Yoruba-speaking southwest. It is led by Bola Ige, former governor
of the western state of Oyo.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party, led by Nigeria's last civilian
vice-president Alex Akwueme, is strong in the north and east of the
country. Akwueme's administration lost 1993 elections that were
later annulled by the military.
	   Another group with northern support is the Peoples' Redemption
Party, led by Balarabe Musa, the respected former civilian governor
of Kaduna state.
	   Based in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, Democratic
Advancement Movement led by former presidential candidate Tunji
Braithwaite is running on a platform of ensuring the rule of law is
upheld in Nigeria.
	   The other registered parties are: the All Peoples' Party, the
United Democratic Movement, the United Peoples' Party, the Movement
for Democracy and Justice, the National Solidarity Movement and the
Peoples' Redemption Party.

Puerto Rican capitol gets its fourth new newspaper in 18 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Puerto Rican capital's fourth
new daily newspaper in 18 months hit the stands Monday, joining a
rough-and-tumble race for readers in this U.S. territory.
	   El Mundo (The World) debuted with 96 pages and a cover story
focusing on reconstruction following Hurricane Georges. It is San
Juan's seventh newspaper.
	   The explosion in newspapers has been accompanied by a dogfight
of lawsuits as publishers spar over advertising, circulation
figures and government influence while gearing up for one of their
biggest stories of the decade _ a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's
relationship with the United States.
	   El Mundo is the third Puerto Rican newspaper to carry the name
and a globe logo. The original El Mundo published from 1917 to
1988, was resurrected in 1989 and closed again in 1990.
	   In an editorial introducing the newspaper, publisher Gaspar Roca
called the debut ``a risky venture.''
	   ``We have spared no effort to offer this newspaper to the good
and generous people of Puerto Rico,'' he wrote. Roca's Caribbean
International News Inc. also owns El Vocero, another daily.
	   In 1997, the island's English-language newspaper, The San Juan
Star, launched a Spanish edition. It later started an afternoon
newspaper, The Star Extra, and three regional editions.
	   They have been joined on news racks by Primera Hora, a color
newspaper published by El Nuevo Dia, the island's largest daily.

	   JESSE, Nigeria _ At least 500 people were killed in a fireball
in Nigeria when a gasoline pipeline exploded as thieves were
stealing from it, officials said Monday.
	   With dozens of charred, unidentified bodies littering the town
and flames still occasionally flaring, authorities began burying
those killed as converged on Jesse, 300 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Lagos, to search for remains of their loved ones.
	   ``It is finished,'' cried Charity Unurhoro, after finding the
horribly burned bodies of her mother and brother. ``Now everything
is over for me.''
	   As she cried, a man told a young relative to fetch a wheelbarrow
to take the corpses home for burial.
	   The fire, which began Saturday as the residents scooped gasoline
spilling from a pipeline, killed at least 500 people and left at
least 100 hospitalized, military officials said.
	   Some corpses _ including those of some children _ were found
clutching plastic cups, funnels and cans to collect the fuel.
	   The charred body of one woman was found with her dead baby
strapped to her back. Many other victims were farmers and villagers
sleeping in their homes.
	   	   A huge grave was being dug at the edge of the town to bury
hundreds of unidentified corpses, many burned beyond recognition.
	   Separate burials were held Monday for at least 52 of the dead,
and dozens more people took corpses of relatives home.
	   Firefighters, meanwhile, continued to battle the blaze, which
was largely under control but flared occasionally. While flames
from the fire had spread to nearby villages, all the victims were
apparently in Jesse.
	   Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar flew in by helicopter
for a 15-minute visit. He said the government would pay for medical
treatment, but that there would be no compensation to survivors,
apparently because many of those killed were apparently stealing
fuel.
	   But residents were furious over the deaths.
	   ``This is a tragedy of huge proportions,'' the Rev. Andrew
Imadu, a local minister, said at one funeral in Jesse. ``Our own
people have been driven by deprivation to such a desperate search
for livelihood.''
	   Southeastern Nigeria, while rich in oil, is scarred by decades
of poverty and villagers in some areas are believed to regularly
sabotage oil pipelines in order to file claims for compensation.
	   The surface pipeline links a refinery in the southeastern city
of Warri, 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Lagos, with the
northern city of Kaduna, nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles) away.
	   Over the weekend, hundreds of people arrived in Jesse as rumors
spread that a huge pool of gasoline _ which had spilled from the
pipeline into a concrete well _ was available for the taking,
according to J.I. Ogude, village chief of Jesse.
	   The gasoline theft, known as ``bunkering,'' had started as early
as Saturday morning, he said.
	   People at the scene, who Ogude said came from at least seven
villages, were preparing to sell the gasoline on the black market.
	   An official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed the pipeline
had been deliberately punctured, and that the thieves' tools had
sparked the explosion.
	   But some newspaper reports said a carelessly discarded cigarette
may have been the cause of what witnesses said started as a loud
roar followed by high flames spreading over the oily slick.
	   Ogude said government petroleum officials knew of the scavengers
and had tried to frighten them with a hovering helicopter on
Saturday.
	   When that failed, police had been sent to disperse the crowd,
but they arrived too late, seeing the explosion as they neared the
village, he said.
	   Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost constant fuel
shortages, causing skyrocketing black-market prices and long lines
at gas pumps.

	   ``I want to warn you, from my view, this will be your last
chance,'' Ghanem said. ``You will either conduct yourself in
accordance with our rules and regulations, or you will probably
never fight again in Nevada.''
	   Muhammad Ali and basketball great Magic Johnson testified on the
boxer's behalf, saying that despite all of Tyson's problems he
should be allowed to return to the ring.
	   ``There are only a few punishments worse than being denied a
right to make a living,'' Ali said in a statement read by his wife,
Lonnie, who sat next to the ailing boxing great. Ali was banned
from the sport for 3 1/2 years for refusing military induction.
	   In one pointed exchange with commissioner James Nave, Tyson said
he was humiliated by the hearing and the psychological tests the
commission told him to undergo last month.
	   ``Please don't torture me any longer, sir,'' Tyson said. ``I
made a mistake. Other fighters have made more.
	   ``I'm just a human being trying to live my life.''
	   With a couple of hundred people watching in the commissioners'
hearing room, Tyson said he has no one to blame but himself for
biting Holyfield, but he once again said he was reacting to what he
thought were intentional head-butts from the champion.

	   Tyson lawyer James Jimmerson opened the hearing by reminding the
commissioners that his client has done everything asked of him and
urging them to meet him halfway. He said Tyson approached the
hearing with a sense of ``honesty, fairness and doing the right
thing.''
	   Tyson, wearing a black sports coat and white dress shirt, sat
next to his wife, Monica, at a table in front of the commissioners.
He stared at the doctors intently as they testified and
occasionally leaned over to whisper to his wife, a physician.
	   Tyson's advisers pushed for the earliest possible hearing so
that Tyson could fight before the end of the year, probably Dec. 5
at the MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
	   The boxer owes the Internal Revenue Service dlrs 13 million
despite having made more than dlrs 100 million in purses since his
release from prison in 1995.
	   But there are more potential problems ahead for the boxer. He is
still on probation for his rape conviction, and could be sent back
to prison if convicted on the assault charges from the car
accident.
	   ``The bigger problem is he'll go to jail,'' Tyson spokesman
Peter Seligman said. ``Then none of this matters.''

Gadhafi begins surprise visit to Tunisia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi began a
surprise visit to neighboring Tunisia on Monday, at the invitation
of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, officials said.
	   Col. Gadhafi, whose country is under a U.N. air embargo, arrived
by land for ``a visit of brotherhood and rest,'' an official
statement said.
	   Officials, however, did not say how long or exactly where
Gadhafi would stay during his visit. The trip was not announced in
advance, though Ben Ali extended the invitation to Gadhafi when he
visited Libya in August.
	   Gadhafi first drove to Gabes, 365 kms (200 miles) south of
Tunis, after crossing the border at Ras Jedir where he was met by
Interior Minister Ali Chaouch, officials said.
	   The Libyan leader last visited Tunisia in January 1996, when he
met Ban Ali in the southern town of Medenine.
	   Since 1992, Libya has struggled with U.N. Security Council
sanctions that ban direct flights to and from the country. The move
was aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland,
that killed 270 people.
	   The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns
the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according to Scottish
law in the Netherlands.

Turkmenistan to privatize 48 state-owned companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Asian nation of Turkmenistan will try
to sell 48 government-owned companies at a privatization auction
Saturday, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
	   The report did not say what kind of businesses were to be sold.
	   Of the 4,800 state-run companies slated for privatization since
Turkmenistan gained independence with the 1991 Soviet collapse,
just 1,933 have moved to private hands, according to Turkmenistan's
National Statistics and Forecasting Institute.
	   The institute said privatization has lagged recently because the
government was mainly selling off unprofitable businesses that
require costly modernization and was setting too high a price for
them, Interfax said.
	   Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic on the Caspian Sea, has
been slow to develop its economy, and remains largely impoverished,
despite vast oil reserves.

Tyson gets license back from Nevada commission

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson was given his boxing license back
Monday after pleading with officials to stop the ``torture'' and
allow him to return to the sport he once dominated.
	   Tyson told the Nevada Athletic Commission that he has suffered
enough for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a title fight
last year and that he needs to box to make a living.
	   Chairman Elias Ghanem said Tyson had made many mistakes in his
life but deserved another chance. The commission voted 4-1 to
restore the fighter's license.
	   Tyson was near tears when he heard that he could return to the
ring, as his supporters hugged him and patted his back.
	   ``I want to warn you, from my view, this will be your last
chance,'' Ghanem said. ``You will either conduct yourself in
accordance with our rules and regulations, or you will probably
never fight again in Nevada.''
	   Muhammad Ali and Magic Johnson testified on the boxer's behalf,
saying that despite all of Tyson's problems, he should be allowed
another chance.
	   ``There are only a few punishments worse than being denied a
right to make a living,'' Ali said in a statement read by his wife,
Lonnie, who sat next to the ailing boxing great. Ali was banned
from the sport for 3 1/2 years for refusing military induction.
	   In one pointed exchange with commissioner James Nave, Tyson said
he was humiliated by the hearing and the psychological tests the
commission told him to undergo last month.
	   ``Please don't torture me any longer, sir,'' Tyson told the
panel. ``I made a mistake. Other fighters have made more.
	   ``I'm just a human being trying to live my life.''
	   Tyson also denied accusations that he punched and kicked two men
following a fender-bender in Maryland in August.
	   ``I'm not going to kill anybody. I'm not a mass murderer,''
Tyson told the commissioners when asked about his ability to
control his temper.
	   In their report, released last week, the doctors concluded that
the former heavyweight champ was depressed but would probably
behave if allowed to fight again.
	   Dr. Ronald Schouten, one of a team of experts who examined Tyson
last month at Massachusetts General Hospital, told the
commissioners Monday that the boxer's low self-esteem was a
``chronic situation'' but that he could be helped through
treatment.
	   He said Tyson was so upset by losing his license that he most
likely would not do anything to jeopardize it in the future.
	   ``The impact of losing his license has been devastating,''
Schouten said. ``He wants his job back.''
	   Tyson lawyer James Jimmerson opened the hearing by reminding the
commissioners that his client has done everything asked of him and
urging them to meet him halfway. He said Tyson was approaching the
hearing with a sense of ``honesty, fairness and doing the right
thing.''
	   ``You have his livelihood and his life in your hands,''
Jimmerson said.
	   With his boxing license back, Tyson could fight again as early
as December. If the commission had turned him down, he would have
been out of the sport for at least another year.
	   The aging heavyweight owes the Internal Revenue Service dlrs 13
million in unpaid taxes despite having made more than dlrs 100
million in purses since his release from prison in 1995 after
serving time for rape.
	   At one point, Ghanem told Tyson that he shouldn't feel he's
being picked on.
	   ``Forgive me for thinking that,'' Tyson responded as the crowd
laughed. ``I love you all.''

Aid workers warn of refugees' plight in Guinea-Bissau, as fighting

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Aid workers warned Monday that their
operations could be disrupted in Guinea-Bissau following fresh
reports of fighting between rebels and loyalist troops as part of a
four-month-old dispute in the west African nation.
	   ``The violent fighting will seriously affect food distribution
throughout the country,'' World Food Program spokesman Wadgi Othman
told The Associated Press by phone from Abidjan, capital of Ivory
Coast.
	   Meanwhile, a peace commission, led by Bissau's Roman Catholic
Bishop Septimio Ferrazzetta, asked to meet the rebels in a bid to
halt the latest fighting and reestablish a truce, Portuguese radio
TSF said, adding that thousands of residents were still fleeing the
capital.
	   The WFP and three other United Nations' relief agencies arrived
in Guinea-Bissau in August to secure the free flow of aid to the
refugees.
	   ``Last month people had started returning to Bissau, but this
situation crushes all hope of going back,'' Othama said.
	   Fighting restarted late Sunday and continued Monday in the
capital Bissau, as army dissidents and troops backing President
Joao Bernardo Vieira exchanged artillery fire.
	   ``The fighting has spread to the capital and is focused near the
presidential palace,'' Ana Paula Zacarias, a spokeswoman for the
Portuguese Foreign Ministry, said.
	   There were no details on casualties.
	   The conflict, which erupted June 7 in the tiny former Portuguese
colony wedged between Senegal and Guinea, displaced most of
Bissau's population of 300,000 to inland areas.
	   Hostilities began when Brig. Ansumane Mane was dismissed as army
chief-of-staff for allegedly running arms to Senegal's Casamance
separatists.
	   The rebels, led by Mane, seized Bissau's main army garrison and
airport, accusing Vieira of corruption and demanding that he step
down.
	   On July 26, both sides agreed to a cease-fire and stood by it
again in subsequent talks, brokered by west African and
Portuguese-speaking negotiators.
	   But the truce has been sporadically violated. Last week, five
rebels and one Senegalese soldier reportedly died in one outbreak
of shooting.
	   No reliable numbers have been made available for the total
number of people who died in the fighting.

EU doubts whether it can respect WTO beef hormone plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-US-Trade &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union Commission said Monday it
will not be able to offer definitive scientific justification for a
ban on imports of hormone-treated beef within the deadline set by
the World Trade Organization.
	   But the EU's executive branch said that it still hoped to keep
U.S. hormone-treated beef out by collecting enough preliminary
scientific evidence by the May 13, 1999 target date.
	   The 15-nation EU has to meet that deadline to comply with a WTO
ruling on its 1989 ban on imports of hormone-treated beef, EU
officials said.
	   The EU launched new studies after the WTO - acting on complaints
by the United States and Canada - ruled last year that the
scientific basis of the EU ban on imports of hormone-treated beef
was not sound enough.
	   EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler told a regular meeting of EU
farm ministers that some of the results of the new studies into the
risks to human health posed by cattle growth hormones would not be
available until 2000, the officials said.
	   He said most of the results would be ready in 1999, but not
necessarily before next May 13, they added.
	   Nonetheless, Fischler said the Commission hopes to use
preliminary evidence from the studies to justify the ban by the WTO
compliance deadline, the officials said.
	   The remarks by Fischler came four and a half months after the
WTO ordered the Commission to comply by next May 13 to its ruling
that the EU hormone-treated beef import ban is illegal.
	   In response, the Commission said it would seek compliance by
changing the scientific justification for the ban rather than by
lifting it. To that end, it ordered in February eight independent
studies into the risks posed by six cattle growth hormones.
	   The EU import ban came after a 1988 ban on the use in the EU of
growth hormones in beef. The ban is based on concerns that the
hormones can cause cancer.
	   The U.S. cattle industry has said the EU import ban is costing
it dlrs 250 million a year in sales.

Champions Leeward Islands beat Guyana in Red Stripe Bowl final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OCHO RIOS, Jamaica (AP) _ Guyana squandered a good start and
faltered to 226 for seven off 50 overs against the Leeward Islands
at halftime Monday in the final of the Caribbean's Red Stripe Bowl
one-day cricket tournament.
	   The Guyanese lost their way in late innings after openers
Clayton Lambert and Andrew Gonsalves had posted 108 for the first
wicket in aggressive fashion. This after captain Carl Hooper had
won the toss and batted at the Kaiser Sports Club, near the
Jamaican resort of Ocho Rios.
	   Lambert was the dominant partner, punching 66 off 72 deliveries
in an innings that included one six and seven boundaries. The
lefthander looked in ominous form before being run out attempting a
quick single in the 23rd over.
	   Gonsalves played some attractive strokes but he also went via
the run-out route three overs later after making 41 which contained
six boundaries. Casually crossing for a single he was caught short
of his crease by a throw from Leewards captain Stuart Williams.
	   The remainder of the Guyanese batsmen failed to capitalize on
the good start given them by Lambert and Gonsalves. Though sharing
in a third wicket stand of 41, star batsmen Hooper (25) and
Shivnarine Chanderpaul (29) never looked threatening as the
Leewards fought their way back into contention through superb
fielding and good bowling.
	   Leading the attack for the Leewards, last year's Red Stripe
champions, was offspinner Anthony Lake who captured two wickets for
42 runs.
	   The Leewards won their way into the final after appealing the
Jamaica Cricket Board's decision that Trinidad and Tobago should
have contested the match.
	   Trinidad and Tobago were declared winners after Saturday's
semi-final against the Leewards was halted midway through the
Trinidadians' innings.
	   Match referee Hugh Perry ruled that Trinidad and Tobago were
winners of the match due to a superior run rate.
	   But the Leewards' management charged that Perry had used the
wrong formula to determine the run rate. Their appeal was upheld
late Sunday despite much confusion and controversy. Trinidad and
Tobago reportedly are considering taking legal action.

Parliament speaker's aide comes out of coma after shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An aide to the speaker of Russia's lower house of
parliament regained consciousness Monday three days after he was
shot in the head by an unidentified gunman, doctors said.
	   Mikhail Osherov remained in serious condition, the Interfax news
agency quoted Igor Yakovenko, chief doctor at the Polyenov
Neurosurgery Institute in St. Petersburg as saying.
	   ``Despite a certain improvement in his condition, it is out of
the question for investigators to be allowed to record his
evidence,'' Yakovenko said.
	   Osherov, an aide to Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the State
Duma. was hit while he was walking into his apartment building
Friday.
	   Police said Monday they had made no arrests in the case.
	   Many Russian businessmen acquire credentials as legislative
aides in hopes that would help advance their business interests,
and many have fallen victim to contract murders. It was unclear
whether Osherov had any business connections.

Amnesty: Syria's longest-serving prisoner hospitalized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syria's longest-serving prisoner, a
Palestinian activist who was first jailed in 1966, has been
hospitalized after falling unconscious during a three-week hunger
strike, Amnesty International said Monday.
	   Abdel-Majid Zaghmout, 54, was admitted to Al-Muwasat hospital in
Damascus last week during a hunger strike to protest his detention,
the human rights group said in a statement.
	   Zaghmout was also suffering from internal bleeding from an
untreated ulcer and an ear infection due to unhygienic prison
conditions in Adra prison outside the capital, Amnesty said.
	   Amnesty said the hospital offers ``no specialist medical care to
deal with serious ear problems,'' and authorities are refusing to
allow him care in a specialized state health institution.
	   Syrian officials would not comment on the report.
	   Amnesty called on Syrian officials to free Zaghmout and to
ensure that he is ``guaranteed access to any specialist medical
care that he needs.''
	   Zaghmout, a former member of Fatah, the mainstream Palestine
Liberation Organization faction, was arrested on May 10, 1966 and
charged with the murder of a Palestinian guerrilla leader.
	   He was sentenced to death later that year by a military court
after what Amnesty called a ``grossly unfair trial.''
	   The sentence was commuted in 1989 to a prison term equal to the
time that he had already spent in custody. It is unclear why he
remains in prison.
	   Syrian jails hold hundreds of political prisoners, Amnesty has
said.

Arbitrator rules in favor of owners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with consequences of ruling; minor editing to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a big victory for NBA owners, an arbitrator
Monday rejected the union's grievance that 226 players with
guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   The decision by John Feerick came on the 111th day of the
lockout, which has caused the league to cancel the first two weeks
of the regular season.
	   With negotiations stalled and the sides far apart on the main
economic issues, the ruling clearly strengthened the owners'
bargaining position by removing the prospect of them being forced
to pay more than dlrs 700 million in salaries to the players they
have barred from work.
	   ``We are pleased with the arbitrator's ruling,'' NBA chief legal
officer Jeffrey Mishkin said. ``Unfortunately, it does not get us
any closer to a deal with the union's leadership.
	   ``Only negotiations will end our current impasse and lead to a
settlement of our dispute. This is yet another defeat for the
union's strategy of litigation instead of negotiation.''
	   The union claimed that the absence of lockout language in the
standard player contract meant the owners were liable for
guaranteed salaries.
	   The owners argued that the right to withhold pay by imposing a
lockout was a tenet of labor law.
	   Players now must face the reality of not being paid until the
dispute is settled at the bargaining table. Until now, they had
been holding out hope that a verdict in their favor would pressure
the owners to soften their stance and come to the table with a
better offer.
	   Union officials did not immediately comment.
	   The sides are fighting over, among other things, the amount of
revenue owners will devote to salaries. Concerned by salary
expenses that are outpacing revenues, the owners imposed the
lockout July 1 and have vowed to achieve a new deal that sets a
definitive limit on payroll costs.
	   There seems little possibility that talks will resume this week.
The union has scheduled a meeting of its entire membership in Las
Vegas for Thursday, and the union's agents advisory committee will
meet with the union's leadership in Las Vegas on Wednesday.
	   Most players were to receive their first paychecks Nov. 15,
although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them to be paid over
the summer. None has received a paycheck.

Controversial mayor seeks an apology from the president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ On the eve of an official visit to
Britain, President Vaclav Havel rebuked a mayor who had suggested
to wall in buildings housing unruly Gypsy families in his town. Now
the mayor wants Havel to apologize.
	   The plan to build walls around Gypsy, or Roma, settlements in
Usti nad Labem in northern Bohemia was first aired by mayor
Ladislav Hruska in May, triggering a wave of protests _ and visits
_ by Czech and foreign reporters and human rights activists.
	   Havel did not comment on the issue before his Czech radio
address Sunday.
	   ``It can happen that a mayor appears who behaves as if the town
(he runs) belonged to him,'' Havel said in the broadcast. ``He
speaks for his electorate and probably thinks that it's his
obligation to share all the prejudices, including the racist ones,
the residents of his town harbor.''
	   Speaking one day before leaving for Britain, Havel also accused
mayor Hruska of damaging the image of the Czech Republic abroad.
The British government repeatedly has indicated it may request
visas from Czech citizens.
	   Rather than publicly rescind his controversial proposal, the
mayor accuses Havel of blaming all citizens of Usti nad Labem, 100
kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Prague, of being racists and
wants the president to apologize.
	   In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Hruska, said, ``I
ask President Vaclav Havel to apologize to the residents of Usti
nad Labem,'' adding, ``they have always shown ... that most of them
don't harbor prejudices, including racist ones the president
ascribes to all of them.''
	   ``I repeat ... that I always will defend the rights of all the
citizens regardless of their nationality, race or color,'' Hruska
said.
	   Hruska's original plan came after residents complained that Roma
families in his town are violent, noisy, dirty and produce too much
garbage.
	   While such a wall has not been built and likely never will, many
human rights activists have accused Usti 's municipality of
sanctioning the building of a new ghetto.

President formally taps D'Alema as next premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more on policies, timing, Vatican objections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Monday formally
asked former Communist Massimo D'Alema to form Italy's 56th
government since World War II.
	   Scalfaro's request came after D'Alema reported to the president
that he has assembled a parliamentary majority in days of hard
bargaining with centrist and leftists parties.
	   D'Alema is expected to announce his Cabinet choices Tuesday or
Wednesday and go to Parliament for the vote of confidence that
would make him premier in time to attend the European Union Summit
on Friday and Saturday.
	   One of D'Alema's first appearances as premier-designate will be
to join Scalfaro in meeting with Pope John Paul II Tuesday at the
presidential palace.
	   The Vatican newspaper, Osservatore Romano, was sharply critical
of the decision to tap D'Alema because of his Communist past.
	   ``Fifty years after the momentous victory of freedom and
democracy over communism, the head of state has entrusted the task
of forming a government to a man from the apparatus of the former
Italian Communist Party,'' it wrote on Sunday.
	   D'Alema was asked Monday if he would try to clear the air with
the pope.
	   ``I have had no arguments with the Holy Father,'' D'Alema said
at a news conference. ``I have nothing to clear up.''
	   	   At his meeting Monday evening with Scalfaro, D'Alema outlined
policies in line with those of Premier Romano Prodi, who guided
Italy into the European economic and currency union.
	   D'Alema also vowed to try again at constitutional reform, a
project he spearheaded but which the conservative opposition sank
earlier this year.
	   In a platform released by D'Alema's office, the parties backing
him pledged to pursue privatization at the pace Prodi had set, to
strive for a 35-hour work week and to tackle unemployment with
government funds linked to private investment in infrastructure
projects.

Iraq steps up campaign against U.N. monitors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials lashed out at U.N. arms
monitors Monday, saying they act unprofessionally and in one case
turned on music and danced as they examined a missile production
site.
	   Iraq repeatedly has accused U.N. weapons inspectors of espionage
and on Aug. 5 ordered an end to surprise inspections by the arms
experts, effectively banning all searches for elements of its past
weapons programs.
	   Iraq has recently mounted a campaign to discredit the remaining
inspectors, who are only allowed to visit weapons sites where the
United Nations already has surveillance equipment installed.
	   One Iraqi official, Kahlil Hameed, accused the monitors of
acting unprofessionally by turning on cassette recorders and
dancing in August while examining a missile site.
	   Hammed also said monitors used their personal cameras to take
photographs of civilians, passing cars and visitors to the missile
production site that he administers.
	   Iraqi authorities arranged the interview with Hameed to back up
accusations by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that the inspectors
engaged in espionage. Aziz made that claim in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan released Saturday.
	   U.N. weapons officials in Baghdad were not available for
comment.
	   Sudat Mohammed of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate,
which coordinates activities for the remaining 40 inspectors in
Iraq, said that some inspectors carried cameras and photographed
army movements and activities in and around Iraqi weapons sites.
	   ``Incidents like this unfortunately indicate that the inspectors
use the authority and mandate given to them in a bad manner to
collect information,'' Mohammed said.
	   In a related development, the official Iraqi News Agency said
Monday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his cabinet reviewed
the inspections.
	   The cabinet also reviewed contacts with Annan to resolve the
current row over spot inspections, the agency reported.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions against
Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will
not be lifted until the inspectors verify that Baghdad has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.

War posture continues in Kosovo, a week after political deal

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A week after a political agreement
intended to stop Kosovo's fighting, a central region resembled a
war zone Monday with tanks positioned openly and the U.N. relief
agency postponing two convoys.
	   A surge of weekend violence brought more Serbian army troops to
the area southwest of Pristina that was the front line of fighting
before the agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and world powers.
	   Western officials voiced concern about the latest skirmishes and
indicated that ethnic Albanian rebels as well as Serb forces were
to blame.
	   Reports of shelling and shooting, along with the Serbian army
deployment along the road from Komorane to Malisevo, caused the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to call off two convoys of
relief supplies headed to western Kosovo on a route through
Komorane.
	   The agency also sent a team to Kisna Reka, a village in the area
with 3,000 Albanian refugees living in the nearby woods, to see
whether the Serbian army was approaching the makeshift refugee
camp.
	   Reporters traveling outside Pristina heard the thud of mortars
on Monday.
	   In Geneva, agency spokeswoman Judith Kumin said the team saw
many displaced people who told of shooting during the night.
	   The team has no comment on military matters, she said, but added
the UNHCR planned to send out the two convoys on Tuesday along with
two others already scheduled for that day.
	   In the mountains above Kisna Reka, ethnic Albanian guerrillas of
the Kosovo Liberation Army showed journalists what they called
newly deployed Serbian tanks and other armored vehicles.
	   Since the agreement, the Serbs have been entering villages and
taking civilians, said a KLA officer who gave his name as Shaban.
	   ``We respect the agreement, but they are provoking us all the
time,'' he said. ``Despite any agreement, we have a right to defend
ourselves and our people.''
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most want independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Milosevic's
crackdown on separatists, and hundreds of thousands more have fled
their homes to escape the violence.
	   Milosevic agreed last week to reduce his forces in Kosovo to the
levels before the February offensive he launched against ethnic
Albanian separatists. NATO has given him until Oct. 27 to comply.
	   The troops who moved out of Pristina to the southwest on Sunday
are normally stationed in the capital, and therefore could remain
in the province under the withdrawal plan.
	   Three Serb policemen died last weekend and two others were badly
wounded by a grenade in the worst of what officials said were more
than a dozen attacks around Kosovo.
	   Serb officials on Monday again blamed the violence on the KLA,
saying the guerrillas want to provoke a fight that would jeopardize
the agreement and bring NATO intervention.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said it
appeared that the insurgents fired first in some instances, but
said the skirmishing was unacceptable no matter what.
	   It would be a mistake, Rubin said, for the KLA ``to consider
NATO its air force. That will not be tolerated by the U.S.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana mentioned the attacks on
Serbs in Paris on Monday after meeting with French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine. ``I think there are provocateurs and provocations,
but we must continue to hold the line'' and carry out the accord,
he said.
	   Three points would ensure that the accord holds, he said,
including pressure on the Serbs, the ground verification team and
NATO overflights.
	   But Solana did not comment on how pressure could be placed on
the Kosovo Albanians not to attack Serb forces.
	   Vedrine disputed that the new violence were a setback, saying it
``doesn't destabilize the accord at all.''
	   A 2,000-member international verification force is being
organized by the 54-nationa Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia is keeping its
word. About 25 members of an advance team for the monitors were in
Kosovo on Monday.

EU doubts whether it can respect WTO beef hormone plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union Commission said Monday it
will not be able to offer definitive scientific justification for a
ban on imports of hormone-treated beef within the deadline set by
the World Trade Organization.
	   But the EU's executive branch said that it still hoped to keep
U.S. hormone-treated beef out by collecting enough preliminary
scientific evidence by the May 13, 1999 target date.
	   The 15-nation EU has to meet that deadline to comply with a WTO
ruling on its 1989 ban on imports of hormone-treated beef, EU
officials said.
	   The EU launched new studies after the WTO - acting on complaints
by the United States and Canada - ruled last year that the
scientific basis of the EU ban on imports of hormone-treated beef
was not sound enough.
	   EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler told a regular meeting of EU
farm ministers that some of the results of the new studies into the
risks to human health posed by cattle growth hormones would not be
available until 2000, the officials said.
	   He said most of the results would be ready in 1999, but not
necessarily before next May 13, they added.
	   Nonetheless, Fischler said the Commission hopes to use
preliminary evidence from the studies to justify the ban by the WTO
compliance deadline, the officials said.
	   The remarks by Fischler came four and a half months after the
WTO ordered the Commission to comply by next May 13 to its ruling
that the EU hormone-treated beef import ban is illegal.
	   In response, the Commission said it would seek compliance by
changing the scientific justification for the ban rather than by
lifting it. To that end, it ordered in February eight independent
studies into the risks posed by six cattle growth hormones.
	   The EU import ban came after a 1988 ban on the use in the EU of
growth hormones in beef. The ban is based on concerns that the
hormones can cause cancer.
	   The U.S. cattle industry has said the EU import ban is costing
it dlrs 250 million a year in sales.

 &UR; Frei and Aznar meet as judge expands Pinochet arrest warrant &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAYONA, Spain (AP) _ Chilean President Eduardo Frei and Spain's
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar met Monday as the controversy raged
over the detention in London of former dictator Augusto Pinochet at
the behest of a Spanish judge.
	   The Chilean government has protested the action of Judge
Baltasar Garzon that prompted the British police to detain the
82-year-old former military chief while he was in a London clinic
recovering from back surgery last Friday.
	   Garzon, who may soon travel to London to interrogate Pinochet,
on Monday widened the basis of his original detention request to
cover the disappearance of 94 people, mostly Chileans.
	   Another Spanish Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon, who is
investigating human rights violations in Chile, has also applied to
question Pinochet in London.
	   Any request for Pinochet's extradition from Britain, must be
approved first by Spain's National Court and then Aznar's cabinet
before being presented to British authorities, who would have the
final word.
	   There was no official confirmation that Aznar and Frei would
meet to specifically discuss the Pinochet case while they are in
this northwestern town for talks with fellow Christian Democratic
leaders from Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica.
	   ``The (democratic) institutions of Spain were born after 40
years of dictatorship without going through the kind of human
rights trials that are demanded of us in Latin America,'' Frei told
reporters here referring to the regime of late Gen. Francisco
Franco in Spain.
	   Frei's was complaining that elected Spanish governments
overseeing the transition to democracy after the death of Franco in
1975 had not been required to deal with politically delicate human
rights legal processes such as that looming over Pinochet.
	   Frei was expected to return to Chile immediately after the
Bayona meeting having canceled a 24-hour private visit in Madrid
owing to the Pinochet's arrest, the Chilean Embassy in Madrid said.
	   Meanwhile, Spanish government spokesman Josep Pique said the
government would not be commenting on the issue as it was a matter
for the judiciary.
	   On Monday, Aznar made no reference to Pinochet and would only
say that the consolidation of democracy in Argentina and Chile were
``bearing fruit.''
	   In the past Aznar has been unenthusiastic about Judge Garzon's
investigations relating to Chile or Argentina.
	   Garzon is pursuing an investigation into the activities of the
so-called Operation Condor through which Latin American
dictatorships allegedly coordinated campaigns to crack down on
leftists during the 1970s and early 1980s.
	   His investigation focuses on events in Argentina.
	   Argentine President Carlos Menem, was also in Bayona, backed
Frei saying Spanish judges ``had nothing to do'' with supposed
crimes committed in his country.

Greek foreign minister to visit Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Greek foreign minister will visit Russia this
week for talks on Kosovo and the divided island of Cyprus, a news
report said Monday.
	   Theodoros Pangalos is scheduled to be in Moscow from Wednesday
through Friday, and will meet Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
on Thursday, the Interfax news agency quoted the Russian Foreign
Ministry as saying.
	   The ministry said Pangalos' talks would not address military
cooperation between the two countries.
	   Russia has delayed delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to
Greek-controlled Cyprus for several months because of threats from
Turkey of conflict on the divided island.
	   Russia fiercely opposes proposed NATO airstrikes on the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, and Pangalos has said Western powers have blown
the Kosovo conflict out of proportion and warned that airstrikes
would cause serious problems for the whole Balkan peninsula.

Tyson gets license back from Nevada commission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more comment from Tyson, Johnson &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson got his boxing license back on
Monday, 15 months after he lost it for biting Evander Holyfield's
ears during a title fight.
	   Tyson told the Nevada Athletic Commission that he had suffered
long enough and needs to box to make a living.
	   Chairman Elias Ghanem said the fighter had made many mistakes
but deserved another chance. The commission voted 4-1 to restore
the license, with the lone holdout commissioner James Nave.
	   ``I want to warn you, from my view, this will be your last
chance,'' Ghanem said. ``You will either conduct yourself in
accordance with our rules and regulations, or you will probably
never fight again in Nevada.''
	   Tyson was near tears as his supporters hugged him and patted on
his back after the decision was announced.
	   ``I'm just happy I won,'' he said. ``I'm undecided when I'll
fight again. I don't know whether I'm prepared to fight. I've been
going through a lot of things.''
	   His handlers have said the former heavyweight champ could be
back in the ring as soon as December to fight for the riches he has
frittered away. A loss would have put him out of the sport for at
least another year.
	   ``Don't be looking for him to be fighting these champions,''
said Magic Johnson, a supporter who testified before the
commission. ``He's been inactive a long time. We're going to bring
him along very, very slowly.''
	   Joining Johnson was Muhammad Ali, who told the commission that
despite all of Tyson's problems he should be allowed to box again.
	   ``There are only a few punishments worse than being denied a
right to make a living,'' Ali said in a statement read by his wife,
Lonnie, who sat next to the ailing boxing great. Ali was banned
from the sport for 3 1/2 years for refusing military induction.
	   In one pointed exchange with Nave, Tyson said he was humiliated
by the hearing and the psychological tests the commission told him
to undergo last month.
	   ``Please don't torture me any longer, sir,'' Tyson said. ``I
made a mistake. Other fighters have made more.
	   ``I'm just a human being trying to live my life.''
	   With a couple of hundred people watching in the commissioners'
hearing room, Tyson said he had no one to blame but himself for
biting Holyfield, but he once again said he was reacting to what he
thought were intentional head-butts from the champion.
	   Tyson also denied accusations that he punched and kicked two men
following a fender-bender in Maryland in August. The commission
said that the case, set for trial in December, would be important
to its decision on whether to give the boxer back the license it
revoked when he bit Holyfield on June 28, 1997.
	   ``I'm not going to kill anybody. I'm not a mass murderer,''
Tyson told the commissioners when asked about his ability to
control his temper.
	   His wife, Monica, who was in the car with Tyson, told the
commission she never saw her husband hit anybody following the
accident.
	   Tyson's hearing came one month after he was told to undergo the
psychological tests to help the officials make their decision.
	   The doctors who examined Tyson tried to reassure the
commissioners that the fighter most likely won't snap again in the
ring, a conclusion they outlined in their report, released last
week.
	   Dr. Ronald Schouten, one of five doctors who examined Tyson at
Massachusetts General Hospital, told the commissioners on Monday
that the boxer's low self-esteem was a ``chronic situation'' but
that he could be helped through weekly treatment.
	   He said Tyson was so upset by losing his license that he most
likely would not do anything to jeopardize it in the future.
	   ``The impact of losing his license has been devastating,''
Schouten said. ``He wants his job back.''
	   Dr. Thomas Deters told the commissioners that allowing Tyson to
fight again would have ``therapeutic value.''
	   At one point, Ghanem told the boxer that he shouldn't feel he's
being picked on.
	   ``Forgive me for thinking that. I love you all,'' Tyson
responded, drawing laughter from the audience.
	   Tyson, wearing a black sports coat and white dress shirt, sat
next to his wife at a table in front of the commissioners. He
stared at the doctors intently as they testified and occasionally
leaned over to whisper to his wife, a physician.
	   Tyson's advisers pushed for the earliest possible hearing so
that Tyson could fight before the end of the year, probably Dec. 5
at the MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
	   The boxer owes the Internal Revenue Service dlrs 13 million
despite having made more than dlrs 100 million in purses since his
release from prison in 1995. But there are more potential problems
ahead for the boxer. He is still on probation for his rape
conviction, and could be sent back to prison if convicted on the
assault charges from the car accident.

 &UR; Spanish judge takes another step toward extraditing Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge on Monday took another step
toward having former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet extradited
from Britain to Spain to face charges of genocide, torture and
terrorism.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose arrest order Friday prompted
British police to detain the aging Pinochet in London, fleshed out
that original document with specific charges involving 94 alleged
victims of Pinochet's regime, most of them Chileans.
	   The original order said Pinochet, who was in London recovering
from back surgery, was responsible for the death of Spaniards and
people of other nationalities. But it cited only one specific case,
the kidnapping and disappearance of a Chilean dissident.
	   ``This broadens the provisional and unconditional detention of
Augusto Pinochet Ugarte for the facts described in this
resolution,'' the judge said in the document, which was sent on to
Britain.
	   Garzon is probing Pinochet's alleged role in so-called Operation
Condor in which South American military juntas in Chile, Argentina,
Uruguay and elsewhere teamed up to snuff out dissent in each
other's countries in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Garzon may travel soon to London to interrogate Pinochet.
Another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, who is probing human rights
violations in Chile, could also go to quiz him.
	   Garzon is relying on a Spanish law that allows prosecution of
alleged genocide no matter where it occurs.
	   Spanish prosecutors say he has no jurisdiction outside of Spain
and on Monday filed a procedural motion to try to block him. But
while a court considers it, the arrest warrant against Pinochet
stands, lawyers said.
	   Garzon's addendum accused Pinochet of ``physical elimination,
disappearances, kidnappings and torture'' of perceived leftists.
	   It said they were of various nationalities _ Spanish, Argentine,
British, U.S., Chilean and others _ but named only 94, almost all
of them Chileans.
	   Private lawyers working with Garzon said the addendum is in
itself a sufficient legal basis for Britain to begin consider
extraditing Pinochet, who is 82.
	   Garzon may also issue an extradition request via the Spanish
government, the lawyers said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In this case it must be approved by the Justice Ministry and the
cabinet of center-right Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, they said.
	   Aznar has frowned upon Garzon's probe, and has declined to say
if he would approve an extradition request.
	   If he does back it, Britain would have the final say.
	   Chile's government has protested Pinochet's arrest saying he had
diplomatic immunity. Chilean President Eduardo Frei met Monday with
Aznar in the northern Spanish town of Bayona but it was not
immediately known if they discussed the Pinochet case.
	   They were there for talks with fellow Christian Democratic
leaders from Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica after a
weekend Ibero-American summit in Portugal.
	   A Chilean government report issued after Pinochet left office
said 4,299 political opponents were killed or disappeared during
his 17-year rule.
	   Pinochet has immunity from prosecution at home because a
constitution he guided to enactment before stepping down as
president in 1990 made him a senator for life.

Torre close to completing dream season with title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Joe Torre's relatives knew.
	   They didn't want tickets for the first round of the playoffs, or
the American League championship series.
	   Why waste money?
	   ``So the pressure was on to get to the World Series, so I can
see all those people,'' he said, not kidding at all.
	   Ever since the Yankees won 114 games, New York and Torre's
family have thought a World Series was preordained.
	   Throughout this October, he's the one urging caution. Perhaps
it's his background as a catcher. He's seen up close what can go
wrong.
	   So as New York piled up win after win, he never relaxed. One
game at a time, he said. Don't look ahead.
	   ``I'm not sure I did anything to help them. I think I got in the
way more than anything else,'' he said one afternoon before the
Yankees opened the World Series last week.
	   He was referring to what he did after New York fell behind
Cleveland 2-1, but he might as well have been talking about his
entire three seasons with the Yankees. The players love him, but in
his mind, his contribution is small.
	   ``Somebody has to write a lineup and pat guys on the rear end if
they do well and make a pitching change now and then,'' Torre said.
``It is a job that I love. It is a great challenge. How important
is it? I think players look to coaches and managers at certain
times just to get a feel of the mood and the confidence.
	   ``I think my job at this point in time is to show that I have
confidence in every single one of them in whatever move I make. But
again, I never will ever say or feel that this game belongs to
managers. It is the players' game.''
	   Joseph Paul Torre, the 58-year-old manager of the Yankees, is
two wins from sweeping San Diego, two games from joining Miller
Huggins, Joe McCarthy, Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk as the only men
to lead the Yankees to a pair of World Series titles.
	   He is understated. It's always we, never me.
	   It's always the players when things go well. It's the manager's
fault when there's a breakdown.
	   ``It's tough to make a bad decision when you have the quality
that I have,'' he said.
	   He spent 18 seasons as a player with the Braves, Cardinals and
Mets, winning one batting title and one MVP award, but never making
it to postseason play.
	   Finally, two years ago, he made it to the Series and led the
Yankees to a 4-2 win over Atlanta. But his brother Frank was in a
hospital for the first five games, awaiting a life-saving heart
transplant. The day before the Yankees won Game 6, Frank got his
new heart.
	   Joe was joyous for Frank, now visible by the batting cage before
postseason games. But Joe was still mourning brother Rocco, who
died of a heart attack that June.
	   ``Two years ago, everything just happened at one time,
basically,'' Joe said. ``At age 55, everybody figures, especially
in baseball, that you will be winding down and things started
winding up.''
	   Joe was voted co-manager of the year in the American League that
year and is a top candidate again this season after leading New
York to a 114-48 record, the most wins ever in the American League.

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi began a
surprise visit to neighboring Tunisia on Monday, his first known
trip since injuring his hip in July.
	   Col. Gadhafi, whose country is under a U.N. air embargo, arrived
by land for ``a visit of brotherhood and rest'' at the invitation
of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, an official statement said.
	   Tunisian television did not show the Libyan leader but said he
met with Ben Ali and several government ministers in a desert oasis
at Tozeur, 400 kms (240 miles) south of Tunis, where foreign
leaders are entertained.
	   Officials, however, did not give the duration or full itinerary
of Gadhafi's visit. The trip was not announced in advance, though
Ben Ali extended the invitation to Gadhafi when he visited Libya in
August.
	   Gadhafi was first driven to Gabes, 365 kms (200 miles) south of
Tunis, after crossing the border at Ras Jedir where he was met by
Interior Minister Ali Chaouch, officials said.
	   It was Gadhafi's first known trip abroad since he broke a bone
near his hip while exercising and underwent surgery in July,
officials have said.
	   The Libyan leader last visited Tunisia in January 1996, when he
met Ban Ali in the southern town of Medenine.
	   Since 1992, Libya has struggled with U.N. Security Council
sanctions that ban direct flights to and from the country. The move
was aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland,
that killed 270 people.
	   The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns
the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according to Scottish
law in the Netherlands, under a U.S.-British proposal.
	   Gadhafi has offered to hand them over but demands any sentences
be served in Dutch or Libyan prisons.

Two week walkout ends with pay raise agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Striking employees at state-owned Air
Algerie reached an agreement with management Monday to end their
two-week-old walkout, officials said.
	   The accord, which the unions called ``a good compromise,'' calls
for a 15 percent pay raise, officials said. Management still vowed
to hold to a restructuring plan.
	   The walkout paralyzed domestic and international flights the
first week, though the airline managed to resume about half its
schedule since then.

200 troops surrender after revolting western Georgia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 3 and 20 with mutineers charged with
treason. &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUTAISI, Georgia (AP) _ Rebellious soldiers surrendered to
government troops after a one-day revolt Monday and agreed to
return to their garrison after clashes near the country's
second-largest city that killed at least one soldier and four
mutineers.
	   The rebel troops released two government officials they had
taken hostage and gave up control of a village they had seized in
this mountainous former Soviet republic, according to Teimuraz
Shashiashvili, governor of the region.
	   The leaders of the mutiny were charged with treason.
	   More than 200 soldiers fiercely opposed to President Eduard
Shevardnadze took over their garrison in the western town of Senaki
on Monday and advanced toward the heart of Georgia, blocking roads
with stolen tanks, trucks and machine guns. Government troops
poured into the area to defend it.
	   Shevardnadze, who has survived assassination attempts and
several rebellions, put Georgian troops on combat readiness, said
presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.
	   Shevardnadze demanded that the mutinous soldiers lay down their
weapons and return to their barracks, and he threatened force if
they refused.
	   Troops were sent to intercept rebels on the road to Georgia's
second-largest city, Kutaisi, but were forced to retreat. Rebels
seized the village of Gubi, just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from
Kutaisi, police said.
	   About 50 civilians joined the rebels in Gubi, police said. Small
groups of civilians were also fleeing villages and towns taken over
by rebels.
	   After talks with government negotiators, the rebel troops agreed
to return to their garrison at Senaki, Shashiashvili said.
	   ``Georgia today has escaped civil war,'' he said.
	   One government soldier was killed in fighting around the town of
Khoni, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Khutaisi, and two were
wounded, said Health Minister Avtandil Dzhorbenadze.
	   At least four rogue troops were killed when government troops
destroyed a tank they had been driving, military officials said. It
was unclear whether the rebels suffered any other casualties.
	   Another group of mutinous soldiers blocked two roads leading
westward to the Black Sea port city of Poti with seven of the
stolen tanks, but they also surrendered, Shashiashvili said.
	   ``It would be unjustified irresponsibility on the part of
Georgia's president and the defense minister if we allowed that
heavy machinery and vehicles with armed adventurers into Georgia's
second-largest city,'' Shevardnadze said in a national television
address.
	   Security was tightened around key buildings in Tbilisi, the
capital, including the government headquarters, parliament and
broadcasting center.
	   The soldiers stole 10 tanks, two armored personnel carriers, and
more than 50 machine guns from their garrison, Abashidze said.
	   The soldiers shot at the car of a government official coming to
talk to them, but no one was wounded, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Georgian Defense Minister Maj. Gen. David Tevzadze and the
Minister of State Security, Lt. Gen. Dzhemal Gakhokidze, were both
sent to the scene.
	   Shashiashvili, who also took part in the talks, said he was
briefly detained by rebels, but then allowed to leave.
	   The leader of the mutiny, Akakiy Eliava, and several of his men
were charged with treason, the Prosecutor General's office said. It
was not immediately clear what sentence they face if convicted.
	   Eliava is a military commander who is also a supporter of the
late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1994.
	   His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.
Shevardnadze blames Gamsakhurdia's supporters for the Feb. 9 attack
on his motorcade that left two of Shevardnadze's bodyguards dead.
At least eight suspects have been arrested.
	   The speaker of the Georgian parliament, Zurab Zhvaniya, said the
rebels were demanding the restoration of Gamsakhurdia's parliament.
He said the rebels issued a statement warning Russian troops not to
intervene.
	   Several foreign leaders have telephoned Shevardnadze to express
support, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Russia's Foreign
Ministry issued a statement appealing for settling the conflict
peacefully.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Albert Costa of Spain and the Netherlands'
Jan Siemerink, two seeded players, suffered shock defeats on the
first day of the high-profile Lyon Grand Prix tennis tournament
Monday.
	   Costa, the world No. 16 and sixth seed here, was beaten by
19-year-old Frenchman Arnaud Di Pasquale, 7-5, 6-3.
	   ``Beating a top 50 player is my ambition for the year so I am
delighted with the result,'' Di Pasquale said after the match. ``I
am not too well-known and perhaps I was underestimated, which
worked to my advantage.''
	   After taking the first set 7-5, Di Pasquale broke Costa's serve
to go 4-2 ahead in the second set after a Costa double fault.
	   Di Pasquale was full of confidence and served two aces - one a
second serve - in the final game to win in just one hour, 18
minutes.
	   No. 5 seed Siemerink was beaten by veteran Italian Gianluca
Pozzi in three sets.
	   Dutchman Siemerink, who recently won the Toulouse Open, seemed
on course for victory after coasting through the first set, 6-2.
	   But a resurgent Pozzi, ranked 58 in the world -- 43 places below
Siemerink -- quickly improved his first serve and put the No. 5
seed under pressure with a series of fine forehand returns.
	   After winning the second set 6-4, Pozzi won a vital service
break in the third game of the final set and broke again to go 4-1
ahead.
	   Siemerink broke back immediately and, at 4-3, had a chance to go
level with the score at 0-30.
	   But the 33-year-old Italian hit a stunning forehand to get back
into the game and ran out a comfortable winner against a dejected
Siemerink.
	   French No. 1 Cedric Pioline, a two-time Lyon finalist, was the
only seeded player to win Monday, winning a tough match against
countryman Sebastien Grosjean 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-1 in two hours 12
minutes.

Welsh milkman says his customers come before the queen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Trevor Jones has been delivering milk since 1949
and sees no reason to disrupt his schedule now _ even if it is to
meet the queen.
	   The Welshman has turned down the chance to visit Buckingham
Palace next month to receive an MBE, or Member of the Order of
British Empire honor, from Queen Elizabeth II.
	   ''I would end up rushing the day before to get everything done,
then rushing up to London by 10 in the morning for the ceremony.
The queen is a very nice lady, but she isn't worth rushing for. I'm
sure she will understand,'' said Jones, 69.
	   Instead, Jones will be given the MBE in a ceremony at Ebbw Vale
civic center next month, which is closer to his home in Tredegar,
south Wales. His wife Dorothy, 73, daughter Jane and six-week-old
grandson Daniel will be with him. The queen's lord lieutenant, Sir
Richard Hanbury Tennison, will conduct the honors.
	   ``I know I am passing up the moment of a lifetime and I hope the
queen will not mind,'' Jones said. ``But it would disrupt my
deliveries and I have to put my customers first.''
	   The queen bestows the honors on the recommendation of the prime
minister. Tony Blair's Labor government has made an effort to
recognize more ordinary people. But Jones will still join an
exclusive group that already includes Peter Cattaneo, director of
the hit movie ''The Fully Monty'' and jazz singer Carol Kidd.
	   Jones began his career when he was six years old and helped his
father deliver milk in a horse-pulled cart. After serving in the
army in Cyprus and North Africa, Jones returned to Wales and took
up the route in 1949 delivering milk to hundreds.
	   ``Trevor is a real local character,'' said Paul Hopkins, the
mayor of Tredegar. ''He fully deserves his award - and I hope the
whole town turns out to see him get it.''

Activists demonstrate against investment liberalization agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with business group comment
 &UR; By ANGELA DOLAND &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 50 French and foreign protesters burst into
the International Chamber of Commerce on Monday, on the eve of new
talks aimed at liberalizing international investment.
	   The protesters passed out communiques detailing their complaints
against the proposed Multilateral Investment Agreement treaty and
slapped ``Stop MAI'' stickers onto the walls of the building.
	   The proposed agreement aims to liberalize the flow of direct
international investments, but its critics say liberalization would
undermine a nation's control over its own economy.
	   Talks broke down this spring largely due to French insistence on
protecting its cultural and audiovisual industries. Negotiators
decided to take a six-month break to consult their governments and
come back with proposals to try to break the impasse.
	   Negotiations were set to resume Tuesday at the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, the
world club of industrialized countries which is hosting the talks.
	   France, however, said last week that it will shun the meeting.
	   The demonstrators, who came from more than 20 countries, crowded
into an upstairs meeting room inside the Chamber to lay out their
complaints about the agreement.
	   Lori Wallach, director of global trade watch for Public Citizen
in Washington D.C., said the MAI, if passed, would mean ``rule by
corporations. It would disempower the role of government in
regulating our day-to-day lives.''
	   Members of the International Chamber of Commerce refused to take
part in the discussion, saying the protesters had entered the
building without permission and scribbled graffiti on the walls,
said Vincent J. O'Brien, the group's deputy director of
communications.
	   An international business lobby, however, said it was ``very
disappointed that France has decided to pull out of the
negotiations.''
	   The Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD said in
a statement that many non-OECD nations were interested in the
accord and that member governments ``should avoid sending a poor
signal to these countries.
	   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin instead has urged new
negotiations instead at the Geneva-based World Trade Organization,
as Canada has also suggested.
	   A WTO agreement would likely take longer to reach and would
likely be weaker, due to protectionist policies of many
member-developing countries.

Parliament session opens with guns and flare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Taking no chances, Dan Tichon, the speaker of
Israel's parliament, said he's carrying a gun these days, and
offered a parliamentary pistol to any member who wants one.
	   Israel's Knesset opened its winter session Monday with new
seats, a fresh coat of paint, a new digital timer aimed at keeping
speeches short, and new lighting. But one traditional feature was
missing _ the prime minister.
	   Benjamin Netanyahu, who was supposed to open the new session
with an address on Israel's political agenda, is in the United
States for a Mideast summit meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   The Knesset agreed to postpone Netanyahu's speech until
Wednesday but with the sides far from concluding a peace deal, it
was not clear when he would return to address the house.
	   Tichon said Netanyahu's speech could only be delayed if all the
parties agree, and one right-wing party already said it doesn't.
Rehavam Zeevi, leader of the tiny Moledet faction, said Netanyahu
should not have gone to the summit in the first place, and should
come home immediately. Moledet favors removing Palestinians from
the West Bank and Gaza, and opposes any Israeli land concessions.
	   So Netanyahu might be in contempt of parliament if the Wye
Plantation summit continues through Wednesday.
	   When he returns, he could find an armed Knesset.
	   Tichon said he carries a weapon because of increasing political
tensions and threats against the lives of Knesset members. A
left-wing member was recently assigned a bodyguard after his car
was set afire, apparently by right-wing extremists.
	   Three years ago, a right-wing Jew shot and killed Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv.
	   Tichon offered a pistol from the Knesset armory to any member
who feels the need to carry one, and added that members of
parliament can practice their sharpshooting at the Knesset firing
range.
	   The Israeli speaker told the newspaper Yediot Aharonot that he
is assigned a bodyguard when he travels abroad, but ``I personally
don't believe in that and continue to carry a gun.''
	   Summer-long renovations left the Knesset with a new look, but
many of the same sounds. The large digital clock failed to impress
parliamentarians who spoke over the time limits anyway.

Opposition coalition claims victory over incumbents in Macedonia

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition claimed victory
Monday in Macedonia's elections, but the ex-communist incumbents
said results were inconclusive, leaving the shape of the country's
next government unclear.
	   Regardless of official results to be announced later, the
dispute could lead to political tension in Macedonia, the only
former Yugoslav republic that gained independence without bloodshed
in 1992.
	   The reformist opposition coalition said its vote count from
Sunday's parliamentary elections showed it had far outdistanced all
other parties by winning 44 seats in the 120-seat assembly. With
most seats still to be determined in a second round Nov. 1, such a
showing would almost certainly oust the incumbent government.
	   But the ruling Social Democrats contended the opposition had
clinched only 15 seats _ the same as their own total _ arguing that
a low turnout invalidated the others. Turnout in each municipality
must be at least one-third of registered voters for results to be
valid.
	   State electoral officials hinted late Monday that they agreed
with the incumbents' interpretation of the complex election law,
which would give the Social Democrats a reprieve from a disastrous
defeat.
	   But electoral commission chief Ljiljana Ristova would not
elaborate on the commission's position, and no results were
available. Official results are required to be released no later
than Tuesday, but the dispute raised the possibility of a delay.
	   Ethnic Albanian parties said they had won 22 seats.
	   The incumbents led the country peacefully to independence from
Yugoslavia. But the opposition coalition, comprised of younger
politicians, is striving for radical political and economic
reforms.
	   ``This is a great victory, and we hope for an even better
outcome in the second round,'' Ljuben Paunovski, the opposition
coalition's spokesman, told Macedonian television.
	   A total of 38 parties contested the elections, all focusing on
the country's economic woes during the campaign.
	   Macedonia, with a population of about 2 million, was the poorest
of all six republics in the former Yugoslav federation and its
economy remains feeble, with 30 percent unemployment and an average
salary of dlrs 210 a month.
	   Situated near the volatile Serbian province of Kosovo in
Yugoslavia, Macedonia has disputes with all its neighbors. It also
has a restive ethnic Albanian minority.

Ex-Spice Girl named goodwill ambassador for U.N. Population Fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with background on Halliwell &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell has
joined a cast of global celebrities tapped by the United Nations to
put the spotlight on global issues.
	   Halliwell, 26, a.k.a. Ginger Spice, has been appointed a
goodwill ambassador for the U.N. Population Fund in Britain to
promote healthier choices about reproduction and greater awareness
of reproductive rights.
	   ``She will be a great ambassador for young people,'' Alex
Marshall, the fund's deputy director for information, said Monday.
	   Halliwell quit the all-girl British pop group on May 31, citing
``differences between us.'' Last week, the British media reported
that she had signed a 2 million pound (dlrs 3.4 million) deal with
Chrysalis records.
	   Halliwell will be working in Britain with Marie Stopes
International and Population Concern, voluntary organizations which
promote reproductive health, especially among women, Marshall said.
	   Both groups are part of the U.N. Population Fund's ``Face To
Face Campaign,'' which is using voluntary organizations to promote
awareness of population issues across Europe.
	   Two of the remaining Spice Girls _ Scary Spice Melanie Brown and
Posh Spice Victoria Adams _ became pregnant this year by their
boyfriends. Brown has since married.
	   Asked why Halliwell was chosen to be a goodwill ambassador in
Britain, Marshall said: ``She almost chose herself. She's
interested in the issue. She got together with Marie Stopes
International.''
	   She is scheduled to appear at a press conference at the United
Nations Tuesday with officials from the fund to discuss her new
role.
	   Famed for her ginger-colored hair and tight-fitting short
dresses, the pop star has gone through a transformation since she
split with the Spice Girls. She is now blonde and more likely to be
spotted in a demure suit.
	   Halliwell has also visited inmates at London's Holloway prison
and students at a London school to highlight cancer awareness. And
she auctioned many of her most famous Spice Girls costumes which
raised almost 145,000 pounds (dlrs 242,000) for a children's cancer
charity. Halliwell became concerned about cancer when, at age 18,
she discovered a lump in her breast that turned out to be benign.
	   The former Spice Girl joins some of the world's biggest names,
past and present, in promoting U.N. activities.
	   Over the years, the U.N. Children's Fund recruited Danny Kaye,
Roger Moore, Liv Ullman and Audrey Hepburn, to serve as ``goodwill
ambassadors'' and money raisers. Actor Danny Glover and South
African writer Nadine Gordimer became the first goodwill
ambassadors for the U.N. Development Program earlier this year.
	   The United Nations has also recruited celebrities to be
``Messengers of Peace,'' including Muhammad Ali, Luciano Pavarotti
and Michael Douglas. Elton John accepted the honor but last week
indefinitely postponed taking on the duty.
	   Halliwell became a millionaire with the Spice Girls, whose motto
``Girl power!'' drew millions of fans worldwide. The group has
continued to perform with four members.

Nigerian town buries victims of fireball gas explosion.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add firefighters allowing blaze to die down, flames
still flaring Monday. Pickup 3rd graf pvs. `Grieving relatives...'
 &UR; With AP Graphic NIGERIA EXPLOSION
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ With dozens of charred bodies littering
the town, authorities began burying at least 500 people on Monday,
victims of a devastating pipeline explosion over the weekend.
	   Some who were too burned to be identified would be placed in
mass graves, officials said.
	   Although flames from the ruptured pipeline occasionally flared
up to 20 meters (65 feet) in the air, by late Monday firefighters
stopped fighting the blaze and waited for it to burn itself out.
	   Meanwhile relatives converged on the disaster scene in Jesse,
300 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos, to search for
remains of their loved ones.
	   ``It is finished,'' cried Charity Unurhoro, after finding the
horribly burned bodies of her mother and brother. ``Now everything
is over for me.''
	   As she cried, a man told a young relative to fetch a wheelbarrow
to take the corpses home for burial.
	   The fire, which began Saturday as residents scooped gasoline
spilling from a pipeline, killed at least 500 people and left at
least 100 hospitalized, military officials said.
	   Some corpses _ including those of some children _ were found
clutching plastic cups, funnels and cans to collect the fuel.
	   The charred body of one woman was found with her dead baby
strapped to her back. Many other victims were farmers and villagers
sleeping in their homes.
	   Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar flew in by helicopter
for a 15-minute visit. He said the government would pay for medical
treatment, but that there would be no compensation to survivors,
apparently because many of those killed were stealing fuel.
	   But residents were furious over the deaths, saying the dead were
mostly poor people trying to make ends meet.
	   ``This is a tragedy of huge proportions,'' the Rev. Andrew
Imadu, a local minister, said at one funeral in Jesse. ``Our own
people have been driven by deprivation to such a desperate search
for livelihood.''
	   Southeastern Nigeria, while rich in oil, is scarred by decades
of poverty and villagers in some areas are believed to regularly
sabotage oil pipelines in order to file claims for compensation.
	   Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost constant fuel
shortages, causing skyrocketing black-market prices and long lines
at gas pumps.
	   The surface pipeline links a refinery in the southeastern city
of Warri, 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Lagos, with the
northern city of Kaduna, nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles) away.
	   Over the weekend, hundreds of people had arrived in Jesse after
hearing rumors that a huge pool of gasoline _ which had spilled
from the pipeline into a concrete well _ was available for the
taking, according to J.I. Ogude, village chief of Jesse.
	   The gasoline theft, known as ``bunkering,'' had started as early
as Saturday morning, he said.
	   People at the scene, who Ogude said came from at least seven
villages, were preparing to sell the gasoline on the black market.
	   An official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed the pipeline
had been deliberately punctured, and that the scavengers' tools had
sparked the explosion.
	   But some newspaper reports said a carelessly discarded cigarette
may have been the cause of what witnesses said started as a loud
roar followed by high flames spreading over the oily slick.
	   Ogude said government petroleum officials knew of the scavengers
and had tried to frighten them with a hovering helicopter on
Saturday.
	   When that failed, police had been sent to disperse the crowd,
but they arrived too late, seeing the explosion as they neared the
village, he said.

Allende's daughter calls arrest a lesson for future dictators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The daughter of the late President Salvador Allende
said Monday that the arrest of former Chilean strongman Augusto
Pinochet _ the man who overthrew her father _ was a lesson for
future dictators.
	   ``It's not revenge,'' said Isabel Allende, three days after
British police detained the former leader. ``It signifies that when
you speak of genocide, of state terrorism, there are no borders.
	   ``It's a day of triumph for democracy and human rights,'' she
said in an interview with France 2 television. ``It's a lesson for
the future ... that a dictator cannot commit crimes with
impunity.''
	   Pinochet ousted Allende in a bloody coup in 1973, when the
Marxist leader committed suicide before he could be captured.
During 17 years of rule, Pinochet has been widely accused of
running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of
political opponents.
	   On Friday, British police detained Pinochet in London, where he
was recovering from back surgery. Spain is seeking his extradition,
though the Chilean government has protested his arrest.
	   Ms. Allende, who became a Socialist member of the Chilean
parliament after returning to her homeland in 1990, said she was
happy with the arrest for ``all the families of political prisoners
who disappeared.''

erupted into a ball of fire, officials said Monday.
	   With dozens of charred, unidentified bodies littering the town
and flames still occasionally flaring up to 20 meters (65 feet) in
the air, authorities began the grim task Monday of burying those
incinerated by the ball of fire.
	   Firefighters stopped fighting the flames and waited for the
blaze, which spread thick black smoke for miles (kilometers)
around, to burn itself out.
	   Grieving relatives also came to Jesse, about 300 kilometers (180
miles) southeast of Lagos, searching for the charred remains of
their loved ones.
	   ``It is finished,'' cried Charity Unurhoro, after finding the
horribly burned bodies of her mother and brother. ``Now everything
is over for me.''
	   As she cried, a man told a young relative to fetch a wheelbarrow
to take the corpses home for burial.
	   The fire, which began Saturday as the residents tried to scoop
gasoline spilling from a pipeline, killed at least 500 people and
left at least 100 hospitalized, military officials said.
	   The area's hospitals _ most of which only have a handful of
doctors and nurses and little in the way of burn care _ were
overwhelmed by the disaster, with doctors overworked and medicine
in short supply, local officials said.

Martin O'Neill's Leicester downs George Graham's Spurs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ Muzzy Izzet smashed home a right-foot,
25-meter volley six minutes from the end as Leicester inflicted
Spurs first loss under new manager George Graham Monday and maybe
convinced its own manager, Martin O'Neill to stay.
	   With O'Neill targeted by Leeds to be its new manager after the
departure of Graham last month, the Leicester fans were worried
that a fourth defeat in nine games might mean they would lose the
inspirational former Northern Ireland international.
	   But the victory at Filbert Street pushed Leicester up four
places to 11th place while Spurs slipped to 14th.
	   Les Ferdinand fired in Darren Anderton's cross to put Spurs
ahead in the 14th minute but the Foxes leveled 13 minutes later
when Emile Heskey twisted round Swiss defender Ramon Vega to shoot
home.
	   Spurs manager Graham took David Ginola out of the game midway
through the second half after a poor display by the French forward.
	   Two minutes after Izzet's goal, Leicester's American
international 'keeper Kasey Keller, who had fumbled two crosses
earlier in the game, made a good save to keep out a header from
Chris Armstrong. Then the American stretched out an arm to fist
away a shot from the Spurs striker.

Parliament session opens with guns and flare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RAISE reference of threats to lawmakers;
ADDS Tichon's party, no comment by lawmakers, clarifies quote &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Taking no chances after several lawmakers
received threats, Dan Tichon, the speaker of Israel's parliament,
said he's carrying a gun these days, and offered a parliamentary
pistol to any member who wants one.
	   Israel's Knesset opened its winter session Monday with new
seats, a fresh coat of paint, a new digital timer aimed at keeping
speeches short, and new lighting. But one traditional feature was
missing _ the prime minister.
	   Benjamin Netanyahu, who was supposed to open the new session
with an address on Israel's political agenda, is in the United
States for a Mideast summit meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   The Knesset agreed to postpone Netanyahu's speech until
Wednesday but with the sides far from concluding a peace deal, it
was not clear when he would return to address the house.
	   Tichon said Netanyahu's speech could only be delayed if all the
parties agree, and one right-wing party already said it doesn't.
Rehavam Zeevi, leader of the tiny Moledet faction, said Netanyahu
should not have gone to the summit in the first place, and should
come home immediately. Moledet favors removing Palestinians from
the West Bank and Gaza, and opposes any Israeli land concessions.
	   So Netanyahu might be in contempt of parliament if the Wye
Plantation summit continues through Wednesday.
	   When he returns, he could find an armed Knesset though lawmakers
have yet to comment on Tichon's offer.
	   Tichon, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, said he
carries a weapon because of increasing political tensions and
threats against the lives of Knesset members. A left-wing member
was recently assigned a bodyguard after his car was set afire,
apparently by right-wing extremists.
	   Three years ago, a right-wing Jew shot and killed Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv.
	   Tichon offered a pistol from the Knesset armory to any member
who feels the need to carry one, and added that members of
parliament can practice their sharpshooting at the Knesset firing
range.
	   The Israeli speaker told the newspaper Yediot Aharonot that he
is assigned a bodyguard when he travels abroad, but would rather he
wasn't. In Israel, he said he would ``continue to carry a gun.''
	   Summer-long renovations left the Knesset with a new look, but
many of the same sounds. The large digital clock failed to impress
parliamentarians who spoke over the time limits anyway.

Britain outlines high cost of ''mad cow'' disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The cost of tackling ''mad cow'' disease might
reach 4.6 billion pounds (dlrs 7.8 billion) by 2002, a British
government official said Monday.
	   But about 45 percent of that sum will be reimbursed by the
European community, said Jeffrey Rooker, an official with the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in a written reply to
a question from the House of Commons.
	   The cost is estimated from 1996 when the European Union banned
British beef exports. The ban came after Britain announced a
possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, and
the fatal, brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The disease has
killed 27 people in Britain since 1995.
	   Hundreds of thousands of cattle have been slaughtered and their
carcasses destroyed since March 1996 as part of the government's
attempt to eradicate the disease.
	   But Britain has been actively lobbying the European Union to
ease its ban on British beef exports by the end of the year.

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ With dozens of charred bodies littering
the town, authorities began burying at least 500 people on Monday,
victims of a devastating pipeline explosion over the weekend.
	   Some who were too burned to be identified would be placed in
mass graves, officials said.
	   Although flames from the ruptured gasoline pipeline occasionally
flared up to 20 meters (65 feet) in the air, by late Monday
firefighters had stopped fighting the blaze and said they would
wait for it to burn out.
	   Meanwhile relatives converged on the disaster scene in Jesse,
300 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos, to search for
remains of their loved ones.
	   ``It is finished,'' cried student Charity Unurhoro, after
finding the horribly burned bodies of her mother and brother. ``Now
everything is over for me.''
	   As she cried, a man told a young relative to fetch a wheelbarrow
to take the corpses home for burial.
	   The fire, which began Saturday as residents scooped gasoline
spilling from a pipeline, killed at least 500 people and left at
least 100 hospitalized, military officials said.
	   The area's hospitals _ most of which only have a handful of

Iraq steps up campaign against U.N. monitors

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials lashed out at U.N. arms
monitors Monday, saying that they act unprofessionally and in one
case turned on music and danced as they examined a missile
production site.
	   Iraq repeatedly has accused U.N. weapons inspectors of espionage
and on Aug. 5 ordered an end to surprise inspections by the arms
experts, effectively banning all searches for elements of its past
weapons programs.
	   Iraq has recently mounted a campaign to discredit the remaining
inspectors, who are only allowed to visit weapons sites where the
United Nations already has installed surveillance equipment.
	   One Iraqi official, Kahlil Hameed, accused the monitors of
turning on cassette recorders and dancing in August while examining
a missile site.
	   Hammed also said monitors used their personal cameras to take
photographs of civilians, passing cars and visitors to the missile
production site that he administers.
	   Iraqi authorities arranged the interview with Hameed to back up
accusations by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that the inspectors
engaged in espionage. Aziz made that claim in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan released Saturday.
	   In New York, a spokesman for the U.N. inspectors dismissed the
Iraqi allegations.
	   The monitors ``are a group of people who are, by and large, good
professionals doing a difficult job under pressure,'' said Ewen
Buchanan.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ An apparent sabotage attack on an oil
pipeline continued to claim lives on Monday and authorities sought
to determine whether leftist rebels were indeed responsible for the
blast, which unleashed a fireball that killed at least 47 people.
	   The usually outgoing rebels have been silent, fueling suspicion
they were behind the early-morning explosion and fire Sunday in the
village of Machuca, in the northwestern state of Antioquia.
	   At least 60 people were badly burned when flames consumed the
hamlet. Two of the victims _ a 60-year-old man and a 7-year-old boy
_ died Monday, the governor's office in Medellin reported.
	   Authorities appeared to rule out an accident. Government
officials and representatives of the company that operates the
Ocensa pipeline stopped short of accusing the guerrillas, but
expressed indignation.
	   The rebel National Liberation Army, or ELN, was suspected in the
blast but made no public comment. Antonio Picon, a civilian member
of a Medellin peace committee, told The Associated Press that
jailed ELN spokesman Francisco Galan said the rebels would make a
statement Tuesday.
	   Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the ELN is active in the
area of Sunday's blast and routinely dynamites pipelines, accusing
the government of selling out to foreign oil companies.
	   Oil company officials said they found a 1.5-meter (4-foot) deep
by 2-meter (6-foot) wide crater in the ground where the pipeline
was ruptured.
	   ``The conclusion is that criminal hands were at work, that it
was an attack,'' said Jorge Suarez, support manager for the
pipeline, which is jointly owned by the state oil company,
Ecopetrol, and a foreign consortium including British Petroleum,
U.S.-based Triton Energy Ltd., Total S.A. of France and two
Canadian companies whose names were not immediately available.
	   Suarez said the crater was ``typical of an explosives attack.''
	   The early morning blaze engulfed wooden homes where villagers
were sleeping and most of the victims were children. One survivor
described a 150 foot (50 meter) ball of flame roaring along a river
before bowling into Machuca.
	   ``We heard people screaming. When we turned around to look
everything was on fire,'' survivor Lacides Atehortua told the
Medellin newspaper El Colombiano.
	   Oil company officials said as many as 30,00 barrels of crude
were spilled and that they expected to have the pipeline repaired
and back in operation by Tuesday.

Bowman to return to Red Wings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Scotty Bowman, the winningest coach in National
Hockey League history, will return to the champion Detroit Red
Wings on Thursday.
	   The Red Wings said Monday that Bowman talked with his doctor on
Monday and got a clean bill of health. He had undergone an
angioplasty in July to clear a blocked artery and had his left knee
replaced in August.
	   Bowman, whose brother Jack died during heart surgery in June,
had said he would not return unless his doctor said he was healthy
enough.
	   The 65-year-old coach said Saturday he expected to return.
	   ``Oh, yeah, I don't think there's any question about that,'' he
said. ``I have no qualms about coming back.''
	   Bowman said his cholesterol and blood pressure were normal and
his heart reacted better during a medical exam on Friday than it
did in July.
	   General manager Ken Holland said Bowman would coach the Red
Wings at practice on Thursday and will be behind the bench when
Detroit plays host to Toronto on Friday.
	   Bowman has a 1,057-484-277 regular season mark and a 194-112
playoff record, winning five Stanley Cups with Montreal, two with
Detroit and one with Pittsburgh. The only other coach to win eight
Stanley Cups is his mentor, former Montreal coach Toe Blake.
	   Red Wings players had said following their 2-0 victory on Sunday
that they were excited about reports of Bowman's return.
	   ``He's the guy in charge; it's Scotty's team,'' captain Steve
Yzerman said. ``He's molded it the way he wants it.''
	   Yzerman said Bowman's return would enhance Detroit's chances for
winning another title.
	   ``We've enjoyed playing for him and we'd like to keep this
going,'' Yzerman said.
	   Added forward Brendan Shanahan: ``He's a part of this team and a
part of the team's success the past two years. We want this to
continue.''

Britannia opens to the public

<TEXT>
	   LEITH, Scotland (AP) _ One of the designers and an original
crewman of the former royal yacht Britannia helped open the ship to
the paying public Monday.
	   Britannia, which served as a traveling home for members of
Britain's royal family for nearly 44 years until its retirement in
December, is expected to attract 200,000 visitors a year.
	   The 412-foot (125-meter) yacht had grown too costly to operate
and has been permanently docked here.
	   James Houston, who worked on designing Britannia and was
visiting the ship on his 64th birthday, and Andrew Brown, a crewman
at the ship's launch in 1954, were first on board at the invitation
of the vessel's general manager, Bob Downie.
	   The first paying visitor, Karen Standland of Nottingham,
England, said she felt the former royal yacht was presented in a
``dignified'' way.
	   ``It's all remarkably well-done,'' she said, adding, ``I'm
struck by how small the officers' cabins were.''
	   Access to Britannia is via a onshore visitor center where people
will be able to learn about the yacht's history with the help of
interactive displays. Visitors will be guided around the yacht and
see all areas of the ship from the galleys to the bedrooms.
	   ``Over 95 percent of the royal collection is on board,'' Downie
said. ``People will be able to see it exactly as it was.''
	   Admission is 6.50 pounds (dlrs 11) for adults and 3.75 pounds
(dlrs 6.40) for children, with a family ticket offered for 18
pounds (dlrs 30).

U.S. gymnast Brian Babcock dead at 38
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK BABINECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Brian Babcock, who bounced back to champion
status in gymnastics after just missing a spot on the 1984 Olympic
team, has died of complications following a bone marrow transplant.
He was 38.
	   Babcock, who earlier this year learned he had a leukemia-like
cancer before he even felt sick, received a bone marrow transplant
on Aug. 14. Though doctors told him he had a 50-50 chance to live,
the gymnast remained optimistic.
	   ``After experiencing nine different surgeries to stay at an
elite level in gymnastics, I'd have to say it was great grounds to
be prepared for what I'm going through now,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press after his transplant.
	   Babcock died at his Houston area home with family at his side.
He suffered from myelodysplasia, which hampers the body's ability
to produce blood and fight infection.
	   He compared his fight for life to his battle to recover from his
third knee operation before vying for a spot on the gold
medal-winning gymnastics team at the Los Angeles Olympics. Even
hobbled, he barely missed the cut.
	   He came back to win the national all-around title the following
year.
	   ``The entire gymnastics community is deeply saddened by Brian's
passing,'' said Bob Colarossi, president of USA Gymnastics. ``He
possessed unparalleled energy and excitement for the sport of
gymnastics, which was reflected in his performance as an athlete
and as a coach.''
	   Babcock, born in Garden City, Kansas, starred at Southern
Illinois. He earned medals at the NCAA championships and the Pan
American Games before his 1985 title.
	   Babcock has remained active in gymnastics as a coach, moving
recently from Pennsylvania to Houston, where he opened the Texas
Sports Ranch along with fellow coach Kevin Mazeika. Among the
pupils is 2000 Olympic hopeful Sean Townsend.

Egypt suspends railway officials after 47 killed in train accident

	   KAFR EL-DAWAR, Egypt (AP) _ The Egyptian government suspended
five top railway officials Monday after a train jumped its rails
and slammed into a crowded town square, killing 47 people.
	   Transportation Minister Suleiman Metwally ordered the suspension
of the officials, including the national head of railways and the
managers in the province where the accident occurred, pending an
investigation into the accident.
	   The train flew off the rails as it pulled into a siding in the
station of Kafr el-Dawar town, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast
of the port city of Alexandria.
	   It crashed through a barricade and into the town square, killing
47 and injuring 104 people, police officials said. They dismissed
earlier reports of as many as 52 dead, saying that in some cases,
bodies were cut in two and counted twice in preliminary death
tolls.
	   A preliminary investigation indicated that the accident was
caused by a faulty brake system.
	   It said that passengers had disrupted brake linkages between
cars, causing them to fail. People often hop on packed Egyptian
trains and ride on the roof or between the cars.
	   Witnesses said the train was speeding when it pulled into the
station, and that the driver was wildly blowing the whistle and
yelling for bystanders to get out of the way.
	   Rescue teams ended their search for survivors Monday after
lifting the last car of the train with mobile cranes.
	   Pools of blood and shredded bloodstained clothing could be seen
beneath the wreckage.
	   Five mangled bodies, including that of a young boy, were found
beneath the last three cars of the train, witnesses said.
	   Hundreds of citizens crowded the square to help in the rescue
efforts.
	   Residents accused the authorities of neglect.
	   ``No one came until 8:15,'' said Khaled Mohammed Lotfi.
``Everyone you see working here is a local man. We asked them to
call the Defense Ministry to bring in soldiers to help, but they
called us crazy.''
	   Most of the dead were bystanders in the town and the majority of
the injured were passengers on the train, said Nabih Yousef
Shaltout, head of health care in the local province of Buheira.
	   The train, which was traveling south from Alexandria, left the
rails when the driver changed tracks at high speed, the Interior
Ministry said in a statement.
	   The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, shot into
the air, hit a war memorial in the square and slammed into seven
shops, witnesses said.
	   When the train hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,''
said Hany Roushdy, a teen-ager who saw the crash.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995, when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

Lawrence Taylor arrested on drug charge

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETE BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Lawrence Taylor, who has battled
drug addiction for more than a decade, was charged Monday with
possession of crack cocaine after making a purchase from an
undercover police officer.
	   Members of the St. Pete Beach Special Response Team entered his
room at the Sandpiper Resort hotel shortly after 2 a.m. and
arrested the former National Football League star and Victoria
Corey, 41, who was identified as an employee of L.T. Enterprises.
	   Police said Taylor, 39, purchased dlrs 50 worth of crack cocaine
from the undercover officer. Officers found drug paraphernalia in
his room and Taylor admitted he knew of its presence, an arrest
report said.
	   Taylor, who was in town for a celebrity golf tournament, said he
was set up by an officer who badgered him all day until he finally
bought the drugs.
	   ``Any time a law enforcement agency can solicit you all day and
you tell them no and then they have the nerve to come to my room at
2 a.m. and try to sell me drugs, that's bull,'' Taylor said as he
left the Pinellas County Jail after posting dlrs 15,500 bond.
	   ``I'm just waiting for my day in court.''
	   Thomas Melani, an attorney who represents Taylor, said his son
Michael, also an attorney, spoke with Taylor by telephone. ``He
indicated it was not what it appears to be, and he claims it's a
setup,'' the senior Melani said. ``At this point, it's only an
accusation.''
	   Taylor, 39, was released from the Pinellas County Jail less than
12 hours later.
	   St. Pete Beach Det. Dean Horianopoulos declined to give
specifics about how the drug deal was arranged, saying only that
police had received information that Taylor was looking to purchase
drugs.
	   The detective said Taylor identified Corey as his secretary.
	   Taylor, who helped the New York Giants win two Super Bowl titles
during his 13-year NFL career that ended in 1993, has battled drugs
for more than a decade. In 1994, he was arrested on similar charges
in South Carolina.
	   He enrolled in a pretrial intervention program that would wipe
the charges from his record by completing 60 hours of community
service and submitting to drug counseling and random drug testing.
	   Taylor also underwent rehabilitation for a cocaine problem in
1986 and was suspended by the NFL two years later for violating the
NFL's substance abuse policy. Although the NFL never specified what
substance Taylor was using in 1988, published reports said it was
cocaine.
	   In March 1989, Taylor failed a Breathalyzer test after he was
found sleeping behind the wheel of his Jeep along a busy New Jersey
highway at 3:30 a.m. No drugs were found in a urine test.
	   Last May, he was arrested in a roundup of deadbeat parents,
spending about 10 hours in jail before a business associate paid
dlrs 6,000 _ dlrs 4,500 for an overdue payment and dlrs 1,500 for
an outstanding traffic violation.
	   He pleaded guilty last year to filing a false 1990 federal
income tax return by failing to report dlrs 48,000 in income from a
now-closed restaurant near Giants Stadium.
	   Taylor, the second player chosen in the 1981 draft, made the Pro
Bowl 10 times and was considered the prototype for the pass-rushing
linebacker.

Iraq steps up campaign against U.N. monitors

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from Aziz letter &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials lashed out at U.N. arms
monitors Monday, saying that they act unprofessionally and in one
case turned on music and danced as they examined a missile
production site.
	   Iraq repeatedly has accused U.N. weapons inspectors of espionage
and on Aug. 5 ordered an end to surprise inspections by the arms
experts, effectively banning all searches for elements of its past
weapons programs.
	   Iraq has recently mounted a campaign to discredit the remaining
inspectors, who are only allowed to visit weapons sites where the
United Nations already has installed surveillance equipment.
	   One Iraqi official, Kahlil Hameed, accused the monitors of
turning on cassette recorders and dancing in August while examining
a missile site.
	   Hammed also said monitors used their personal cameras to take
photographs of civilians, passing cars and visitors to the missile
production site that he administers.
	   Iraqi authorities arranged the interview with Hameed to back up
accusations by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that the inspectors
engaged in espionage. Aziz made that claim in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan released Saturday.
	   In his letter, Aziz accused one American inspector of using his
personal camera to photograph military equipment. The U.N. weapons
commission has acknowledged that the inspector, Carl Pfluger, used
his own camera in violation of its rules and ordered him to leave
the country.
	   In New York, a spokesman for the U.N. monitors defended the
inspectors.
	   ``These are a group of people who are, by and large, good
professionals doing a difficult job under pressures,'' said Ewen
Buchanan.

	   BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP) _ A Palestinian man threw two hand
grenades near a bus stop crowded with Israel soldiers Monday
morning, injuring at least 64 people during a critical point in a
Mideast peace summit in Maryland.
	   In response to the attack, Israel suspended talks with the
Palestinians on all matters unrelated to security issues and
Israel's prime minister said he would not remain at the talks for
an ``unlimited period of time.''
	   Three victims of the attack were in serious condition after the
rush hour assault in the desert town of Beersheba 50 miles (83
kilometers) south of Jerusalem, and many soldiers were among the
wounded.
	   After the 8 a.m. (0600 gmt) blasts, army-issue olive duffel bags
and clothes were seen strewn on the pavement near a glass-covered
bus stop. A soldier's polished black boots, with the socks stuffed
inside, were left behind on a traffic island.
	   There were conflicting reports on how the assailant was caught.
	   Some witnesses said that as the Palestinian fled, he ran into a
bus turning the corner. A bus driver said he ran down the attacker
with his bus. Israel TV's Channel Two showed footage of a bus whose
glass door was shattered by the impact.
	   However, a construction worker, Avi Friedman, said he jumped the
man from behind and wrestled him to the ground.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu after receiving word of the attack. Arafat said
he regretted the incident and ordered an investigation, according
to a statement by Netanyahu's office.
	   Netanyahu, who received the call during a meeting with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said he appreciated the word
but that now, more than ever, real action by the Palestinians was
needed to fight terrorism.
	   ``In order to achieve peace, there is a need for a firm struggle
and a clear order to everyone in the Palestinian Authority,
especially Jibril Rajoub, to act on all security matters,''
Netanyahu said in a statement, referring to Arafat's West Bank
security chief.
	   In response to the attack, Netanyahu decided to postpone a
negotiation session that had been scheduled for Monday on the
opening of a Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip.
	   ``For progress to be achieved on other issues, we must first
focus on security and terrorism. We are awaiting answers from the
Palestinians today. We do not plan to stay at Wye Plantation for an
unlimited period of time,'' Netanyahu said in a press statement
issued from his office in Jerusalem.
	   Rajoub said the assailant was a 29-year-old father of five from
the West Bank town of Hebron. He said the man was a supporter of
the Islamic militant group Hamas and was imprisoned twice for
activities linked to the group.
	   Israel radio quoted the country's police minister, Avigdor
Kahalani as saying that the assailant told investigators that Hamas
had sent him to carry out the attack.

U.S. gymnast Brian Babcock dead at 38

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Brian Babcock, who bounced back to champion
status in gymnastics after just missing a spot on the 1984 Olympic
team, has died of complications following a bone marrow transplant.
He was 38.
	   Babcock, who earlier this year learned he had a leukemia-like
cancer before he even felt sick, received a bone marrow transplant
on Aug. 14. Though doctors told him he had a 50-50 chance to live,
the gymnast remained optimistic.
	   ``After experiencing nine different surgeries to stay at an
elite level in gymnastics, I'd have to say it was great grounds to
be prepared for what I'm going through now,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press after his transplant.
	   Babcock died Sunday at his Houston area home with family at his
side. He suffered from myelodysplasia, which hampers the body's
ability to produce blood and fight infection.
	   He compared his fight for life to his battle to recover from his
third knee operation before vying for a spot on the gold
medal-winning gymnastics team at the Los Angeles Olympics. Even
hobbled, he barely missed the cut.
	   He came back to win the national all-around title the following
year.
	   ``The entire gymnastics community is deeply saddened by Brian's
passing,'' said Bob Colarossi, president of USA Gymnastics. ``He
possessed unparalleled energy and excitement for the sport of
gymnastics, which was reflected in his performance as an athlete
and as a coach.''
	   Babcock, born in Garden City, Kan., starred at Southern
Illinois. He earned medals at the NCAA championships and the Pan
American Games before his 1985 title.
	   Babcock had remained active in gymnastics as a coach, moving
recently from Pennsylvania to Houston, where he opened the Texas
Sports Ranch along with fellow coach Kevin Mazeika. Among the
pupils is 2000 Olympic hopeful Sean Townsend.

Guyana beats Leewards in Red Stripe Bowl final

<TEXT>
	   OCHO RIOS, Jamaica (AP) _ Penetrative spin bowling carried
Guyana to an emphatic 52-run victory over the Leeward Islands
Monday in the final of the Red Stripe Bowl one-day cricket
tournament at Kaiser Sports Club.
	   Replying to Guyana's 226 for seven made in 50 overs, the
Leewards tumbled from 78 for one to be bowled out for 174 in 45.5
overs. It was sweet revenge for Guyana, which lost in the 1997
final to the Leewards.
	   Apart from fast bowler Reon King, who picked up the first wicket
off captain Stuart Williams for three in the third over, Guyana's
spinners shared the remaining wickets.
	   None of the Leewards batsmen looked at ease, with Lennox Cush
leading the way with four wickets for 37 runs. Neil McGarrel and
captain Carl Hooper had two wickets each.
	   Opening batsman Wilden Cornwall, the Leewards' most consistent
batsman throughout the tournament, was again among the runs with
45. Runako Morton, with whom he shared a second wicket stand of 77
runs, topscored with 48.
	   But once both were out, wickets fell regularly as Guyana's slow
bowlers took control.
	   Earlier Monday, Guyana's batting struggled after winning the
toss and taking first strike. Openers Clayton Lambert and Andrew
Gonsalves posted 108 for the first wicket in aggressive fashion.
	   Lambert was the dominant partner, slamming 65 off 72 deliveries
in an innings that included one six and seven boundaries. Gonsalves
was run out, making 41 with six boundaries.
	   The remaining Guyanese batsmen failed to capitalize on the good
start. Though sharing a third wicket stand of 41, star batsmen
Hooper (25) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (29) never looked
threatening as the Leewards fought their way back into contention
through superb fielding and good bowling.
	   Leading the Leewards attack was offspinner Anthony Lake who
captured two wickets for 42 runs.
	   The Leewards had reached the final after appealing the Jamaica
Cricket Board's decision that Trinidad and Tobago should have
contested the match.
	   Trinidad and Tobago were declared winners after Saturday's
semi-final against the Leewards was halted midway the Trinidadians'
innings. Match referee Hugh Perry ruled that Trinidad and Tobago
were winners due to a superior run rate.
	   But the Leewards' management charged that Perry used the wrong
formula to determine the run rate. Their appeal was upheld late
Sunday despite much confusion and controversy. Trinidad and Tobago
reportedly were considering legal action.

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Three men were shot to death during a
fight over a soccer game near Kingston, Jamaica, police reported
Monday.
	   They said the shooting occurred Sunday following a game in
Olympic Gardens, a neighborhood in the southeastern district of St.
Andrew.
	   The victims were identified as Devon DePass, 31; Dennison
Allison, 45; and Trevor Dixon, 24. They were shot repeatedly, and
their bodies were found on nearby Balmagie Avenue.
	   Amateur soccer games have led to deaths in Jamaica twice in the
last month. On Sept. 19, the manager of a community soccer team in
De La Vega City was charged with stabbing one of his players to
death.
	   There were no immediate details about the cause of the fight.

Egypt suspends railway officials after 47 killed in train accident

	   KAFR EL-DAWAR, Egypt (AP) _ The Egyptian government suspended
five top railway officials Monday after a train jumped its rails
and slammed into a crowded town square, killing 47 people.
	   Transportation Minister Suleiman Metwally ordered the suspension
of the officials, including the national head of railways and the
managers in the province where the accident occurred, pending an
investigation into the accident.
	   The train flew off the rails as it pulled into a siding in the
station of Kafr el-Dawar town, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast
of the port city of Alexandria.
	   It crashed through a barricade and into the town square, killing
47 and injuring 104 people, police officials said. They dismissed
earlier reports of as many as 52 dead, saying that in some cases,
bodies were cut in two and counted twice in preliminary death
tolls.
	   A preliminary investigation indicated that the accident was
caused by a faulty brake system.
	   It said that passengers had disrupted brake linkages between
cars, causing them to fail. People often hop on packed Egyptian
trains and ride on the roof or between the cars.
	   Witnesses said the train was speeding when it pulled into the
station, and that the driver was wildly blowing the whistle and
yelling for bystanders to get out of the way.
	   Rescue teams ended their search for survivors Monday after
lifting the last car of the train with mobile cranes.
	   Pools of blood and shredded bloodstained clothing could be seen
beneath the wreckage.
	   Five mangled bodies, including that of a young boy, were found
beneath the last three cars of the train, witnesses said.
	   Hundreds of citizens crowded the square to help in the rescue
efforts.
	   Residents accused the authorities of neglect.
	   ``No one came until 8:15,'' three hours after the crash, said
Khaled Mohammed Lotfi. ``Everyone you see working here is a local
man. We asked them to call the Defense Ministry to bring in
soldiers to help, but they called us crazy.''

UN chief condemns barbarism in Sierra Leone and urges surrender
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned
``acts of barbarism'' by rebels in Sierra Leone and urged them
Monday to lay down their arms and surrender.
	   In a report to the Security Council, Annan said human rights
abuses committed by the rebels have created a ``humanitarian
emergency'' in the West African nation and continue to cause
widespread dislocation of the local population.
	   ``In the last two months the northern province has seen a
resurgence of rebel activity, including atrocities, with no sign of
weakening in rebel resolve, numbers or organization,'' Annan said.
	   The current concentration of rebels in the northwest indicates
that they may be preparing for a major strike against Makeni or
Port Loko, which would sever the main route from neighboring Guinea
used to supply the West African peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone,
he said.
	   U.N. humanitarian experts estimate that 250,000 people have been
displaced since the intervention of the Nigerian-led peacekeeping
force in February, an increase of about 70,000 since August. And
Annan said there are fears a considerable number of displaced
people remain uncounted.
	   Sierra Leone, one of the world's poorest countries, has been
plagued by civil war since the early 1990s.
	   A rebel junta which seized power from the democratically elected
government in May 1997 was driven from office by a Nigerian-led
peacekeeping force. Although the elected president's return to
power early this year was hailed as a victory for democracy in West
Africa, it has not ended the bloodshed.
	   U.N. observers received an escalating number of reports in
September of mutilations, amputations, summary executions,
abductions and house burnings, Annan said, noting that in a single
week 20 villages were attacked and destroyed in northwestern Sierra
Leone.
	   ``I am particularly outraged by the senseless acts of terror
perpetrated against children, such as the amputation of limbs of
boys and girls as young as six years of age, and support the
efforts to bring to justice the authors of these especially
abhorrent crimes,'' he said.
	   As a result of the continuing military conflict, the government
has made little progress in disarming, demobilizing and
reintegrating soldiers which are essential for the long-term
stability of the country, Annan said.
	   The secretary general also expressed ``deep concern'' about
instability on the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia and
urged both governments to exercise ``maximum restraint'' and pursue
dialogue.
	   If both countries agree, he said, the deployment of peacekeeping
troops and U.N. military observers at the border ``could help to
stabilize the situation and restore mutual confidence.''
	   On a day that 34 military officers were executed in Sierra Leone
for crimes linked to the 1997 coup, Annan expressed concern that
those sentenced to death by military courts had no right of appeal.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge on Monday moved closer to
having former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet extradited from
Britain to Spain on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose arrest order Friday prompted
British police to detain the aging Pinochet in London, added in a
second document sent to Britain specific charges related to 94
alleged victims of Pinochet's regime, most of them Chileans.
	   The original order said Pinochet, who is in London recovering
from back surgery, was responsible for the death of Spaniards and
others. But it had cited only one specific case, the kidnapping and
disappearance of a Chilean dissident.
	   Another Spanish Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon, who is
investigating human rights violations in Chile, has also applied to
question Pinochet in London.
	   Any request for his extradition must be approved first by
Spain's National Court and then by the cabinet of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar before being presented to British authorities, who
would have the final word.
	   Garzon has 40 days from Friday to present a formal extradition
request.
	   Garzon is probing Pinochet's alleged role in Operation Condor in
which juntas in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and elsewhere cooperated
to snuff out dissent in each other's countries in the 1970s and
1980s.
	   Aznar's government has opposed the probes by Garzon and Garcia
Castellon, saying they could upset delicate political dynamics in
countries that suffered years of military rule.
	   On Monday, Spanish prosecutors moved to try to stop the judge's
planned trip to London.
	   While Garzon is relying on a Spanish law that allows prosecution
of alleged genocide no matter where it occurs, Spanish prosecutors
say he has no jurisdiction outside Spain.
	   Chile's government has protested Pinochet's arrest saying he had
diplomatic immunity abroad and immunity from prosecution at home
because a constitution he guided to enactment before stepping down
as president in 1990 made him a senator for life.

Iraq steps up campaign against U.N. monitors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from Aziz letter &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials lashed out at U.N. arms
monitors on Monday, saying that they act unprofessionally and in
one case turned on music and danced as they examined a missile
production site.
	   Iraq repeatedly has accused U.N. weapons inspectors of espionage
and on Aug. 5 ordered an end to surprise inspections by the arms
experts, effectively banning all searches for elements of its past
weapons programs.
	   Iraq has recently mounted a campaign to discredit the remaining
inspectors, who are only allowed to visit weapons sites where the
United Nations already has installed surveillance equipment.
	   One Iraqi official, Kahlil Hameed, accused the monitors of
turning on cassette recorders and dancing in August while examining
a missile site.
	   Hammed also said monitors used their personal cameras to take
photographs of civilians, passing cars and visitors to the missile
production site that he administers.
	   Iraqi authorities arranged the interview with Hameed to back up
accusations by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that the inspectors
engaged in espionage. Aziz made that claim in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan released Saturday.
	   In his letter, Aziz accused one American inspector of using his
personal camera to photograph military equipment. The U.N. weapons
commission has acknowledged that the inspector, Carl Pfluger, used
his own camera in violation of its rules and ordered him to leave
the country.
	   In New York, a spokesman for the U.N. monitors defended the
inspectors.
	   ``These are a group of people who are, by and large, good
professionals doing a difficult job under pressures,'' said Ewen
Buchanan.

USOC to ask for `medal recognition' for swim relay beaten by East
</HEADLINE>
Germans &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Four U.S. swimmers from two decades ago may be
getting Olympic gold medals that authorities believe were lost to
drug use by East German athletes.
	   U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said Monday that he
was preparing to ask the International Olympic Committee to give
``appropriate medal recognition'' to the 1976 American women's
400-meter medley relay team, which finished second to East Germany
at the Summer Games in Montreal.
	   Hybl said the USOC would not ask that the East German quartet of
Ulrike Richter, Hannelore Anke, Andrea Pollack and Kornelia Ender
relinquish its title.
	   But he said that a German court case investigating athlete
doping in the old East German sports system offered ``conclusive
proof'' that the gold-medal team had an unfair edge.
	   The East Germans won the race in 4 minutes, 7.95 seconds, taking
5 1/2 seconds off the old world record and beating the U.S. team of
Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile Wright and Shirley Babeshoff by
6.6 seconds.
	   Hybl said the committee was awaiting court documents that it
believes will show irrefutably that Pollack, who swam the third
leg, was boosted by anabolic steroids, which are banned by the IOC
and most other sports organizations.
	   Steroids help build muscle mass and allow an athlete to rebound
faster from injuries. The German courts have heard testimony that
East German athletes were routinely fed steroids disguised as
vitamins, and five doctors and coaches have admitted giving
steroids to athletes as young as 12 years old.
	   ``From 1968 through 1988, there was state-sponsored doping
throughout the East German sports system,'' Hybl said. ``The fact
is that there probably were 10,000 athletes involved in the
system.''
	   Babeshoff was the premier U.S. women's swimmer in the mid-1970s
but was repeatedly stymied in international competition. Between
1972-76, she won four gold medals and 13 silvers in the Olympics
and world championships, with 10 of those runner-up finishes behind
East German swimmers.
	   Because the doping apparently took place without the athletes'
knowledge, Hybl said, the USOC would not ask that the original gold
medals be withdrawn.
	   But Hybl said he would ask IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch
within the next 2-3 weeks to take action ``out of fairness and
competition in the Olympic spirit.''
	   ``We are going to pursue having appropriate medal recognition,''
Hybl said. ``We support our athletes.''
	   The East German relay team passed drug tests at the Montreal
Games and the IOC for years has refused to even consider changing
results that might have been tainted by doping.
	   It threw Canadian 100-meter gold medalist Ben Johnson out of the
1988 Games in Seoul after he flunked a drug test and later admitted
under oath that he had been on steroids for years. But the IOC
allowed him to keep his bronze relay medal from the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics because he passed a drug test there.
	   Last January, as court evidence of East German doping mounted,
Samaranch said the IOC would consider altering its records and
medals standings in cases were there was specific proof of
cheating. It was a major change for an organization that values
tradition and history.
	   And, while rumors of drug use by scores of athletes from many
countries have circulated for years, Hybl said the USOC would not
ask for a large-scale alteration of Olympic races.
	   ``We are going to support our athletes on a case-by-case basis
where there is conclusive proof through either conviction or
confession in court,'' he said.

Young, Flutie just know how to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ This was no Hail Flutie from 50 yards. But when
Doug Flutie scored on a bootleg to hand Jacksonville its first
loss, it was the kind of play with which he always charmed the
football world.
	   It's also what fans admire in Steve Young. He ran 23 yards
through the entire Indianapolis defense, including four players
near the goal line, and tossed a 1-yard pass to Jerry Rice for the
2-point conversion to help the 49ers avoid a major upset by beating
the Colts 34-31.
	   Doug Flutie isn't Steve Young. But both are winners, as are most
National Football League quarterbacks who survive into their 30s, a
lesson for the impatient fan who thinks an NFL quarterback can be
made in the six or seven games that Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf
have played.
	   ``He's a big-time player who made big-time plays,'' Bruce Smith
says of Flutie, his new Bills teammate who has always had his
height (5-foot-10 but more like 5-8) held against him. ``His
heart's a lot bigger than his size.''
	   Young?
	   ``I didn't think he was going to slide,'' said Colts cornerback
Jeff Burris, one of many Colts who had a shot at the 49ers'
quarterback on his TD run. ``He's a playmaker. He plays the game
the way it should be played.''
	   ``That's what makes him Steve Young,'' added teammate Terrell
Owens.
	   Flutie, who will lose his job again when Rob Johnson is healthy,
was run out of the NFL a decade ago because of his lack of height
and settled in Canada, where he did nothing but win and gain
experience.
	   Young also bided his time before becoming a full-time starter at
age 30. He sat first behind Vinny Testaverde in Tampa (Vinny
Testaverde?) and then behind Joe Montana.
	   After Sunday's games, quarterbacks 35 and over (John Elway,
Bubby Brister, Young, Randall Cunningham, Dan Marino, Warren Moon
and Flutie) are 23-6 as starters.
	   Add Chris Chandler, who's 33, in Atlanta, and it's 28-7.
	   Quarterbacks 25 and under (Kerry Collins, Peyton Manning, Rob
Johnson, Ryan Leaf, Danny Kanell, Charlie Batch, Tony Banks, Steve
McNair, Danny Wuerffel and Jake Plummer are 20-36.
	   The reason?
	   The salary cap doesn't allow young quarterbacks to apprentice
under veterans. The Colts, for example, had to trade Jim Harbaugh
to the Ravens to make cap room for Manning.
	   ``Maybe it would help to sit and watch,'' Plummer said after he
was sacked seven times and turned over the ball three times Sunday
in a 34-7 loss to the Giants. ``But then I wouldn't be starting
would I? I'm a competitor and I want to start.''
	   Chances are that competitive spirit will help Plummer down the
line. He even said he was encouraged Sunday by the work of the
quarterback who opposed him _ Kanell, who threw for 259 yards and
three TDs after two games in which he totaled 183 yards and five
turnovers. ``You like to see young quarterbacks succeed.''
	   Kanell said the turning point came after last Sunday night's
debacle against Atlanta, when two ex-quarterbacks turned TV
personalities pointed out that shaky starts are the rule with QBs.
	   ``I got good advice from good people,'' Kanell said. ``Guys like
Joe Theismann and Ron Jaworski told me I had the tools to play in
this league. They said there has never been a quarterback who
didn't go through tough times.''
	   So hold the obits on Manning and Leaf. Hold them on Plummer and
Kanell and Bobby Hoying and Gus Frerotte and the rest of the young
QBs. And don't start when Batch, who's started very well for
Detroit, hits the wall _ maybe this week against the Vikings.
	   Listen to Theismann and Jaworski instead.

Dominicans look to Sosa as a hurricane hero
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSE MONEGRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ The party's already begun in
the Dominican Republic, where Sammy Sosa, at last, is coming home
as a much-needed national hero.
	   The Dominican-born Chicago Cubs slugger has been busy in the
United States, basking in the glow of his 66-home run season,
receiving the keys to New York City, throwing a ceremonial first
pitch in the World Series and raising funds for hurricane relief.
	   On Tuesday, it's Dominicans' turn.
	   ``Many times, Sosa made us feel happy with his home runs,'' said
Miguel Contreras, a bar patron in Santo Domingo. ``Now it's right
that we make him feel good.''
	   In a country still coping with the ravages of Hurricane Georges,
the government proclaimed Sosa's homecoming Tuesday a day of
national celebration. Thousands of well-wishers will get free bus
rides to Santo Domingo's international airport to cheer Sosa's
arrival.
	   In Santo Domingo, hundreds of motorists cruised the streets,
sporting the magic number ``66'' on their windshields. In Sosa's
storm-battered hometown of San Pedro de Macoris, 40 miles (66
kilometers) east of Santo Domingo, residents have plastered the
seaside boulevard's trees and walls with posters of Sosa.
	   President Leonel Fernandez planned to present Sosa with the
Order of Duarte, Sanchez and Mella, the Caribbean country's highest
civilian honor, before Sosa heads to San Pedro, where he will
distribute relief aid to storm victims.
	   Dominicans followed every step of Sosa and Mark McGwire's battle
to surpass Roger Maris' Major League record of 61 home runs in a
season. Each home run, each strikeout was chronicled in
excruciating detail by the country's newspapers.
	   While McGwire took the crown with 70 homers, Sosa's final home
runs provided the only cause for celebration while Hurricane
Georges raked the nation on Sept. 22. The storm killed at least 283
people in the Dominican Republic and left more than 100,000
homeless.
	   For a day, at least, Dominicans look forward to forgetting the
pain and pressure of life after the hurricane. ``I wouldn't miss
the opportunity to welcome Sammy for anything,'' Contreras said.

	   KAFR EL-DAWAR, Egypt (AP) _ The Egyptian government suspended
five top railway officials Monday after a train jumped its rails
and slammed into a crowded town square, killing 47 people.
	   Transportation Minister Suleiman Metwally ordered the suspension
of the officials, including the national head of railways and the
managers in the province where the accident occurred, pending an
investigation into the accident.
	   The train flew off the rails as it pulled into a siding in the
station of Kafr el-Dawar town, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast
of the port city of Alexandria.
	   It crashed through a barricade and into the town square, killing
47 and injuring 104 people, police officials said. They dismissed
earlier reports of as many as 52 dead, saying that in some cases,
bodies were cut in two and counted twice in preliminary death
tolls.
	   A preliminary investigation indicated that the accident was
caused by a faulty brake system.
	   It said that passengers had disrupted brake linkages between
cars, causing them to fail. People often hop on packed Egyptian
trains and ride on the roof or between the cars.
	   Witnesses said the train was speeding when it pulled into the
station, and that the driver was wildly blowing the whistle and
yelling for bystanders to get out of the way.
	   Rescue teams ended their search for survivors Monday after
lifting the last car of the train with mobile cranes.
	   Pools of blood and shredded bloodstained clothing could be seen
beneath the wreckage.
	   Five mangled bodies, including that of a young boy, were found
beneath the last three cars of the train, witnesses said.
	   Hundreds of citizens crowded the square to help in the rescue
efforts.
	   Residents accused the authorities of neglect.
	   ``No one came until 8:15,'' three hours after the crash, said
Khaled Mohammed Lotfi. ``Everyone you see working here is a local
man. We asked them to call the Defense Ministry to bring in
soldiers to help, but they called us crazy.''
	   The train, which was traveling south from Alexandria, left the
rails when the driver changed tracks at high speed, the Interior
Ministry said in a statement.
	   The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, shot into
the air, hit a war memorial in the square and slammed into seven
shops, witnesses said.
	   When the train hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,''
said Hany Roushdy, a teen-ager who saw the crash.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995, when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

44-year-old DeBerg might just be the starter in Atlanta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUWANEE, Georgia (AP) _ Try selling this story to Hollywood.
	   A 44-year-old who hasn't played in the National Football League
since 1993 decides to come out of retirement. He manages to find a
team that will give him a tryout, then plays well enough in
training camp to earn a job as the backup quarterback.
	   Now, here's where the plot gets really interesting. The starter
goes down with an injury, so the aging quarterback finds himself
taking snaps for a 5-1 team.
	   Steve DeBerg, the role belongs to you.
	   ``The whole thing has been kind of an amazing adventure,'' said
DeBerg, who will start for the Atlanta Falcons if Chris Chandler's
aching left shoulder doesn't heal before this weekend's game
against the New York Jets. ``A lot of what has happened has really
surprised me.''
	   Coach Dan Reeves admitted Monday he doesn't know what to expect
if he has to start a quarterback who is only a decade younger than
himself and just a few years away from qualifying for a senior
citizen's discount.
	   ``We're dealing with the unknown,'' Reeves said. ``Until he
plays a full game, no one is really going to know for sure. I can't
answer that question. I just know that I'm not that concerned about
it. I think he understands and knows what it takes. He's been there
before.''
	   Already, DeBerg has played a key role in the Falcons matching
the best start in team history.
	   On Sunday, after Chandler hobbled off the field in excruciating
pain late in the first half, DeBerg took off his baseball cap,
slipped on his helmet and made sure Atlanta remained tied for first
in the NFC West with a 31-23 victory over the New Orleans Saints.
	   ``It was very exciting,'' DeBerg said, reflecting on his
performance a day later at the Falcons' suburban training complex.
``It was frustrating for me in the third quarter when things
weren't going as well as I expected or hoped for. But the team was
playing so well, I had a chance to kind of settle down and get
things going.''
	   Indeed, the third quarter was like a horror movie, with DeBerg
as the star. The Falcons were leading 17-14 when he was sacked in
the end zone for a safety. He completed only one of four passes in
the quarter _ the lone completion resulting in a 3-yard loss _ and
guided the Falcons to minus-15 yards in offense.
	   In the fourth quarter, however, the story took an amazing twist.
DeBerg completed all four of his passes, including his first
touchdown since '93 and a key third-down throw that allowed the
Falcons to run out the clock.
	   ``I really have been preparing myself because I know if
something does happen, this team is going to depend on me to win
the football game,'' said DeBerg, who was 7-of-10 for 60 yards.
``I've seen a lot of backup quarterbacks who kind of take the easy
way out and don't prepare themselves. When the opportunity presents
itself, they're not prepared mentally or physically.''
	   DeBerg certainly hasn't taken the easy way out. He retired after
the 1993 season, a 16-year career seemingly over at age 40, but he
maintained his physical conditioning, kept throwing a football in
his spare time and finally talked himself into trying a comeback.
	   If Chandler can't play against the Jets, DeBerg will make his
first start since Dec. 13, 1993, when he subbed for the injured Dan
Marino in Miami.

USOC to ask for `medal recognition' for swim relay beaten by East
</HEADLINE>
Germans &QL;

 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Four U.S. swimmers from two decades ago may be
getting Olympic gold medals that authorities believe were lost to
drug use by East German athletes.
	   U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said Monday that he
was preparing to ask the International Olympic Committee to give
``appropriate medal recognition'' to the 1976 American women's
400-meter medley relay team, which finished second to East Germany
at the Summer Games in Montreal.
	   Hybl said the USOC would not ask that the East German quartet of
Ulrike Richter, Hannelore Anke, Andrea Pollack and Kornelia Ender
relinquish its title.
	   But he said that a German court case investigating athlete
doping in the old East German sports system offered ``conclusive
proof'' that the gold-medal team had an unfair edge.
	   The East Germans won the race in 4 minutes, 7.95 seconds, taking
5 1/2 seconds off the old world record and beating the U.S. team of
Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile Wright and Shirley Babashoff by
6.6 seconds.
	   Hybl said the committee was awaiting court documents that it
believes will show irrefutably that Pollack, who swam the third
leg, was boosted by anabolic steroids, which are banned by the IOC
and most other sports organizations.
	   Steroids help build muscle mass and allow an athlete to rebound
faster from injuries. The German courts have heard testimony that
East German athletes were routinely fed steroids disguised as
vitamins, and five doctors and coaches have admitted giving
steroids to athletes as young as 12 years old.
	   ``From 1968 through 1988, there was state-sponsored doping
throughout the East German sports system,'' Hybl said. ``The fact
is that there probably were 10,000 athletes involved in the
system.''
	   Babashoff was the premier U.S. women's swimmer in the mid-1970s
but was repeatedly stymied in international competition. Between
1972-76, she won four gold medals and 13 silvers in the Olympics
and world championships, with 10 of those runner-up finishes behind
East German swimmers.
	   Because the doping apparently took place without the athletes'
knowledge, Hybl said, the USOC would not ask that the original gold
medals be withdrawn.
	   But Hybl said he would ask IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch
within the next 2-3 weeks to take action ``out of fairness and
competition in the Olympic spirit.''
	   ``We are going to pursue having appropriate medal recognition,''
Hybl said. ``We support our athletes.''
	   The East German relay team passed drug tests at the Montreal
Games and the IOC for years has refused to even consider changing
results that might have been tainted by doping.
	   It threw Canadian 100-meter gold medalist Ben Johnson out of the
1988 Games in Seoul after he flunked a drug test and later admitted
under oath that he had been on steroids for years. But the IOC
allowed him to keep his bronze relay medal from the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics because he passed a drug test there.
	   Last January, as court evidence of East German doping mounted,
Samaranch said the IOC would consider altering its records and
medals standings in cases were there was specific proof of
cheating. It was a major change for an organization that values
tradition and history.
	   And, while rumors of drug use by scores of athletes from many
countries have circulated for years, Hybl said the USOC would not
ask for a large-scale alteration of Olympic races.
	   ``We are going to support our athletes on a case-by-case basis
where there is conclusive proof through either conviction or
confession in court,'' he said.

Flutie's magical comeback wins stir quarterback debate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF GOODMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ The last thing the Buffalo Bills
want is a quarterback controversy. Doug Flutie hasn't given them
much of a choice.
	   Actually, the 5-foot-10 (1.75-meter) former Canadian Football
League star has forced Buffalo coach Wade Phillips to make a
difficult decision _ Rob Johnson or Flutie.
	   Flutie has led the Bills to comeback wins in successive weeks.
First it was Indianapolis. Then he ended Jacksonville's unbeaten
hopes Sunday on a 1-yard touchdown run with 13 seconds left.
	   Will Phillips choose the dlrs 25 million franchise quarterback
or the minimum-salary fan favorite who disappeared north of the
border for the past eight years?
	   In all likelihood, it will be back to the sidelines for Flutie.
But maybe not just yet.
	   For the first time all season, Phillips even ducked the question
of who would be the starter when Johnson is healthy.
	   ``We have one quarterback that's hurt and one that's healthy,
and I don't want to get into what-if's,'' Phillips said. ``If Rob's
not able to practice like last week, then Doug will play.''
	   Even though Phillips won't publicly say it, players will.
	   ``Rob's the starting quarterback and we're just very fortunate
Doug's able to come in and do what he did,'' said Bills fullback
Sam Gash.
	   ``Rob's still the guy,'' said Bills running back Thurman Thomas.
``If I was the owner and paid him dlrs 25 million, he's still going
to be the No. 1 guy. We're just happy to have two quality QB's on
the team.''
	   The decision was made when the Bills dealt a first-round pick
for Johnson this past offseason and gave him the most lucrative
signing bonus in team history. The 35-year-old Flutie, told he'd
have a chance to compete for the starting job, never got the
chance.
	   Health permitting, Johnson's the starter.
	   But Johnson's well-being, or lack thereof, has enabled Flutie to
have nearly as much playing time this season.
	   Johnson, 25, has made it through just three of five games this
season and sat out Sunday's 17-16 upset win over Jacksonville with
a rib injury.
	   ``I think it should be Flutie,'' said former Giants quarterback
Phil Simms, now a TV commentator for CBS. ``I like Rob Johnson a
lot, but the team has won two in a row with Flutie and you let it
go until it runs out.''
	   Johnson said his ribs are still bothering him and isn't certain
whether he'll be able to play this Sunday night at Carolina.
	   If Flutie is overlooked in favor of the 6-foot-4 (1.9-meter)
Johnson, it wouldn't be the first time.
	   The former Heisman Trophy winner was drafted in the 11th round
by the Rams in 1985, but elected to sign with the New Jersey
Generals of the USFL. The Rams traded his rights to Chicago the
following season and Flutie played five games with Mike Ditka's
Bears before being dealt to New England for an eighth-round pick.

	   ``I was No. 1, then I went to No. 3, and now I'm coming back,''
_ Marcelo Rios, on winning in Singapore, his seventh title of the
year.
	   ``I hit that ball perfectly. It was great timing and
technique.'' _ Venus Williams, after hammering a 127 mph serve,
women's record, in her European Championships match against Mary
Pierce.
	   ``It was a house of pain.'' _ Nicolas Kiefer, describing his
1{-hour ordeal at the hairdressers where he dyed his hair blond.
	   ``The reason why Pete (Sampras) is No. 1 is because he plays
well on all three surfaces. He's going to be very tough to catch.''
_ Patrick Rafter, after losing in the CA Trophy, an indoor
tournament which Sampras eventually won.
	   ``It's exactly what people want, but then they get mad at me.
That was nothing compared to what I am capable of.'' _ John
McEnroe, after arguing with the umpire and shouting at his opponent
in a senior tournament match in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``There should be some rules. The referees deserve some
respect.'' _ Henri Leconte, saying the senior tour needs to
introduce rules to combat bad behavior.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SWIFT SERVE &QC; 
	   Venus Williams unleashed the fastest serve ever recorded in
women's tennis during the European Championships when she drilled
an ace clocked at 127.4 mph (205 kph) past a stunned Mary Pierce.
Williams broke her own record _ a blistering 125 mph (201 kph)
serve she delivered at Wimbledon this year.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SCUD'S RETURN &QC; 
	   Mark Philippoussis has ended his feud with John Newcombe and
Tony Roche and rejoined the Australian Davis Cup team. Ironically,
his first match back will be against Zimbabwe next April. With
Philippoussis, known as Scud because of his powerful serve, sitting
in the stands after refusing to play Davis Cup, Australia was upset
by Zimbabwe in this year's competition.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SWISS STREAK &QC; 
	   When Lindsay Davenport successfully defended her European
Championships by beating Venus Williams in Zurich, she extended her
five-year winning streak in Switzerland to 17 matches. She has not
lost a set in the past two years in the Zurich tournament. And it
was her sixth tournament title of the year, tops on the Corel WTA
Tour.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SINGAPORE SNACK &QC; 
	   Australian teen-ager Lleyton Hewitt had breakfast with the
orangutans at the Singapore Zoological Gardens while playing in the
Heineken Open. No one, though, told him how big orangutans grow.
Hewitt wondered whether it was a good idea when he spotted the huge
male orangutans. Fortunately, breakfast turned out to be feeding a
fruit platter to the mother and baby.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STAUDER SUCCESSOR? &QC; 
	   Klaus Stauder has denied reports that Boris Becker might succeed
him as president of the German Tennis Federation (DTB). Becker, who
is semi-retired and playing only certain tournaments, is the
manager of Germany's Davis Cup team. Speculation that the
three-time Wimbledon champion might succeed Stauder increased when
the DTB president, whose term ends in February 1999, said he would
not stand for reelection. Stauder said Becker ``would no longer
feel free and independent'' if he became DTB president.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STEFANKI TO COACH &QC; 
	   Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman has taken on Larry Stefanki as his new
coach _ at least for four weeks. If things work out well, they will
sign a one-year contract. The Swede has been without a coach since
he parted company with Swede Fredrik Rosengren earlier this season.
Stefanki coached Chile's Marcelo Rios to No. 1 in the world before
the two parted ways about six weeks before the U.S. Open this year.

Guyana beats Leewards in Red Stripe Bowl final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Guyana victory, details &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OCHO RIOS, Jamaica (AP) _ Penetrative spin bowling carried
Guyana to an emphatic 52-run victory over the Leeward Islands
Monday in the final of the Red Stripe Bowl one-day cricket
tournament at Kaiser Sports Club.
	   Replying to Guyana's 226 for seven made in 50 overs, the
Leewards tumbled from 78 for one to be bowled out for 174 in 45.5
overs. It was sweet revenge for Guyana, which lost in the 1997
final to the Leewards.
	   Apart from fast bowler Reon King, who picked up the first wicket
off captain Stuart Williams for three in the third over, Guyana's
spinners shared the remaining wickets.
	   None of the Leewards batsmen looked at ease, with Lennox Cush
leading the way with four wickets for 37 runs. Neil McGarrel and
captain Carl Hooper had two wickets each.
	   Opening batsman Wilden Cornwall, the Leewards' most consistent
batsman throughout the tournament, was again among the runs with
45. Runako Morton, with whom he shared a second wicket stand of 77
runs, topscored with 48.
	   But once both were out, wickets fell regularly as Guyana's slow
bowlers took control.
	   Earlier Monday, Guyana's batting struggled after winning the
toss and taking first strike. Openers Clayton Lambert and Andrew
Gonsalves posted 108 for the first wicket in aggressive fashion.
	   Lambert was the dominant partner, slamming 65 off 72 deliveries
in an innings that included one six and seven boundaries. Gonsalves
was run out, making 41 with six boundaries.
	   The remaining Guyanese batsmen failed to capitalize on the good
start. Though sharing a third wicket stand of 41, star batsmen
Hooper (25) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (29) never looked
threatening as the Leewards fought their way back into contention
through superb fielding and good bowling.
	   Leading the Leewards attack was offspinner Anthony Lake who
captured two wickets for 42 runs.
	   The Leewards had reached the final after appealing the Jamaica
Cricket Board's decision that Trinidad and Tobago should have
contested the match.
	   Trinidad and Tobago were declared winners after Saturday's
semi-final against the Leewards was halted midway the Trinidadians'
innings. Match referee Hugh Perry ruled that Trinidad and Tobago
were winners due to a superior run rate.
	   But the Leewards' management charged that Perry used the wrong
formula to determine the run rate. Their appeal was upheld late
Sunday despite much confusion and controversy. Trinidad and Tobago
reportedly were considering legal action.

Former Chilean dictator says he'll fight extradition and win

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet
vowed from his hospital bed Monday to fight attempts to extradite
him to Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, and
said in a statement issued by his lawyers that he is confident of
winning.
	   Chile's ambassador delivered a formal protest to the Foreign
Office, declaring Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity by placing him under arrest at a Spanish magistrate's
request.
	   Spain, meanwhile, increased the charges to genocide _ for which
there is no diplomatic immunity.
	   In the statement issued through his lawyers _ his first public
comment since police arrested him in his bed Friday night _
Pinochet said he would resolutely oppose extradition.
	   ``Upon his arrival he was treated as a VIP,'' said the statement
by the London law firm Kingsley Napley. ``Permission for him to
enter and stay in this country was stamped in his diplomatic
passport.''
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized for as
long as two more weeks, now faces a long battle through British
courts to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who
instigated the extradition proceedings, and a humiliating
appearance before London's Bow Street magistrate's court.
	   Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture and other human
rights abuses against political opponents.
	   A Chilean government report after he left office said 4,299
political opponents were killed or vanished during his rule. He
remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March.
	   Both Britain and Chile appear ready to dig in for a long
dispute.
	   After a 70-minute meeting at the Foreign Office ended in
deadlock, Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza told reporters that Chile
is trying to protect its institutions.
	   Pinochet is immune from prosecution in Chile as a
senator-for-life, and he arrived here on a diplomatic passport.
	   ``The government of Chile is not trying to shield Mr. Pinochet
from the wrath of the law,'' the ambassador said. ``This is really
a matter of international law and processes.''
	   Britain says diplomatic immunity is reserved for accredited
diplomats or foreign government officials on official visits, which
doesn't cover Pinochet.
	   Artaza said that Pinochet, who underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9,
did not fully appreciate what was happening when he woke to find
police in his room with the arrest warrant.
	   ``He was under sedation and he had been interrupted from his
sleep,'' Artaza said. ``He didn't understand what was going on and
the doctors treating him were taken out from his room.''
	   In Spain on Monday, the lead magistrate in the case, Baltasar
Garzon, widened the basis of his original detention request to
include charges of genocide, torture and murder in the
disappearance of 94 people, mostly Chileans.
	   The original arrest warrant was for questioning about an
unspecified number of Spaniards who were killed or vanished in the
first decade after Pinochet seized power in 1973.
	   Garzon is probing Pinochet's alleged role in Operation Condor in
which juntas in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and elsewhere cooperated
to snuff out dissent in each other's countries in the 1970s and
1980s.
	   Another Spanish judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, who is
investigating human rights violations in Chile, has also applied to
question Pinochet in London.
	   The Spanish government has opposed the probes by Garzon and
Garcia Castellon, saying they could upset delicate political
dynamics in countries that suffered years of military rule.
	   On Monday, Spanish prosecutors moved to try to stop the judge's
planned trip to London.
	   While Garzon is relying on a Spanish law that allows prosecution
of alleged genocide no matter where it occurs, Spanish prosecutors
say he has no jurisdiction outside Spain.
	   In Britain, lawmakers of the opposition Conservative Party
charged Prime Minister Tony Blair's 18-month-old Labor Party
government with ``gesture politics.''

Rooting for the Padres can border on passion
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ For San Diegans who like to gamble, smoke
in bars or buy beer at 18, the perfect place to watch the World
Series is just 20 miles (32 kilometers) away.
	   For Tijuana residents, who hold baseball second only to soccer
as their favorite pastime, the Padres' climb to the Series is just
as much their accomplishment as it is San Diego's.
	   In these sister cities where cultures blend and crossing the
border means opportunity to both sides, Padres Fever creates
another unshakable bond.
	   ``It's the team of the region, of Tijuana and all of Baja
California,'' said Raul Robles, 35, who has a ticket to Game 4
Wednesday at Qualcomm Stadium.
	   The Tijuana man watched Game 2 of the ``Serie Mundial'' Sunday
at the crowded Las Pulgas bar on the city's main nightclub strip,
as did Ernesto Hernandez, 28, who went to 30 Padres home games this
season.
	   ``All of the people (here) are supporting San Diego,'' said
Hernandez, refusing to give up hope despite the Padres' two losses
in New York. ``The Padres are going to win here in San Diego.''
	   The fan base is so deep in Mexico that Padres majority owner
John Moores and president Larry Lucchino arranged for games to be
broadcast across the border and opened the first major league
merchandise store in Mexico, the Padres Store in Tijuana.
	   San Diegan Robert Hildebracht, 38, is happy about the
broadcasting arrangement because he'd rather watch the game in
Tijuana. He gets his next chance Tuesday in Game 3.
	   ``I like to drink beer, I like to watch baseball and I like to
smoke, and you can do all that here,'' Hildebracht said. Smoking in
bars is banned in California.
	   Some Americans among the crowd of mostly locals at Las Pulgas
were there to take advantage of Mexico's legal drinking age, 18.
	   ``We're underage and we want to drink,'' said Alex Mendoza, 19,
who is two birthdays shy of legally drinking in California. He
crossed the border with a friend and a cousin to enjoy the game.
	   But most American sports fans travel to Tijuana to gamble. There
are about 10 betting shops where wagers are taken on everything
from the NBA to the Kentucky Derby to college football.
	   ``I don't have to go to Vegas,'' said Jeffrey Amey, 39, a San
Diegan and a regular visitor to Caliente Race and Sports Book near
the border. ``The odds are better there, but I don't have to buy a
plane ticket.''
	   Americans can park their cars on the U.S. side of the border or
take the San Diego Trolley to the international line, then make a
short walk to betting parlors along the town's main streets.
	   Just past the taxi station, the taco stands and tables of
souvenir trinkets is an open-air parlor, where bettors sit on white
plastic chairs and root for teams playing in games that are shown
on several awning-covered televisions.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ With dozens of charred bodies littering
the town, authorities began burying at least 500 people on Monday,
victims of a devastating pipeline explosion over the weekend. Some
who were too burned to be identified would be placed in mass
graves, officials said. Although flames from the ruptured gasoline

	   BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP) _ A Palestinian man threw two hand
grenades near a bus stop crowded with Israeli soldiers on Monday
morning, injuring at least 64 people during a critical point in a
Mideast peace summit in Maryland. In response to the attack, Israel
suspended talks with the Palestinians on all matters unrelated to
security issues and Israel's prime minister said he would not
remain at the talks for an ``unlimited period of time. Three
victims of the attack were in serious condition after the rush hour
assault in the desert town of Beersheba 50 miles (83 kilometers)
south of Jerusalem, and many soldiers were among the wounded.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge on Monday moved closer to
having former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet extradited from
Britain to Spain on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism.
Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose arrest order Friday prompted British
police to detain the aging Pinochet in London, added in a second
document sent to Britain specific charges related to 94 alleged
victims of Pinochet's regime, most of them Chileans. The original
order said Pinochet, who is in London recovering from back surgery,
was responsible for the death of Spaniards and others. But it had
cited only one specific case, the kidnapping and disappearance of a
Chilean dissident. Any request for his extradition must be approved
first by Spain's National Court and then by the cabinet of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar before being presented to British
authorities, who would have the final word. (SPAIN-PINOCHET)
	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Monday formally
asked former Communist Massimo D'Alema to form Italy's 56th
government since World War II. Scalfaro's request came after
D'Alema reported to the president that he has assembled a
parliamentary majority in days of hard bargaining with centrist and
leftists parties. D'Alema is expected to announce his Cabinet
choices Tuesday or Wednesday and go to Parliament for the vote of
confidence that would make him premier in time to attend the
European Union Summit on Friday and Saturday. One of D'Alema's
first appearances as premier-designate will be to join Scalfaro in
meeting with Pope John Paul II Tuesday at the presidential palace.

	   KAFR EL-DAWAR, Egypt (AP) _ The Egyptian government suspended
five top railway officials Monday after a train jumped its rails
and slammed into a crowded town square, killing 47 people.
Transportation Minister Suleiman Metwally ordered the suspension of
the officials, including the national head of railways and the
managers in the province where the accident occurred, pending an
investigation into the accident. The train flew off the rails as it
pulled into a siding in the station of Kafr el-Dawar town, 30
kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port city of Alexandria. It
crashed through a barricade and into the town square, killing 47
and injuring 104 people, police officials said. They dismissed
earlier reports of as many as 52 dead, saying that in some cases,
bodies were cut in two and counted twice in preliminary death
tolls. (EGYPT-TRAIN CRASH)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose for a fourth straight session
Monday, with a sudden flurry of mergers adding to the optimism
created by last week's cut in Federal Reserve interest rates. The
Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.62 points _ or by 0.6 percent
_ at 8,466.45 after retreating from a 98-point gain that put the
blue-chip barometer above 8,500 for the first time since before the
late August selloff. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky on Monday urged the European Union to make more import
efforts to help Asian countries overcome the global crisis, but
faced countercharges the EU was doing more than the United States.
Barshefsky, on a visit to the 15-nation EU, said the economic
crisis had made it critical that the EU and the United States help
other countries ``whose recovery depends in some parts on them
being able to export.'' Barshefsky said Monday that the European
Union should share more of the burden of accepting steel imports.
The European Union said instead it its steel imports had increased
much more than those of the United States. (EU-US-TRADE)
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Dubai on Monday threatened
retaliatory action against the European Union over what it sees as
an unfair and discriminatory duty on Dubai's aluminum exports. ``If
they don't open the door for us, we will do everything legally
possible,'' Mohammed Alabbar, director general of Dubai's
Department of Economic Development, told a press conference. His
warning came ahead of next week's crucial talks on the dispute at a
Gulf Cooperation Council-EU ministerial meeting in Luxembourg. At
the center of the row is a 6 percent EU tax on premium aluminum
exported to Europe by Dubai Aluminum Company and Aluminum Bahrain
in the nearby state of Bahrain, also a member of the GCC.
(EMIRATES-EUROPE)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's UBS AG has lost some
130,000 clients since the announcement last December of the merger
that formed the banking giant, a spokesman said Monday. The loss,
which amounts to around 2 1/2 percent of the bank's total
customers, was lower than expected, UBS spokesman Michael Willi
said. UBS was formed in June as a result of the merger of two major
Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. The
bank had expected to lose between 3 and 4 percent of its customers,
Willi said. (SWITZERLAND-UBS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Government lawyers Monday used videotape
excerpts from pretrial interviews with Microsoft's billionaire
chairman, Bill Gates, to try to show he was behind a controversial
1995 meeting with a rival company to divide the market for Internet
software. Although Gates, the world's wealthiest man, wasn't in the
crowded Washington courtroom, his presence was felt when he
appeared on a large projection screen and on smaller television
sets around the room. What happened during the June 1995 meeting
with executives from rival Netscape Communications Corp. is of
crucial importance to the government, which is trying to show that
Microsoft illegally misused its influence as the maker of the
dominant Windows operating system. (US-MICROSOFT)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ McDonald's Corp. reported Monday its
third-quarter profits rose 7 percent, matching Wall Street
expectations, as the company showed solid sales increases in the
United States and abroad despite a global economic crisis. For the
three months ended Sept. 30, the world's largest fast-food chain
reported net income of dlrs 482.2 million, or 69 cents a diluted
share, compared to dlrs 448.9 million, or 63 cents a diluted share,
the same period a year ago. Sales rose 5 percent to dlrs 9.25
billion from dlrs 8.8 billion. (US-EARNS-MCDONALD'S)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The fabled Madame Tussaud's wax museum, London's
top tourist attraction, has been sold, its parent company announced
Monday. Pearson PLC said it has sold The Tussauds Group, a British
leisure business made up of a number of theme parks and the popular
museum, to Charterhouse Development Capital of London for 352
million pounds (dlrs 598.4 million). Pearson, which also owns the
London-based business newspaper the Financial Times and the French
business daily Les Echos, said proceeds from the sale of The
Tussauds Group would be used to cut debt. The company already has
said it intends to sell an indirect 4.3 percent stake in British
Sky Broadcasting, currently worth around 350 million pounds (dlrs
595 million). (BRITAIN-MADAME TUSSAUD'S)

Report: Troubled Japanese bank to seek state control this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Debt-saddled Long Term Credit Bank of Japan will
seek temporary nationalization this week after being informed by
regulators that its liabilities exceed its assets, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   LTCB will apply to be taken under state control Friday when a
new law aimed at bailing out Japan's troubled banking sector takes
effect, public broadcaster NHK reported.
	   Earlier this month Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down and to pump up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in public
funds into the cash-strapped financial system.
	   The government's Financial Supervisory Agency informed LTCB on
Monday that the bank had a capital deficit at the end of the
current fiscal first half on Sept. 30, if all its assets were
measured at market value, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   An agency official confirmed it has informed LTCB about the
results of its inspection, but added that it can't comment on an
individual bank's asset and liability situation.
	   The agency also said, however, that valued at acquisition
prices, LTCB's assets exceeded its liabilities, Kyodo reported,
adding that Japan's accounting regulations allow banks to value
assets at purchase costs for book-keeping purposes.
	   But regulators regard market valuation as a better guide than
purchase costs to a bank's overall health since the former includes
losses in a bank's stock and securities holdings in calculating
balance sheets, Kyodo said.
	   LTCB, once a major pillar of Japan's postwar financial system,
has seen its share price tumble as low as 3 yen (U.S. dlrs 0.26) in
recent trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   The bank rescue package passed by Parliament is seen as crucial
for cleaning up the heap of bad loans left by the collapse in the
early 1990s of Japan's runaway real estate and stock prices.
	   It is also a key first step in the country's efforts to overcome
its deepest recession since the end of World War II.

Prince Charles, Queen Fabiola of Belgium, careful Arab drivers and
Yasser Arafat. Some items may have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Gloria Estefan will join Meryl Streep in ``50
Violins'' in her first feature-film role.
	   The Cuban-born singer will play Streep's friend and co-worker in
the movie about a woman who taught youngsters in East Harlem how to
play the violin, Miramax Films said Monday.
	   Streep took over the lead, Roberta Tzavaras, from Madonna, who
spent three months learning violin but dropped out before filming
began due to creative differences with director Wes Craven.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Geri Halliwell will soon fill her
post-Spice days with the duties of a goodwill ambassador.
	   Halliwell, a.k.a. Ginger Spice, will promote awareness of
reproduction health issues in Britain for the U.N. Population Fund.
	   ``She will be a great ambassador for young people,'' Fund
spokesman Alex Marshall said Monday.
	   Halliwell, 26, quit the all-girl British pop group May 31,
citing ``differences between us,'' and recently signed a new record
deal.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Georgia has been good to Elton John.
	   ``People always ask me, 'Why do you have a place in Atlanta?'
It's because people here have always been that nice to me,'' said
John, who also owns homes in England and France. ``I've always been
welcomed. I feel at home.''
	   So much at home that he persuaded Disney Chairman Michael Eisner
to pick Atlanta's Alliance Theater for the premiere of Disney's
first original for-the-stage musical. John and lyricist Tim Rice
composed the music for ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,''
which is playing in Atlanta through Nov. 8.
	   ``It gives the show a sense of continuity,'' John said. ``'Aida'
was conceived in Hollywood but written in Atlanta. Time Rice even
wrote a lot of his stuff in Atlanta as well.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ The longtime paramours toured a succession of
Aegean islands on a borrowed yacht, sat side-by-side on the deck
painting watercolors and simply relaxed in the sunshine.
	   All in all, it sounds a luxurious but hardly groundbreaking week
away _ except the pair in question were Prince Charles and Camilla
Parker Bowles and the leisurely cruise marked their first vacation
as a couple, several newspapers reported Monday.
	   A spokeswoman for Charles, the son of Queen Elizabeth II,
declined any comment on the reports that he and Mrs. Parker Bowles
recently spent a week island-hopping with two other couples.
	   Charles and Mrs. Parker Bowles, who is divorced, have spent time
together abroad before, but always traveled separately and met up
as part of a large group, the newspapers reported.
	   The Daily Mail quoted one ``senior royal official, not usually
given to sentimentality'' as saying: ``They looked so sweet
together, it brought tears to my eyes.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Queen Fabiola of Belgium saw
contrasting sides of Thai society Monday, visiting two
disadvantaged groups during the day and dining with the Thai royal
family in the evening.
	   The queen's visit as the guest of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and
Queen Sirikit began Saturday. On Sunday, she attended church at
Assumption University in Bangkok, an institution affiliated with
the Roman Catholic Church.
	   On Monday, Fabiola toured a royal rehabilitation project for
blind women at Nakorn Pathom, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the
capital. The project trains the women in making arts and
handicrafts.
	   She also visited a hospital for handicapped children.
	   Before attending a dinner given by King Bhumibol, she watched
traditional drama and dance performances as well as an elephant
show at a cultural center outside of Bangkok.
	   The queen was to leave Tuesday for Malaysia.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ For one week this month, this
oil-rich emirate will be using a carrot instead of a stick to
convince car drivers to be on their best behavior.
	   During a weeklong campaign starting Saturday, traffic police
will cite 12 motorists a day for following safe driving rules,
radio and press reports said Monday.
	   The safe drivers _ or RoadStars _ will share a total of 100,000
dirhams (dlrs 27,400) in prize money, the report said.
	   During the campaign, police will be on the lookout for drivers
who wear seat belts, drive within speed limits, use their turn
signals and display courteous behavior, the Gulf News reported.
	   Traffic accidents are the number one cause of death in this
country of 2.4 million.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Taking a break from grueling Mideast talks,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hopped on a bicycle and rode
around sprawling Wye Plantation in Maryland for 90 minutes.
	   The 68-year-old Arafat has been dogged by persistent rumors of
failing health because of his trembling lower lip and hands, but
has dismissed the speculation as subversive propaganda.
	   The Al Ayyam daily, which is close to the Palestinian Authority,
reported Monday that ``Arafat rode the bicycle well and did not
show signs of fatigue.''

Optimism in Bulgaria amid emerging markets gloom
</HEADLINE>

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ After years of political turmoil and
economic chaos, Bulgaria now enjoys a strong currency, low
inflation, healthy budget and stable government committed to market
reforms.
	   The Bulgarians are still poor by European standards with a dlrs
100 average monthly salary. But poverty has not driven angry crowds
into the streets as it did almost two years ago when a government
of former communists collapsed.
	   For the first time since communism fell in 1989, the 8.5 million
Bulgarians believe they can safely plan their future.
	   ``I am absolutely sure that we'll have 4.5-5 percent growth of
the (economy) this year,'' Prime Minister Ivan Kostov told a recent
meeting of 1,200 foreign investors in Sofia.
	   It would be the first growth after eight years of steady
decline. Last year the economy contracted by 6.9 percent.
	   Antoine Iskander, a Lebanese businessman, and Kristina
Dimitrova, a Bulgarian businesswoman who run together a croissant
factory in Sofia, share this optimism.
	   ``Bulgaria is stable and is improving. It is on the right
track,'' Iskander said. ``Now there are good opportunities to
invest here, but if you asked me this question in early 1997, I
would have definitely answered `no.'''
	   Bulgaria's upbeat performance is in sharp contrast to many
developing countries, whose economies have been buffeted by the
financial turmoil that began in Southeast Asia more than a year
ago. It has since swamped Russia and is threatening Latin America.
Many developing economies are in recession or on the brink of a
downturn.
	   International lenders and investors have also described
Bulgaria's performance in positive terms.
	   ``In contrast to many other transition economies, Bulgaria has
now been able to produce robust macroeconomic performance ...
Inflation is down to European Union levels, fiscal performance is
sound, the tax regime is stable,'' said Andrew Vorkink, the World
Bank director for Bulgaria.
	   The anchor of Bulgaria's stability is the currency board, a
panel within the central bank. Enacted on July 1, 1997, the board
bars the central bank from printing large amounts of new money to
cover deficits and bail out insolvent companies and banks.
	   Under the board's oversight, the long-ailing national currency,
the lev, is tied to the German mark by a fixed exchange rate of
1,000 leva to one mark. Domestic money supply is backed by foreign
currency reserves of the central bank.
	   The International Monetary Fund advised Bulgaria to endorse the
board in late 1996 as the previous government of Socialists, the
renamed communists, plunged the country into a financial tailspin
similar to the current one in Russia. Hong Kong and Argentina also
have currency boards.
	   The Socialists balked at privatization and ran up huge fiscal
deficits to keep inefficient state companies going. They tried to
bail out banks from which their political allies siphoned money
through a series of bad loans.
	   Inflation soared to over 300 percent in 1996 and to 577 percent
in 1997. The average monthly salary fell to some dlrs 10 as the lev
slumped from 500 to some 3,000 to the dollar in January last year.
	   That sent crowds into the streets for a month, forcing the
Socialists agree to early elections. Kostov's Union of Democratic
Forces won and pursued new policies which have brought about the
economic turnaround.
	   The new government tightened financial discipline, improved tax
collection and speeded long-stalled privatization programs to sell
state companies which were draining the treasury.
	   From a three-digit monthly level in February 1997, Bulgaria's
inflation slowed to an average of 2.9 percent in the first nine
months of this year. Foreign currency reserves grew to some dlrs 3
billion from dlrs 500 million. Next year Bulgaria plans to balance
its budget.
	   The improved economic climate has allowed Iskander and Dimitrova
to increase the output of their ``Pain D'Or,'' or Golden Bread,
line by 30 percent.
	   The two entrepreneurs now employ about 100 workers. They started
in 1994 with just 11.
	   ``We had almost ground to a halt in early 1997,'' Dimitrova
said. ``We stopped producing our main staple, the croissants, and
switched just to bread, because that's what people could only
afford to buy. Now domestic consumption is stabilized and people
are again looking for quality products.''

	   VERO BEACH, Florida (AP) _ After Piper Aircraft emerged from
bankruptcy three years ago, company president Chuck Suma made some
bold predictions.
	   By 2000, he said, the company would produce 400 aircraft a year,
employ as many as 800 people and have annual sales up to dlrs 150
million.
	   Pretty lofty aspirations considering Piper was just a shadow of
the industry powerhouse it had once been.
	   In the 1970s, the Vero Beach-based company had 8,000 employees
churning out 18 planes a day _ even keeping 450 extra aircraft tied
down outside waiting for buyers. By the time Piper sought
protection from creditors in 1991, its work force had shrunk to 45.
Yearly _ not daily _ production was down to 14 planes. Power was
turned off, buildings locked up. There was no cash in the bank.
	   ``There were some pretty bleak days,'' Suma recalled.
	   Not any more.
	   The New Piper Aircraft Inc. _ the company created by a dlrs 95
million sale to bring it out of bankruptcy _ has actually exceeded
some expectations with a more conservative business philosophy
under new owners, Philadelphia investment group Dimeling, Schreiber
and Park, Teledyne Industries Inc. and creditors.
	   Two years shy of the original projections, Piper has beefed up
its work force to 953 employees, projected dlrs 128 million in
revenue and sold 303 aircraft this year.
	   More than 90 orders have been placed for its new Malibu
Meridian, a dlrs 1.3 million single-engine turboprop unveiled in
September.
	   Suma says the solution is simple: You need more money coming in
than going out.
	   ``If you go back to 1991, it's a great feeling,'' Suma said. ``I
think we're doing a lot better than we all set our goals for.''
	   Still, he knows to take measured steps.
	   Suma grew up just two miles (3 kms) from the Vero Beach airport,
where Piper has 1.2 million square feet (110,000 sq. meters) of
air-conditioned factories and offices. As a teen-ager, he fueled
planes. He joined Piper in 1976 as an aircraft assembler.
	   It was the heyday of the company, founded in 1937 in Lock Haven,
Pennsylvania, but there was waste. Planes were built on speculation
and were tied down outside the factory until they were matched by
color, stripe and radio to a customer's request.
	   Too many had to be sold at bargain prices, Suma said.
	   ``It's a lot of money to tie up,'' he said.
	   As Suma rose in the company, the U.S. economy turned sour. And
product-liability lawsuits dogged Piper. Production and profits
declined until July 3, 1991, when the company sought federal
bankruptcy protection.
	   ``The lack of financial planning _ that was the biggest
mistake,'' Suma said.
	   As he reflected on the past, he was momentarily distracted by
what he hopes is the future: a prototype of the Malibu Meridian
revving its engine on a test run just outside his office.
	   ``That's a very distinctive sound,'' Suma said, with a proud
smile. ``It sounds like a million-three airplane.''
	   The unveiling of the Meridian marked Piper's return to the
turbine-powered aircraft market _ a market abandoned before
bankruptcy when it stopped production of its Cheyenne series.
	   Piper hopes the new line will attract more customers with deeper
pockets. The previous high-end Piper was the dlrs 800,000 Malibu
Mirage. Pipers start at dlrs 139,000. The Meridian won't be
available until mid-2000.
	   In Piper's brightly lit factories, employees are buzzing. At
least a third of the work force is made up of pre-bankruptcy
employees.
	   ``They made it a point to say 'You will not be forgotten,'''
said tour guide Bob Phillip. ``They're still calling some back.''
	   Phillip worked for Piper from 1960 until his retirement in 1991.
But he and several other former members of management returned in
1995 as tour guides. Twice a week, they share their insight during
a tour that covers more than a mile (1.6 kms).
	   ``Everybody's just as content as can be. They just like what
they're doing,'' said Phillip, 71. ``The attitude in the plant is
very inspiring with the new company.''
	   Mike Boyd, president of The Boyd Group, an Evergreen,
Colorado-based aviation consulting group, also has been impressed
by Piper's turnaround. It was something he never expected.
	   He supports Piper's decision to return to the turbine-engine
powered aircraft market, calling it ``the wave of the future.'' He
knows orders already have been placed.
	   ``It says they've got products they can sell in a marketplace
that wants to buy them,'' Boyd said. ``I don't see a great deal of
downside for the company. I see a very strong future for something
like a Piper.''

Labor shortage challenges restaurant industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAN SEWELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LOGANVILLE, Georgia (AP) _ Signing bonuses. Flexible scheduling.
Scholarship offers and internships.
	   Such recruiting tools are common in these days of low
unemployment, but not just for information technology experts or
investment bankers. They are some of the ways American restaurants
are trying to take a bite out of a major industry problem _ a
shortage of workers.
	   ``People would like to have these jobs filled, but the workers
aren't available,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Georgia
State University Economic Forecasting Center.
	   ``It's a top-of-the-list issue for us and the food service
industry in general,'' said Donald Perry, spokesman for the
Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A chain, whose 2-week-old restaurant in
suburban Loganville is among 85 locations opening this year.
``Because of the low unemployment and changes in society, the
numbers are just not out there.''
	   Chick-fil-A and other expanding restaurant groups have an
appetite for more restaurants, but face little demand for the jobs
to staff them.
	   AFC Enterprises, an Atlanta-based group of fast-food chicken and
coffee-and-bagel restaurants, is adding 400 locations worldwide
this year. Each new restaurant requires 20 to 25 new hires.
	   ``It's a factor,'' said Lee Channell, vice president for people
services at AFC. ``Like any other restaurant company, we're
challenged (to find employees).''
	   Edgar Brush, a 16-year veteran of the restaurant business who
operates the new Chick-fil-A in Loganville, said hiring ``has
changed drastically.'' Besides low unemployment rates _ 3 percent
or lower in much of metropolitan Atlanta _ he finds that many
children of baby boomers are unwilling to accept the fast-paced
work.
	   ``So many have been raised to have everything handed to them,''
said Brush, who came to Loganville from a downtown Atlanta
restaurant where turnover was a major problem. ``You've got to work
harder to find them, and you've got to work harder to keep them.''
	   Brush used paid advertising and called church youth ministries
to help find the 66 employees needed to start operations at his
restaurant about 50 miles (90 kms) northeast of Atlanta. He said
Loganville is a working-family town, so it wasn't as difficult to
find willing workers.
	   When Mike Grisham, managing partner of Maggiano's Little Italy,
began hiring last year for the new restaurant in Atlanta's Buckhead
neighborhood, he advertised in college newspapers and recruited
through school parent-teacher organizations.
	   Restaurateurs are also using job fairs and employment agencies
to find workers.
	   AFC has focused on community and school involvement and has been
active in the Hospitality Business Alliance. That's a partnership
of the National Restaurant Association and the American Hotel and
Motel Association that works with schools to interest students in
their businesses and to provide education, mentoring and
internships.
	   AFC's Channell said the effort is part of the restaurant
industry's goal ``to establish ourselves as a place to have a
long-term career, where you can move very rapidly.''
	   For the short term, restaurants are spending more money on
advertising, and wages have been bumped above the dlrs 5.15-an-hour
minimum wage for most entry-level jobs. In some affluent suburbs,
dlrs 7-an-hour starting wages for fast-food restaurants are common
and some restaurants have offered small ``signing bonuses'' of dlrs
50 or dlrs 100 to new employees.
	   Among Chick-fil-A's inducements are the 1,000 scholarships of
dlrs 1,000 each it gives out annually and the guarantee of Sundays
off. By tradition, all the chain's restaurants are closed on
Sunday.
	   Grisham, who moved to Atlanta from the Chicago restaurant
business, said more than money and flexible scheduling is needed to
keep employees.
	   He offers perquisites such as free food at the restaurant,
cultivates the work force as ``one big family'' with picnics and
other outings, and tries to make sure good performance is rewarded.
Last year's top employee was given a two-week trip to Europe.

Germany's incoming center-left government to sign coalition pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ceremony scheduled at 0900 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After the quickest negotiations in postwar
German history, the Social Democrats and Greens are ready to sign a
coalition pact that paves the way for Germany's first center-left
government in 16 years.
	   After a final round of talks to nail down Cabinet posts, both
sides described the deal late Monday as sealed after just over two
weeks of work. Details of who gets what job were to be released at
a signing ceremony on Tuesday.
	   But most of the positions were already known, including Greens
leader and former peace activist Joschka Fischer as foreign
minister and Oskar Lafontaine, leftist chairman of the Social
Democrats, as head of a beefed-up Finance Ministry.
	   The new government also was expected to include five female
Cabinet members _ three more than outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
conservative coalition. Gunda Roestel, another Greens leader,
called the pact ``good for women.''
	   The deal still must be approved at special party conventions
this weekend before Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder can be sworn
in on Oct. 27 _ exactly one month after the election.
	   Not included in the government is the political outsider
Schroeder had wanted as his economics minister: Jost Stollmann.
	   The millionaire computer entrepreneur backed out Monday, saying
he was unhappy with plans to take European economic policy from his
office and give it to the Finance Ministry.
	   He also criticized the incoming government's left-leaning
agenda, saying it would result in higher tax burdens on small firms
and strayed from the business-friendly ``new center'' approach
Schroeder had campaigned on.
	   ``This country needs a policy of modernization and renewal,'' he
said. ``I hope that Schroeder will be able to push through his
ideas of the `new center' because that is the right kind of
policy.''
	   Schroeder played down Stollmann's complaints, saying that as
future chancellor, he had to take a bigger picture view of
government policy.
	   He also insisted Stollmann's departure did not mean he was
abandoning the political middle.
	   ``If the `new center' consisted of just one person, that'd be
underrating it,'' Schroeder said.

One of Griffith Joyner's dreams lives on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The late Florence Griffith Joyner put in a
lifetime of hard work to reach her goals, and the accomplishments
didn't stop when she died.
	   A line of athletic shoes and clothes that she had been working
on will be introduced as planned, her husband announced Monday.
	   Griffith Joyner, Olympic gold medalist and holder of world
records in the 100 and 200 meters, died Sept. 21 in her sleep at
her home in Mission Viejo. She was 38.
	   There has been speculation that Griffith Joyner may have had
unsuspected heart problems, but results of an investigation into
the cause of death were still pending Monday, said Lt. Hector
Rivera, a spokesman for the county sheriff and coroner.
	   Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic triple jump champion, said his wife
had been working since last year on the ``FGJ'' collection,
participating in every step of the design process. The line was
scheduled to appear at Lady Foot Locker stores in mid-November.
	   A portion of the sale proceeds will go to the non-profit
Florence Griffith Joyner Memorial Empowerment Foundation to
continue helping children around the world, he said.
	   ``Florence had long dreamed of having her own signature line,''
Joyner said. ``As with everything in her life, she put a tremendous
amount of time, energy and passion into making this line a success.
By continuing the work she started, we are adding to her legacy.''

NHL's participation in Olympics still up in the air
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The National Hockey League's participation in the
2002 Winter Olympics will depend on how negotiations go with
broadcast rights holder NBC, says league commissioner Gary Bettman.
	   ``The schedule has got to be put together so there is
considerable prime-time (TV) exposure for the U.S. and Canadian
teams because if we're not going to get substantial exposure for
our players ... it doesn't make sense for us to go,'' Bettman said
Monday.
	   In Nagano, Japan, CBS relegated hockey to the late-night show,
airing at either 11:35 p.m. or 12:35 a.m.
	   Bettman made the comments while attending the book launch of the
NHL-produced ``Total Hockey: The Official Encyclopedia of the
NHL.'' It was held at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Report: Troubled Japanese bank to seek state control this week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from LTCB in 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Debt-saddled Long Term Credit Bank of Japan will
seek temporary nationalization this week after being informed by
regulators that its liabilities exceed its assets, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   LTCB will apply to be taken under state control Friday when a
new law aimed at bailing out Japan's troubled banking sector takes
effect, public broadcaster NHK reported.
	   A spokeswoman at Tokyo-based LTCB, however, said that the bank
has yet to make a decision on the application. She spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier this month Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down and to pump up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in public
funds into the cash-strapped financial system.
	   The government's Financial Supervisory Agency informed LTCB on
Monday that the bank had a capital deficit at the end of the
current fiscal first half on Sept. 30, if all its assets were
measured at market value, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   An agency official confirmed it has informed LTCB about the
results of its inspection, but added that it can't comment on an
individual bank's asset and liability situation.
	   The agency also said, however, that valued at acquisition
prices, LTCB's assets exceeded its liabilities, Kyodo reported,
adding that Japan's accounting regulations allow banks to value
assets at purchase costs for book-keeping purposes.
	   But regulators regard market valuation as a better guide than
purchase costs to a bank's overall health since the former includes
losses in a bank's stock and securities holdings in calculating
balance sheets, Kyodo said.
	   LTCB, once a major pillar of Japan's postwar financial system,
has seen its share price tumble as low as 3 yen (U.S. dlrs 0.26) in
recent trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   The bank rescue package passed by Parliament is seen as crucial
for cleaning up the heap of bad loans left by the collapse in the
early 1990s of Japan's runaway real estate and stock prices.
	   It is also a key first step in the country's efforts to overcome
its deepest recession since the end of World War II.

Chilean Government appeals for calm after Pinochet's arrest

 &UR; By EVA VERGARA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The Chilean government has asked people
to remain calm and not reopen old political wounds in response to
the arrest in London of former dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   Vice President Raul Troncoso issued a statement on Monday after
a meeting with the cabinet in which he said that Pinochet is
protected by diplomatic immunity.
	   But Britain says diplomatic immunity is reserved for accredited
diplomats or foreign government officials on official visits, which
doesn't cover Pinochet, who is recovering from back surgery on
London.
	   Monday's statement in Santiago was the first from the Chilean
Government since Pinochet's arrest on Friday in London. The
82-year-old former dictator said in a statement issued through his
lawyers on Monday that he would fight extradition to Spain.
	   In Spain on Monday, Judge Baltasar Garzon, widened the basis of
his original detention request to include charges of genocide,
torture and murder in the disappearance of 94 people, mostly
Chileans.
	   The original arrest warrant was for questioning about an
unspecified number of Spaniards who were killed or vanished in the
first decade after Pinochet seized power in 1973.
	   Garzon is probing Pinochet's alleged role in Operation Condor in
which juntas in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and elsewhere cooperated
to snuff out dissent in each other's countries in the 1970s and
1980s.
	   Troncoso is acting president while Chilean President Eduardo
Frei is in Europe. Frei has also protested Pinochet's arrest.
	   ``After the preventive arrest of Senator Pinochet in a London
clinic, a climate of concern has been created as we have noted
today,'' Troncoso said. ``People must remain calm.''
	   He added that Pinochet's arrest ``should not alter our
coexistence or revive conflicts that Chileans have learned to
overcome,'' an apparent reference to the strong emotions that
Pinochet still provokes in Chile.
	   Thousands took to the streets of Santiago on Sunday to
alternatively protest Pinochet's arrest, or to show their support
of it.
	   The rallies were mostly peaceful, although riot police used tear
gas and water canons on some protesters trying to break through
police lines into the British embassy on Sunday evening. No arrests
or injuries were reported.
	   Pinochet took power in power in 1973 with a coup. He left the
government in 1990 although he retained the post of Commander in
Chief of the Army until his retirement in March. According to the
constitution that he changed, he is a senator for life.
	   A Chilean government report after he left office said 4,299
political opponents were killed or vanished during his rule.

Ex-Spice Girl named goodwill ambassador for U.N. Population Fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with background on Halliwell &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell has
joined a cast of global celebrities tapped by the United Nations to
put the spotlight on global issues.
	   Halliwell, 26, a.k.a. Ginger Spice, has been appointed a
goodwill ambassador for the U.N. Population Fund in Britain to
promote healthier choices about reproduction and greater awareness
of reproductive rights.
	   ``She will be a great ambassador for young people,'' Alex
Marshall, the fund's deputy director for information, said Monday.
	   Halliwell quit the all-girl British pop group on May 31, citing
``differences between us.'' Last week, the British media reported
that she had signed a 2 million pound (dlrs 3.4 million) deal with
Chrysalis records.
	   Halliwell will be working in Britain with Marie Stopes
International and Population Concern, voluntary organizations which
promote reproductive health, especially among women, Marshall said.
	   Both groups are part of the U.N. Population Fund's ``Face To
Face Campaign,'' which is using voluntary organizations to promote
awareness of population issues across Europe.
	   Two of the remaining Spice Girls _ Scary Spice Melanie Brown and
Posh Spice Victoria Adams _ became pregnant this year by their
boyfriends. Brown has since married.
	   Asked why Halliwell was chosen to be a goodwill ambassador in
Britain, Marshall said: ``She almost chose herself. She's
interested in the issue. She got together with Marie Stopes
International.''
	   She is scheduled to appear at a press conference at the United
Nations Tuesday with officials from the fund to discuss her new
role.
	   Famed for her ginger-colored hair and tight-fitting short
dresses, the pop star has gone through a transformation since she
split with the Spice Girls. She is now blonde and more likely to be
spotted in a demure suit.
	   Halliwell has also visited inmates at London's Holloway prison
and students at a London school to highlight cancer awareness. And
she auctioned many of her most famous Spice Girls costumes which
raised almost 145,000 pounds (dlrs 242,000) for a children's cancer
charity. Halliwell became concerned about cancer when, at age 18,
she discovered a lump in her breast that turned out to be benign.
	   The former Spice Girl joins some of the world's biggest names,
past and present, in promoting U.N. activities.
	   Over the years, the U.N. Children's Fund recruited Danny Kaye,
Roger Moore, Liv Ullman and Audrey Hepburn, to serve as ``goodwill
ambassadors'' and money raisers. Actor Danny Glover and South
African writer Nadine Gordimer became the first goodwill
ambassadors for the U.N. Development Program earlier this year.
	   The United Nations has also recruited celebrities to be
``Messengers of Peace,'' including Muhammad Ali, Luciano Pavarotti
and Michael Douglas. Elton John accepted the honor but last week
indefinitely postponed taking on the duty.
	   Halliwell became a millionaire with the Spice Girls, whose motto
``Girl power!'' drew millions of fans worldwide. The group has
continued to perform with four members.

Are year-end cash bonuses next casualty of Brazil's economic
</HEADLINE>
crisis? &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Caught in the middle of an economic
crisis, many Brazilian factories fear they won't be able to pay
their workers the mandatory year-end bonus. So they're considering
paying with products instead of cash.
	   Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things
as hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash
bonus that normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the
head of Brazil's largest federation of trade unions.
	   ``The idea is completely unacceptable,'' said Joao Antonio
Felicio, secretary-general of the federation, which represents more
than 2,000 unions and 19 million workers. ``We will recommend our
unions reject such a preposterous proposal.''
	   But strapped for cash and punished by high interest rates and
declining sales, factory owners may have no other choice, said
Joseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small
Industries, which represents 110,000 factories that employ nearly
800,000 workers.
	   ``Access to credit is almost impossible,'' Curi said. ``If banks
and the government don't create some kind of emergency credit line,
the only option many of our associates will have will be to use
products to pay the bonus.''
	   Factories that produce clothes, shoes, food, toys and household
appliances were ``the most enthusiastic about the idea,'' Curi
said.
	   Curi predicted even harsher times for Brazil with the
belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce Tuesday.
	   The measures, aimed at curbing the country's ballooning budget
deficit _ equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product _ are
expected to include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes.
	   ``There is a lot of talk of increasing taxes, which means less
cash circulating in the market and more credit restrictions,'' Curi
said. ``It is a shortsighted approach that will spell more
recession and the collapse of many small factories.''
	   Brazil has been a major casualty of the global economic crisis,
buffeted by loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow of
capital. The country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50
billion, from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July.
	   In an effort to prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the
real, and stem capital flight, interest rates were hiked to 50
percent a year.
	   For union leader Felicio, the proposed product-for-cash swap
``is a clear sign of the despair the business sector is feeling
because of the recessive economic policies'' brought by the Real
Plan, the economic stabilization program put together in 1994 when
Cardoso was finance minister.
	   The plan succeeded in slashing inflation from 2,400 percent to
almost zero today. But it also brought recession and unemployment,
which now stands at almost 8 percent, the highest in a decade.

Deutsche Bank targets Bankers Trust for takeover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has opened
preliminary takeover talks with Bankers Trust, according to a
report Tuesday in the Financial Times.
	   The possible deal, which would require the approval of the U.S.
Federal Reserve and banking regulators in New York, would be the
largest takeover of a U.S. bank by a non-U.S. bank, the newspaper
said, adding that the announcement of any deal is seen as being
some way in the future.
	   The Financial Times says sources close to the talks, whom they
do not name, stress the discussion is in its early stages, but that
it is the ``key element'' of the German bank's efforts to acquire a
leading U.S. investment bank.
	   ``I would not call these offical talks, more exploratory
talks,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified person involved as
saying. ``However, it looks like it may lead to that.''
	   The newspaper said both companies declined to comment on the
report Monday night.
	   Senior executives at Deutsche Bank are said by Wall Street
sources to recognize talks with Bankers Trust as offering the best
hope of a takeover announcement before the end of the year, the
newspaper said, adding that Bankers Trust would provide the German
bank with a large-scale U.S. operation and U.S. clients.
	   Bankers Trust is ranked by market capitalization as the 35th
largest bank in the United States, the newspaper said.

 &UR; Rare form of dementia spurs creativity &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Previously unknown artistic skills can
suddenly blossom in individuals struck by a rare form of dementia,
according to a U.S. researcher.
	   Dr. Bruce Miller of the University of California at San
Francisco reports in Tuesday's edition of the journal Neurology on
five people who had a burst of artistry even as dementia began
destroying their ability to talk and deal with other human beings.
	   ``In each of the five cases we've documented, a period of
exceptional creativity heralded the beginnings of a tragic disease
and continued to flourish even as the patients began to lose their
ability to use language,'' he said.
	   The individuals suffered from a disease called frontotemporal
dementia, which he said accounts for only about one in 10 cases of
dementia.
	   This form of disease tends to strike when people are in their
50s and may run in families, Miller reported.
	   The disease affects an area of the brain that influences social
behavior, causing loss of social skills, Miller said. As the
patients developed their artistic outburst, they lost interest in
others and tended to work on their own.
	   ``The loss of social skills and inhibitions may have facilitated
the art of our patients,'' Miller and his co-authors wrote in their
paper.
	   Miller commented there may be parallels with such artists as
Vincent van Gogh and Francisco Goya, who worked independently,
spurned social involvement and battled mental illness.
	   But, the researchers concluded that while this form of dementia
opens ``an unexpected window into the artistic process,'' the
actual mechanism to enhance the artistry of the individuals
``remains a mystery.''

Padres hoping change of scenery changes their luck
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Tony Gwynn was standing alone in right field,
checking out the grass torn up a day earlier by an National
Football League game, and his hearty laugh echoed throughout the
empty ballpark.
	   Gwynn was the first player on the field for the San Diego
Padres' practice Monday afternoon, and his disposition matched the
weather _ bright sunshine, blue California sky and warm
temperatures.
	   A change of scenery for the World Series, for sure, from the
subway trains clacking outside Yankee Stadium to the palm trees
inside Qualcomm Stadium.
	   But a change in the Padres' luck against the New York Yankees?
No telling.
	   The Yankees look unbeatable so far, taking a 2-0 lead into Game
3 Tuesday night. David Cone will start against former Yankees
pitcher Sterling Hitchcock.
	   ``What I've seen from New York in the first two games, I'll have
to admit, is very impressive,'' Gwynn said. ``We're down 0-2, but
we can get back in this thing if we play our game, which is
pitching and defense and some timely hits.''
	   Gwynn has done his part, tied for the Series lead with four
hits. Yet unless Padres pitching improves, it could be over real
soon.
	   Of the 44 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the World Series, 33 have
gone on to win the championship.
	   Then again, the Yankees were wiped out at home by Atlanta in the
first two games in 1996 before coming back to win four in a row.
Cone began that comeback with a win in Game 3.
	   Cone traveled to the West Coast on Sunday, before the Yankees
romped 9-3 in Game 2. He was already in San Diego relaxing while
watching the victory.
	   ``This is the time of year when pitchers feel a bit fatigued,''
he said. ``I'm looking forward to closing this out and getting a
nice rest.''
	   Hitchcock already has beaten Houston's Randy Johnson and
Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in the playoffs. Now he's
likely to face his toughest challenge, trying to shut down a
Yankees team that scored nine runs in two straight nights against
San Diego.
	   ``They can hit. Bottom line, they can hit,'' Hitchcock said.
	   Hitchcock, however, will have a few advantages that Padres
starters Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby did not have. For one thing,
he's feeling a little better, aside from some congestion _ a flu
bug bit the San Diego staff right before the opener.
	   Hitchcock will have two other factors in his favor _ he'll be
facing a lineup that does not include a designated hitter, and
he'll be pitching at twilight.
	   The DH is not used for games at the National League park,
meaning Cone, a career .152 hitter, will be batting. That could
mean Chili Davis will be on the bench, although Yankees manager Joe
Torre held out the ``wild card'' possibility Davis might play left
field.
	   Game 3 is scheduled to begin at 5:20 p.m. PDT (0020 GMT
Wednesday), a time when shadows can make it difficult for hitters
to see the ball.
	   Despite the early start, the park should be almost filled by the
first pitch. Unlike crowds for other Southern California baseball
teams, the Padres fans are known for making noise.

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson won the biggest split decision of
his life. Now, with the help of a certain former basketball player,
he could be back in the ring before the year ends.
	   ``I'm just happy I won,'' Tyson said Monday after the Nevada
Athletic Commission voted 4-1 Monday to return the license it
revoked when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears 15 months ago.
	   With Magic Johnson and Muhammad Ali backing him up, Tyson seemed
near tears upon learning he would be allowed to return from his
boxing exile.
	   He promised to put his life in order as he prepares to return to
the sport he loves and the heavyweight division he once terrorized.
	   When he does, Johnson says he will replace the spiky-haired Don
King as Tyson's new promoter and help guide the career and troubled
personal life of the 32-year-old former heavyweight champion.
	   ``I'll be the closest guy to him, making all the decisions,''
Johnson said.
	   Other sources close to Tyson told The Associated Press, though,
that Johnson's role might not be as big as he believes, and that
adviser Shelly Finkel will help Tyson make most of his major
decisions.
	   ``Shelly is still the guy,'' said a source, who asked not to be
identified.
	   The first decision will be when Tyson fights again. He could box
at a Las Vegas casino as early as Dec. 5, although Johnson said it
will not be against a top opponent.
	   ``We're going to be bringing Mike along very slowly,'' Johnson
said. ``Don't be looking for him to be fighting these champions.''
	   It was a contrite and thoroughly humbled Tyson who appeared
before the commission Monday in a repeat of a hearing a month ago
that went on for six hours before commissioners ordered
psychological tests for Tyson before making a decision.
	   This time, though, it was a far different atmosphere as Tyson
sat with his wife, Monica, and lawyer, Jim Jimmerson before the
five-member panel. Gone were other attorneys who presented the case
in the first meeting and Finkel, who irritated the commission by
trying to get Tyson licensed in New Jersey in August.
	   Tyson and his wife both spoke to the commission instead of the
lawyers. Johnson then gave a plea and Ali's wife, Lonnie, read a
statement from her husband, who sat trembling next to her.
	   ``I have made many mistakes in my lifetime that cost me
dearly,'' Ali said in the statement. ``Let this young man earn a
living. Give him a chance to redeem himself in the ring.''
	   In the end, the commission did just that, voting quickly after
the three hours' of testimony to restore the license that was
revoked after Tyson shocked the world by biting Holyfield's ears
during their June 28, 1997, heavyweight title fight.
	   ``Mike, you have made a lot of mistakes in your life,'' said
commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem. ``I know that sometimes you
think you're a victim. But let me tell you, that most of your
problems are of your own making. You and you alone have to take
responsibility for your life.''
	   Tyson, dressed in a dark sports coat and dress shirt, drew
laughter from a crowd of a few hundred people at times with his
statements as he pleaded to be allowed to fight again.
	   ``You gentlemen have no idea what it's like to be myself, no
idea what it's like,'' Tyson said. ``I'm not interested in being
humiliated anymore.''
	   At only one point did Tyson appear to be losing his temper, when
he was questioned by commissioner James Nave, who cast the only
dissenting vote. His wife tapped him on the leg to try to keep him
from talking further as he sparred verbally with Nave.
	   ``I'm at your mercy,'' Tyson told Nave. ``Please don't torture
me any longer, sir.''
	   For half of the meeting, five doctors from Massachusetts General
Hospital gave their evaluation of Tyson, who underwent five days of
psychological testing there last month.
	   The lead doctor, Ronald Schouten, testified that Tyson is ``a
very complex individual with strengths not always apparent and
weaknesses that are sometimes too apparent.''
	   Schouten said Tyson is in need of extensive psychotherapy and
needs to learn how to control his emotions and anger. Tyson is also
depressed and might have to take medication for that if the therapy
doesn't work, the doctor said.

Holmes thinks it is time for Tyson's return

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A man he once fought and a promoter he is
fighting expressed satisfaction that Mike Tyson will get another
boxing license.
	   ``It's about time they gave the man's license back,'' said Larry
Holmes, who came out of retirement to get knocked out by Tyson in a
title bid on Jan. 22, 1988. ``I wish him well.''
	   Don King , whom Tyson is suing for dlrs 100 million, also said
he was pleased with the decision by the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   ``I am delighted Tyson will be able to fight again,'' said King,
who's accused of cheating the former heavyweight champ out of
millions of dollars.
	   The commission voted 4-1 to allow Tyson to box again. It had
revoked his license and fined him dlrs 3 million after he was
disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in their rematch
on June 28, 1997.
	   ``Taking the dlrs 3 million was punishment enough,'' Holmes
said. ``He paid his dues with that.''
	   As for Holyfield, he has often said he thought Tyson had paid
for his mistake and should get a license.
	   ``The primary victim of that mistake has forgiven him
completely,'' said Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer. ``Mike has had
an exemplary career inside the ropes, with one major exception.
Everybody deserves a second chance.''
	   Mills Lane, the referee who disqualified Tyson, did not wish to
give an opinion.
	   ``It's the commission's call to do what they think is
appropriate,'' Lane said. ``They made this choice, now let's move
on.''
	   King, through spokesman Greg Fritz, said allowing Tyson to
return to the ring was the ``fair thing to do.''
	   ``The Nevada State Athletic Commission is the greatest in the
world and I believe they displayed wisdom and justice in allowing
Mike Tyson to apply for a boxing license,'' he said.
	   There is talk of Tyson returning to the ring as early as
December. He is under contract to Showtime.
	   ``We have a contract for a significant number of fights over the
course of a significant amount of time,'' said Jay Larkin, senior
vice president for boxing and entertainment programming for the
cable network.
	   Whomever and whenever Tyson fights, Holmes believes the former
champ could face a tough challenge.
	   ``His toughest fight will be with the first opponent who gets
into the ring with him who's not afraid of him,'' Holmes said.
``His hole card has been tipped. Evander Holyfield showed how to
fight Mike Tyson _ don't run, stand in there and box him.''

Dollar lower, Tokyo stock prices rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen early
Tuesday in lackluster trading, while Japanese stock prices moved
moderately higher after an overnight rise on Wall Street.
	   The dollar bought 114.62 yen in early trading, down 0.10 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its New York level of 114.28
yen late Monday.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 85.80
points, or 0.63 percent, to 13,653.00 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei closed up 286.66 points,
or 2.16 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher against the Japanese
currency from its late New York level, as the dollar's strength
against the German mark led Japanese short-term players to buy back
the U.S. currency against the yen.
	   The dollar continued to benefit from speculation that the
Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, may lower interest rates at its
policy-setting meeting on Thursday, traders said.
	   But they said the dollar's direction against the yen remains
unclear.
	   On the stock market, an overnight gain on Wall Street encouraged
investors in Tokyo. The Dow rose 49.62 points _ or 0.6 percent _ to
finish Monday's session at 8,466.45.
	   Trading remained moderate in Tokyo, however, as many investors
took a wait-and-see attitude on expectations the government will
consider stimulus steps to lift Japan's moribund economy, dealers
said.
	   Kaoru Yosano, head of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, told reporters Monday that the government may come up
with a new set of economic stimulus measures next month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 7.36 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,030.28
points. The TOPIX closed up 16.24 points, or 1.61 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.835 percent from Monday's finish of 0.815
percent, driving its price down to 108.62 yen from 108.82 yen.

West concerned about latest Kosovo skirmishes

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western powers are voicing concern
about increased violence in Kosovo that has taken place despite a
political agreement intended to stop the fighting. But the prospect
of NATO airstrikes to end the bloodshed remains on hold.
	   NATO commander Wesley Clark planned to visit Belgrade on Tuesday
to discuss how far Yugoslav authorities still have to go in pulling
out army units from Kosovo, under an agreement signed with U.S.
negotiator Richard Holbrooke on avoiding NATO intervention.
	   The visit was set amid increased signs of battle preparedness in
parts of Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   More Yugoslav army troops were positioned southwest of Pristina,
the Kosovo capital, after a surge of weekend violence that left
three Serb policemen dead and led to mutual accusations between
authorities and radical Albanians on who started the bloodshed.
	   Western officials, concerned about odan Milosevic. The agreement headed off NATO
airstrikes against Serb forces for the time being, disappointing
ethnic Albanians who want outright independence.
	   Rubin said U.S. mediator Christopher Hill was telling Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas they should not try to provoke Serb
forces into taking actions that would heighten the possibility of
airstrikes against them.
	   It would be a mistake, Rubin said, for the rebel group ``to
consider NATO its air force. That will not be tolerated by the
U.S.''
	   He said Yugoslav compliance with commitments to disarm in Kosovo
has been mixed. Over the past month, he said, about half of the
Yugoslav Army units that had moved into Kosovo earlier this year
have left the province.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Milosevic's
crackdown on separatists, and hundreds of thousands more have fled
their homes to escape the violence.
	   In Paris, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Monday the
recent upsurge in violence doesn't undermine the accord on Kosovo.
	   ``I think there are provocateurs and provocations, but we must
continue to hold the line'' and carry out the accord, Solana said.
	   Milosevic has until Oct. 27 to reduce the level of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces in Kosovo or face airstrikes by the Atlantic
alliance.
	   Solana avoided comment on how pressure could be placed on the
Kosovo Albanians not to attack the Serb forces.
	   In Kosovo, reports of shelling and shooting, along with a
Yugoslav army deployment along a key road, caused the U.N. refugee
agency to call off two convoys of relief supplies on Monday.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees planned to send out the
two convoys on Tuesday along with two others already scheduled.
	   The troops who moved out of Pristina to the southwest on Sunday
are normally stationed in the capital, and therefore could remain
in the province under the withdrawal plan.
	   Serb officials on Monday again blamed the violence on the KLA,
saying the guerrillas want to provoke a fight that would jeopardize
the agreement and bring NATO intervention.
	   A 2,000-member international verification force is being
organized by the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia honors its
promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the monitors are
in Kosovo.

Arbitrator rules in favor of owners; guaranteed contracts won't be

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Shaquille O'Neal won't get his overdue dlrs 15
million. Patrick Ewing won't get the first chunk of his dlrs 18.5
million.
	   They and 224 other players won't be paid anytime soon because an
arbitrator on Monday rejected the union's grievance that all
players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the
lockout.
	   The ruling by arbitrator John Feerick, dean of Fordham of Law
School, bolstered the bargaining position of the owners and saved
them from having to go to court to avoid paying more than dlrs 700
million in salaries.
	   ``We are pleased with the arbitrator's ruling,'' National
Basketball Association chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said.
``Unfortunately, it does not get us any closer to a deal with the
union's leadership.
	   ``Only negotiations will end our current impasse and lead to a
settlement of our dispute. This is yet another defeat for the
union's strategy of litigation instead of negotiation.''
	   The league has already canceled the first two weeks of the
season, costing the players about dlrs 100 million in lost
salaries. More cancellations will probably be announced next week,
since no new bargaining sessions are scheduled and the sides are
far apart on the main issue of controlling the growth of player
salaries.
	   ``I kind of expected it,'' union director Billy Hunter said. ``I
was hoping Dean Feerick would be inclined to see things our way,
but we knew it would be a giant leap for him to take, especially
since he is a labor lawyer by profession.''
	   The uncertainty of how Feerick would rule had been a factor in
the stalemate all summer and was one of the reasons the sides have
met only three times for formal bargaining sessions.
	   The players' resolve will now be tested since they won't be
getting paychecks until the lockout is settled. They had been
holding out hope that a verdict in their favor would pressure the
owners to soften their stance and come to the table with a better
offer.
	   ``The players don't seem to realize they can't get that money
back. It's gone, gone forever, and they seem to think that's not
the case,'' commissioner David Stern said.
	   Hunter said he and union president Patrick Ewing had spoken to
20 players since Feerick's decision was announced.
	   ``If you thought the guys were zealous about staying committed
to the cause, they're probably more rabid than they were before,''
Hunter said.
	   The union claimed that the absence of lockout language in the
standard player contract meant that owners should be held liable
for paying guaranteed salaries, especially since other
circumstances under which salaries can be withheld are clearly
defined.
	   The union pointed to lockout language in the league's television
and other contracts, arguing that such clauses indicated that a
work stoppage was foreseeable and should have been included in
player contracts.
	   The owners argued that the right to exert pressure on employees
by withholding pay during a lockout was a fundamental tenet of
labor law.
	   The sides are fighting over, among other things, the amount of
money owners will devote to salaries. Concerned by salaries that
are outpacing revenues, the owners imposed the lockout July 1 and
have promised to achieve a new deal that limits payroll costs.
	   The union, however, has vowed to resist any deal that includes a
``hard'' salary cap. The old system included several exceptions
that allowed teams to exceed the cap, and 24 of the 29 teams
reportedly exceeded the dlrs 26.9 million limit last season.
	   The sides haven't bargained since last Tuesday, when the players
proposed a ``tax'' on the highest salaries to help slow payroll
growth.
	   The union filed the grievance just hours before the lockout was
imposed July 1. Although Feerick's jurisdiction expired along with
the collective bargaining agreement, he ruled the union had beat
the deadline and he was entitled to hear the case.
	   Most players were to receive their first paychecks Nov. 15,
although a handful had clauses entitling them to be paid over the
summer. O'Neal was supposed to receive his entire salary in one
payment on Oct. 1.

Padres riled up after losing first two World Series games

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The San Diego Padres are not only feeling
better, they're feeling a bit feisty.
	   The flu bug that bothered the Padres in losing the first two
games of the World Series at Yankee Stadium seems to be clearing
up. Now they've got to do something about the bad baseball that
plagued them in giving up nine runs in each of the first two games
against New York.
	   ``I want to win,'' Tony Gwynn said before Monday's workout at
Qualcomm Stadium. ``There's nothing in the rules that says you
can't win four of the next five. I know that not a lot of teams
have done it, but we want to get back in and make a run and win the
thing.
	   ``I'm not going down without a fight, and we're at that stage
where we have to fight.''
	   Game 3 is Tuesday night at Qualcomm Stadium, with the Yankees
starting David Cone against Sterling Hitchcock.
	   Bacterial and viral infections have been going around the
Padres' clubhouse, and it has afflicted mostly pitchers. Kevin
Brown said he pitched the opener with a sinus infection and Andy
Ashby, who lasted only 2 2-3 innings in Sunday night's 9-3 loss,
had a cold and a sore throat.
	   Hitchcock said he was still congested Monday but otherwise felt
fine. He'd better be, because pitching coach Dave Stewart is going
to be watching closely to see how the left-hander pitches against
the Yankees.
	   Stewart said he was edgy on Monday, both because his staff has
been second-guessed so much and because it hasn't pitched well.
	   Stewart wasn't happy that Ashby didn't throw any inside pitches
in allowing 10 hits and seven runs, four earned.
	   ``I didn't see one guy get jackknifed off the plate or one guy's
feet move,'' Stewart said. ``That's uncharacteristic of this staff.
	   ``It's going to change tomorrow,'' Stewart said. ``If we're
going to lose the game, we're going to lose firing our pistols.
Right now, we're just laying down.''
	   Hitchcock was named MVP of the National League championship
series after beating Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine. He also
beat Randy Johnson as the Padres clinched the division series over
the Houston Astros.
	   Manager Bruce Bochy said the Padres haven't decided if they'll
start Brown on three days' rest in Game 4 on Wednesday night or go
with Joey Hamilton. Brown has been taking antibiotics and said he
was feeling better on Monday.
	   One Padres pitcher who hasn't thrown yet in the World Series is
Trevor Hoffman, who tied the NL record with 53 saves this year.
	   Qualcomm Stadium will be rocking Tuesday, and the crowd,
expected to be about 64,000, will really get loud if it hears
AC/DC's ``Hells Bells'' announcing Hoffman's arrival on the mound.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stock prices rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS amount of rise in Dow in 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen early
Tuesday in lackluster trading, while Japanese stock prices moved
moderately higher after an overnight rise on Wall Street.
	   The dollar bought 114.62 yen in early trading, down 0.10 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its New York level of 114.28
yen late Monday.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 85.80
points, or 0.63 percent, to 13,653.00 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei closed up 286.66 points,
or 2.16 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher against the Japanese
currency from its late New York level, as the dollar's strength
against the German mark led Japanese short-term players to buy back
the U.S. currency against the yen.
	   The dollar continued to benefit from speculation that the
Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, may lower interest rates at its
policy-setting meeting on Thursday, traders said.
	   But they said the dollar's direction against the yen remains
unclear.
	   On the stock market, an overnight gain on Wall Street encouraged
investors in Tokyo. The Dow rose 49.69 points _ or 0.6 percent _ to
finish Monday's session at 8,466.45.
	   Trading remained moderate in Tokyo, however, as many investors
took a wait-and-see attitude on expectations the government will
consider stimulus steps to lift Japan's moribund economy, dealers
said.
	   Kaoru Yosano, head of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, told reporters Monday that the government may come up
with a new set of economic stimulus measures next month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 7.36 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,030.28
points. The TOPIX closed up 16.24 points, or 1.61 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.835 percent from Monday's finish of 0.815
percent, driving its price down to 108.62 yen from 108.82 yen.

Security tight as students plan new mass demonstrations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Will be led after Paris march begins at 0800 GMT. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of French police were placed on maximum
alert Tuesday to prevent disturbances by high school students
planning to hold their second major nationwide protest in less than
a week.
	   Hundreds of thousands of high school students were expected to
demonstrate across the country to press their demands for more
teachers, better equipment and buildings and a lighter course load.
	   The French government has promised to provide more money soon,
but it has no quick remedy for the ailing education system or for
high youth unemployment _ a deep fear for many French teen-agers.
	   The biggest demonstration Tuesday was expected in Paris, where
at least 4,000 police were mobilized to contain any outbreaks of
violence.
	   The Socialist-led government, wary of the political damage done
by university student protests 30 years ago, appears to be taking
no chances in letting Tuesday's demonstrations get out of control.
	   Police planned to monitor the Paris demonstration on television
monitors in the basement of their headquarters in hopes of
identifying hooligans. Extra police were to be deployed in suburban
trains leading to Paris.
	   Adult monitors wearing white helmets also were to march
alongside the students to help maintain calm.
	   Last Thursday's student protests in a number of cities were
badly marred by violence, some of it instigated by rowdy youths
bent on disrupting the demonstrations.
	   Some 150 people were arrested nationwide. In Paris, five people
were injured, 50 shops were looted and more 100 cars were damaged,
some of them burned.
	   In Normandy, the police chief advised merchants to take
precautions Tuesday to protect store windows against possible
damage in case of rioting.
	   Students in the capital planned to march from the Place d'Italie
in southeastern Paris toward the National Assembly, where lawmakers
were to debate the new budget.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, a former Education Minister, have promised to come up with
funds to prevent the crisis from deepening.
	   Six weeks after the school year has begun, some students are
still without teachers. Many schools, especially in disadvantaged
working-class neighborhoods, are badly in need of modernization.
	   Polls show that the students have widespread public support, and
Jospin's popularity has dipped in the past week as the high school
protests swelled.
	   The students have expressed disappointment in Allegre, and many
do not believe he will be able to keep his promises.
	   The student protests have won some sympathy among their
teachers. At least two teachers' unions called on their members to
join Tuesday's march.

Fidel Castro receives warm welcome on visit to southern Spanish
</HEADLINE>
town of Merida &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MERIDA, Spain, (AP) _ Cuban leader Fidel Castro received a warm
welcome when he arrived for a brief visit to the southern Spanish
town of Merida.
	   Speaking to reporters a few hours after his arrival on Monday he
thanked people for an ``extraordinary'' welcome and praised
relations between Spain and Cuba.
	   ``The relationship is going fine, it has improved a lot,''
Castro said, adding that this was especially pleasing because this
year marks Cuba's 100 years of independence from Spain, its former
colonial master.
	   After his arrival, Castro met Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra,
president of Extremadura, the region where Merida is situated.
	   Later some 800 people gathered outside the regional government
offices where the two met and shouted ``Cuba yes, embargo no,''
referring to the United States' decades-old embargo on Cuba.
	   Castro, 72, came to Merida, a city of 65,000 people some 217
miles (350 kilometers) south west of Madrid after attending the
Ibero-American summit in the Portuguese city of Oporto last
weekend.
	   On Tuesday he was to visit some Roman ruins, meet Spanish
President Jose Maria Aznar in Madrid and later return to Cuba.
	   Castro was invited to Extremadura by Rodriguez Ibarra, who
visited him in Havana in July.
	   As she waited to see him, housewife and grandmother Juana
Barrera said she was nervous and excited. ``He has been a leader
for a long time, so I don't think he is such a bad man,'' she said.

Fate of thousands of Palestinian prisoners to be determined in Wye
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TURMOUS AYYA, West Bank (AP) _ Saieda Hamzeh remembers gently
caressing the young face of her 16-year-old son Muntasir. Three
years later, a full-grown beard now covers that face and barbed
wire keeps a mother's touch away.
	   Muntasir is serving a five-year sentence in Israel's Megiddo
prison for possessing and preparing to use explosives. The
possibility of Muntasir's early release, and that of some 3,000
other Palestinians in Israeli jails, is one of the issues at the
summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the United States.
	   For Arafat, the issue is critical. The Palestinian leader,
already under pressure from opponents who claim he has conceded too
much to Israel, needs to bring back something solid to his people
from the talks.
	   For Netanyahu, prisoner release is one of the more difficult
concessions. The prime minister was highly critical of his
predecessors for releasing prisoners and has accused Arafat of a
``revolving-door'' policy regarding militants in Palestinian
custody.
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said
Monday that police submitted a list of 100 Palestinian prisoners to
the Israeli delegation at Wye Plantation, outside Washington, D.C.,
but would not say if some or all would be released.
	   Her boss, Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told Israel
radio that up to 100 prisoners, primarily those who are sick or
jailed for non-violent crimes, could be released soon.
	   But Arafat will need to hold out for a more significant offer
than that to satisfy his public.
	   ``Arafat feels the pressure, the street reminds him every day of
the importance of the prisoners,'' Mrs. Hamzeh said.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians marched in the Gaza Strip on Monday to
demand the release of relatives held in Israeli jails.
	   Holding pictures of husbands, fathers and sons, an estimated 700
Palestinian women and children demanded that the Palestinian
delegation to the Mideast summit secure the release of prisoners
held for security offenses.
	   ``Our people cannot accept any agreement without the release of
all the prisoners,'' said Sufian Abu Zaida, an official in the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Such protests have been a daily occurrence in
Palestinian-controlled cities, even before the start of the summit,
giving Arafat something to point to as he argues the issue.
	   Though clearly skeptical, the 49-year-old Hamzeh said she is
hopeful that her son, now 19, will be released once a deal is
reached.
	   ``He has only two years left, Israel usually releases those who
have a short time left,'' Hamzeh, wearing a tradional full-length
embroidered dress, said with a warm smile.
	   Because the explosives her son prepared were never used in an
attack and he did not cause the death of anyone, he could be among
those released.
	   But for her next door neighbor, Summana Jabara _ whose father is
serving a life sentence for planting a bomb in a Jerusalem market
23 years ago that killed and injured tens of Israelis _ the chances
of greeting a jailed relative are slim.
	   Israel has said it would never release Palestinians who have
``blood on their hands.''
	   ``People like my father, no one even mentions them any more,''
said Jabara, who was three months old when her father Ahmed was
arrested. ``I have no hopes that he will be released.''
	   Mrs. Hamzeh said she has plans for her son and will hold him to
a promise he made to get his high school diploma and enroll in
college.
	   She also said that if her son is released, she'll make sure he
stays out of trouble.
	   ``Before he was arrested he would get frustrated and stomp out
of the house when I asked him what he was doing or where he was
going,'' Mrs. Hamzeh said. ``Now, he won't get away with that.''

Report: Deutsche Bank targets Bankers Trust for takeover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT Bankers Trust seventh largest bank,
sted eighth; ADDS additional background on Bankers Trust &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has opened
preliminary takeover talks with Bankers Trust, according to a
published report.
	   The possible deal, which would require the approval of the
Federal Reserve and banking regulators in New York, would be the
largest takeover of a U.S. bank by a non-U.S. bank, the Financial
Times said in Tuesday's edition.
	   Bankers Trust, based in New York, is the seventh-largest bank
holding company in the United States in terms of assets.
	   The newspaper said sources close to the talks, whom they do not
name, stress the discussion is in its early stages, but that it is
the ``key element'' of the German bank's efforts to acquire a
leading U.S. investment bank.
	   Any announcement of any deal is seen as being some way off.
	   ``I would not call these official talks, more exploratory
talks,'' the Financial Times quoted an unidentified person involved
as saying. ``However, it looks like it may lead to that.''
	   The newspaper said both companies declined to comment on the
report.
	   Senior executives at Deutsche Bank are said by Wall Street
sources to recognize talks with Bankers Trust as offering the best
hope of a takeover announcement before the end of the year, the
newspaper said.
	   Many European banks have been eyeing U.S. banks, many of which
have suffered large drops in stock prices recently and are seen as
undervalued. Losses through investments in overseas markets and in
risky loans to hedge funds have hurt many banks, causing investor
confidence to drop.
	   Bankers Trust was one of the banks involved in the dlrs 3.6
billion bailout of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management LP last
month and subsequently reported it had dlrs 875 million in
hedge-fund exposure. Critics have questioned how vulnerable banks
and other financial institutions have become by lending to or
investing in the risky funds.
	   Bankers Trust will report quarterly earnings on Thursday. The
bank has said it will report a loss for the third quarter, in part
because of investments in Russia, but has refused to comment on
speculation about possible layoffs.
	   Deutsche Bank has been rumored to be looking for a U.S.
acquisition for the past year. Bankers Trust would provide the
German bank with a large-scale U.S. operation and U.S. clients.

Grenades injure dozens at Israeli bus station, throw peace talks
</HEADLINE>
into turmoil
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS Israel-Explosion.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP) _ The No. 14 bus stop was packed with
soldiers waiting for a ride to a nearby army base during morning
rush-hour when suddenly there was a hissing noise.
	   ``Grenade!'' someone shouted, and many of the young recruits
dropped to the ground.
	   The Monday attack, by a Palestinian activist in the Islamic
militant group Hamas, injured 64 people and disrupted the Mideast
peace summit in Maryland, seen as perhaps the last chance for
wrapping up an agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was
suspending all talks with the Palestinians except those on security
issues, and said he would not remain at the negotiating table for
an ``unlimited period of time.''
	   Three victims were in serious condition after the early morning
attack in the Negev Desert town of Beersheba, 50 miles (80
kilometers) south of Jerusalem, and many soldiers were among the
wounded.
	   The attack began when the assailant, concealing something in a
white bag, walked toward the bus stop at the edge of Beersheba's
central bus station and hurled two grenades, witnesses said.
	   The stop was packed with soldiers waiting for a ride to a nearby
army base, among them 19-year-old Tamar Glustoron.
	   ``Suddenly I heard a hissing noise,'' Glustoron said. ``Someone
yelled, 'It's a grenade.''' Glustoron, who was injured by shrapnel
in the head, back and legs, said she and most of her fellow
recruits dropped to the ground to seek cover.
	   From the bus stop, the assailant ran across the street and was
struck by a bus turning the corner. A construction worker, Avi
Friedman, said he then jumped on to the Palestinian from behind and
wrestled him to the ground. The assailant was taken into custody.
	   The blast shattered nearby windows and left army-issue olive
duffel bags and clothes strewn on the pavement. A soldier's
polished black boots, with the socks stuffed inside, lay on a
traffic island.
	   A street sweeper, who had lost consciousness, lay on the
pavement, his body covered by blood, said Ezra Zion who owns a
nearby restaurant.
	   Officials at Sorokka Hospital in Beersheba said 64 people were
injured, including a 15-year-old boy in critical, but stable
condition, and two in serious condition. Most of the others
suffered minor injuries.
	   The Palestinians' security chief in the West Bank, Jibril
Rajoub, said the assailant was from the Palestinian-controlled
sector of the West Bank town of Hebron. He said the man, a
29-year-old father of five, was a supporter of the Islamic militant
group Hamas and was imprisoned twice for activities linked to the
group.
	   Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stopped short of claiming
responsibility for the attack, saying only that ``what happened
this morning is part of our continued resistance to the occupation
of our land.''
	   Hamas has threatened to carry out terror attacks in Israel to
avenge the killing of two fugitives by Israeli soldiers last month.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called Netanyahu, saying he
regretted the incident and ordered an investigation, according to a
statement by Netanyahu's office.
	   Netanyahu, who received the call during a meeting with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, said he appreciated the words but that
real action by the Palestinians was needed to fight terrorism.
	   ``In order to achieve peace, there is a need for a firm struggle
and a clear order to everyone in the Palestinian Authority,
especially Jibril Rajoub, to act on all security matters,''
Netanyahu said.

Sollied new coach in Gent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Because former Rosenborg coach Nils
Arne Eggen will return as of Jan. 1, present head coach Trond
Sollied signed two and a half year contract with Belgium Gent on
Monday.
	   A year ago Sollied was Eggen's assistant coach, but he did not
want to be an assistant to Eggen. Sollied led Rosenborg to the
seventh consecutive league title Sunday, and he will remain the
Rosenborg head coach until Jan. 1.
	   ``Gent is an exciting club, and it is a great challenge for me
as coach,'' Sollied told the Rosenborg website.
	   Gent is seventh in the Belgium league, seven points behind the
leader Lokeren after 10 rounds.

Kohl to pay Poland farewell visit and receive award

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The outgoing German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, a strong supporter of Poland's integration with the western
security and economic structures, is heading to Warsaw to say
farewell.
	   An invitation from Poland's President Aleksander Kwasniewski,
made after Kohl lost his re-election bid last month, is to
recognize Kohl's efforts to lead the former Warsaw Pact country and
a former foe, into the family of western nations.
	   During Tuesday's one-day visit, Kohl, who steps down Oct. 27,
was to receive from Kwasniewski Poland's highest distinction, the
White Eagle Order. He was also to meet with Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek.
	   Buzek has invited Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who is to
be sworn in on Oct. 27, to visit Poland in early November,
government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin said.
	   Ever since the two neighboring nations, with a long history of
warfare, signed the landmark friendship treaty in 1991 aimed at
burying the ghosts of World War II, Kohl has supported efforts to
mend relations.
	   Even in his campaign this year, Kohl advocated closer ties with
Poland, saying postwar Germany's success at converting its western
neighbor France from historic foe to close ally can and should be
repeated across the eastern border.
	   ``The way to mutual understanding is often hard,'' Kohl said a
year ago. ``It means overcoming some prejudices. But our experience
with France shows that `good neighborliness' can succeed if many
people on both sides take it to heart.''
	   Championed by Germany, Poland was among the first former Warsaw
Pact countries invited to join NATO and is on the short list for
early EU entry as well.
	   Germany is also the biggest market for Polish exports.
	   Relations are sometimes strained, though, by calls from
conservatives within Kohl's camp for Poland to do more to address
demands from Germans forced out of Poland after World War II for
compensation for their land.

Torre with one decision left for Game 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Relaxed and seemingly rested after a long early
morning flight, the Yankees enjoyed a few laughs around the batting
cage Monday at Qualcomm Stadium.
	   Most of the fun came at the expense of New York's pitchers, who
got in a few meek hacks in preparation for Tuesday night's Game 3
of the World Series when the American League champions will have to
play some National League ball.
	   David Wells took a Ruthian swing that produced a high popup,
Jeff Nelson's bunt attempt plopped in the netting above his head,
and Hideki Irabu looked like he was holding a bat for the first
time.
	   ``Oh, this is ugly,'' one Yankee said while watching the
pitchers take their rips.
	   It's easy to have fun in California, especially when you're two
wins away from a World Series title.
	   Little has gone wrong for the Yankees so far. They're finally
hitting, everyone's healthy and only a total collapse seems to
stand in their way from finishing their dream season on top.
	   Still, manager Joe Torre has some concerns and at least one
problem to resolve.
	   A former manager in the National League, Torre knows the
subtleties of that league's game will force him to be on top of his
game Tuesday night.
	   ``This is the National League now, and you have to pay a lot
more attention when you manage,'' he said before the Yankees'
workout. ``You've got to be aware of double switches.''
	   Torre has already decided to make a switch in his starting
lineup for Game 3. What that switch is, he's still not certain.
	   Rookie Ricky Ledee, who has gone 4-for-6 in the first two games
of the Series and who reached base in his first seven at-bats, will
not start in left field for Game 3 against San Diego left-hander
Sterling Hitchcock.
	   Torre will chose from among Tim Raines _ a switch-hitter _ or
right-handers Chili Davis and rookie Shane Spencer to start in
left.
	   ``I don't know yet,'' Torre said. ``It's not going to be Ledee
so take that and run with it. But I haven't really zeroed in on
anybody. ... You've got a few candidates, and the wild card guy
could be Chili Davis because he threw his hat in the ring last
night (1-for-3, one RBI, two walks). But I'm going to give it a
little more thought.''

Qualcomm field torn up by Chargers and Eagles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The field at Qualcomm Stadium looked like a
battleground Monday, with worn brown patches in the infield and
right-center field.
	   The San Diego Chargers and Philadelphia Eagles played an
National Football League game Sunday, and in less than a day the
stadium was converted back to baseball for Tuesday night's Game 3
of the World Series.
	   Much of the infield grass was cut very low and soft, and it
appeared some of the grass between the pitcher's mound and first
base was either dead or close to it. Sections were muddy between
home plate and the mound and between the mound and first.
	   After the workouts, a machine rolled the grass in right field.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DESIGNATED SITTER: &LR;  With the World Series shifting to Qualcomm
Stadium, the San Diego pitchers should finally get a breather in
the New York lineup.
	   With the designated hitter used in the first two games, the
Yankees' No. 9 hitter Ricky Ledee went 4-for-6 and reached base in
seven of his eight plate appearances. That's quite a difference
from what David Cone and Andy Pettitte _ New York's starting
pitchers the next two games _ are likely to produce from the nine
hole.
	   Cone, who played six years in the National League, has the most
experience at the plate of the Yankees pitchers. He is 61-for-401
(.152) in his career and joked that manager Joe Torre held him
until Game 3 to get his bat in the lineup. Cone doesn't have a hit
since 1992, but did drive in a run in interleague play against
Atlanta this year.
	   Pettitte is much less experienced at the plate and is hitless in
four career at-bats. He has been taking batting practice the past
month, but is not confident about his skills at the plate.
	   ``Normal hitters have a tough time against their pitching, I
don't know if I have a chance,'' Pettitte said. ``All you can hope
for is getting a bunt down when you need to. I hit about .350 in
high school, but most of these guys hit at least .500.''
	   New York's best weapon at the plate is reliever Mike Stanton who
is 6-for-12 in his career.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LOVING LEFTIES: &LR;  If the Padres think the sight of a left-handed
starter will spook the Yankees, think again.
	   Sterling Hitchcock will be the first left-hander New York has
faced since the next-to-last day of the regular season, when the
Yankees beat Tampa Bay's Terrell Wade 3-1. But during the regular
season, New York went 33-11 against lefties with a gaudy .306
batting average.
	   Hitchcock's start will likely force Ricky Ledee to the bench.
Ledee had four hits in the first two games but manager Joe Torre
will probably go with one of his four right-handed options in left
field _ Chad Curtis, Tim Raines, Shane Spencer or even designated
hitter Chili Davis, who has been shagging flies the last few days.
	   ``At this point, I really do not know which way I am going,''
Torre said. ``In all likelihood it won't be Ledee. He did play
against left-handers all season, but I think with the number of
right-handers I have to choose from it will probably be one of the
right-handers.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; COAST TO COAST: &LR;  The 2,444-mile (3,910-kilometer) flight from
New York to San Diego was the longest World Series trip in 17
years.
	   Not since the Dodgers and Yankees met in 1981, have there been
teams from opposite coasts in the Series. This is the eighth time
there has been a coast-to-coast Series, with the Yankees involved
in six of them. The East Coast team is 4-3.
	   The Yankees beat the Giants in 1962, lost to the Dodgers in 1963
and 1981, and beat Los Angeles in 1977 and 1978. The 2,585-mile
(4,136-kilometer) flight in 1962 was the longest distance between
two cities.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ODDS AND ENDS: &LR;  If the Yankees come up with their first World
Series sweep since 1950, they will end up with the fourth-best
overall record in modern history. New York's 125-75 record (.714
winning percentage) would trail only the 1906 Cubs (.749), 1927
Yankees (.722), and 1909 Pirates (.717). ... Tuesday's game will be
the first World Series game in California since Cincinnati beat
Oakland in Game 4 of the 1990 Series. ... In seven Series games,
San Diego's starters have failed to make it out of the third inning
five times. They've allowed 24 earned runs in 19 1-3 innings, an
11.17 ERA. ... The first 10 times the Yankees took 2-0 leads in the
World Series, they went on to win. But they lost the last two times
they won Games 1 and 2, to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955 (4-3) and
to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1981 (4-2). ... Overall, teams with
2-0 World Series leads have lost 10 of the last 12 Game 3s, with
the 1989 Oakland Athletics and 1990 Cincinnati Reds the exceptions
(each went on to sweep). Of the 29 times a team swept the first two
games at home, 22 went on to win the Series.

Dollar, Tokyo stock prices inch higher at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged up against the yen Tuesday
morning in lackluster trading, while Japanese stock prices moved
slightly higher after an overnight rise on Wall Street.
	   The dollar bought 114.78 yen at midday, up 0.06 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 114.28 yen
late Monday.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 15.12
points, or 0.11 percent, to 13,582.32 points to end the morning
session. On Monday, the Nikkei closed up 286.66 points, or 2.16
percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar's strength against the German
mark led Japanese short-term players to buy back the U.S. currency
against the yen.
	   The dollar continued to benefit from speculation that the
Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, may lower interest rates at its
policy-setting meeting on Thursday, traders said.
	   But they said the dollar's direction against the yen remains
unclear.
	   On the stock market, an overnight gain on Wall Street encouraged
investors in Tokyo. The Dow rose 49.69 points _ or 0.6 percent _ to
finish Monday's session at 8,466.45.
	   Trading remained moderate in Tokyo, however, as many investors
took a wait-and-see attitude on expectations the government will
consider stimulus steps to lift Japan's moribund economy, dealers
said.
	   Kaoru Yosano, head of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, told reporters Monday that the government may come up
with a new set of economic stimulus measures next month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.31 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,028.23
points. The TOPIX closed up 16.24 points, or 1.61 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.800 percent from Monday's finish of 0.815
percent, driving its price up to 108.96 yen from 108.82 yen.

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Eric Daze scored with 3:49 left in regulation to
lift the Chicago Blackhawks to a 2-1 victory over the Canadiens on
Monday night and earn their first win in Montreal since 1991.
	   Daze scored on a backhander off a rebound of Alexei Zhamnov's
long shot into an open side as goaltender Jose Theodore tried to
scramble back into the crease.
	   Rookie Daniel Cleary scored his first NHL goal in the first
period for Chicago (3-2-0), which had lost six games in a row in
Montreal since an 8-3 victory Feb. 6, 1991.
	   Vincent Damphousse scored on a power play 3:45 into the third
period for Montreal (2-2-1), which lost at home for the second time
in three nights.
 &UR; Predators 2, Maple Leafs 2
	   In Toronto, in Nashville's first and only appearance at Maple
Leaf Gardens, the expansion Predators battled the Toronto Maple
Leafs to a tie.
	   The Maple Leafs needed a goal from Fredrik Modin at 13:51 of the
second period to salvage the point.
	   Andrew Brunette scored and also assisted on Sergei Krivokrasov's
goal at 12:30 of the second that gave the Predators (1-2-1) a 2-1
lead.
	   Sergei Berezin gave Toronto (3-1-1) the initial lead in the
first period.
	   Mike Dunham played well for the Predators, stopping 30 shots as
Toronto outshot Nashville 32-25.

	   KISNA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ They've been displaced from their
homes. Gunfire explodes nearby. But ethnic Albanian children in
this refugee camp have an even more immediate concern: They want to
go to school.
	   Round a bend in Kosovo's central mountains they play soccer on
the lush hillside, framed by trees under the midday sun. When their
teacher calls, they tumble into class, a gangly mass of arms, legs,
clothes and hair.
	   But any normalcy ends there.
	   The school is rectangular hut, 40 feet (13 meters) long, made
from tree branches over a frame covered by clear plastic sheeting.
Children sat on a wooden plank or the bare earth that served as a
floor.
	   There are no books, writing pads, pencils or lunch boxes. The
teacher stands in the middle, talking or asking questions as the
air inside becomes humid and musty from the sun beating down on the
plastic covering.
	   ``They learn very well, but when they hear shooting, their minds
leave the classroom,'' sighs Heset Qelaj, who started the school
two weeks ago in the ethnic Albanian refugee camp.
	   Over the past few months, about 3,000 refugees fleeing the
Serbian military and police offensive across Kosovo have settled in
a mountain gully above Kisna Reka village.
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most want independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in the crackdown
on separatists, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their
homes to escape the violence.
	   As word of the refugees' arrival in Kisna Reka spread, relief
supplies arrived, including food, clothes and materials for
shelters.
	   But the children got bored with playing in mud puddles left by
tire tracks and soon a group of 10-year-olds asked Qelaj, who has
been a teacher in Kisna Reka for 30 years, if he would hold
classes.
	   ``The children know I am a teacher and they wanted to learn,''
he said after dismissing Monday's class. ``They asked me to teach
them.''
	   Within days, more than 100 of the refugee children were coming
for three hours in the early afternoon for classes in Albanian
language, math and other subjects.
	   Two other teachers help Qelaj supervise and teach, with separate
classes held in each half of the school hut. A blue sign over the
door says ``Survival School,'' or better, ``School of Hard
Knocks.''
	   Kushtrin Rexhiqi, a 10-year-old with bright green eyes, said he
likes gonig to class because it gives him something to do.
	   ``It's OK here,'' he said as his friends gathered around to
watch him talking with a reporter, ``But my old school back in the
village was better.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A judge has blocked an attempt to close
discotheques that restrict entry based on race, stripping the
government's consumer rights group of its ability to punish racist
businesses.
	   The group, Indecopi, had fined and ordered four exclusive Lima
discotheques temporarily closed after an investigation showed they
denied entry to people with Indian features or dark skin.
	   The owner of one discotheque appealed the ruling, arguing that
Indecopi did not have the jurisdiction to order business closed for
racism. That authority belonged only to the courts, the owner said.
	   Members of Peru's Indian majority are regularly barred from
entering from Lima's exclusive restaurants and clubs, which cater
to a white or mixed race elite. People with the Andean features of
Peru's mountainous interior are most frequently discriminated
against.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A U.S. animal-rights group has carried its
campaign for vegetarianism to a place where many people in recent
years already _ unwillingly _ have abandoned meat: Cuba.
	   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent a Sept. 22
letter to President Fidel Castro urging him to give up meat as an
example. A copy of the letter was faxed Monday to The Associated
Press.
	   ``Adopt a vegetarian diet. Such a decision would make a powerful
statement of solidarity with both the exploited animals and people
forced to desensitize themselves in low-paid slaughterhouse jobs,''
it said.
	   But lack of meat is one of the most common complaints of Cubans
struggling with economic hardships caused by the collapse of
socialist trading partners.
	   While traditional Cuban cuisine is heavy on pork, beef and
chicken, many Cubans rarely find more than a pound of chicken _ if
that _ in their monthly rations.
	   Bruce G. Friedrich, coordinator of PETA's vegetarian campaign,
said the Virginia-based group is still waiting for a response from
Castro.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Government officials took a stronger stand
Monday against U.S. plans to put a nuclear waste site near its
border with Mexico.
	   Cabinet members who earlier had waffled on steps to oppose the
dump are now promising strong action against the projected
low-level radioactive waste dump in Sierra Blanca, Texas, about 15
miles from the Mexican border.
	   Energy Secretary Luis Tellez, who previously had said the waste
dump did not pose a danger to Mexican border residents, said he
shared his government's concern over its location.
	   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, appointed by
Gov. George W. Bush, is to meet Oct. 22 to decide whether to
license the dump.
	   ___
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ President Jamil Mahuad's approval rating
has fallen sharply since he took office more than two months ago,
mainly due to unpopular austerity measures that have caused prices
to soar, a poll showed Monday.
	   A poll by the private company Market showed that 35 percent of
Ecuadoreans approved of his presidency, down 30 percentage points
from results of a poll taken shortly after Mahuad entered office
Aug. 10.
	   In a national strike called by Ecuador's unions on Oct. 1 to
protest the measures, three people died in clashes between police
and protesters.
	   The reforms have increased the price of fuel by as much as 400
percent and sent the cost of many basic foods and public
transportation skyrocketing.
	   Pollsters surveyed 1,600 people across Ecuador on Oct. 3-4. The
margin for error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ An American tourist and
three Dominicans drowned in flooding this weekend in the Dominican
Republic, police said Monday.
	   The deaths were in Jarabacoa, an area north of Santo Domingo
that is popular with campers and hikers. Two of the dead were
identified as Ramon Alcantara Cabrera, 48, and American tourist
Bryan Cluso, 54. Police did not know Cluso's hometown, and they had
not identified the two other victims.
	   Police said Cluso was believed to have died when a small boat he
was in capsized on the Yague del Norte River. Alcantara died when a
bridge he was on was swept away.

discotheques that restrict entry based on race, stripping the

	   Peru's consumer rights watchdog Indecopi had fined and ordered
four exclusive Lima discotheques temporarily closed after an

	   The owner of one discotheque appealed the ruling, arguing that
Indecopi did not have the legal power to order business closed for
racism, which can only be done by the courts.
	   The judge backed the appeal, ordering Indecopi to stop further
investigations.
	   The court ruling left Indecopi powerless to investigate or
punish racist businesses, consumer groups charge.
	   ``This questionable decision will promote discrimination in our
country. It is impossible to understand how the judicial system
could back these racist practices,'' the vice president of Peru's
Association of Consumers and Users, Herley Llerena, said Monday.
	   Members of Peru's Indian majority are regularly barred from
entering from Lima's exclusive restaurants and clubs, which cater
to a white or mixed race elite. People with the Andean features of
Peru's mountainous interior are most frequently discriminated
against.
	   Indecopi had acted after receiving many complaints about the
four clubs.

Chinese, Vietnamese leaders discuss border dispute in Beijing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China and Vietnam are making progress in settling
their border disputes and have replaced former enmity with smooth
bilateral ties, Premier Zhu Rongji said in talks with Vietnamese
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.
	   Khai was to meet on Tuesday with President Jiang Zemin.
	   In the talks on Monday, Zhu said it is in both countries'
interests to settle the land border and sea boundary in the Beibu
Gulf by 2000, a time frame set by the ruling communist parties of
China and Vietnam, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported late
Monday night.
	   Khai said Vietnam also was determined to settle the boundary
soon, Xinhua reported.
	   The two also discussed ways to promote trade and investment,
Xinhua said without giving details. Senior economic officials were
accompanying the two premiers in the talks.
	   Afterward, Chinese and Vietnamese officials signed a treaty on
judicial assistance in civil and criminal cases, a border trade
agreement and a consular treaty. Xinhua gave no details, but
problems between the two countries include smuggling and poor
quality goods.
	   Trade along the border has boomed since the two former enemies
mended ties and normalized relations in 1991. Trade grew from dlrs
30 million in 1991 to dlrs 1.44 billion last year, according to
Vietnamese statistics reported in the newspaper Investment in
Vietnam.
	   In 1979, China attacked Vietnam to punish Hanoi for invading
Cambodia 10 days earlier.
	   During the 1980s, relations between the two countries remained
chilly. This was the first time a Vietnamese prime minister has
lead a delegation on a visit to China since normalization.
	   Khai planned to tour southern China before returning to Hanoi on
Friday.
	   China has 41 investment projects in Vietnam with total
investment capital of dlrs 102 million, while Hong Kong has 191
projects capitalized at dlrs 2.5 billion.

Charred bodies litter the ground after Nigerian pipeline blast

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ Drawn by rumors that a huge pool of
gasoline was free for the taking, hundreds of people converged on
this small Nigerian town over the weekend.
	   On Monday, though, it was their relatives who converged here,
searching out the charred remains of their brothers, sisters,
fathers and mothers, killed as the fountain of fuel burst into a
fireball.
	   ``It is finished,'' cried Charity Unurhoro, after finding the
horribly burned bodies of her mother and brother, who she could
identify only by his necklace. ``Now everything is over for me.''
	   As she cried, a man quietly told a young relative to fetch a
wheelbarrow. It was time to take the corpse of the boy and his
mother home.
	   For dozens of families, Monday's search ended the same way.
	   ``I cannot take him,'' said James Daniel, after finding the body
of his brother, Joseph. ``Let the government bury him.''
	   The fire, which began Saturday as gasoline spilled from a
pipeline, killed at least 500 people and left at least 100
hospitalized, military officials said.
	   The area's hospitals _ most of which only have a handful of
doctors and nurses and little in the way of burn care _ were
overwhelmed by the disaster. Doctors were overworked and medicine
in short supply, local officials said.
	   With dozens of charred, unidentified bodies littering the town
and flames still occasionally flaring up to 20 meters (65 feet)
high, authorities began the grim task Monday of burying the dead.
	   By Monday night, firefighters had stopped battling the flames
and waited for the blaze, which spread thick black smoke for miles
(kilometers), to burn itself out.
	   A mass grave was being dug at the edge of the town to bury
hundreds of unidentified corpses, many burned beyond recognition.
Separate burials were held Monday for at least 52 of the dead, and
dozens of people took corpses back to surrounding villages.
	   Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar flew in by helicopter
for a 15-minute visit. He said the government would pay for medical
treatment, but that there would be no compensation to survivors,
apparently because many of those killed were believed to be
scavenging fuel.
	   But area residents were furious over the deaths.
	   ``This is a tragedy of huge proportions,'' the Rev. Andrew
Imadu, a local minister, said at one funeral in Jesse. ``Our own
people have been driven by deprivation to such a desperate search
for livelihood.''
	   Southeastern Nigeria, while rich in oil, is scarred by decades
of poverty and villagers in some areas are believed to regularly
sabotage oil pipelines in order to file claims for compensation.
	   The above-ground pipeline links a refinery in the southeastern
city of Warri, 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Lagos, with
the northern city of Kaduna, nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles)
away.
	   Over the weekend, hundreds of people descended on the town as
rumors spread that a huge pool of gasoline _ which had spilled from
the pipeline into a concrete well _ was available for the taking,
according to J.I. Ogude, village chief of Jesse.
	   The scavenging had been going on since at least Saturday
morning, he said, adding that people gathering at the scene were
taking the fuel to sell on the black market.
	   An official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed the pipeline
had purposely been punctured, and that scavengers tools had sparked
the explosion. Some newspaper reports, though, said a cigarette may
have started the conflagration.
	   Some corpses _ including those of some children _ were found
still clutching plastic cups, funnels and cans to collect the fuel.
	   The charred body of one woman was found with her dead baby still
strapped to her back. Many other victims were villagers sleeping in
their homes.
	   Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages, skyrocketing black-market prices and long gasoline
lines.

<TEXT>
	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A bus carrying British holiday-makers
crashed early Tuesday near this Aegean port killing at least seven
people, including two Britons, and injuring 35, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
	   The tourists were traveling to Izmir's airport from Kusadasi,
and were on their way home to Britain from the resort.
	   According to Anatolia, the bus collided with a car at 2:20 a.m.
(1120 GMT), killing all five passengers in the car and two Britons.
	   A spokeswoman for the British holiday company Airtours, which
hired the bus, said the bus was carrying 38 passengers when it
collided head-on with a taxi.
	   The spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said hospital reports indicated that eight people were killed in
the crash _ three Britons and five Turkish nationals.
	   All passengers were taken to one of four local hospitals for any
needed treatment and at least one needed emergency surgery and was
undergoing an operation, the spokeswoman said.
	   ``Our rep was traveling in the front of the coach but she was
fine. She had chest pains but she was walking, talking and
organizing people after the crash, so it sounds as though it could
be a lot worse for people in the taxi,'' she said.
	   The identities of the victims were not immediately available.
Police was unavailable for comment.

Symonds called into Australian team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Hard-hitting youngster Andrew Symonds
has been called up for Australia's cricket team for the ICC's
mini-World Cup event at Bangladesh.
	   The former Gloucestershire star, who chose Australia over
England at the end of 1996, replaces injured Tom Moody. Moody
suffered a knee injury last week.
	   Symonds scored four Sheffield Shield centuries last season after
previously failing to live up to his promise in the competition. He
is an aggressive batsman and once hit a record number of sixes for
Gloucestershire.
	   Symonds, who plays Sheffield Shield cricket for Queensland, was
selected to tour Pakistan with England A but declined the
opportunity in order to make a bid for Australian selection.
	   After being chosen for several Australia A matches, this is his
first call up to the top limited overs side.
	   The ICC Trophy competition starts this weekend but Australia's
first match will be played on Oct. 28 following the third test
against Pakistan.

Conflict prevention discussed at Tokyo Africa conference

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Conflict prevention and rebuilding after military
disputes topped the agenda Tuesday as an international African
development conference entered its second day, organizers said.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan planned to deliver a speech at
a dinner for participants of the 2nd Tokyo International Conference
on African Development. Annan was to arrive in Tokyo later Tuesday.
	   On Monday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi opened the conference and
vowed to maintain Japan's commitment to African aid despite his
country's severe economic difficulties.
	   The conference is expected to issue an ``Agenda for Action''
Wednesday aimed at halving the number of people living in absolute
poverty by 2015 through economic growth and development.
	   Besides Annan, participants in the conference include the
leaders of Swaziland, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Djibouti,
Mozambique, Botswana and Benin.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attended the
conference's opening on Monday.
	   The event is jointly staged by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Empress Michiko marked her 64th birthday Tuesday,
vowing to continue praying for peace and expressing concern over
Japan's prolonged recession.
	   Celebrations for Michiko's birthday were held at the Imperial
Palace, with visits scheduled by the prime minister, other
political figures and imperial family members.
	   When asked about her thoughts on the past year, the empress said
the economic situation in Japan continued to give ``much cause for
anxiety.''
	   With higher corporate bankruptcies and surging jobless rates in
recent months, Japan is now struggling to bail the economy out of
its worst recession since the war.
	   Recalling her state visit with Emperor Akihito to Britain in
May, the empress mentioned protests by former British prisoners
held captive by Japan during World War II.
	   ``I feel I must go on praying for peace, never forgetting those
who, whether foreign or our own, have suffered grievous wounds of
pain,'' she said. The empress made her comments in a pre-birthday
interview with palace reporters.
	   At the start of the four-day imperial visit to Britain,
survivors of Japanese prison camps turned their backs and booed as
his gilded carriage made its way through London.
	   Japan, in violation of international law, forced POWs to work in
shipyards, mines, jungles and in bridge construction during World
War II. Many were beaten and some were executed.
	   Michiko is the first commoner to become empress. She and
Akihito, also 64, have two sons and a daughter.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ An apparent sabotage attack on an oil
pipeline continued to claim lives Monday and authorities sought to
determine whether leftist rebels were indeed responsible for the
blast, which unleashed a fireball that killed at least 47 people.
	   The usually outgoing rebels have been silent, fueling suspicion
they were behind the early-morning explosion and fire Sunday in the
village of Machuca, in the northwestern state of Antioquia.
	   At least 60 people were badly burned when flames consumed the
rural hamlet. Two of the burn victims _ a 60-year-old man and a
7-year-old boy _ died Monday, the governor's office in Medellin
reported.
	   Authorities appeared to rule out an accident. Government
officials and representatives of the company that operates the
Ocensa pipeline stopped short of accusing the guerrillas, but
expressed indignation.
	   ``We are truly perplexed and indignant,'' said Nestor Humberto
Martinez, the interior minister. ``If it is proven that insurgents
committed this ferocious and barbaric act they owe a clear
explanation to the nation.''
	   The rebel National Liberation Army, or ELN, was suspected in the
blast but had no public comment. Antonio Picon, a civilian member
of a Medellin peace committee, told The Associated Press that
jailed ELN spokesman Francisco Galan said the rebels would make a
statement Tuesday.
	   ``They are carrying out an investigation and tomorrow morning
they will produce a statement saying either 'it was us' or 'it
wasn't,'' said Picon.
	   Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the ELN is active in the
area of Sunday's blast and routinely dynamites pipelines, accusing
the government of selling out to foreign oil companies.
	   Oil company officials said they found a 1.5-meter (4-foot) deep
by 2-meter (6-foot) wide crater in the ground where the pipeline
was ruptured.
	   ``The conclusion is that criminal hands were at work, that it
was an attack,'' said Jorge Suarez, support manager for the
pipeline, which is jointly owned by the state oil company,
Ecopetrol, and a foreign consortium including British Petroleum,
U.S.-based Triton Energy Ltd., Total S.A. of France and two
Canadian companies.
	   Suarez said the crater was ``typical of an explosives attack.''
	   Guerrilla groups often target Colombia's Cano Limon pipeline,
which has been bombed repeatedly this year. But Sunday's explosion
was only the third Ocensa bombing since the pipeline began
operating in November 1995. The 510-mile (820-kilometer) pipeline
carries 350,000 barrels of crude daily from eastern Colombia to the
Caribbean.
	   If the rebels are found responsible, it could poison the
atmosphere for peace talks to put an end to Colombia's 34-year
civil war. President Andres Pastrana is set to begin negotiations
Nov. 7 with the country's other leading guerrilla faction, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. In February, preliminary
peace talks are scheduled to get under way with the ELN.
	   Civilian leaders were giddy last week after a mountain meeting
with ELN leaders to set the talks' agenda. But the mood soured
after Sunday's tragedy.
	   ``I hope the ELN wasn't responsible, but if it was it owes some
explanations, because this goes against everything we've been
talking about,'' said former foreign minister Augusto Ramirez
Ocampo, one of the civilians leading the peace contacts with the
rebels.
	   The pre-dawn blaze scorched wooden homes where villagers were
sleeping and most of the victims were children. One survivor
described a 150 foot (50 meter) ball of flame roaring along a river
before bowling into Machuca.
	   ``We heard people screaming. When we turned around to look
everything was on fire,'' survivor Lacides Atehortua told the
Medellin newspaper El Colombiano.
	   Oil company officials said as many as 30,000 barrels of crude
were spilled and that they expected to have the pipeline repaired
and back in operation on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An electric short-circuit may have
started a fire that killed one foreign tourist and injured two
others at a Seoul hotel, police said Tuesday.
	   The fire broke out in a Turkish Airline office housed on the
second floor of the 19-story President Hotel in downtown Seoul
shortly before midnight Monday.
	   Hundreds of hotel guests scrambled to escape the fire and smoke,
with about 200 finding shelter on the roof of the building, police
said.
	   Fey Chung, a 46-year old Korean-American woman from Downey,
California, was later found dead outside the hotel. Police believe
she fell from her 11th floor room while trying to escape.
	   Two unidentified Japanese tourists were treated for smoke
inhalation and later released, police said. No other injuries were
reported.

	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A bus carrying British holiday-makers
collided with a car early Tuesday near this Aegean port, killing at
all five people in the car and two Britons on the bus and injuring
35 other bus passengers, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   The tourists were traveling to Izmir's airport from Kusadasi,
and were on their way home to Britain from the resort.
	   According to Anatolia, the bus collided with a car at 2:20 a.m.
(1120 GMT), killing all five passengers in the car and two Britons.
	   A spokeswoman for the British holiday company Airtours, which
hired the bus, said the bus was carrying 38 people, including the
driver, when it collided head-on with a taxi.
	   The spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said hospital reports indicated that eight people were killed in
the crash _ three Britons and five Turkish nationals.
	   All passengers were taken to one of four local hospitals for any
needed treatment and at least one needed emergency surgery and was
undergoing an operation, the spokeswoman said.
	   ``Our rep was traveling in the front of the coach but she was
fine. She had chest pains but she was walking, talking and
organizing people after the crash, so it sounds as though it could
be a lot worse for people in the taxi,'' she said.
	   The identities of the victims were not immediately available.
Police was unavailable for comment.

Report: Government appeals for end to street protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Home Ministry has
appealed to citizens to use the ballot box and not street protests
to bring about political change, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said Malaysians
disenchanted with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Asia's
longest-serving ruler, should wait until the general election to
express their frustrations.
	   ``We cannot topple a government which has been elected by the
people,'' Tajol Rosli was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times
daily.
	   In recent weeks, protests have flared throughout the Southeast
Asian nation in support of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir
fired him on Sept. 2 as deputy premier and finance minister. Anwar
was subsequently arrested for launching a campaign urging political
reform.
	   If the governing United Malays National Organization party wants
to change its leader, it too must use an election, Tajol Rosli
reportedly said.
	   ``If we don't like Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, we have to topple him
through UMNO elections and we have to oust UMNO through general
elections,'' he was quoted as saying. An UMNO internal election is
scheduled for next year and a general vote in 2000.
	   Demonstrations held in the capital and in dozens of towns have
demanded Anwar's release, and the ouster of Mahathir, who has ruled
Malaysia for 17 years.
	   On Monday, several thousand protesters gathered near the rural
village of Sementa in the surrounding state of Selangor in defiance
of a blanket police ban on political rallies.
	   Several activists from various political parties spoke before
police arrived an hour later to break up the gathering,
eye-witnesses said.
	   Public gatherings of more than three or four people are deemed
illegal in Malaysia.
	   During Saturday's street protest in front of the National
Palace, police arrested around 140 people, including 17 women, who
called for Malaysia's constitutional monarch to rescue the
country's rapidly declining political climate.
	   A police spokesman was quoted as saying in Tuesday's Star daily
that 133 protesters remain under detention. Several dozen people
have been taken to hospital after complaining of police brutality.

Thai government wants state banks to increase lending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With Thai commercial banks reluctant to
make loans, the Council of Economic Ministers wants state-run banks
to start lending more money as a means of reviving economic growth,
a government spokesman said on Tuesday.
	   Thailand's economic crisis has had a devastating effect on the
country's banking system. As businesses fail or hit hard times,
they have been unable to repay loans to commercial banks.
	   Non-performing loans have been estimated as high as 40 percent
of commercial banks' loan portfolios. Consequently, they have been
refusing to extend credit even to healthy companies, leaving them
unable to purchase raw materials.
	   Government spokesman Akaphol Sorasuchart said state-run banks
such as the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, the
Government Savings Bank, the Government Housing Bank and the Export
and Import Bank of Thailand would be asked to extend more loans.
	   Priority should be given to housing loans for low-income
earners, and to businesses involved in exporting and agriculture,
Akaphol said.
	   He added that more money for loans from state institutions could
come from an anticipated aid package Japan is expected to extend to
Southeast Asian nations, including Thailand.
