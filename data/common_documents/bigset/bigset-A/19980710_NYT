SPORTS COLUMN: HUNDLEY COMES MARCHIN' HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On this first day after the All-Star Game break, the
Mets' clubhouse was filled with music and the chatter of players
back at work after three days off. There was news, too, with
manager Bobby Valentine having to deal with the fact that John
Franco, the ace closer, would be suspended for three games for
bumping an umpire during a disputed game-ending play at the plate
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension wasn't the first news a manager wanted to hear
coming off the all-star break. ``At least they didn't ruin my three
days off,'' Valentine joked. But the bigger buzz was all about the
impending return of Todd Hundley to the Mets' slumping lineup on
Saturday night. Where will he play? Whose place will he take?
Bernard Gilkey, the slumping left fielder? Brian McRae, the center
fielder? Butch Huskey, the right fielder? Each is hitting below
.250.
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus among the outfielders was that if Hundley
arrived and the Mets won, everything would work out. ``If we win,
everyone will be happy,'' McRae said. The taciturn Huskey simply
said, ``The name of the game is win. W-I-N.'' Gilkey took a larger
view. Win or lose, he said, the team needed a jump start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a boost,'' Gilkey said. ``We've been playing flat. We
need something to pick us up.'' The 31-year-old veteran was being
honest. For all the talk about Hundley coming and platooning,
Gilkey was looking forward to remaining an everyday player. ``I've
been an everyday player for eight years.'' he said. ``That is what
I want to cultivate.''
</P>
<P>
   But if duty calls? ``I'm ready to change positions, if that's
what it takes,'' he said. ``I'm ready to sit down, then fight my in a company videotape a few years ago, ``and
you ought to use them in the same proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical telephon call from Calloway might go on for two
hours, Enrico added, with only about five words actually being
spoken by Callway. One Pepsi executive, summoned to lunch alone
with Calloway one day, spent the entire time struggling to think of
ways to break the silence. As the coffee was being served, Calloway
finally spoke, saying, ``Why don't we finish this conversation in
my office?''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway was a director of General Electric, Exxon and Citicorp
when he died, in addition to Pepsico. He was also chairman of the
board at Wake Forest and an enthusiastic supporter who often
interviewed student applicants from the New York area in his
office, said the president, Thomas Hearn. About five years ago, the
university's School of Business and Accountancy was named for
Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I always admired about him was his insight into
people,'' said GE chairman John Welch, who called Calloway ``a
beautiful man'' who displayed great courage during his long
illness. ``He could really read people. People we had known for
years and knew little things about, he would glean in two meetings.
It was an amazing talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway is survived by his mother, Lether Smith of
Winston-Salem; his wife, Janice, of Greenwich; a son, David, of
Austin, Texas; a daughter, Jennifer, of Manhattan; two stepsons,
Ross Smythe of Dallas and Boyd Smythe of Boston, and two
grandchildren.

COMMENTARY: 3 BRAWLEY DEFENDANTS DEFTLY JUGGLE THE FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ The Tawana Brawley defamation case may
deserve to be called the trial of the century, but only because it
looked as though it might last that long. For all the attention
that it has drawn through eight insufferable months, it has had
about as much redeeming social value as a Jerry Springer episode.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted significance and not sideshow, you'd have done
better to skip the second-floor Brawley courtroom and walk another
two flights in the Dutchess County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Dalkeith McIntosh was found guilty Wednesday of
first-degree murder. In little over a month, New York state has
seen two criminal defendants face possible execution, the first two
under the 1995 capital-punishment law. Expect death row to keep
growing.
</P>
<P>
   But to give the Brawley trial its due, it has provided a useful
lesson or two, especially about the meaning of truth.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to six jurors, who finished their first full day of
deliberations Thursday, to decide whether the Rev. Al Sharpton and
two co-defendants showed a reckless disregard for the truth when
they accused Dutchess County prosecutor Steven Pagones of raping
Ms. Brawley in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The key word in this defamation lawsuit brought by Pagones is
``reckless.'' But that's from a legal perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense does not require a jury verdict to conclude that
Sharpton and his Brawley-advising mates, C. Vernon Mason and Alton
Maddox, had shown a regard for the truth so slight that it would
not be detectable on any known scale.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, Mason and Maddox continue to label Pagones a
rapist and even a murderer, while Sharpton does verbal dances
around the question. Have they backed up any of those smears with
hard evidence? Don't be ridiculous. They have yet to offer anything
but innuendo and knowing smirks _ absolutely nothing to refute a
1988 grand jury report that essentially branded the Brawley affair
a hoax. A racially explosive hoax at that.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said on the witness stand here that his purpose was to
speak up for a black teen-ager who had hollered ``rape'' at a group
of white men. Finding out whether there was any reality to her
accusations never flashed on his radar screen, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   And that attitude toward the truth _ certainly cavalier, whether
or not the jury calls it reckless _ might be worth bearing in mind
the next time Sharpton asks New York voters to put him into public
office. His political ambition gives this case whatever scant
significance it may have.
</P>
<P>
   Mason and Maddox have long overstayed their allotted 15 minutes
of fame. Thursday, a Poughkeepsie man walking near the courthouse
expressed annoyance at Pagones for pressing his lawsuit. All it
did, he said, was to give these two discredited men more time in
the limelight, more time to scream ``racism'' at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   When Pagones' lawyer, William Stanton, called the defendants
evil self-promoters this week, Mason stayed true to form. ``Why
don't you just use the N word, you racist, because you did it
impliedly,'' he said later. Of course, Stanton neither used nor
implied the N word. He did, however, use the L word: liars.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton stays above this fray. Verbal excesses of the
Mason-Maddox variety are not his style anymore. He has not only
cleaned up his act but he has also proved himself to be a
formidable political figure: smart and funny, a man who can charm
the birds out of the trees when he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has a penchant for likening himself to no less than
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He did it again when he
testified in this trial, carrying with him a book on King's jailing
for civil-rights protests. ``I've been indicted, I've been stabbed
and now I've been sued,'' Sharpton said. ``I have every base
covered being a great civil-rights leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Every base, however, except one.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself whether King would have repeatedly denounced a man
as a rapist without making any serious effort to find out if the
charge contained a milligram of truth.
</P>
<P>
   If your answer is no, then you are entitled to reach your own
verdict when the man who would be King says that nothing the jury
decides will ``interfere one iota with the future and intentions of
Al Sharpton.''

 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSTOWN, N.Y. _ At her father's sentencing last year, Stacey
Hoehmann was a figure of tortured outrage, providing her own
pronouncement of doom for what she said was his repeated sexual
abuse of her as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe nobody else saw what he did, but God did and He's not
going to forget,'' she told the court and her father. ``So if you
think it's over today, it's not, because your day is still coming.
You're burning in hell for what you did.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Stacey and her father, Joseph Hoehmann, hugged
jubilantly in a hallway of the same courthouse and were joined in
the embrace by Stacey's mother, Kelly Hoehmann. The three walked
off to a local diner for their first lunch together in years, with
Stacey gently stroking her father's back.
</P>
<P>
   What set off this dramatic reversal was a startling letter Ms.
Hoehmann, now 20, sent to Judge Vincent Alfieri Jr. of Clarkstown
Justice Court in March. Her accusation, she said, had all been
lies. Her father, who has been out on bail pending an appeal of his
conviction for sexual abuse, was not guilty of the charges for
which he was sentenced to a year in jail, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoehmann's new account has backed the Rockland County law
enforcement authorities into an uncomfortable corner. It has forced
the district attorney, who believes her recantation is a lie, to
proceed with a case without a cooperating victim, and forced
Alfieri to decide whether he should throw out a conviction he
himself handed down.
</P>
<P>
   But her recantation has also opened a window on how difficult it
can sometimes be to untangle abuse charges in the messy dynamics of
a family. Did Ms. Hoehmann falsely accuse her father three years
ago to exact revenge against his authoritarian discipline? Or is
she lying now to save from jail an abusive father whom she still
loves, and enable herself to reunite with parents who have also
been wounded by the death of her 15-month-old sister?
</P>
<P>
   Some experts in child psychiatry approach such recantations
skeptically because, they say, a child can be more upset by the
convulsive effect of her charges than by actual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's tremendously traumatic to betray a
parent,'' said Dr. Alan Tuckman, chief forensic psychiatrist for
Rockland County. ``What invariably happens is that the child is
ostracized by the family _ a second trauma. All her fears are made
to come true and she has gotten re-victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to distinguish between false and authentic recantations,
he said, is to analyze the depth of detail. ``Children who make up
a sexual abuse usually present a very superficial set of facts,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Gardner, professor of child psychiatry at Columbia
University Medical School, said such cases highlight the difficulty
of resolving child abuse allegations through an adversarial legal
system. What is preferable, he said, is to have both the child and
the father evaluated by impartial mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at her tidy apartment in West Nyack, N.Y., Ms.
Hoehmann, a willowy, freckle-faced young woman who manages a mall
coffee shop and studies at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill,
N.Y., said her accusations against her father grew out of a lie she
told a friend in her simmering anger at her father's strictness.
That lie, she said, ``spun out of control.'' The friend told a
priest who told a guidance counselor who brought in the county's
child protection agency and police. Soon, she said, she felt
compelled to invent lurid details so she would not be branded a
liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept wanting more and more details,'' she said. ``I
didn't know what they were looking for, so I made stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   But as her father's appeal neared a decision and it became clear
he might actually go to jail, she decided to recant, she said.
Prodded by the judge at a hearing last month, she tearfully
apologized to her father, who cried as she spoke. Wednesday, Judge
Alfieri lifted a court order that had barred any contact between
father and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hoehmann, a 38-year-old building contractor,
said that ``an awful lot of reconciliation'' would have to take
place because what she did ``absolutely destroyed'' his life. But,
he added, ``She grew up enough so that she had to make it right,
and the only way to make something right is to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoehmann's lawyer, Bennet Goodman of Bronxville, N.Y.,
criticized the Rockland County district attorney's office for
proceeding when there was no corroboration. ``Society has no
interest in continuing a conviction under these circumstances,
because it's too likely that it will be sending an innocent man to
jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, though, has found three friends to whom
Ms. Hoehmann said the recantation was untrue. One friend testified
that she explained her recantation by saying, ``I've been without a
family so long that to walk out into a room and have everyone nice
to me and not feel like the villain made me feel good.'' (Ms.
Loehmann said she had lied to them again because she did not want
to lose their friendship.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our position that her recantation is a fabrication out
of guilt of seeing her father go to jail and out of a desire to
reconcile with her siblings,'' said Louis Valvo, first assistant
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Ms. Hoehmann described her father as a tough
disciplinarian who kept her from seeing friends or watching
television for infractions like cutting classes. She was also
embittered at having to baby-sit frequently for her five younger
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The enmity deepened when her parents for disciplinary reasons
forced her to transfer from Nyack High School to an all-girls
Catholic school, Academy of the Holy Angels in nearby Demarest,
N.J. When she bloodied a brother's nose in late 1994, her father
ordered her to find another place to live. Some days afterward, in
January 1995, Ms. Hoehmann told a friend in a Catholic youth group,
Patricia Sullivan, that her father abused her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up a stupid story,'' she said. ``I never intended for
it to get back to adults.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan soon passed on the charge to the youth group's
director, the Rev. Anthony Ventrano, and he questioned Stacey.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point I was afraid to tell him I lied,'' she said. ``I
remember thinking that he couldn't tell it to anybody because he's
a priest. After that it pretty much spun out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoehmann began giving a strikingly detailed account, the
same testimony she was to give in Judge Alfieri's courtroom. She
told a worker for the county's Child Protection Services that in
the summer of 1992, when she was 14, her father showed her a
pornographic video in his bedroom, asked her to put on her mother's
robe, and attempted to have sex with her but was interrupted by her
mother's knock.
</P>
<P>
   The second incident, she testified, occurred two years later in
July 1994, the night before a party for a priest close to the
family. She mentioned such details as a shower she took at 4 a.m. A
third incident took place after Christmas 1994, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a screwed-up little kid,'' Ms. Hoehmann said in the
interview. ``I did have pangs of conscience but it was out of my
hands at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of that year, Ms. Hoehmann said, she found
another justification for lying. A fire started by defective wiring
tore through her parents' home. Her father, who had been barred
from the home by court order, raced to the scene late and tried to
rescue 15-month-old Allysia, but could not find her, and she died.
</P>
<P>
   When the abuse case came to trial, Ms. Hoehmann's sister,
Gillian, and other relatives pointed out apparent flaws in her
account, such as the presence of a video recorder in the living
room, not the parents' bedroom. They said she appeared cheerful at
the party for the priest _ the day after the second incident _ and
even jumped playfully on her father's back in a pool.
</P>
<P>
   But at a nonjury trial, Alfieri found Hoehmann guilty of
third-degree sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child,
both misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoehmann, who lives with her boyfriend, has come to believe
that she bears some responsibility for her sister's death because
her charges, forcing her father to leave home, meant he could not
fix the wiring problem. She said she wanted to take more
responsibility for her life, rather than blame her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with a lot of what he did and I don't like the
way he acted,'' she said, ``but he never did anything that he had
to go to jail for.''

NIGERIA ANXIOUSLY AWAITS RESULTS OF PRISONER'S AUTOPSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Inserts new graf (after original 10th graf) on commuting 6
prisoners' death sentences)  (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Stores were shuttered Thursday, isolated fires
burned and streets were unusually empty as Nigeria anxiously
awaited a verdict on the sudden death of its main opposition
leader, Moshood K.O. Abiola, and a timetable for the promised birth
of a democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, who had been imprisoned since 1994 after asserting his
right to the nation's presidency, died Tuesday in Abuja, the
capital, shortly after meeting with high-level U.S. officials. The
apparent cause was cardiac arrest, but the death has raised
suspicion here and set off violence, which continued sporadically
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's body was transported secretly to Lagos on Thursday for
fear that any public sighting could ignite tumult. In a further
effort to prevent unrest, the Lagos state government imposed a
dusk-to-dawn curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The international doctors, including three Americans, who are to
conduct the autopsy on the leader, who died a political prisoner,
also arrived here and Western officials said they would almost
certainly examine Abiola's body Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes according to plan we should have the
preliminary findings by the weekend,'' said one Western official.
``If we find blockage of the arteries, then everything will be
pretty straightforward. But of course if the arteries are clear,
then you have a whole new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's family, gathering here before his funeral, appealed for
calm. ``The greatest honor we can do him in death is to embrace
peace,'' Kola Abiola, the late politician's oldest son, said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Abiola was the apparent winner of elections held in
1993, but annulled by the military government. The government said
last week that it would release all its political prisoners,
including Abiola, who had agreed to relinquish his claim to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of its leading figure, the opposition here is in some
disarray, deeply concerned that further widespread rioting could
provide an excuse for a military clampdown or delay movement toward
democracy. Mobile police units fanned out across Lagos on Thursday
to quell unrest.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little threat of mass protests that could
bring down Nigeria's recently installed leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, because the opposition here is fragmented, Nigeria's
unity is fragile and there is no obvious successor to the military
ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, who has impressed Western officials with his
reform-minded moderation since he took office last month, convened
the 27-member Provisional Ruling Council, the heart of the
country's military authority, Thursday for the second time in two
days. But the meeting adjourned with no announcement on how or when
a democratic system might be introduced. A working group is to
study possible timetables and is expected to report to the
government early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The council announced late Thursday that it would commute death
sentences handed down against Gen. Oladipo Diya and five other men
convicted of plotting to overthrow the country's dictator, Gen.
Sani Abacha. Diya and two co-conspirators now face 25 years in
prison, while the others face 20 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Abubakar's commitment to change appears clear _ and was
reiterated to South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who
visited Thursday _ he faces a delicate choice between a gradual
process that could prove too slow to assuage an impatient nation
and a rapid shift that might precipitate chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said Thursday they doubt that an elected
president could take office before Jan. 1, 1999, if a credible vote
is to be organized.
</P>
<P>
   Tension was palpable in Lagos on Thursday, fanned by the
continuing uncertainty over Abiola's death. Members of Abiola's
family remained convinced that he was poisoned. Several opposition
leaders share this conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally convinced that Abiola was poisoned,'' said
Clement Nwankwo, a prominent human-rights lawyer and opposition
figure. ``The way his death has been described _ the cup of tea,
the gasping for breath, the protracted back and forth _ does not
sound like cardiac arrest to me. But the fact is that if the
autopsy shows foul play, that would really intensify a crisis that
now needs to be contained.''
</P>
<P>
   Nwankwo said his chief concern was that the country could
descend into what he called ``major ethnic conflict.'' Some of the
rioting and killing _ at least 19 people have been confirmed dead _
has involved clashes between the mainly Yoruba population of the
Lagos and Abeokuta areas and Hausa from the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being attacked just because of where they are
from,'' the lawyer said. ``If this country becomes ungovernable, no
authority is going to hold elections, and that would be a terrible
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Hausa and Fulani constitute a majority in the military
government and the armed forces, while a significant part of
Abiola's following came from the Yoruba tribe in southwestern
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the many ethnic and religious groups in this
country of 105 million people have been fanned by the domination of
northern military figures since independence in 1960 and the fact
that the oil that earns the country more than $10 billion a year is
concentrated in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The perceived exploitation of one part of the country by another
_ some officers, including Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator who died
suddenly of a heart attack June 8, are widely reported to have
enriched themselves with oil money _ has inevitably made Nigeria
more volatile.
</P>
<P>
   In this context the Clinton administration is not putting any
pressure on the government to adhere to the timetable Abacha had
set for a democratic transition. A presidential election was to
have been held Aug. 1, and he had emerged as the sole candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With Abacha and Abiola dead, and the process of creating genuine
political parties not yet begun, the Aug. 1 election date is
regarded as entirely unrealistic, officials said. So, too, is the
Oct. 1 date that had been set for an inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five government-created parties are largely meaningless in
the new context,'' one Western official said. ``Time is needed. New
parties have to be formed. A six-month transition looks all right
to us, although of course a period of years is entirely
unacceptable. The most important thing is to do this right.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies have about $7 billion invested in Nigeria, almost
exclusively in the oil industry, an increase of about $3 billion
over the last five years. With about 10 percent of U.S. oil imports
coming from Nigeria, there is clearly extreme concern in Washington
that any transition be handled prudently
</P>
<P>
   In addition, through its size and the strength of its armed
forces _ Nigerian troops are involved in military missions in
Liberia and Sierra Leone _ the country dominates the region, and
the United States is concerned that any chaos might rapidly spill
over Nigeria's borders.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's recent condemnation of
homosexuality and a variety of anti-gay initiatives in Southern
communities point up an important trend in American politics, and a
threatening one for advocates of inclusive democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, this more restrictive attitude toward social freedom
is linked to a newly expansive exercise of religious freedom.
Starting about 20 years ago, evangelical Christians began shedding
their traditional aversion to political activism. In the South,
especially, they have flooded into the electoral process, settling
mainly in the Republican Party. In doing it, they have charged and
changed American politics as has no other force since the civil
rights revolution. They have transformed the Republicans, bringing
to the party a potent bloc vote, boundless energy and an
unwillingness to compromise on certain domestic social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a party that had been centered on economic issues and
anti-communism, and that first began to court the Southern vote in
the days of segregation, found that its best new troops had
concerns other than race: prayer in the schools, abortion and
opposition to gay rights. Prayer and abortion got more attention in
national campaigns, but the anti-gay theme was there from the
beginning. In fact, the crusade by Anita Bryant, a devout Southern
Baptist, against a gay rights ordinance in Miami in 1977 was an
early rising of what came to be called the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentalists won that contest, reversing the ordinance by
referendum, and the two movements _ evangelical Christians and gay
rights _ have been in collision ever since. For the Rev. Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson, who first brought evangelicals back to
politics, and for James Dobson, their newest spokesman, Bible
values are absolute. If homosexuals are condemned in scripture, as
the fundamentalists say they are, then they must be condemned in
society as well. The leaders of conservative religious
organizations have been pressing the case with Republicans on
Capitol Hill lately, and the effect has been plain to see.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said last month that homosexuals are sinners. In
Greenville, S.C., the pastor of the Choice Hills Baptist Church
went him one better. They are ``a stench in the nostrils of God,''
the Rev. Stan Craig declared.
</P>
<P>
   As Kevin Sack reported at length in The New York Times this
week, that kind of sentiment has become the fashion among
Republican politicians in several South Carolina towns. ``The time
has come to take a stand,'' a local school board chairman who was
running for state superintendent of education proclaimed. He was
talking about banning the Indigo Girls from singing at a high
school because of complaints that they were lesbians. He got the
Republican nomination. The new Republican mayor of Myrtle Beach won
office by campaigning to stop the opening of the city's first gay
bar. The bar opened anyway. But near Lancaster, S.C., a lesbian
named Regan Wolf was twice beaten unconscious and tied
spread-eagled on her porch. ``Jesus weren't born for you, faggot,''
a spray-painted message said.
</P>
<P>
   American history is replete with examples of the connection
between the politics of bias and violence. Republican leaders ought
to take stock of what is happening in their party leaders' press
conferences and in its new areas of grass-roots primacy. The party
of Lincoln, which freed the slaves so long ago, should not be
sowing the seeds of a new hatred on Southern ground.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   Could George Steinbrenner's storied ambivalence about keeping
the New York Yankees in the Bronx after 2002 really be melting? His
team's winning streak this season and Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer's prediction that fan attendance could break the 3
million barrier moved Steinbrenner to a tantalizing comment. ``Do
the 3 million, and then we'll talk about the Bronx after the
season,'' he said. ``That isn't getting me where I want to be, but
maybe it would be worth talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitudinal shift, if genuine, is a welcome development.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, the option of remaining in the Bronx has
been treated as though it were radioactive. Steinbrenner, the
club's principal owner, and some politicians have cast eager
glances toward Manhattan. Our hope, as we have noted, is to see
baseball's most important franchise stay planted on historic ground
in a renovated or new stadium that pays homage to the 75-year
tradition built by Ruth, Gehrig, Mantle, Jackson and others who
have worn the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Steinbrenner's response to Ferrer's prediction,
however, could have been put less grudgingly. Then it would have
been heard and heeded by a wider audience of elected officials. He
challenged Ferrer to insure that attendance actually hits three
million. That would break the Yankees' 1988 record of 2.63 million
but fall well short of levels achieved in new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching this milestone by October will require the Yankee
organization to move creatively. Steinbrenner should persuade Gov.
George Pataki, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, to build a temporary Metro North railroad station at
Yankee Stadium now. This modest move alone could enable thousands
more from the suburbs to come and go by commuter rail. The club
should press the MTA and the mayor to promote the ease of hopping
on subway lines to reach the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the club and the rest of Major League Baseball should
take some marketing courses from the NBA and the NFL Baseball must
learn how to market America's pastime to fans of all races and
backgrounds, especially given the prominence of black and Hispanic
players.
</P>
<P>
   With real effort, not sound bites, Ferrer's prediction and
Steinbrenner's challenge could be the beginning of a rapprochement
between the club and New Yorkers who want serious brainstorming to
make the Yankees successful in the place where they are most at
home.

SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR HASIDIC CHILDREN ONLY CALLED UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The village of Kiryas Joel lost yet another decision Thursday
when a state appellate court ruled unanimously that the third and
latest effort by the governor and the state legislature to create a
public school district solely for Hasidic children violated the
Constitution's establishment-of-religion clause.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-0 decision by the Appellate Division in Albany essentially
upheld a lower-court ruling in April, but it was notable for its
strong recommendation that Kiryas Joel, a village of 12,000 Satmar
Hasidic Jews in Orange County, N.Y., invite public school teachers
from an adjoining district into its yeshivas to provide special
education for its disabled students. Sending public school teachers
into parochial schools was barred until June 1997, when the U.S.
Supreme Court, in Agostini vs. Felton, held it was indeed
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty broad judicial hint that they ought to give this
up and use Agostini for providing education in a way that's
acceptable,'' said Marc Stern, a lawyer for the American Jewish
Congress, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief opposing the
Kiryas Joel district.
</P>
<P>
   Except for handicapped students, all the children in Kiryas Joel
attend yeshivas. Establishing a school district is a means for the
village to tap tax dollars to help pay the cost of educating its
severely handicapped children. Kiryas Joel's leadership has always
maintained that it needed its own publicly financed district
because its students, distinguished by their garb, religious
practices and their language, Yiddish, felt ostracized in the
public schools of nearby Monroe-Woodbury.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded in getting the Legislature and two governors to
pass three successive laws carving out a Kiryas Joel public school
district. Each effort was held unconstitutional by a succession of
courts because it applied only to Kiryas Joel and thus was seen as
favoring a particular sect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the district, which instructs 40 disabled village
children and 150 other disabled Hasidic children from nearby
districts, has been allowed to continue operating until the legal
process is exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The latest legislative effort contained provisions that
theoretically might have applied to at least one other school
district. But the appellate judges said that law also ``lacks the
neutrality toward religion mandated by the establishment clause of
the First Amendment.'' It does not cover a broad enough array of
eligible municipalities, the judges said, and its ``application to
other municipalities in the future is speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Wieder, mayor of Kiryas Joel, said it was likely that
the village would appeal to the state's Court of Appeals. He said
the problem with permitting public school teachers from
Monroe-Woodbury to teach Hasidic children is that the
Monroe-Woodbury school board does not want the political
consequences or the expense of absorbing a populous district like
Kiryas Joel.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Waldman, leader of a group of dissidents within Kiryas
Joel, hailed Thursday's ruling because they oppose sending their
children into public schools, even if they are operated by the
village. ``It's a disgrace to the Constitution and a disgrace to
our religion that religious children should be forced to go to
public school,'' he said.

WELLPOINT TO EXPAND REACH IN HEALTH-CARE FIELD WITH CERULEAN BUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Managed-care specialist WellPoint Health Networks
Inc. said it will pay $500 million to buy the parent company of
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint will pay in stock and cash for Atlanta-based Cerulean
Co., which through its two Blue plans has 1.7 million members.
WellPoint, which operates the Blue Cross of California health plan,
already has about 100,000 members in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban Woodland Hills-based company had targeted Georgia
three years ago as a place to expand because of its relatively
business-friendly regulatory environment and growing population,
said WellPoint Chief Executive Leonard Schaeffer. About two-thirds
of the company's current 6.7 million members are in California, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this deal we become No. 1 in market share in one of the
highest strategic geographic areas, plus inherit the Blue name and
trademark in Georgia. I'm very positive about it,'' Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent WellPoint shares up $1.437 1/2 Thursday to close
at $71.06 1/4, and analysts responded positively as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good deal,'' said analyst Ed Kroll at Cowen &AMP; Co. ``The
valuation is reasonable, and it's a good market where they're going
to be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerulean is in the process of converting the nonprofit Georgia
Blue plans to for-profit status, Kroll said, a process WellPoint
itself went through in the early 1990s. Both Cerulean's Blue Cross
and Blue Shield unit and WellPoint's Blue Cross are licensed by the
Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, a national group of health
plans with 68.7 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how a Blue Cross plan operates,'' Kroll said of
Schaeffer and his management team. ``They know what it took to
convert WellPoint from a nonprofit Blue Cross indemnity plan to
managed care ... and I'm confident the management team will
accelerate that process in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer said he expects the deal to close in the fourth
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint also said Thursday it is increasing its stock buyback
program to as many as 8 million shares from 1 million shares. The
company said it will buy back the shares as it issues new ones to
pay for the Georgia purchase.

DODGERS BEAT PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a 12{-game deficit still staring at them this
morning, the Dodgers have a long way to go if they expect to make
the San Diego Padres nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, the Dodgers showed the National League West
Division leaders that they don't plan to go away quietly.
</P>
<P>
   In their first game after the All-Star break, the Dodgers played
arguably their most dominating game of the season by whipping the
Padres 12-3 in front 41,250 at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers also
snapped the Padres' three-game winning streak and have won five of
their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a ladder, we are at the first step,'' said Dodgers
manager Glenn Hoffman. ``Today was the first win and step in trying
to reach out and get back in the second half. I'll tell you, that
was a good sign today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are still in need of one more starting pitcher, but
there isn't expected to a ``Big Unit' or any other well-known
pitcher coming to Chavez Ravine today.
</P>
<P>
   The chances for Seattle ace Randy Johnson or another front-line
starter joining the Dodgers now seem highly unlikely. Interim
general manager Tommy Lasorda and the Mariners have denied talking
about a deal for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Dodgers deal for a fifth starting pitcher might be
made today. Cincinnati Reds left-hander Mike Remlinger (5-9, 4.50
ERA) is believed to be among the names of possible players
discussed, along with Kansas City's Tim Belcher and the Mets' Brian
Bohanan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite asking for a trade after the Dodgers acquired closer
Jeff Shaw last weekend, reliever Antonio Osuna was told by Lasorda
that he would not be traded. Afterward, Osuna asked Lasorda to tell
him the truth since he also reportedly told Paul Konerko the same
thing before shipping him to Cincinnati in the Shaw deal.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who was also promised more save opportunities, said
Lasorda told him: ``I am sincere. My word is in my heart. I'm not
going to trade you.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lasorda: ``I never said I would trade Osuna, you guys
(reporters) said so.''
</P>
<P>
   With Osuna apparently off the market, the Dodgers may have
reliever Jim Bruske start or turn to their farm system if they
can't make a trade. Hoffman expects to name Sunday's starter today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get that fifth starter, believe me when I tell
you that,'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Angel Mark Langston (3-2) struggled in the loss for San
Diego, allowing six runs, eight hits and three walks in just 31/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored four runs on five hits in the first inning,
two of them on Gary Sheffield's 15th home run. Eric Young, who
missed the previous five games with a strained right quadriceps,
got a leadoff single, stole his league-leading 33rd base and scored
in the first. Young (2 for 3), who came out in the fourth inning
for precautionary reasons, said he felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers batted around in the fourth inning for the fourth
time this season and scored six runs on six hits to go up 10-0.
During their hit parade, Raul Mondesi's infield single pushed his
hitting streak to nine games, Eric Karros (2 for 2) drove in two
with a single and Bobby Bonilla (2 for 4) had a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are averaging 7.53 runs when Chan Ho Park (8-5)
pitches, the second-highest runs-per-outing behind a pitcher in the
league. The right-hander allowed one unearned run on three hits in
six innings to extend his home winning streak to 10 games, dating
to last July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to show San Diego how much we wanted to
win,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   With the game in hand, the Dodgers' Trenidad Hubbard helped
liven it up after hitting a two-run home run in the seventh that
put the Dodgers up by nine. While Hubbard watched the ball fly
toward the left-field bleachers, Padres pitcher Brian Boehringer
yelled at him to stop showboating.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy that doesn't hit home runs every day hits a home
run, he gets a little numb,'' said Hubbard, who also had a
career-high three hits and insisted he didn't hear Boehringer. ``I
was not trying to rub his nose in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Boehringer didn't comment, teammate Tony Gwynn said:
``If you don't want a guy to hit a ball out the park, hey, don't
throw a bad pitch. Trenidad hit it right on.''
</P>
<P>
   And at least Thursday, so did the rest of the Dodgers.

NEW JERSEY PANEL'S GOAL TO SPEED EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Jersey commission is expected to recommend Friday a series
of changes intended to speed up the pace of executions. The changes
include cutting out an entire level of state appeals and limiting
other appeals, designating specially trained judges to hear death
penalty cases and permitting the retrying of the penalty phase of a
trial if a jury cannot agree on imposing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the changes are passed by the legislature and signed
into law by Gov. Christie Whitman, they will likely face a series
of legal challenges by opponents of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Study Commission on the Implementation of the Death Penalty
is scheduled to hold its sixth and final hearing Friday in Trenton
to put the finishing touches on the recommendations. Its final
report will be sent to Whitman next month, almost a year to the day
after she called for a study to explain why the state ``had not
carried out the will of juries in even one instance'' where the
death penalty was voted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Zimmer, the former Republican congressman from
Lawrenceville and chairman of the commission, said the governor's
concerns were quite clear when she appointed the group last
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mandate was to make sure that those who merit the death
penalty get the death penalty,'' he said. ``We have tried to be
practical and base our recommendations on actual experience in the
16 years since the state enacted a death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the commission members will consider more
recommendations, including equalizing the number of peremptory
challenges to prospective jurors that prosecutors and defense
lawyers get. Currently, defense attorneys get 20 challenges to
prosecutors' 12.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said the group would also decide whether to suggest that
the legislature pass laws allowing convicted murderers who are
determined to be competent to choose to halt their appeals and
elect for immediate execution.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents and critics of the 16-member commission
accused the panelists of going beyond their mandate of devising
measures to expedite executions. They said that the commission had
actually sought to change the conduct of capital trials in order to
increase the number of death sentences imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, this was a politically motivated commission
that will not insure anything,'' said Cathy Waldor, a lawyer and
the only member of the commission who has said she is opposed to
the death penalty. ``I don't know why we are so obsessed with
killing people quickly. All this commission has done is proposed
changes in set procedures and guaranteed that we will have to
relitigate these things all over again causing even more delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the death penalty such as Bryan Stevenson, director
of the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit group in Montgomery,
Ala., that provides legal representation for death-row inmates, had
similar criticisms of the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds as if some politicians are unhappy about what juries
are saying about who should get the death penalty,'' Stevenson
said. ``They seem less concerned about improved procedures than
different results.''
</P>
<P>
   The state enacted its death penalty in 1982, 10 years after the
U.S. Supreme Court laid out the parameters for constitutional death
penalty statutes. It was not until 1987 that New Jersey's highest
court also upheld the state's death penalty law. But none of the 13
men and 1 woman sent to death row since then have actually been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   There are 38 states with death penalty laws, but in recent years
only 17 of them have actually had executions, according to
Stevenson. Those states are the ones, he said, that quickly passed
their own statutes shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling and
have had time for cases to work their way through appeals processes
that can take from 14 to 18 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey panel is likely to recommend the elimination of
the state-mandated ``proportionality review.'' It is one of three
levels of appeals available to death row inmates in which the
courts evaluate whether the sentence is consistent with sentences
for similar crimes and whether it is being applied fairly on the
basis of race and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said the courts' work was often ``very subjective'' in
comparing cases and he suggested that many of these considerations
could be dealt with in the other two appeal phases.
</P>
<P>
   The designation of specific judges to hear capital cases, he
said, was a recognition of the complexity of such cases. The
judge's manual devotes 300 pages to the proper conduct of death
penalty cases, said Zimmer, adding that special judges who were
more conversant with the rules could move them along more swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Waldor suggested that the motive for this change
was to reduce the errors trial judges often make in such cases and
which defense lawyers exploit on appeal.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: CAMBODIA'S STUNTED ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   It is not particularly surprising that as the July 26 election
day approaches in Cambodia, the campaign is dominated by the
dictator, Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   His party runs the local and national election commissions. His
image and propaganda monopolize the media except for a five-minute
daily ad permitted each opposition group. His supporters menace
opposition activists, especially in the countryside, and are
suspected of political killings. Yet the outside world is
pretending that an acceptably fair election can be held in this
climate of intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants have their own reasons for maintaining the
charade. Hun Sen wants approval from the international community.
After he staged a coup a year ago against his co-leader, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, the world cut off the foreign aid that forms
half of Cambodia's budget. The United Nations says that Cambodia's
U.N. seat still belongs to Ranariddh. Winning an election would
restore these and other international benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-party opposition has decided not to boycott the election,
in part due to pressure to participate from the European Union, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other international
groups. The EU and Japan have largely financed the registration
process and campaign infrastructure. The United Nations has already
sunk nearly $3 billion into Cambodia in the last few years. Many
diplomats say that Hun Sen is a reality to be recognized, and one
they prefer to his main adversary, the hapless and corrupt Prince
Ranariddh. The Clinton administration, which has wisely declined to
give the Hun Sen government any election money, still joins the
rest of the diplomatic world in whitewashing the process.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia would be best served by postponing its elections a few
months, until Hun Sen can be pressured into permitting a fair
campaign environment. But if the international community is
determined to go ahead, it must stop apologizing for a dictator and
describe conditions in Cambodia honestly. In their rush to
normalize relations, diplomats are becoming the dupes of a man who
has shown he is determined to retain power at all costs.

&HT;     EXPERTS TEAM UP TO GET NEW TRIALS IN WENATCHEE SEX CRIMES
CASE 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A skilled team of lawyers has formed to seek new trials for 16
people still in prison from the Wenatchee child sex-abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   They're national experts in police misconduct, mental health
abuse, civil rights and DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   They've fought and won some of the state's hottest legal
battles.
</P>
<P>
   They've gotten convictions overturned for scores of people
wrongly convicted of murder, rape and other major crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're teaming with law students and professors to
represent defendants in the Wenatchee cases.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Innocence Project Northwest, it may be the nation's
largest collection of free legal talent ever assembled for a single
effort: More than 40 lawyers who will meet Friday to take on
individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence and information that we've already collected
strongly indicate these people are innocent _ did not commit the
crimes they were imprisoned for,'' said Seattle lawyer Frederick
Leatherman, a project co-founder. ``It appears that none of these
people received justice as demanded by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Leatherman and Jackie McMurtie, a University of Washington law
lecturer, modeled the project after an operation at New York's
Cardozo Law School. The National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers has offered to cover some costs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 lawyers have signed up to work on the Wenatchee
cases, and others have expressed interest in joining, Leatherman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we not become involved?'' asked Julie Spector, a
Seattle lawyer. ``It's a situation that calls for immediate
attention from defense lawyers because it is just so outrageous.
These people were wrongly accused, wrongly prosecuted and
wrongfully convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Palmer, another Seattle lawyer, added: ``There are
serious issues and I was uncomfortable not doing anything to help.
These convictions need to be looked at again.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the volunteers are seasoned professionals with 15 to 20
years of experience. At least 22 have worked as public defenders,
six as prosecutors. At least three have argued cases before the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   A few work for huge law firms, but most are private
practitioners. Two, Mark Prothero of Seattle and Jeffery Swan of
Yakima, are public defenders. All will work on the project on their
own time.
</P>
<P>
   Swan said he somewhat surprised himself by volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a joiner, nor much of an activist, but what
happened with these defendants in Wenatchee just infuriated me and
I have to do something,'' said the young public defender.
</P>
<P>
   They come from across the state _ lawyers such as Garth Dano of
Moses Lake, James Dixon of Olympia, Ron Ness of Port Orchard and
Mark Muenster of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Their 16 clients are five women and 11 men, ages 26 to 66. Most
are serving 23-year sentences. They were among the 44 adults
arrested in Chelan and Douglas counties in the mid-'90s and charged
with 29,730 counts of rape and molestation of 60 children.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lawyers joining the Innocence Project already were
working with Wenatchee defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Nielsen, who with New York lawyer Robert Rosenthal is
guiding the appeal of Mark and Carol Doggett, is also collecting
evidence for an appeal on the behalf of Jeannie Bendt.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle lawyer Robert Van Siclen is representing Harold and
Idella Everett in their bid to win a new trial. He and Rosenthal
also have filed an appeal on the behalf of Manuel Hidalgo
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanna Lee Elliott of Seattle is developing an appeal for Doris
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Others will be assigned clients through the luck of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do some sort of lottery or pick names out of a hat to
see which client each lawyer will get,'' Leatherman said..
</P>
<P>
   Their work crafting appeals in hopes of convincing courts to
order new trials will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these 16 people are at the point where they have only
one chance left to present an argument to the court,'' Van Siclen
said. ``It becomes a massive challenge to pick the right issues,
with the right documentation, written in just the right words to
convince the court that a new trial is deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the joint effort is that many of the cases deal
with the same accusers _ two girls who, at the time, were foster
daughters of then-Wenatchee Detective Robert Perez _ who was the
investigator in most of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The same police reports, medical evidence, mental health
records, social service agency documents and personnel link almost
all the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working together, sharing information and resources, presents
a great benefit in allowing us to work these very similar cases
without everyone having to reinvent the wheel,'' explained
McMurtie.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal saw another advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this pool of experienced lawyers, the accused will
finally have power behind them that is nearly equal to the state.
The courtroom has been made into a level battle ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lawyers joined because they fear what happened in
Wenatchee is happening elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases involving children, more often then not, you are
facing the presumption of guilt, not the presumption of
innocence,'' said David Allen of Seattle. ``The rules are all
changed, and innocent people are sometimes convicted because of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenell Nussbaum, another Seattle lawyer, added that she hopes
knowledge gained by the lawyers will help defendants in other cases
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there are more innocent people in prison for child
sex-abuse than for any other charges,'' Nussbaum said. ``It's time
for our criminal justice system to find a way to correct the
injustices it has been creating.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal historians said it is extremely rare for so many
experienced lawyers to work simultaneously on a related case.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable efforts include defense of American Indians arrested
in the Wounded Knee protest in 1973 and the rush of young lawyers
to the South during the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At least four of those in the Wenatchee project cut their legal
teeth in one or both of those legal musters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the best tradition of our profession to help people
who need our services and can't afford to pay, and that is clearly
the case in Wenatchee,'' said Seattle lawyer David Marshall. ``It
is always more difficult to get the legal system to go back and fix
its mistakes. ''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wearing a black T-shirt to a meeting that was
anything but casual, S.I. Newhouse Jr. told uneasy staff members of
The New Yorker Thursday that the departure of his star editor, Tina
Brown, would not create precipitous changes at the magazine his
family owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a slight editorial problem,'' he jokingly acknowledged
to about 75 employees, as Ms. Brown chuckled nearby, having stunned
Newhouse with her resignation exactly 26{ hours earlier. But just
before an awkward kiss and embrace of Ms. Brown, he vowed not to
use the occasion of her replacement to redefine the nature of the
magazine, to change its weekly publication schedule, or to begin
cutting its famously expansive budget.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse gave no indication whom he is considering to succeed
Ms. Brown, according to several people who attended the meeting,
but said he planned to make the decision by next week. When he said
that no one in or out of the magazine had been ruled out, Susan
Orlean, a staff writer, brought down the house by raising her hand
and asking, ``Would you consider me?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlean said later that she would not really be submitting
her resume, but about 10 or 15 editors from around New York have
done so, several current and former employees said. Although Kurt
Andersen, the former editor of New York Magazine and currently a
New Yorker columnist, remains the front-runner in the rumor-driven
sweepstakes, Newhouse said only that he would make his selection
based on a gut instinct of who would make him both ``comfortable
and excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-minute staff meeting came a day after Ms. Brown announced
that she was leaving the magazine to start a company affiliated
with Miramax Films that would produce a new monthly magazine, as
well as books, films and television programming. To dispel rumors
about a growing tension between her and Conde Nast Publications,
which is owned by Advance Publications, she thanked Newhouse, the
chairman and chief executive of Advance, for his ``unflagging
support,'' both financially and emotionally, although several
employees said the warmth appeared to be for display purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was also attended by Steven T. Florio, chief
executive of Conde Nast, an appearance that was apparently designed
to downplay stories of hostility between him and Ms. Brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Ms. Brown invited a large group of magazine
writers and editors to her home for champagne and dessert Thursday
night, in what was described by those who attended as a thank-you
and goodbye party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown cried and hugged each of the writers and editors at
the party, which was attended by Hendrik Hertzberg, Joe Klein,
Roger Angell, Lillian Ross, Bill Buford and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Yorker has been the love of my life, but love can
often be painful,'' Ms. Brown told the gathering. ``Sometimes in
the last six months, I have felt so vulnerable and exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tears and sadness of the farewell party, staff members
talked of the intense camaraderie of the magazine and how many of
them had been brought there by Ms. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown is expected to lure several writers to her new,
still-unnamed magazine over the next year, but employees said that
was not the explicit purpose of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlean's facetious self-nomination had its serious side: the
job is so coveted, and so closely watched, because of the
enormously broad opportunity it allows an editor to put his or her
stamp on an influential magazine. Other magazines are about news or
fashion or music; The New Yorker is largely about its editor's
interests, and as a result, staff members said they were deeply
concerned about life after such a prominent cultural fixture as Ms.
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deepest anxiety was that he would now bring in some kind of
efficiency expert or cost cutter,'' said Roger Angell, the longtime
writer and editor at the magazine, who asked for and received an
assurance from Newhouse that such a person would not be appointed.
``It was good to hear him say that that was the furthest thing from
his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse, of course, could hardly be expected to promise an
editorial shakeup. But employees are acutely aware that the
magazine has lost more than $100 million in the 13 years since it
was purchased by Conde Nast Publications, and that the choice of a
successor could be determined by whether Newhouse still wants to
spend such sums on the magazine's expensively acquired marketplace
verve.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks Thursday were interpreted by many employees as an
indication that he does not plan to turn off the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not someone who believes in disinvesting from magazine
properties in a way that is likely to diminish their appeal,'' said
Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker. ``It's a
fantasy that you can just put on a green eyeshade and go from red
to black, and I think the last thing he would want to do is to do
anything that would jeopardize the quality and cachet of the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Wickenden, the magazine's executive editor, agreed that
the meeting reassured anxious staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a major turning point when there is a new editor
of an extremely important magazine,'' she said. ``But he was quite
clear that he intended to continue to publish an intelligent,
informed, serious magazine of culture and the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was less clear, however, whether a new editor would be
expected to share the particular interests Ms. Brown had brought to
the magazine since her arrival six years ago _ her fascination with
Hollywood and the celebrities of Washington, her enjoyment of
breaking news, her lavish use of graphics and photo spreads, all
but unheard of before her arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Though Finder said the magazine had a core identity, a
``genome'' that could not readily be changed, some people outside
the magazine questioned how much tradition could really be
preserved, noting that Ms. Brown's crusade to eliminate stodginess
from the magazine had already taken it far from its roots into
pop-cultural territory well-covered by other publications.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at this with extra scrutiny because Tina
Brown raised the stakes, the eyebrows, the volume of that job, so
that any change will be considered dramatic,'' said Daniel Menaker,
a former senior editor of The New Yorker who left in 1994 after 20
years and is now senior literary editor of Random House, which
Newhouse recently sold. ``With a magazine like Refrigeration
Monthly, you know it will always be about refrigerators. With The
New Yorker, it's a more plastic situation, which will be shaped
much more by its editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, however, in praising the talent and standards of the
magazine's writers and editors, said Thursday night that ``the
index of success is whether something survives beyond the person
who helps make it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new editor,'' she said, ``should be given the right to
make his own mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to succeed Ms. Brown took on an almost comic aspect
Thursday, with people in and out of the magazine handicapping long
lists of candidates based on their perceived closeness to Newhouse.
Some people mentioned friends' names, as a favor; others tried
desperately to avoid being mentioned. Those leading the various
lists included Andersen; writer David Remnick; Peter Kaplan, editor
of The New York Observer; Michael Kinsley, editor of the online
magazine Slate; Katrina Heron, editor of Wired, which was recently
purchased by Conde Nast; and Dominique Browning, editor of Conde
Nast's House &AMP; Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But probably not Susan Orlean, as she is the first to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everyone else in the world had been mentioned,
so I had to throw my name in, too,'' she said after the meeting
Thursday. ``With lists that long, it's just insulting if you don't
get mentioned.''

EPA CHIEF ATTACKS GE ADS ON HUDSON RIVER POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Clinton administration's top environmental
official said Thursday that an ongoing publicity campaign by the
General Electric Company playing down the health hazard from its
factories' pollution of the Hudson River ``could put people's
health at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner
accused the company of trying to confuse the public as part of a
broad effort to delay or limit the cleanup of tons of PCBs, or
polychlorinated biphenyls, that coat the river bottom for 200 miles
and make the Hudson the most extensive federal Superfund site in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the first of several hearings on the river
before the Environmental Conservation Committee of the New York
state Assembly, Ms. Browner said the company's efforts were
undermining state health advisories warning young women and
children to eat no fish from the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE would have the people of the Hudson River believe, and I
quote, `Living in a PCB-laden area is not dangerous,''' Ms. Browner
testified. ``Well, you know something? The science tells us the
opposite is true.'' Federal scientists say PCBs probably cause
cancer in people.
</P>
<P>
   The statement she quoted was made in May by GE chairman John
Welch during the company's annual shareholders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Ramsey, vice president for environmental programs at
General Electric, said in a telephone interview that the company
had compiled a long list of independent studies showing no link
between PCBs and human cancer, and that other studies questioned
any connection to other health effects, like disruption of
hormones. He said that Ms. Browner's appearance, in a forum without
any scientists on hand and no chance for hostile questions, ``is
politics, politics, politics.''
</P>
<P>
   GE's public relations campaign along the river has intensified
in the last two years, asserting that the risk of leaving the
chemicals in the silt is very low, while the risks and cost of
dredging the tainted bottom would be very high.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brodsky, the committee chairman and a Westchester County
Democrat, said company officials would testify before the panel
late in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky said the company was continuing to use science to
confuse, not clarify, the situation. ``As with any scientific
question there are always going to be ways to raise doubts,'' he
said. ``That's the same strategy the tobacco companies used for 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, GE and the federal government have been
tussling over how to deal with one million pounds of PCBs that two
of the company's factories, now closed, in Fort Edward and Glens
Falls, released into the Hudson over a 30-year period. .
</P>
<P>
   Before PCBs were banned in 1977, they were widely used in
industry and could be legally dumped into water. The compounds
persist in some 40 spots on the river bottom and in many types of
fish, including striped bass and catfish.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner said her agency would decide how to deal with the
PCBs in the Hudson by December 2000. For General Electric, hundreds
of millions of dollars are at stake _ both the potential cost of
widespread dredging of ``hot spots'' of PCB-tainted silt and the
cost of claims by the federal and state governments for damage to
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision on the Superfund site on the Hudson could
affect cleanups at many of the 74 other Superfund sites where GE is
responsible for some pollution.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Ms. Browner said that it was the first time she
had testified before any state legislative committee in her tenure
as Administrator, but that the cleanup of the Hudson was important
enough for her to come to New York to ``set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner said that more than 20 carefully reviewed studies
reinforced the position of her agency and federal health officials:
that PCBs are known to cause cancer in animals and are a probable
cause of cancer in people, and that they appear to have other
adverse health effects.

METS' FRANCO IS DISCIPLINED FOR CLASH WITH UMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco already had three days off that he did
not really want during the All-Star Game break. Thursday, he was
informed that he will probably have to take three more days off
sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the second half of the season, Franco, the
New York Mets' closer, was suspended for three games and fined
$1,500 for ``initiating contact with an umpire and personal
profanities directed towards an umpire,'' according to a statement
released by the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension stemmed from Franco's reaction to Umpire Angel
Hernandez's controversial game-ending call at home plate in the
11th inning of last Sunday's 3-2 loss in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Franco announced that he would appeal the suspension. A hearing
is likely next week. Until then, Franco will be available to pitch
out of a Mets bullpen that would be considerably diminished by his
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on anything yet,'' said Franco, who
had expected only to be fined.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips said he reviewed videotapes
of the argument showing Franco bumping Hernandez. But Phillips
sounded as if he felt that the suspension was a little harsh.
``It's tough,'' he said. ``Three games without your closer is not
insignificant. I think it's worthy of an appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation that Valentine would also be
suspended for his actions during the argument. But Phillips said
that the league president, Leonard Coleman, had told him
Valentine's ``efforts were to keep players away.''

JURY IN BRAWLEY DEFAMATION CASE ASKS TO BE SEQUESTERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see NY-COLUMN-BRAWLEY)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Showing concern about the scrutiny they are
under, the jurors in the Tawana Brawley defamation case asked
Thursday that they be sequestered.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice S. Barrett Hickman agreed, ordering
that they be sequestered after Thursday, their first full day of
deliberations. ``This is a trial and not a media event,'' he said,
without explaining whether jurors had been exposed to news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, who had previously resisted the suggestion of being
separated from their families, seemed to be settling into a
detailed examination of the evidence. But participants in the case
said it appeared that several of the jurors had been rattled by the
extensive attention to the case among their acquaintances when they
went home after the start of deliberations Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Hickman said a majority of the six jurors had agreed
Thursday that sequestration was now necessary. In addition, Hickman
said, one juror had requested that the courtroom sketch artists not
depict the jurors identifiably in the drawings that are used for
television coverage of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors' new attention to the public focus on their
deliberations came as a growing throng of reporters paced the
sidewalk just under the second-floor window of their deliberation
room in the Dutchess County Courthouse. Television transmission
trucks, which have rarely been seen since the early days of the
trial, in the fall, parked down the block awaiting a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   During the nearly eight months of the trial, the attention has
usually been on the lawyers; the plaintiff, Steven Pagones, or the
defendants, the Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   But as the focus shifted to the jurors, there were clear signs
that the panel was taking its responsibilities soberly, with a
touch of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, who began their deliberations Wednesday with several
requests for evidence in the case, Thursday sent 11 notes asking
for specific items or a rereading of certain testimony. When the
judge did not respond promptly, the jurors sent notes that
displayed irritation. ``Still waiting for Pagones testimony,'' said
one of the notes, after the jurors had asked a few hours earlier to
hear a portion of the plaintiff's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the case said the number of notes and the detail
of some of the requests showed that the jurors were digging in to a
thorough review of Pagones' assertion that the advisers defamed him
a decade ago. The advisers said he had raped and kidnapped Ms.
Brawley in 1987. He filed a lawsuit seeking millions of dollars in
damages after a grand jury exonerated him and discredited Ms.
Brawley's account in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones has long maintained that it was obvious that the
advisers took part in a hoax, and some of his supporters had
predicted that a verdict would come quickly. Supporters of the
defendants have said they believe that they benefit from long
deliberations, which could signal that the jurors are questioning
some of the fundamental assumptions of Pagones' lawsuit, like the
conclusions of the grand jury report.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's voluminous requests for information provided grist
for both mills. The jurors asked for testimony that the defendants
said could only benefit them, like testimony that suggested Pagones
might have lived near Ms. Brawley for a time before she claimed she
had been assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   But the jurors also asked to have the closing statement of
Pagones' lawyer, William Stanton, read to them. In that statement,
he branded the defendants ``evil men,'' and supporters of Pagones
contended that this request could be a prelude to a denunciation of
the advisers by the jurors. Justice Hickman said he could not have
a closing statement read again.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors' request for sequestration also brought differing
interpretations. Some participants in the case said it appeared
that four of the jurors wanted to be kept in a hotel and separated
from acquaintances simply to focus on the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Mason, who has long suggested that Pagones is tied to a
Dutchess County establishment that is hostile to the defendants,
said, ``They're concerned about not receiving undue pressure in
Dutchess County.''

DIRECTOR COPPOLA GETS $60 MILLION PUNITIVE AWARD VS. WARNER BROS.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola won a
$60 million jury award for punitive damages in his dispute with
Warner Bros., proving again that battling a celebrity in court is a
big gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood attorneys and industry analysts expressed
surprise that media giant Time Warner Inc. would risk going before
a jury against Coppola, a brand name for many moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a rule of thumb at the Los Angeles courthouse,'' said
entertainment attorney Pierce O'Donnell. ``Celebrities always
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The punitive award comes less than a week after the same Los
Angeles Superior Court jury awarded Coppola $20 million in
compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warner Bros. has traditionally not treated its creative people
well,'' Coppola said. ``Hopefully, this will teach them to treat
creative people as an asset, not as serfs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-winning director of ``Apocalypse Now'' and the
``Godfather'' trilogy had argued that Warner quashed his dream of
making a film version of ``Pinocchio'' with another studio.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. claimed Coppola reneged on a deal to make the film
with it. Studio officials called Thursday's verdict ``simply
ludicrous,'' and a spokesman said the media giant would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys and Hollywood industry insiders disagreed Thursday on
whether the enormous verdict will change the culture of making
movie deals with handshakes and oral agreements rather than written
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But most agreed that the case serves as yet another reminder
that celebrities hold enormous sway in the courthouses of America.
For this jury, the choice was between the corporate face of Warner
and the bearded, warm presence of Coppola, one of Hollywood's most
revered directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that when you take on a celebrity in court,
watch out,'' said entertainment lawyer Adam Miller. ``American
society is star-struck, and it's no different in downtown Los
Angeles than anywhere else in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Miller represented The Private Movie Co. Inc. in a
breach-of-contract lawsuit against ``Baywatch'' star Pamela
Anderson Lee. At the trial, the former Playboy centerfold came to
court in miniskirts and high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge took one look at her and her little dresses and it
was all over,'' Miller said. She was absolved of any liability.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Bibb, a media analyst with New York's Ladenberg Thalmann,
called Warner Bros.' legal strategy ``a big shock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never bet against Francis Ford Coppola on a jury
trial,'' he said. ``I think the poor oppressed artist will always
win out over the coldblooded corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, said they found the size of Thursday's verdict
shocking if not outrageous. Some legal analysts said they thought
the studio had a legitimate case against the famous director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coppola is no virgin,'' said entertainment lawyer Schuyler
Moore. ``He's not your typical sympathetic unemployed postal
worker. He's a big boy who knows how the game is played, so I am
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1991 when Warner Bros. bought a treatment of
Coppola's screenplay from his collaborator and threatened to take
any other studio to court if it tried to produce it. At the same
time, Warner refused to pay Coppola to develop the film.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola began negotiations with Columbia over his version of
``Pinocchio,'' which would have included computer-generated and
stop-motion animation.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia was warm to Coppola's proposal but dropped it in 1994,
a move the director said came as a result of Warner Bros.' threats.
</P>
<P>
   J. Larson Jaenicke, a Warner Bros.' attorney, said the movie had
an estimated $100 million budget, and that no studio was willing to
gamble that much on the film.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood insiders predicted that Thursday's verdict would
change some basic business practices in the industry. Among the
possible effects: Studios might think twice before aggressively
asserting their rights over a project when they don't have a signed
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``One potential positive effect will be that this common
practice in Hollywood of sending threatening lawyer letters will
cause people to pause and think of the Coppola case,'' O'Donnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others predicted that studios will make more of an effort to get
everything in writing at the beginning of a project. Still, in a
world where creative types strike deals over martinis at Westside
watering holes like the Polo Lounge, drawing up a detailed contract
isn't always the most practical thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have creative people who really don't care that much about
the legal end,'' Miller said. ``That's even true from the studio
side, although they're getting better about it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not every celebrity who winds up in court emerges
victorious. In one of Hollywood's more notorious civil disputes, a
jury in 1993 ordered actress Kim Basinger to pay $8.9 million for
backing out of a starring role in the movie ``Boxing Helena.'' An
appeals court later overturned the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Basinger's husband, Alec Baldwin, is expected to testify next
week in a civil trial in Van Nuys Superior Court. Tabloid
photographer Alan Zanger is suing the star of ``The Hunt for Red
October'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' for an assault that he claims
occurred in a scuffle outside Baldwin's suburban Woodland Hills
home.
</P>
<P>
   In opening statements Thursday, Zanger's lawyer seemed to
acknowledge that his client faced an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not about who is better-looking, Mr. Zanger or
Mr. Baldwin,'' attorney Leonard Steiner told the jury. ``I think
one look will tell you Mr. Baldwin is better-looking.''

NEW BOARD MEMBER'S EDUCATIONAL ODYSSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Terri Thomson's new constituents, the 1.1 million
students who attend New York City public schools, may be interested
to learn that she often spends her free moments as they do,
cramming for exams. Not in algebra or social studies, mind you, but
in courses like Protest Movements, Neighborhoods, and Urban
Planning.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being one of two new members of the New York City Board
of Education, and a longtime vice president of community affairs at
Citibank, Ms. Thomson, 49, is a college student six credits away
from a bachelor's degree at Queens College. Her dual major is
political science and urban studies, with a minor in sign language,
and she hopes to graduate in February.
</P>
<P>
   Her grade point average? 3.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew it,'' she says, ``I was 4.0 for the longest time.''
</P>
<P>
   In embarking on a four-year term as a caretaker of and advocate
for the country's largest school system, Ms. Thomson possesses
little firsthand knowledge of life within public schools. She
attended parochial schools, including Bishop Riley High School in
Queens and the Thorpe Secretarial School, a now-defunct Roman
Catholic school in Manhattan, from which she graduated in 1966. Her
two daughters followed a similar route, in what she calls ``a
personal decision'' that was ``not a reflection at all on our
neighborhood schools'' in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   But what does seem to qualify Ms. Thomson for the board, in
addition to two decades as a backstage player inside the city's
political theaters, is an empathy for those navigating the dead
ends and extended detours of the educational process.
</P>
<P>
   She contends that her own educational odyssey _ interrupted by
marriage, family and then work, but ultimately resumed at night and
on weekends a decade ago _ gives her unique standing to inspire a
system from which less than half of the students graduate in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going slowly, taking my time, fitting it into my
schedule,'' Ms. Thomson said of her college experience the other
night, in a telephone call from the weekend home in the Adirondacks
that she shares with her husband, Ed, an electrician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look back,'' she added. ``I love going to school. I
think I will go to school the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomson says that the mind-set that will light her way
through 110 Livingston Street, the board's labyrinthine
headquarters in Brooklyn, has been influenced by many passages in
her life. They include helping her daughters, 26 and 23, acquire
the skills to graduate from Williams College and Boston College;
stitching together a coalition of parents at the Electchester Co-op
in Flushing in the early 1970s to rebuild a rundown playground;
building on that experience to attend to constituent concerns in
the 1980s as the district administrator for Rep. Gary Ackerman, a
Democrat from northern Queens, and being the public face of
Citibank since the early 1990s in meetings with small-business
owners and politicians within the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the element of her background that has most tantalized
officials at City Hall, and most unnerved those within the inner
circle of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, is that she is the daughter
of a policeman, Albert Farrell, who retired in 1978 after 25 years.
The first major decision that Ms. Thomson will probably have to
make is to declare her stance on the mayor's bid to give the police
more responsibility for school safety.
</P>
<P>
   After being stymied for three years by Crew and an unwavering
four-member majority on the seven-member board, Giuliani is now
presented with a wild card in Ms. Thomson. She replaces Carol
Gresser, one of the most vocal opponents of expanding the police
role, and Ms. Thomson has said she has yet to decide on a position.
With no shortage of advocates seeking her vote, she says she still
needs to spend more time studying the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if growing up in a police officer's home would predispose
her, Ms. Thomson spoke cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a proposal on the table,'' she said, ``I'll look
at it and and see what questions I might have and make an informed
decision based on the outreach that I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who takes her vote for granted would do well to
consider her position on publicly financed vouchers that would
benefit the same parochial schools she and her children attended.
She opposes them, saying that more investment, not less, is needed
for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomson's evenhandedness and modesty are among the qualities
that prompted Queens Borough President Claire Shulman to tap her to
succeed Ms. Gresser.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, a political ally of Ms. Shulman's, said of Ms.
Thomson: ``I think she probably gets embarrassed when her name is
in the paper. At least she used to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a workhorse,'' he added, ``not a show horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Floyd Flake, who resigned from Congress last year after
11 years representing Jamaica, Queens, said he appreciated Ms.
Thomson's keen ear for people's concerns. He recalled Citibank's
decision not long ago to replace the tellers at its Rochdale branch
with bank machines. When Ms. Thomson learned that older people in
the neighborhood were terrified of entrusting their life savings to
such technology, she prevailed on the bank to install a customer
service representative to guide them through the first six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of flexibility,'' Flake said, ``will be very helpful
to her as a member of the board, which can be a place where people
dig deep into the cement and are sometimes intractable.''

EDITORIAL: BULLETS DESIGNED TO MAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Police Department's decision to switch from
conventional full-metal-jacketed bullets to more lethal
hollow-point bullets is regrettable. The hollow-point bullets,
which expand when they enter flesh, are banned as inhumane in
warfare by the Geneva Conventions because they cause great damage
to internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Police Department can show that conventional bullets
are inadequate to protect public safety, there is no reason to
switch to a type of ammunition that can result in more severe
injuries for suspects, bystanders and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced the
same change, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani delayed the action. A
subcommittee of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent
agency that monitors police conduct, has now recommended the use of
hollow-point bullets because they are somewhat less likely to
ricochet or pass through objects to hit bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever benefit these bullets offer in terms of ricochet
capacity is outweighed by the damage they would do to bystanders
who are hit directly. Former Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly
cautioned against the use of hollow-point bullets in 1994 because
one-fifth of the officers shot were wounded with their own guns or
by other officers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, simply firing deadlier bullets will not bring down
suspects when accuracy is poor. About 80 percent of shots fired by
police in shootouts around the country miss their targets.
</P>
<P>
   A better way to increase safety is to insure that officers can
actually hit what they aim at. That takes target practice, not a
new brand of deadlier ammunition.

STEINBRENNER FOES SEE HOPE IN RECENT WORDS ON STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>

 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After squabbling for weeks over the future home of
the Yankees and its repercussions on life in the city, some
prominent politicians tried to project a more conciliatory spirit
Thursday in response to a highly tentative peace offering by the
team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said Wednesday that he would consider keeping the
team in the Bronx if attendance reaches record levels and could be
guaranteed to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Steinbrenner's antagonists in the fight over the stadium,
City Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer, reacted to Steinbrenner's unexpected overture by
inviting him to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to meet with George Steinbrenner any time, any place
to discuss the responsible things the borough, the city, the state
and the Yankees together must do to improve attendance, even beyond
an all-time high,'' Ferrer said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Ferrer, Vallone and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ who
says his primary goal is to keep the team somewhere in the city _
said they were encouraged, Steinbrenner took no steps Thursday to
explain further his idea about guaranteeing attendance of 3 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   That total is about 6 percent more than the team is on pace to
draw this year and 14 percent more than its previous record.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has sought a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan,
contending that his team cannot flourish financially in the Bronx
because people worry about its crime and traffic. Vallone and
Ferrer want to block such a move.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Steinbrenner has appeared to be on the
defensive over the stadium, as Vallone has tried to rally
opposition to a Manhattan site by putting a referendum on the
November ballot that would bar the city from spending money on such
a project.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have the best record in baseball and are on the way
to setting an attendance record as well, with the total number of
fans for the season projected to reach 2.83 million. ``Do the 3
million, and then we'll talk about the Bronx after the season,''
Steinbrenner said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By saying, even with many caveats, that he is willing to
consider staying in the Bronx, Steinbrenner may have been trying to
immunize himself from attacks that he is an irrational opponent of
the existing stadium. Because the attacks have hurt his effort to
gain a new stadium in Manhattan, parrying them would be useful even
if he has no intention of remaining in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has often contended that a West Side stadium would
be very successful, said in a radio interview that if attendance in
the Bronx remained robust, it would help persuade the Yankees to
stay there, though he did not address whether the city would agree
to guarantee a certain number of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance guarantees have proven to be controversial in other
cities where they have been used, and none of the three officials
ventured Thursday to say how one would work, including how much
money the city would have to pay in penalties if fans started
shunning the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Vallone, while expressing optimism about the
possibility of new discussions, could not resist taking another dig
at Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ask the city to guarantee 3 million fans is like asking
George Steinbrenner to guarantee 100 wins every year,'' Vallone
said in a statement. ``But at least we are finally talking about
keeping the Yankees in the Bronx.''

STATE OVERSIGHT PANEL DISBANDS AND LEAVES YONKERS ON ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ Twenty-three years after a State Emergency
Financial Control Board first took over Yonkers' finances, the
board declared Thursday that the city could now take care of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member board, in unanimously voting to disband itself,
cited the city's balanced budget during the last three years, its
healthy four-year fiscal projections and its commitment to pay back
debts to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the opportunity to begin a new chapter in Yonkers'
history,'' said state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who was a member
of the control board. The State Comptroller will continue as the
city's fiscal agent until 2018, monitoring Yonkers' finances and
insuring that its budget, now $253 million, continues to remain
balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Spencer said, ``This is the best government meeting
I've ever attended.''
</P>
<P>
   The first control board in Yonkers was set up in 1975 in
response to the city's financial problems, which included improper
budget, finance and accounting practices that left it unable to
market its bonds. The board was disbanded in 1978, but brought back
in 1984, when the city was near bankruptcy and was so short of
money that it risked having to close its schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yonkers' finances were further strained by the battle over a
federal court order to desegregate the city's housing and its
schools. In 1988, after the City Council refused to comply with the
housing aspect of the case, the presiding judge, Leonard Sand of
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, imposed fines on Yonkers that
began at $100 a day and were to double each weekday.
</P>
<P>
   The control board imposed a hiring freeze and made plans for
drastic cuts as the fines mounted. The Council ultimately accepted
the housing plan and paid $819,000 in fines; the battle also cost
the city an estimated $15 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the shackles were removed,'' said Nicholas DeSantis, who
was city manager at the time of the desegregation battle. ``I saw
them when they came. It's nice to see them go.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, a state board was placed in control of the finances of
New York City, which was on the brink of bankruptcy. That board
concluded its oversight role 11 years later and now serves in an
advisory capacity, an arrangement that will stay in effect until
2008.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said he would propose in next year's budget a
correction to the schedule of state aid payments that had
contributed to the Yonkers' cash flow problem for 20 years. Since
Pataki took office three years ago, state aid to Yonkers has almost
doubled, to $70.2 million this year from $37.2 million in fiscal
year 1995-96. Although a portion of its $16 million debt to Albany
was forgiven, the city has agreed to repay the state $11.1 million
as part of the agreement to disband the oversight board.

COURT BARS NYC FROM AWARDING CONTRACTS TO BIDDERS OTHER THAN
LOWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state's highest court ruled Thursday that New
York City's more than century-old practice of awarding some
contracts to companies when they are not the lowest bidders was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which overturned the decisions of a trial court and
a lower appellate court, came in a complex case involving street
repair contracts, the area where the city most frequently
circumvents the low-bid requirement. The court threw out the
mechanism that the city uses for awarding some of those contracts,
under which the city and private utility companies like
Consolidated Edison and Bell Atlantic jointly seek bids for fixing
streets.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that government contracts be awarded to ``the
lowest responsible bidder,'' but it gives New York City an
exemption. In a 5-2 decision Thursday, the state Court of Appeals
ruled that when voters adopted a new city charter in 1989, the city
lost its exemption and must adhere to the low-bid rule.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved four contracts worth about $100 million,
though the court ruling could affect hundreds of millions of
dollars a year in contracts. Most of the city's street repair
contracts would not be affected, however, because they do not
involve utility work.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling takes away from the mayor one of the broader powers
granted him under the new charter, albeit one that the city's
lawyers say Mayors David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani had used
sparingly. The charter allows the mayor to choose someone other
than the lowest bidder for a city contract if the mayor declares it
to be ``in the best interest of the city,'' placing no other
restrictions on that power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani's office did not return repeated telephone calls
seeking comment on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Finkelman, deputy chief of the commercial and real estate
litigation division in the city corporation counsel's office, said,
``One of the options we're exploring is state legislation to
remedy'' the loss of the city's exemption. He added that the city
``has had this authority to bypass the low bid since 1853, in one
form or another.''
</P>
<P>
   The city contended in court that the way it awarded
utility-related contracts made for faster, less troubled street
repairs, which the court acknowledged might be true.
</P>
<P>
   But the court concluded that the practice raised the cost of
street repair to taxpayers, because the city was not always taking
the lowest bidder. More importantly, the judges said, it raised the
specter of corruption, though they stressed that there was no
suggestion that the city had intentionally done any wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive bidding statutes are intended to guard against
the opportunity for fraud,'' Judge Joseph Bellacosa wrote for the
court majority. That the city's practice ``opens the door to fraud
is plain to see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Vito Titone, George Bundy Smith, Howard A. Levine and
Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick concurred.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting judges, Chief Judge Judith Kaye and Judge Richard
Wesley, ruled in the city's favor on different legal grounds, and
did not take up the issue of whether the mayor could legally bypass
the lowest bid.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Mollen, a former deputy mayor and former Appellate
Division judge, argued the appeal for Diamond Asphalt Corp., a
company that was denied contracts under the city's bid system. He
said the significance of the decision lay in the court's
invalidation of the mayor's power to bypass the low-bid
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important,'' Mollen said, ``because it takes
away what was really too much power in the hands of an individual,
without any checks and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Asphalt did not seek money damages in the case. Mollen
said he doubted that bidders who lost out under the now-banned
system had a valid claim for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old city charter, a two-thirds vote of the city's
Board of Estimate could bypass the low bid requirement. The state
law requiring government to accept the low bid makes an exception
for longstanding local rules like the one in the old charter.
</P>
<P>
   The new charter did away with the Board of Estimate and gave the
mayor the power to bypass the lowest bid. The city asserted in
court that this was permitted because it was just a continuation of
the old rule.
</P>
<P>
   When a contractor repairs a street, it potentially endangers the
web of telephone, electric, natural gas and other lines under the
asphalt. So when the city hires a contractor to dig up a street, it
sometimes requires that the utilities hire a contractor, too, to
either safeguard their lines or move them until the work is done.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities have long found that the easiest and cheapest way
to do that was to hire the same contractor that the city did. The
utilities also contend that, knowing this, contractors, on winning
city contracts, would then charge the utilities inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say that system often slowed the work, in part
because of frequent contract squabbles between utilities and
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the city and the utilities adopted a new system for
street repairs where utilities were involved. For each job, the
city would request a single bid _ the street work, plus the utility
work _ and have the utilities reimburse the city for their part of
the work.
</P>
<P>
   But contractors complained that often the lowest bidder for the
street work, the part the city would pay, was not the lowest bidder
over all and so was denied the contract. A group of companies that
lost out on street repair contracts that way filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The city made two arguments in its defense. First, it said the
entire contract, including the part paid for by the utilities,
could be regarded as ``public work,'' and so joining them and
choosing the lowest overall bidder was acceptable. And second, it
said that even if the first argument were wrong, the mayor had the
power to bypass the lowest bid.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting judges accepted the city's broad definition of
``public work.'' But the court majority rejected both of the city's
arguments.

Brazil Makes Practice Of `Beautiful Game' 
 By BRUCE JENKINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France _ I've probably spilled more drinks
and hors d'oeuvres than any six of my friends put together over the
years. And to think: If Dunga had been around, none of it would
have hit the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup magic of Brazilian feet was never more evident
than Thursday, at this remote countryside location some 40 miles
east of Paris. This is the Brazilians' training camp for the
tournament, and it is a place of many wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Watching these guys play among themselves, in relative privacy,
would be something like hanging around the 17-year-old Cassius Clay
as he worked the bag. Sitting in a corner of the North Carolina
gymnasium as Michael Jordan shot alone. Leaning against a tree in
some woodsy park as Joe Montana threw down-and-outs to Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   I almost didn't find this precious slice of soccer heaven, but
as always, I had help.
</P>
<P>
   As the train whisked away, I was a solitary figure on the ramp;
nobody in either direction. The directions were a little blurry
from this point on. The weather was turning cool, a brisk wind
rustling through the trees under a heavy overcast. Rain seemed
imminent, and I didn't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Walking out of the station in any old direction, I suddenly
heard the single most important clue for any Brazilian soccer fan:
the pounding of drums. They were distant, like the high school
rat-a-tat on a football Friday night when you're several blocks
away. But it was all I needed. With the Brazilians come music,
fanaticism and a full-on bash. They will travel to Mars, as well,
if the World Cup ever goes there.
</P>
<P>
   After about a mile's walk, I arrived at a tiny, charming complex
with about 20 rows of bleacher seats. The place was packed with
Brazilians who had paid their way in. It's just an ordinary pitch,
home to a third-division team in normal times, but the grass was
deep green and immaculate, as it had to be. The best soccer team in
the world was here.
</P>
<P>
   At the top row of the ``press'' section, if you could call it
that, a number of Brazilian radio crews were fully set up.
Incredibly, they would be broadcasting the action back home. It was
just a scrimmage, a bunch of guys running around with nothing at
stake _ but in the soccer-mad towns of Brazil, it is paradise just
to hear the names: Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cesar Sampaio, Dunga, Bebeto.
It is a language all its own.
</P>
<P>
   The fans wore jerseys of all these men, to say nothing of
Taffarel, Roberto Carlos and Denilson. This isn't like the
vicarious hoops thrill in Asia, Europe or Africa, where everyone in
a jersey is Jordan (OK, maybe the occasional Dennis Rodman, for
that kid who's just a little different). A good Brazilian team
always will spread the wealth. I even saw a Romario jersey, in
honor of the '94 World Cup star who was left off this year's team.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo is the youngest-looking sports deity I have ever seen.
Magic Johnson, Jean-Claude Killy, Greg LeMond and Rod Laver never
looked this young. Jim Brown was  &LR; never  &LR; young. The gap-toothed
Ronaldo looks like a kid who got a chance to run around with the
great ones for a day. That's all he did Thursday, by the way _ run
around. He did many laps in a slow jog around the perimeter, then
disappeared down a runway. He can do that, because he's Ronaldo,
and apologies to the kids. He's not taking BP today.
</P>
<P>
   As if it even mattered. I couldn't keep my eyes off Dunga, the
tough-guy midfielder and veteran of three World Cups. In this
playful scene he was a comedian, performing Globetrotter-like
miracles with his feet. He wouldn't just catch that fallen shrimp
or Heineken; he'd deliver it right back to your hand, with a little
wink in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hands, one wonders: In a game where they might as
well be amputated, do they go stale on you? Could Rivaldo flip a
bottlecap or fancy-deal a deck of cards? Do these guys eat like the
ancient Vikings, hurling slabs of beef across the table?
</P>
<P>
   I got my answer from Sampaio, who picked up a ball, sent it
spinning on the tip of his middle finger, then watched it revolve
like a top, forever. I got it from Taffarel, the goalkeeper, making
artful catches with one hand. In the tense desperation of a game,
keepers perform time-it-or-die punches or two-armed wraparounds, as
if an infant child was heading their way. In the casual atmosphere
of practice, I saw many Fred Biletnikoffs.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the Brazilians reminded me of children. They
had a dozen little games going, to the accompaniment of laughter
and playful roughhousing. One game sends a loose player into the
middle of an 11-man ring, all of them clasping hands. He only has
to make a touch, to stop the flow, but with these guys, he was like
a miniature man dropped into a pinball machine. The ball movement
was blinding.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is often called ``the beautiful game,'' and in a
Brazilian practice, purity shines forth. Now free of the relentless
diving and tackling, the many fits and starts, it becomes an
uninhibited expression of freedom and personality. It's like a
dance floor out there, really, and we all know what that means. The
good dancers get the space, the respect and the girls. I'm one of
those guys who needs two or three kicks to get the Sunday paper
down the driveway, but if you've grown up with the game, like a
million kids in Brazil, the sight of these cavorting legends must
be magical.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil vs. France: Could Sunday's final get any better? The
Chicago Bulls of soccer against the host nation, all giddy and
fascinated with itself. I'll never forget the sight of the
jam-packed Champs-Elysees the other night, and what it meant for so
many thousands of French people to celebrate together. But I'll
take Thursday's memory along, too. The Brazilians truly make it a
beautiful game.

Curtain Rises, A's Fall  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ That was far more than a ballgame Thursday at
the Coliseum. President Sandy Alderson raised the bar for his team
over the All-Star break, railing against local media for slighting
the A's impressive four-game winning streak to close out the first
half.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alderson was taking a calculated gamble with his talk of a
conspiracy against his team. If he demanded more attention, and his
team played well, he could expect more coverage _ and presumably
more fan interest.
</P>
<P>
   If he yelled at everyone to look at his team, and what they saw
was a team finding a way to lose, that wouldn't leave him any
better off.
</P>
<P>
   One game into a crucial, 11-game homestand that will determine
whether Alderson's outburst was smart, or just good for his blood
pressure, the verdict is: Maybe another day of obscurity wouldn't
have been such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   The A's wasted another beautiful outing from staff ace Kenny
Rogers, who left after eight innings with the score tied 1-1. Texas
rallied for three runs in the top of the ninth against closer Billy
Taylor, helped by catcher Mike Macfarlane's throwing error, and won
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitches as well as he could pitch, and we come up dry,''
manager Art Howe said. ``It's a shame to waste that kind of
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has given up at least one run in four of his past five
outings, but it's hard to heap too much blame on him for Thursday's
ugly ninth. Pinch-hitter Tom Goodwin led off the inning with a slap
single to right, then stole second and took third on the play when
Macfarlane's throw bounced and skipped behind the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark earned a walk, but then Taylor struck out Juan
Gonzalez, the man with 101 RBIs, and got Ivan Rodriguez to smack a
hard-hit ball up the middle that looked like it would be an
inning-ending (and tie-preserving) double play. Instead, it caromed
off Taylor and into right field and the Rangers had the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the groundball, it's just too bad it bounced off his
foot,'' Howe said. ``Luck wasn't in our corner today.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Giant John Burkett held the A's to one run on a Rickey
Henderson single to score Jack Voigt in the sixth. Rogers held his
old team to three hits over eight innings. Mike Simms' solo shot in
the third was the only damage and Rogers' ERA dropped to 3.05.
</P>
<P>
   The game proves nothing about how the A's (41-46) will fare over
the next three games against the Rangers (49-39), the team ahead of
them in the American League West, or against the first-place Angels
the next two games after that. The A's have bounced back well from
bad losses before, and besides, this was a noon start the first
game back from the three-day All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we were all on a four-day holiday, instead of a
three-day holiday,'' Matt Stairs said. ``Both teams were
sluggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Howe: ``We don't have the luxury of letting it set in on
you. Tomorrow's another day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the A's have made it much harder to start the second half
strong and elbow their way into contention in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Rangers have gotten past the A's ace, they get to
see how Tom Candiotti (5-10, 5.33) and Blake Stein (3-5, 6.52) fare
against the league's most explosive offense Friday night and
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, the A's lost their first five games after the
break and did so by an average margin of more than four runs per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Either team could have pulled out Thursday's game in the ninth,
so there's no reason to think history will repeat itself.

SETTLEMENT EXPOSES BUS DRIVER'S LONG RECORD OF VIOLENCE TOWARD
PASSENGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Supervisors kept bus driver David Smith behind
the wheel for seven years despite his failing a drug test and
drawing 27 passenger complaints -- including that he shoved a
toddler and punched a rider.
</P>
<P>
   Now Smith has cost taxpayers $225,000 to settle a lawsuit
brought by 79-year-old Louis Ross, who claimed Smith hit and choked
him, causing injuries that cost him $10,000 in medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said
Thursday that he recommended a settlement in late May because the
agency was too vulnerable over its demonstrated failure to protect
the public in that case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operator's history was the major concern,'' said Phil
Miller, deputy Los Angeles County counsel overseeing MTA operations
litigation. ``The agency has responsibility for the safety of
passengers on its buses.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA board approved the payout June 25 in closed session.
Members did not call for an investigation of the case, nor were
they provided with a detailed explanation of what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   However, board members were ``aghast and outraged,'' said Glenda
Wina, spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke, who chairs the operations committee and was
briefed on the meeting. Burke was out of the office and unavailable
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   MTA board member and Glendale Councilman Larry Zarian, who did
not attend the session, said the facts in the case implicate MTA
supervisors who allowed what he termed ``a cancer'' to remain in
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything was in fact in his record, then someone was
neglectful,'' Zarian said. ``He continued to work and a supervisor
did not pay attention. That's not acceptable in my mind. The
reprimand should be of the person who kept him on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, he added, is ``Why did they keep him?''
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials declined to respond, saying information about
Smith is confidential because it is a personnel matter. Such
confidentiality extends to all cases, whether or not the public's
welfare is at stake, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also declined to disclose whether any MTA supervisors
were disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly view what this operator did as an unfortunate
incident, but not typical of our bus drivers,'' said MTA spokesman
Ed Scannell. ``Our policy is not to discuss individual employment
histories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News first described how the 79-year-old Ross was
beaten by Smith as part of a broader review of violent bus drivers
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   MTA records documented about 100 incidents during a five-year
span in which operators were implicated in passenger beatings,
assaults on motorists and other serious on-duty crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Former transit police officers provided anecdotal evidence that
the MTA's discipline was uneven, and that some complaints either
weren't thoroughly investigated or that the agency played favorites
with drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement documents in the Ross case show how the MTA
reacted to a driver with repeated allegations of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 27 passenger complaints beginning in February 1988,
Smith continued driving. In that span, he was accused of shoving a
2-year-old child, physically ejecting three minors from his bus and
punching a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately slowed him down -- but didn't stop him -- was
failing a drug test ordered after he was suspended in September
1992 after a ``physical altercation'' with two women passengers,
the settlement states.
</P>
<P>
   He was discharged, but a successful appeal put him back behind
the wheel a year later, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Ross contended that the MTA either was aware or
should have been aware of Smith's propensity to use physical force
on passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he had waited 15 minutes for a bus Nov. 18, 1995, at
Temple and Rampart streets when Smith pulled up but didn't open the
doors because he was talking with a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who is hearing-impaired and of diminutive stature, began
to knock on the doors. When they opened, he asked -- Smith said he
shouted -- what had taken so long.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Smith got out of his seat and hit Ross,
``causing him to fall backward into the handrail,'' the settlement
states. ``(Smith) then shook Mr. Ross and grabbed him by the
throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who could not be reached for comment, suffered cuts,
bruises and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who also could not be reached for comment, pleaded no
contest to a battery charge and served six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The County Counsel's Office said it never asked MTA officials
why they kept Smith on the payroll, but left no doubt that their
failure was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe a court or jury would find the bus operator
assaulted Louis Ross on the bus,'' the settlement states. ``The MTA
will be strictly liable for such conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldy Norton, spokesman for the United Transportation Union,
said that while most bus drivers are professional, ``several may
not be the greatest people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to the MTA to make sure the public is protected, he
said, citing rules that allow the agency to dismiss drivers for an
array of offenses, including ignoring directions to ``deal with
customers in a polite and professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Discipline, that's their obligation,'' Norton said.

cheering wildly outside the company's headquarters along the

still no union at the shipyard. The 50,000 pages of documents
stacked in the offices of the National Labor Relations Board are
evidence of what happened instead, producing one of the longest,
most heavily litigated unionization fights in the board's history.

question them about theft, arson and the disappearance _ or murders
_ of at least three people. Police finally tracked them down Sunday
in New York, arresting them at the New York Hilton on a Utah
warrant for writing a bogus check. But one last time, investigators
now fear, they were just hours too late. It was only after the

saw what he did, but God did and He's not going to forget,'' she
told the court and her father. ``So if you think it's over today,
it's not, because your day is still coming. You're burning in hell
for what you did.'' But on Wednesday, Stacey and her father, Joseph
Hoehmann, hugged jubilantly in a hallway of the same courthouse and
were joined in the embrace by Stacey's mother, Kelly Hoehmann. What
set off this dramatic reversal was a startling letter Ms. Hoehmann,

reporters following him on the campaign trail that the newly
minted, minority-owned metal-processing company was proof that
``the American dream can still come true.'' Trouble is, the
privately held Steeltech is no dream come true for its investors or
for customers who had to provide cash and other concessions to keep
it afloat. By Barnaby J. Feder.

   FRENCH-ART-REVIEW (Washington) _ Art exhibitions that resemble
art history seminars often do so at their peril. Full of wordy text
panels, such shows can swamp the viewer with extraneous information
or make interesting points that one would rather encounter in book
form, sitting down. But every pitfall has escapees carefully
skirting its brink. Curators are becoming increasingly skilled at
mixing and matching artworks and ancillary material to conjure up
the times, places and personalities that produced those artworks.
There are growing numbers of shows in which words and pictures
share the wall to mutually illuminating effect, so that looking and
reading become one, or close to it. A rewarding example is ``Manet,

EXPOS DEFEAT METS, 9-8 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day began with bad enough news, with the New York
Mets learning that their closer, John Franco, had been suspended
for three games because of his angry outburst at the umpires at the
end of last Sunday's disputed extra-inning loss to the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   And the day ended with Franco a double loser, as he took the
defeat in an unbelievably ugly 9-8 11-inning loss to the Montreal
Expos. If Franco had known how Thursday night's game would turn
out, he might have decided not to appeal his suspension after all.
</P>
<P>
   For Franco and the Mets it was a miserable way to begin the
second half of the season. The winning run came on Rondell White's
two-out single to left that skipped off Rey Ordonez's glove. Only
minutes before, Todd Pratt had led off the bottom of the 10th for
the Mets with a double. But after Edgardo Alfonzo failed to bunt
Pratt over, he hit a fly ball to right field on which Pratt tagged
up and went to third. The only trouble was that Pratt left the base
long before the ball was caught. The Expos appealed, and Pratt was
out.
</P>
<P>
   So it went for the Mets (44-40), who have now dropped eight of
their last 10 games and may need more than the return of Todd
Hundley on Sunday night to get them playing good baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Neither pitching staff seemed content with a lead on Thursday
night. The Expos blew three of them, the Mets coughed up two, all
while both teams were surrendering 34 hits. Over all, it was a
sloppy affair for both teams, who combined for four errors (two
apiece), not to mention a balk, a passed ball and another
base-running gaffe, by the Mets rookie Benny Agbayani, who fell
down on a botched hit-and-run play in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a month,'' said Mike Piazza, mindful that the Mets have
gone 13-20 since June 1. ``Every mistake we make is hurting us bad.
You hate to start the second half on a note like this. What can you
say? It's frustrating. It really is. You figure we scored enough
runs to win that game. We're just not getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied from deficits of 2-0, 5-3 and finally, 8-7.
They scored a run in the third, two in the fourth, three in the
fifth, one in the sixth and one more in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   And the two players who stand to lose the most playing time when
Hundley arrives in the outfield tomorrow evening _ Bernard Gilkey
and Butch Huskey _ each delivered important hits in the first three
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey batted leadoff for the second time this season and
doubled in Ordonez, who tied his career high with four hits, for
the Mets' first run. The shot came within inches of clearing the
fence in left-center for a game-tying two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey and Ordonez singled in runs in the fourth to give Bobby
Jones a brief 3-2 lead. But Jones, who had allowed solo homers to
F.P. Santangelo leading off the game and Vladimir Guerrero with two
out in the third, contributed greatly to Montreal's three-run
fifth. He bobbled a potential double-play ball with runners on
first and second and one out and then nearly threw the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   Only a nice play by John Olerud to block Jones' throw stopped
Montreal from scoring right there. But with the bases loaded, Brad
Fullmer blooped a single to left for two runs, Mark Grudzielanek
hit a sacrifice fly to right and the Expos had a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Shane Andrews muffed an Alfonzo grounder to open
the Mets' fifth. Olerud then tripled off White's glove in
right-center field to score Alfonzo and cut the deficit to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   After Piazza popped out and Carlos Baerga took a called third
strike, it looked as if the Montreal right-hander Dustin Hermanson
might leave Olerud stranded on third with the tying run. But Huskey
drilled a 1-1 pitch some 430 feet over the center-field fence that
gave the Mets a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They added a run in the sixth when Ordonez scored from second on
Chris Widger's passed ball and throwing error into left field. But
the Mets' rookie right-hander Jeff Tam, who had not allowed a run
in his first five major league innings over four appearances, gave
up three runs on four consecutive one-out hits in the top of the
seventh. Andrews's two-run double, which short-hopped Huskey in
right, capped the rally and put the Expos ahead by 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez led off the bottom of the eighth against the
right-hander Anthony Telford with his fourth single and moved to
third on a pair of groundouts. Up stepped Alfonzo, who delivered a
single to left to score Ordonez and knot the game at 8-8. For the
Mets, the worst was yet to come.

RIPKEN LIFTS ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ And now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   As if they needed any reminder, the Red Sox, sights set on a
playoff berth and with Mo Vaughn back in the lineup, began the
second half of the schedule Thursday night with a 3-2 loss to the
Baltimore Orioles, preseason favorites who have fallen out of sight
in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn walked and doubled in four plate appearances, the
Orioles prevailed on an eighth-inning single by
rusting-but-still-dangerous legend Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Iron Cal responded to an intentional walk to B.J. Surhoff by
clunking a broken-bat single into center field off reliever Jim
Corsi. That hit scored Eric Davis, who had opened the inning by
hustling his way to an opposite-field double and taking third on a
fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people figure they're being singled out (by an
intentional walk), but I saw it as a matter of strategy,'' Ripken
said. ``Corsi is tough on a lot of people, especially me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just battle and try and do the best you can. I got a
little lucky today. I broke a bat and hit it in the right spot.
I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' logic in passing Surhoff to get to Ripken seemed
unassailable. In eight career at-bats against Corsi, Ripken had
just one hit, and the Newton, Mass., native struck him out in
Boston last month. But Corsi, who had been unbeaten in 37 previous
appearances this season, reverted to Son of Steamer form as Ripken
reached down and dunked a javelin throw of a hit just over the Sox
infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal fouled off a couple of pitches then put the ball in
play,'' Corsi said. ``I made a good pitch. Sometimes you make a
lousy pitch, they hit a rocket right at somebody, and you look like
the hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have rather made a lousy pitch and have him hit a
rocket at Nomar. It's just aggravating, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggravation was just beginning for Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams, who after a ninth-inning leadoff single by John Valentin,
was forced to use his pinch hitters out of sequence because plate
umpire Jim Evans said he saw Williams pointing at Jason Varitek in
the on-deck circle, when Williams in fact was pointing at Reggie
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed the pine-tar rag in the on-deck circle just in case
I had to hit,'' said Varitek, who was forced to bat and popped out.
``I was on the edge of the circle, handed the rag to Reggie, and
walked away. I never took a practice swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Orioles lefty Jesse Orosco had just given up Valentin's single
when Williams sent righthanded hitting Damon Buford to hit for
Scott Hatteberg. Orioles manager Ray Miller countered by summoning
his righthanded closer, Armando Benitez, when the confusion began.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who earlier this season experienced another umpiring
first when third-base umpire John Hirschbeck said he heard a pitch
hit Tampa Bay batter Quinton McCracken in a dome, said this was
another first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pointed, I pointed to Reggie,'' he said. ``I didn't
even see Varitek out there, myself. Reggie came up to hit and Evans
told me Varitek was already in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea. What was I supposed to do. Varitek's in the
game, Reggie's up to hit, and I don't have another catcher. I don't
understand. He says, `Varitek's got to hit or you don't have a
catcher.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both Varitek and Jefferson came to the plate and
made outs, Varitek popping out, Jefferson whiffing, and the game
ended with DH Midre Cummings lining out to the track in
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible that had Jefferson been given the chance to
advance Valentin, Williams would have kept Varitek in reserve and
let Mike Benjamin hit in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what was going on,'' said Jefferson, whose back
was still sore after taking a cortisone shot on Sunday. ``It caught
me totally off-guard. I was just thinking, `Get me in there, I
don't want to stretch my back too much.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles began the night losers of 11 of their last 12 and 26
1/2 games out of first place, the farthest they have been back at
the break in 43 years. The last time they were over .500 was May
14, when ace pitcher Mike Mussina was struck by a line drive hit by
Cleveland's Sandy Alomar, big brother of Orioles second baseman
Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   For the first seven innings, solo home runs were the order of
the night as two each by both sides _ Darren Bragg and Valentin for
the Sox off Mussina, Alomar and Mike Bordick for the hometown Birds
off Bret Saberhagen _ accounted for all the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways this is the toughest game of the season,''
said Saberhagen, who threw 102 pitches in five innings before
giving way to Derek Lowe, who went six up, six down. ``Everybody's
been relaxing, getting away from the game a little bit. The first
game back is tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of dead out there, nobody's fault really, but it
was like we were a little laid-back. Hopefully, tomorrow we'll come
back out and play ball the way we've been playing.''

MARINERS LIFT BURDEN OFF STUNNED DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Change is in the air. The Mariners refuse to go down
without a fight and Russ Davis did not start at third base Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Even he knows why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, Lou (Piniella) can't keep throwing me at third if I'm
killing the team, you know? And I totally agree with it. I wouldn't
do it either,'' Davis said Thursday night, his Alabama drawl
telling an anguished tale of a season that needed its free-fall
stopped, for him and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have a guy out there if you're trying to win a
championship and it's supposed to be a big banner year. I'm not
going to throw a guy out there who's booting balls and continues to
let runs come around. Try something different and if that don't
work ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' voice trailed off, but he's facing facts. It's over for
him.
</P>
<P>
   At third base, that is. For now and probably the rest of the
season, which is a big relief for the snake-bit Davis and an
absolutely necessary move for the desperate Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the start to the second half of 1998. Moving
Davis out of his own personal hell was the least the Mariners could
do, until, of course, they do something bigger and bolder, like
make some trades and start working toward really improving this
should-be contender.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the M's electrified the Kingdome, beating the
Angels 8-6 and making it look like they could rise from the ashes,
although it will take two solid weeks to get the final read on the
team's EKG.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, smaller fires had to be put out. Immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, in another important American League West game
against the Angels, Davis is scheduled to start in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to let Russ play out there and maybe it will be
the right tonic for him,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give him a chance to relax and help his
hitting, maybe offensively he can put up some good numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means Davis will become the 59th man to play that position
since Ken Griffey Jr. took over in center field 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The way Davis figures it, he can't be too great a liability in
his new position, which he has never once fielded, not even in the
minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that Glenallen Hill occupied that position for
much of the first half of '98, Davis understands no one is
expecting him to win a Gold Glove. Just make the routine plays.
Hit. Accept getting pulled for a better defensive player in the
late innings. Try not to wonder if he'll be part of a package when
the trades come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is not out of the race. I don't know if this is the
answer or not. You never know. I might be able to go out and be an
All-Star left fielder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, at this point in time, I need to do something
different just to get my mind off this whole thing at third base. I
need to flush all this stuff out of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Davis in Texas right before All-Star Game break
was the final straw. It made his banishment from third base
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it made it humane, since Davis' pain and suffering and
ham-handedness were so incredibly obvious and detrimental, to him
and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five stinking errors in two days. That's the worst it's ever
been,'' said Davis, the 28-year-old Alabaman whose five fielding
gaffes against the Rangers pushed him to a major-league worst 25
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Davis never dreamed his major league career would have come to
this _ a nightmare that infield coach Steve Smith said left Davis
unable to sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The team's) not living up to expectations and I feel like I'm
a real big part of that,'' Davis said, lifting up his cap and
running his hands through his hair, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over there it's just a case of not being able to get
negative thoughts out of my head. There's a lot of negativity
surrounding this whole ballclub, first of all. And I'm a big part
of that. It's something I've never really had to deal with. It's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Drafted by the Yankees in 1988, Davis was one of their
well-regarded prospects, even if his mechanics at third base were
never natural or totally sound. But Davis worked at it. His bat was
dynamic and his former AAA-Columbus manager, Buck Showalter, would
have played him at Yankee Stadium if only a guy named Wade Boggs
had not signed there as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But after two injury-shortened seasons with the M's, Davis'
first real chance to make his mark as an everyday third baseman
came this year. It was a disaster from the start _ although perhaps
it was not totally unpredictable that Davis would have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's never had trouble before,'' said Smith, who
has worked extensively with Davis to improve his mechanics at
playing down on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he will look forward to the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like I started out real bad and I dug myself a
big hole and it just keeps getting deeper and deeper. I'm trying to
claw my way out and I just haven't had any success doing it,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The M's have finally lifted the burden off Davis. It is what
many hope is only the first step toward inner-Mariner peace and
productivity.

EX-BUSINESS PARTNER SUES GRIFFEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS and RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An attorney for Ken Griffey Jr. has asked that the
Mariners' All-Star center fielder be dropped from a lawsuit in
which a former business partner accuses him of backing out of a
contract to open a chain of Griffey's Sports Bar and Grills.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Griffey signed an exclusive licensing agreement with
Thomas Brown and Endorsements Unlimited in 1992 to use his name and
likeness on restaurants, bars and nightclubs, Griffey later bought
out Brown of Bellevue and his partner, Hugh Stanton of Issaquah,
said David Lawyer, Griffey's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Brown received $250,000 and Stanton got $400,000 from Griffey in
separate settlements approved by attorneys on both sides of the
business, which never took shape beyond the planning stages, Lawyer
said. Brown also names Griffey's parents, Ken Griffey Sr. and
Alberta Griffey, who also signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brown claims Stanton conspired with the Griffeys to
oust him.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was made after Griffey signed an agreement with
Planet Hollywood to develop the Official All Star Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But in a lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court, Brown now
says he felt pressured to accept the settlement last March. He
claims Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg, threatened his family and
that the ballplayer and his agent knew Brown needed money prior to
making a settlement offer, which originally was $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brown now wants up to $10 million, and says the contract could
have been worth $5 million to $7 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can pay me my money and I'll walk away,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawyer claims the figure is ridiculous for a business
arrangement that never took form and was already settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporation was a shell,'' Lawyer said. ``It had no
assets, it had no employees, it had nothing. They never opened a
restaurant, they never had a schedule by which they were going to
open a restaurant. They negotiated toward the execution of a lease,
but no lease was ever signed. . . . It never got off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's attorney, Robert Brandt, said that while no business got
off the ground, the partners, including Griffey, did meet with
Seafirst bank officials and had plans to open a sports restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a business deal that's gone bad,'' Brandt said,
declining to comment about the specifics of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The next court date in the lawsuit is scheduled for July 24, in
which a judge will hear arguments on Lawyer's motion to dismiss the
case based on the signed settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, the lawsuit alleges that Griffey told
creditors about back taxes Brown owed and suggested they foreclose
on his stock in Endorsements Unlimited, and gave personal
information about Brown to other business associates to devalue his
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer said that Brown, a former motorcycle dealer, also claims
that Griffey had a hand in a criminal charge filed against Brown in
Kittitas County. According to the lawsuit, Brown claims Griffey
urged Ellensburg police to file criminal charges against Brown
after he took money for the sale of a motorcycle but never
delivered it to the Ellensburg buyer.

GRIFFEY HITS 36TH HOMER IN M'S VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For better or worse, here come the Mariners?
</P>
<P>
   If the M's have decided to marry into the notion of changing
their inept ways, it was evident Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The M's at least hope the wedlock to the second half of the
season is as eventful and fruitful as their 8-6 victory over the
American League West-leading Anaheim Angels at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing the Angels by 13 games after the All-Star break, the
Mariners know they need plenty of good karma to recover. Thursday
night did not erase three months of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   However, it could be considered a step toward salvaging an
otherwise dissolution this season. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- The M's began an 11-game homestand and play three more
against Anaheim, the team they overtook for the division title in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   -- By the end of next week, the M's should know their fate after
facing second-place Texas following this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see where we're at by the middle of the month,'' M's
manager Lou Piniella said. ``If we get on the right foot and gain
some momentum, it'll give us a chance to get back in the race. . .
. All we have to do is play better. It doesn't matter how the front
team is playing. The only situation you can control is your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had outscored the Mariners 32-12 and was unbeaten in
five meetings this season.
</P>
<P>
   However, M's starter Jeff Fassero (8-5) reversed that wave with
his third straight effective outing. The Mariners' offense
supported Fassero with a five-run fifth and three-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   When Ken Griffey Jr. belted his AL-leading 36th home run in the
sixth, Fassero worked with an 8-1 cushion. Griffey's homer was the
330th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to go out there and play,'' Griffey said. ``I'm
just trying to win as many ballgames as I can for the Mariners.
It's hard to do anything if you're not playing consistently.
Hopefully this is the start of it _ playing consistent ball for the
rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero mostly dominated through 62/3 innings. He stayed in
front of the count, and kept batters off balance with his fastball
and a hard, inside slider.
</P>
<P>
   With a comfortable lead and two out in the seventh, Fassero
tried to finish the job. However, the Angels banged him around for
three hits and four runs in that inning. Fassero yielded to Bobby
Ayala, who allowed a base hit before he smothered Anaheim's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella did not take any chances with an 8-5 lead. After Ayala
yielded a one-out double in the eighth, Piniella turned to Paul
Spoljaric. However, Spoljaric immediately gave up a towering double
to Darin Erstad, putting the tying run at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   When Spoljaric recorded an out, Greg McCarthy came on and ended
the inning when he got Jim Edmonds to fly out to left. Mike Timlin
pitched the ninth and recorded his second save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to win the first one. You just try to win the
series,'' Timlin said. ``If you do that, you come out on the
winning side.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mariner Omar Olivares (5-5) took the loss for the Angels.
Olivares lost his third straight start.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners cracked Olivares in the fifth when Joey Cora began
a rally with a one-out double that was followed by Alex Rodriguez's
triple to right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   With one run in, Martinez and Segui both walked to load the
bases for Buhner, who promptly delivered a single to center. Dan
Wilson loaded the bases again after he chopped an infield hit to
third. That set up Shane Monahan's first major league hit.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, called up from Class AAA Tacoma to start in left field,
struck out his first two times at the plate. However, his base hit
to center drove in two runs and capped the Mariners' game-breaking
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cora added another run in the sixth when he sent an Olivares
fastball over the right-field wall for his third home run. Moments
later, Olivares hit Rodriguez on the left shoulder. That pitch
chased Olivares, who allowed seven earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim reliever Rich DeLucia entered the game and probably
wishes he had not. Griffey pounded DeLucia's first pitch to
straight-away center for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fassero retired seven of the next eight batters he
faced after the third. He even pitched his way out of a
bases-loaded jam in the sixth. Fassero struck out Phil Nevin and
got Justin Baughman to fly out to right, which ended the Angels'
best scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   How important was this game to Anaheim?
</P>
<P>
   Nevin was ejected for arguing a third strike. As part of his
tirade, Nevin threw his helmet and ripped off his jersey _
reminiscent of Hulk Hogan during his red and gold Hulkamania era.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Mariners felt a sense of urgency, Timlin said:
``No. I was told this team was 13 games out in August (of 1995).
Everyone knows what we can do. We know what we can do.''

 &HT;    NAACP OPENS NATIONAL CONVENTION WITH REVITALIZED SPIRIT
 &HT;    1000&AMP;add. For release Sunday, July 12
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Californians voted to end affirmative action
programs two years ago, the nation's largest civil rights
organization was missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) does not plan to repeat that mistake in November, when
voters in Washington state will have essentially the same question
before them.
</P>
<P>
   The association will spend $50,000 to try to defeat the
Washington ballot initiative. and it will work with a coalition of
labor and civic groups seeking to blunt the assault on affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   This effort is one sign of the renewed vitality of the
89-year-old organization, its supporters say, just a few years
after some people were wondering whether it would survive at all.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP is expecting 6,000 people at its annual meeting, which
began Saturday in Atlanta. ``We're at a moment where the
organization is poised on a path of terrific opportunity,'' said
Roger Wilkins, the George Mason University professor who also is
board chairman of the NAACP magazine, Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For Julian Bond, who returns to his home town for the convention
as the NAACP's new chairman, the trick is not necessarily doing
anything new, but doing ``the old things better.''
</P>
<P>
   The old things Bond spoke of include returning the organization
to its focus of fighting racial discrimination instead of its
members fighting each other. The NAACP is only now emerging from
several years of turmoil in its leadership positions. The resulting
financial crisis plunged it more than $4 million in debt and
prevented the organization from contributing to the campaign
against the anti-affirmative action issue in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bond claims the NAACP now has a $2 million surplus, a turnaround
that was achieved in part by mass layoffs of staff members at its
Baltimore headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In Bond and the NAACP's president and CEO, former Rep. Kweisi
Mfume, D-Md., the civil rights group has two elegant public
spokesmen with vast political experience.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing the NAACP suggest they will need every
ounce of their skills.
</P>
<P>
   The association still is struggling to reach out to young
African-Americans, who have no memory of the seminal struggle for
voting rights, fair housing laws and desegregated schools. Some
young blacks still perceive the NAACP as a stodgy, slow-footed
group, a view Bond himself held when he was a young civil rights
worker in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Walters, a University of Maryland political scientist,
said the NAACP's work with young people is directed primarily to
the middle class, a criticism he said holds for the organization in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the vexing question. The young people I see taking part
are essentially middle class,'' Walters said. ``Eventually they are
going to have to deal with questions of urban policy, questions of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hispanics about to become the nation's largest minority
group, NAACP leaders are increasingly talking in terms of working
with other ethnic and racial groups. ``Colored people come in all
colors,'' Bond has said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet of the NAACP's 64 directors, two are white and the rest are
African-American. Michael Meyers, president of the New York Civil
Rights Coalition, is a vocal critic of the NAACP, where he once
worked as a staff member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is supposed to believe in racial harmony, but it is a very
segregated organization,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   To support his contention, he pointed to the NAACP's ambivalence
toward Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
   There is no unanimity on the NAACP's board of directors about
the proper relationship with Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
   Bond has unambiguously said Farrakhan preaches an exclusionary
message that has no place in the NAACP. But Mfume's history with
Farrakhan is more complex. He once spoke of a ``sacred covenant''
between Farrakhan and the Congressional Black Caucus, which he
headed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Madison, a Washington talk radio host who was Bond's closest
competitor for the chairmanship, said African-American groups need
to work in concert because black congressmen would be chairmen of
three powerful committees in the House of Representatives if
Democrats can capture a majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be open dialogue with Farrakhan. We stand at a
critical juncture that requires a major voter registration and
get-out-the-vote effort,'' Madison said. ``The Nation of Islam is a
major player.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement, if not outright dissension, among NAACP directors
is nothing new. Bond described the group as a firing squad standing
in a circle and facing inward. His job, he said, is to ``make them
turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   While money no longer is a source of controversy, Mfume and Bond
have acknowledged that a campaign to raise a $50 million endowment
is progressing more slowly than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The endowment drive is just one way Bond and Mfume have tried to
raise the NAACP's profile. Mfume has used an annual scorecard for
the hotel industry to shine a spotlight on hotel chains that the
NAACP says do not give African Americans sufficient employment,
management or ownership opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Two chains, Best Western and Omni, scored so low that the
organization will not do business with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one I didn't think would have political salience, but
it has made the hotel industry sensitive about the list and that's
good,'' Walters said. ``This is an example of the kind of civil
rights work they should be doing, instead of the social service
approach they seem to have taken too often recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume also has tried to draw increased attention to the NAACP's
annual congressional report card of votes it deems critically
important, which this year includes three affirmative action
measures and a bill to provide vouchers for private schools to
low-income students in Washington. The NAACP opposed the bill,
which supporters said would provide mainly African-American
children their best way out of the city's troubled public schools.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of rankings are available on the NAACP's Internet site
(http://www.naacp.org), but Bond said the organization has yet to
modernize in terms of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring us up to the 20th century,'' he said. ``Quite
often, the NAACP office in a town will be a telephone answering
machine in somebody's living room. ... I want there to be e-mail
and the same kind of communications network that almost every other
organization of our kind has. Nothing extraordinary, but enough to
more quickly mobilize our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond tells audiences around the country that the NAACP today
``is not your father's NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics such as Meyers agree. But he laments the NAACP's demise.
``They're huffing and puffing and trying to blow people's houses
down,'' he said. ``The only house blowing down is their own
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters said Bond and Mfume have placed the NAACP in better
shape than it was a year ago. ``This is a solid team,'' he said.
</P>

 &HT;    Sign of the times: Pray for rain
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Just another dry spell, the men said at first. Ranchers
watched waterholes recede to brown puddles of mud that their
livestock would not touch. They watched the rank weeds shrivel as
the west wind relentlessly sought them out and smothered them with
its hot breath. They watched the grass slowly lose its green, then
curl and fire up like dying cornstalks.''
</P>
<P>
   _ From The Time It Never Rained, by Elmer Kelton
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL TEXAS _ Just off the shoulder of Hwy. 79, a few miles
north of Taylor, a sign sits in front of a parched cornfield,
sun-burned
</P>
<P>
   stalks rustling in the hot wind:
</P>
<P>
   Pray for rain.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only entreaty to a higher authority for some
relief that I saw posted between here and Austin, but its setting
drove the point home
</P>
<P>
   harder. This country is drying up, the black land turning gray,
the corn well past saving, and most of the cotton crop in deep
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped on the way back from Austin to visit a friend who runs
the Taylor newspaper, which is conveniently located next to Ed's
Bar (Hours:
</P>
<P>
   Closed until open; open until closed), and around the corner
from Louie Mueller's Barbecue _ which serves the best beef brisket
in the free world.
</P>
<P>
   We went up the road to Frame Switch to eat lunch at the Texas
Cafe, which is graced by a giant statue of a bull that once made
Texas Highways magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever driven Hwy. 79 to Austin, you've seen the bull.
The food is pretty good too.
</P>
<P>
   My friend told me county farmers harvested less than 30 percent
of the usual corn crop, and predictions aren't any better for
cotton. He's an East
</P>
<P>
   Texas emigrant to the blacklands, and he loves it, though he had
the good sense to get out of the cow business when he moved out of
the Pine Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps seven head just to piddle with out at a small farm, and
he lives in town. The day before, he got two-tenths of an inch at
the house, and
</P>
<P>
   nine-tenths at the farm a couple of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   I watched that storm on my way into Austin the day before, as I
traveled through Elgin, the official, legislatively mandated
Sausage Capital of
</P>
<P>
   Texas. As I rounded the curve in that big-sky country, I could
see the storm off in the distance, toward Taylor, dropping rain
over a few miles at
</P>
<P>
   most _ including my friend's farm. To the north of the cloud was
blue sky. Same to the south. Such are the scattered showers that
offer what little
</P>
<P>
   relief we get these days.
</P>
<P>
   North of Taylor, farmers are already mowing down the fields of
drought-killed corn. Numerous ``for sale'' signs adorn fences along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Cows stand sluggishly in stock ponds that barely reach their
ankles even when they're standing in the middle. I never once saw a
hay baler, or even
</P>
<P>
   someone working a tractor for that matter. There's nothing to
bale.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Hearne, a fire along the railroad tracks claimed a
few miles of trees along the fence row and burned the grass along
the right-of-way. You
</P>
<P>
   see the remains of lots of grass fires these days when driving
through Texas. There's no rain to help the grass grow back.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Trinity River bottom, about 10 miles west of Crockett,
usually one of the prettiest spots in East Texas, is brown and
ugly, the grass
</P>
<P>
   chewed down to nearly nothing by the cattle. There's a ``for
sale'' sign on a chunk of that land too.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I remember it being this hot and dry in Central Texas,
and here too for that matter, was in 1980. I remember because I had
just moved to
</P>
<P>
   Austin, and I spent the first part of summer working for an
inventor who lived in what was then the country near Barton Creek.
I did a number of
</P>
<P>
   odd jobs, like driving a dump truck, breaking up rocks to help
build a garden, and other manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly rained that summer. Everything turned brown, including
my skin from hours under the sun. This summer is shaping up to be
at least that bad
</P>
<P>
   if something doesn't change pretty soon. It is bad here in East
Texas, but it's worse in the blackland country, where in some spots
less than seven
</P>
<P>
   inches of rain have fallen all year.
</P>
<P>
   In Franklin, a small town that sits on my imaginary border
between Central and East Texas, a church sign reads, ``Thanks for
the rain, Lord.'' I couldn't
</P>
<P>
   tell it had rained there, but I'll take their word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, please send us some more. Soon.

 &HT;    Clinton sends message of sympathy to Florida fire victims
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ President Clinton made a brief stop
recently in fire-weary Central Florida to thank firefighters,
sympathize with burned-out families and deliver three messages:
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida is ready to welcome tourists again and needs the
economic boost to recover.
</P>
<P>
   _ The world is facing further extremes of heat, drought and
severe weather and needs all the knowledge firefighters gained from
Florida's ordeal to be better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   _ It shouldn't take a disaster to remind us that we're all part
of a community and that ``we're at our best when we're giving.''
</P>
<P>
   With praise for ``the real American heroes,'' Clinton thanked
the firefighters who kept wildfires from consuming whole
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the Daytona International Speedway in Volusia
County, which was hit hard by fires. But there was no trace of
smoke in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton squeezed in the visit between stops in Atlanta and
Miami, attracting a stage full of smiling state and local officials
and a tent full of awed firefighters, National Guardsmen, forest
rangers, Americorps volunteers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, Clinton met privately with 10 families who
had lost homes Many of them were renting and had no insurance, and
are now living in hotels or with relatives. ``I'm very sorry for
what you're going through,'' Clinton told them.
</P>
<P>
   He also met with children who had donated money to fire relief
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared Florida's 34 counties disaster areas, and
announced new federal assistance for farmers and people who are out
of work because of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance includes a Labor Department grant of up to $1
million for hiring 200 temporary workers to help clean up charred
areas, restore roads and assist at shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew cheers when he alluded to the movie Armageddon and
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer . . . the real American heroes are not up in space
fighting asteroids. They're in Florida fighting fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred of the 5,000 firefighters spread out through
Florida's fire zone got to attend the event, and they rushed to get
within handshaking and picture-taking distance as Clinton slowly
worked his way out through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it!'' exulted Boca Raton firefighter and paramedic Joel
Narcowich, holding up ``the hand that shook the hand of the
president of the United States.'' And he got a picture with his
pocket camera.
</P>
<P>
   Narcowich and four others from Boca Raton arrived Tuesday, along
with seven from Palm Beach County Fire Rescue and a Broward County
contingent. They're manning fire stations so local firefighters who
have worked weeks without a break can get some rest.

 &HT;    Firefighters made Florida homes safe for thousands
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM COAST _ On the road to Greg Weston's neighborhood, a sheet
hangs between two trees with the message ``HOME OF THE BRAVE
(firefighters).''
</P>
<P>
   Weston, a sheriff's deputy, has been one of those firefighters
for the past month in Flagler County, where deputies, paramedics
and even regular citizens were pressed into service to try to save
this small county.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, just hours before the county was evacuated,
Weston's own house burned down while he fought a fire at the other
end of the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew, even if I was here, there was nothing I could have
done,'' Weston said, standing at his old address. ``There was an
identical house over there that had three firetrucks sitting on it.
The same thing. It's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard on the police radio that his house was going to
burn, he called his wife. She had about an hour to get their sons,
Alex, 2, and Paul, 6, and a few photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's great. Last night was the first time she cried,'' he
said. Last night they sent their sons to Pennsylvania with his
parents. ``You should have been there last night, trying to put
Paul in the van. He kept saying, `I want to go home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Weston isn't going to let his children see what used to be their
home.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to start building a new one. But for now, he's back on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `As long as my family's safe, I gotta keep working,'
'' said fellow deputy Chris Oh. ``I guess that's the Marine in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   He's one of hundreds of people in Flagler County who have gone
above and beyond the call of duty in the past month in this rural
county. Officials don't know how many of the 100 volunteer and 18
paid firefighters have been injured because none would leave the
fires _ paramedics went to the front lines where they bandaged them
up and sent them back to their hoses. Even the chiefs and captains
were fighting fires. The county's emergency operations director was
hospitalized Wednesday for exhaustion or heat-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to meals, citizens loaded up pickups full of what
they had cooked and collected at churches and in their
neighborhoods. Officials wouldn't take it at the emergency
operations center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd tell them where a fire was and ask them to take it to the
firefighters,'' Rich Weizer, Flagler's emergency spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Shinnick, 72, a volunteer firefighter, abandoned his sign
painting business to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can just wait for the signs,'' Shinnick said. ``Something
like this is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of the Palm Coast volunteer fire station, another sheet
hangs with a message on it, this one from the firefighters who
continued fighting after the county was evacuated and are still
fighting now that the residents have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome home.''

POLICE FIND 17 STOLEN PAY PHONES IN APARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MACARENA HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If anyone has ever wondered what happened to the
telephones missing from phone booths in New York City, a partial
answer may have been found Thursday in a Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they found 17 public phones Thursday in an
apartment, and arrested two people, Phyllis Shepard, 30, and
Anthony Roper, 35. The two suspects were apparently so hungry for
quarters, police said, that they stole the phones, worth a total of
nearly $60,000, carried them back to the apartment, then broke open
the coin boxes for their paltry bounty.
</P>
<P>
   While vandalism to public phones is a problem commonly faced by
phone companies, it is unusual for entire phones to be stolen, said
Maureen F. Lanagan, a spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic, which has
about 9,000 phones on New York City sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lanagan would not say how much money Bell Atlantic
phones can hold, officials at another phone company said that at
most the phones contain $150 worth of coins, but are emptied
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they caught onto the thefts after going to to
execute a warrant for a fugitive wanted in an unrelated case. While
they did not find the man they were looking for, they did find the
17 public phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see a man and woman in a the room with lots of pay
phones, most of them in plain sight,'' said an investigator who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``They were busted up pretty
bad: coin slots ripped open, backs ripped off, keys punched in.
There were no coins left and there were two crowbars in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Roper and Ms. Shepard face felony charges of criminal possession
of stolen property and possession of burglary tools, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the stolen phones were owned by Bell Atlantic,
other companies said they had had phones stolen, too. Wendy Macey,
a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T, said her company had fewer problems with
theft because many of its units no longer require coins. In
addition to taking the money, she said, people who steal the phones
can sell the parts.

SUSPECT IN PIZZA MURDERS ATTEMPTS SUICIDE IN JAIL

  (gm)

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A man charged with murdering two pizza
deliverymen last year tried to commit suicide yesterday, only hours
before he was expected to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty
in the so-called thrill killing.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Thomas J. Koskovich, was found unconscious in his
prison cell after taking an overdose of sleeping pills, officials
said. He remained hospitalized in critical condition Thursday, his
breathing assisted by a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued late Thursday afternoon, the Sussex County
Prosecutor, Dolores Blackburn, said that blood and urine tests at
Newtown Memorial Hospital, where Koskovich was in intensive care,
showed that he had taken sleeping pills known as tricyclic
antidepressants. A suicide note was found in his cell at the Walter
Keogh-Dwyer Correctional Facility in Newtown, Ms. Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskovich, 20, the older of two defendants in the case, had
planned to plead guilty to murder Thursday afternoon for his role
in the slaying of Giorgio Gallara, a pizza shop owner, and
Gallara's employee, Jeremy Giordano, on April 17, 1997. Prosecutors
had accused Koskovich and the other defendant of killing the two
deliverymen after ordering pizza and luring them to an abandoned
house in Franklin, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The killings in April 1997 were a horrifying shock in Franklin,
a town of 5,000 residents in the northwestern corner of the state.
Even more stunning was the accusation by investigators that the
suspects, trying to relieve their small-town boredom, had killed
the pizza men just to find out what it felt like to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea would have spared Koskovich execution but would
almost certainly have resulted in a sentence of life in prison. The
other defendant, Jayson Vreeland, was 17 at the time of the
killings and thus was not eligible for the death penalty. But he
faces first-degree murder charges, and if convicted, will face a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers in the case declined to discuss
the plea bargain arrangement, which was first reported in The
Star-Ledger in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, Reginald Stanton of Sussex County
Superior Court, postponed the hearing at which Koskovich was
expected to enter his plea, pending an improvement in his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Koskovich's lawyer, Pamela Brause, said that she had met with
Koskovich on Wednesday and that he had appeared nervous _ much as
he had since he was arrested more than a year ago. ``We certainly
weren't expecting anything like this,'' she said. ``The whole
nature of these charges and the magnitude of these proceedings has
always been very difficult for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Newtown Memorial Hospital were unable to determine
immediately how many of the prescription pills Koskovich had taken,
according to the Prosecutor's statement. As a result, doctors could
not say whether they expected him to survive. Investigators said
that Koskovich had not been prescribed any medication while in
prison and that they believed he had obtained the pills from
another inmate to whom the pills had been prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, a prison drug test found heroin in Koskovich's
urine. Prison officials said the drugs had been smuggled into the
prison, and they arrested Koskovich and a second inmate who had
tested positive for heroin. After the arrests, prisoners were no
longer allowed to meet with visitors face to face but were required
to talk to them through a glass partition.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the hospital remained extraordinarily tight, with
sheriff's officers posted both outside Koskovich's room in the
intensive care unit and outside the main entrance to the unit. The
hospital also called in extra security personnel, Grace said. A
guard was positioned at the rear of the hospital, he said, and the
Newtown Police Department had stepped up patrols around the
hospital perimeter.

GORDON PARKS: GOING EVERYWHERE, AT HOME NOWHERE BUT WITHIN
HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1940, Gordon Parks, the son of a dirt farmer in
Fort Scott, Kan., who made his living playing piano in a brothel,
washing dishes in a restaurant and waiting on tables on a
transcontinental train, found himself broke in Minnesota. So he did
what any poor black man trying to support his wife and kids would
do: He went to an exclusive clothing store in St. Paul and told the
owner that he would like to take fashion photographs. Amazingly,
the store gave him a chance. He borrowed lights and a camera,
muddled through a roll of double exposures and got one good
picture, the shot that started his illustrious and improbable
career in photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon Parks,'' a 221-picture
retrospective organized by the Corcoran Gallery in Washington and
now on view at the Museum of the City of New York, covers the
nearly 60 years of photography that followed that shot: from Harlem
street fights to Paris fashions, from Rio slums to artists'
studios, from Kansas pool halls to Parks' flowery imaginings. If
this is only half past autumn, you have to wonder what winter could
possibly bring. And this, bear in mind, is only one of Parks'
careers. He is also an author, filmmaker, poet and composer.
</P>
<P>
   The first bend in his photographic life occurred when the boxer
Joe Louis' wife, Marva, happened to visit the store in St. Paul,
where Parks' fashion photographs were on display. She was so
impressed that she invited him to Chicago to do more. What quality
did she see in his work? One of Parks' portraits in the
retrospective, a picture of a gloved, veiled, glamorous Marva,
accompanied by her billowing, glamorous shadow on the wall, is a
clue. He had an eye for elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Parks went to Chicago, but he had other things on his mind than
fashion. After all, his first photographic inspiration had not been
fashion plates but pictures of poor workers taken by the Farm
Security Administration. Parks turned his camera to the slums on
the South Side. For the work he did there, he won a fellowship, and
he chose to spend it at the Farm Security Administration in
Washington, under Roy Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, in 1942, that Parks took the iconic picture of his
career: a portrait of a black charwoman posing under an American
flag with a broom in one hand and a mop in the other. Her name was
Ella Watson and she cleaned the floors at the Farm Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A pleasure of this large retrospective is to see this powerfully
polemical portrait, ``American Gothic,'' joined with lesser-known
shots of the same woman. One shows Mrs. Watson dressed up and
waiting patiently in line, barefoot, with other black women.
Another picture, split neatly in half by the door frame of a
kitchen, seems to show the past and future of Ella Watson. In the
left half of the picture, she sits in the kitchen with her
grandchildren around her. In the right half is a younger woman
reflected in a dresser mirror. On the dresser next to the mirror is
an old photograph of a man and woman who appear to be Mrs. Watson's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   This complex, dense, socially loaded photograph is typical of
some of Parks' best works.
</P>
<P>
   A picture titled ``Negro Children in the Front Door of Their
Home,'' for example, is a marvel of formal order created out of the
disorder of poverty. In the narrow space behind a screen door, a
row of kids are lined up, one behind the other, according to
height, and they don't appear to be posing. In the back is a tall
boy on tiptoe and in the front is a little girl in pigtails,
hanging out of the bottom of the screenless door. All of them are
looking at something intriguing or terrible or both that is out of
the camera's view.
</P>
<P>
   When the Farm Security Administration was disbanded in 1943,
Stryker took Parks with him to the Office of War Information and
then to the Standard Oil Photography Project, which was devoted to
producing patriotic images of the United States during the war.
Parks traveled to New York, Maine, Connecticut and Pennsylvania,
and he appeared to be an outsider everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem he shot a sea of children peering at him through a
half-open car window. In New England he caught a fisherman,
lighting his pipe under a storm lantern and looking suspiciously
out at him. These two pictures show Parks' peculiar position. In
Harlem, he was the object of envy. In New England he was an
intruder.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admire Parks' fortitude as a constant outsider. A
picture of three teen-age cowhands in front of a restaurant with
the accidentally fitting name Bar U in Turner Valley, Alberta, show
some good ol' boys with hats, missing teeth and smirky smiles. What
could they have been thinking?
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of four generations of New England women, zigzagging
back through a room, from an old spotted face in front to a baby on
its mother's lap in back, shows a closed if crooked maternal line.
How did they welcome him to their home?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Parks swerved back and forth between
whiteness and blackness, fashion and poverty, as if he were using
each of these worlds as a warning, a lure and a lesson for himself.
</P>
<P>
   One year he photographed a teen-age gang leader in Harlem
looking into the satin-lined coffin of a man killed in a rumble.
The next year he was in Paris catching a fashionable lady in a
veiled hat sucking hard on a cigarette and squinting from the smoke
in her eyes. One year he took pictures of Ingrid Bergman and
Roberto Rossellini at the beginning of their love affair in
Stromboli, Italy. The next he photographed beggars in the streets
of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Diving into so many worlds, Parks must have wondered where his
true home was. In 1949, he returned to Fort Scott, where he was
born in 1912, to find out. The pictures he took there, though, are
hardly pictures of a native son returning home. A picture of Parks'
uncle leaning on a cane shows no sign of familial recognition. A
picture of men standing for a portrait outside a pool hall seems to
be summed up by the dog's expression: What are you doing here?
</P>
<P>
   He did not linger in Fort Scott. Starting in the late 1940s,
Parks, the first black photographer at Life magazine, produced a
series of photo essays: on poverty, segregation, black Muslims, the
Black Panthers, crime and fashion. By far the best known of Parks'
photo essays, and the one given the most space in this exhibition,
is the 1961 series of pictures he took of a poor, asthmatic boy
named Flavio da Silva living in a slum in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   In one photograph Flavio lies in bed, looking deathly ill. In
another he sits behind his baby brother, Zacarias, stuffing food
into the baby's mouth from behind while the baby reaches into the
dish for more food with his wet, dirty hands.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Parks crisscrossed so many classes and cultures
makes for some strange resonances in the retrospective. The picture
that Parks took of a sea of hats and coats on the Staten Island
ferry in 1944 seems formally similar to the sea of faces at a black
Muslim rally in 1963. The picture of Flavio stuffing the baby's
mouth from behind looks oddly similar to two preachers with their
hands over the mouth of a woman they are baptizing.

   Given Parks' habit of swinging between Vanderbilts and gang
leaders, it is no surprise that the exhibition is somewhat choppy,
moving from one photo essay to another. It is also no surprise that
there is a large gap in the retrospective that runs from the late
1970s until the '90s. Those were the years Parks was writing most
of his books, composing a ballet based on the life of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. (1989), and directing a series of films:
``The Learning Tree,'' a movie based on his first book (1969);
``Shaft'' (1971), which will be shown free in Bryant Park on
Thursday at 8:30 p.m., and ``Moments Without Proper Names'' (1986),
an autobiographical film, which will be shown continuously at the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   This retrospective does raise the question of where Parks feels
most at home. The last part of the show, focusing on Parks'
abstract color landscapes, seems to give a partial answer. For the
last few years, he has been creating dreamy, flowery, abstractions
in his studio by using shells, flowers, cloth and other props.
These works, which are reminiscent of some of Georgia O'Keeffe's
paintings, have suggestive, romantic titles like ``Toward
Infinity,'' ``Moondown'' and ``The Labyrinth.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if Parks realized how much his eyes had seen in
eight decades and decided to create a home for himself in his
imagination.

FORMER BROOKLYN COACH WINS DAMAGES IN SEX BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan has upheld a
jury's verdict in a sex-discrimination suit that Brooklyn College
acted improperly against Molly Perdue, its former women's
basketball coach. The judge, Frederic Block, ordered the college on
June 17 to pay her $799,566 plus accumulated interest.
</P>
<P>
   The figure included legal fees and expenses totaling $356,381
over a five-year period, $134,829 in back pay and liquidated
damages for the same amount and compensatory damages of $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1992, Perdue was the college's women's basketball
coach and primary administrator of women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   She said that in 1991, when her coaching salary was $6,500, the
men's coach, Ron Kestenbaum, was paid $45,000. As the de facto
women's athletic director, she said, she was paid less than $38,000
while the men's athletic director, Mark Reiner, received more than
$72,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perdue testified that she had to clean the locker room and
gymnasium floor and launder her team's uniforms because there was
no one else to do it. In addition, she said, male members of the
athletic department subjected her to repeated sexual innuendos and
questions about her and her players' sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
   She sued the City University of New York, of which Brooklyn
College is a member, citing two pieces of Federal legislation: the
Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Last
August, a federal jury, citing ``willful'' and ``intentional''
discrimination by the college, ruled in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, Block rejected CUNY's motion to overturn the jury
verdict and awarded damages. On Tuesday, CUNY filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the verdict is excessive,'' said Jay Hershenson,
CUNY's vice chancellor for university relations. ``As a matter of
law, there were significant errors. We are in the process of
reviewing all options.''
</P>
<P>
   Perdue now directs the boys' and girls' athletic programs at
Provincetown High School in Massachusetts. She said she was pleased
with the judge's decision and added, ``I hope this will help reduce
discrimination against women athletes at all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Brake, a former senior counsel to the National Women's
Law Center, said: ``This case is very important for the cause of
equality for women in sports and everywhere else. It demonstrates
the increased ability individuals now have to fight large public
institutions because of changes in the civil rights laws in the
early 1990s.''

MANAGED CARE CONTROVERSY SIZZLES IN WASHINGTON SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the summer of forest fires in Florida and
the home run pyrotechnics of baseball stars Mark McGwire, Ken
Griffey Jr. and others. But here in the nation's capital and out on
the campaign trail, the hot topic this summer is managed care.
</P>
<P>
   A mad scramble is underway by both parties to tap voter
frustration over managed care, which now accounts for more than 80
percent of employer-sponsored health-care coverage in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that more and more of the public is upset that the
health plans' cost-conscious method of providing health care too
frequently denies patients thorough medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   In a Time/CNN poll last week, 76 percent of respondents said
they supported federal regulation of managed care plans, which
monitor services provided to patients to ensure they are medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is incredibly potent,'' said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster. ``I don't think there will be a congressional
race, a Senate race or a gubernatorial race in this country this
year where this will not be discussed and debated in some way. This
issue will be everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Bob Castro concurred. ``This is an issue
with legs in the public mind,'' he said. Even normally conservative
voters who oppose governmental solutions are ``willing to have the
government intervene because they can see no other way out,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1998 election is four months away, managed care
already has become a fixture in campaign advertising..MDRV/.MDNM/
In primary races, many Democratic candidates are promising voters
they'll do something about managed care horror stories, usually
involving instances of medical care being denied, with death or
injury resulting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Health Benefits Coalition, an alliance of 35
employer and health insurance groups, is planning to spend $2
million this year trying to convince the public through advertising
that any effort to regulate managed care would mean big government,
higher-costing insurance premiums, and less employer coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Their ads feature a likeness of the cinematic Frankenstein
creature over the caption: ``Washington, be careful how you play
doctor. You might mandate a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition includes the American Association of Health Plans,
which represents over 1,000 managed care companies providing
coverage to 140 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is being conducted as if mandates cost nothing and
hurt no one,'' said AAHP spokeswoman Susan Pisano. ``And that is
simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Democrats appear to have an edge in the battle over
the hearts and minds of voters concerned about managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
and others introduced legislation four months ago at a time when
GOP lawmakers were vacillating on what, if anything, to do about
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something the Republicans have an advantage on,''
said Rick Reed, a Republican media consultant. ``Poll after poll
has shown the Democrats ... are perceived as more capable on all
health-care-related issues. That's a problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., denounced
managed care legislation as a sure way to drive up health care
costs. But now, in an effort to avoid getting stiffed on a
hot-button issue in an election year, Lott is pledging to bring up
a Republican version this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate task force headed by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., is
drafting a GOP version that may parallel a House Republican bill
introduced last month, the product of a task force chaired by Rep.
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. The GOP House bill, backed by Speaker Newt
Gingrich, shares several features of the Democratic proposal, which
was introduced in March.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both Republican and Democratic bills would allow a
patient unhappy with a coverage decision by a managed care plan to
appeal that decision to an independent body.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills also would assure easier access to emergency care and
would lift the ``gag rule'' in some plans that limit the freedom of
physicians to discuss treatment options not covered by the plan.
</P>
<P>
   There also are key differences. The Democratic proposal would
end the federal ban on lawsuits against health plan decisions
denying treatment when those decisions cause injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' bill includes a series of government-enforced
regulations for managed care plans. Among them: Plans must have a
``sufficient number, distribution and variety'' of doctors on hand,
must cover at least 48 hours in a hospital when a woman undergoes a
mastectomy, and must cover patients' costs for clinical trials of
new drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   None of these are in the House Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have released only the outline of their
legislative proposal, not the details. However, the GOP plan
appears to permit court action only when a plan defies an outside
appeals body that concludes a patient merits a disputed kind of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans are hitting the Democratic proposal as a
``big government'' answer, a strategy that has produced victory on
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   From President Clinton's failed 1994 health care initiative to
torpedoed tobacco legislation last month, Republicans and their
various business allies have scored phenomenal victories by
targeting voters' fears that Washington-based solutions wind up
costing them big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Bill McInturff said that at a minimum, the
GOP House leadership's proposal insulates its candidates this fall
against Democratic charges that Republicans are sitting on their
hands when it comes to managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the House Republican measure are questioning the
sincerity of the GOP leadership say that despite a lack of details,
it appears to be loaded with ``poison pills,'' controversial
elements that Republicans know will never pass Congress. Among them
is a $250,000 cap on medical malpractice liability, an expansion of
controversial medical savings accounts, and permitting small
businesses to band together to purchase insurance in a way that
would negate state-level managed care regulatory law.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have opposed these features in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Speaker Gingrich package is really about protecting (GOP
members of) Congress at the ballot box, rather than protecting
patients,'' said Joan Alker, assistant government affairs director
for Families USA, an advocacy group lobbying for more controls on
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and their supporters say that the House GOP proposal
is a sincere attempt to forge marketplace solutions to complaints
about managed care rather than rely exclusively on government. And
besides, they say, it is the Democrats who are politically
motivated to stall legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many on the Democratic side are concerned the Republicans
could pass a bill and take the issue off the table in time for the
elections,'' said Dan Danner, a lobbyist with the National
Federation of Independent Business and chairman of the Health
Benefits Coalition. ``And they don't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats agree that no bill at all would lend credibility
to Democratic campaign ads this fall charging Republicans with
indifference to the managed care issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, I think it's better not to have a bill,'' said
Mellman, the Democratic pollster. ``But the bottom line is that we
have Democrats in the Congress and the Senate who think we should
have a bill for the good of the country.''

THE POSTAL SERVICE'S STAMP ACT COMES UNGLUED 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Postal Service has announced the 15 stamps
picked by the public to commemorate events, people and phenomena of
the 1960s. Sorry, you will not be licking an LSD stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is there a birth control pill stamp, a stamp for John or
Robert Kennedy, a Motown stamp, a miniskirt stamp, a burning cities
stamp, nor a flammable draft card stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Instead you'll find a Barbie doll stamp, a first Super Bowl
stamp and a Ford Mustang stamp.
</P>
<P>
   It's like putting out a series of 1860s stamps and forgetting
Lincoln and Gettysburg, but including the invention of the
hand-crank eggbeater.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service offered 30 people and events of the '60s for
the public to vote on _ a list most certainly concocted by Cliff
the postman on ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else would have thought of including the invention of
televised golf as one of the great events of the '60s. Fortunately,
that one lost.
</P>
<P>
   From the 15 stamps selected for release a year from now (that's
Postal Service time), we can guess most of the 930,000 ballots were
from those who learned about the '60s from Time magazine
retrospectives.
</P>
<P>
   The public did vote for a peace symbol stamp, but that's
something that has made a big comeback. Martin Luther King's ``I
have a dream'' speech is honored on a stamp, but it's something
taught in every classroom today.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is: What's a Barbie doll doing on a '60s stamp?
Barbie was invented in 1959, and spurned in the '60s as a
capitalistic plot to subjugate women to false ideals of feminine
beauty and the millinery-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s stamps are divided into five categories: people and
events, arts and entertainment, sports, science and technology, and
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the '60s weren't about categories, man.
Politics, music, sex and drugs melted together in one big brain
stew.
</P>
<P>
   So here are the winners.
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE AND EVENTS: King's speech, the Vietnam War and the Peace
Corps.
</P>
<P>
   That's not too bad, except the Postal Service didn't give the
public the opportunity to vote on John F. Kennedy's assassination,
or any of the other assassinations that made the '60s more than a
toke in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon didn't get '60s stamps either,
even though their ugly mugs were all over that decade.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Postal Service got the Vietnam War on a stamp. I
just don't know how they get it all on a square inch of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT: The Beatles, Woodstock and ``Star
Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where things really go wrong. Motown lost in the voting
to some Brits, and what's with ``Star Trek''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek'' began in the '60s, but it didn't take off until
the invention of nerds in the '70s. No one who was really in the
'60s watched television. We went out and saw ``2001, a Space
Odyssey'' a couple of dozen times, and a lot of movies with
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Kids today can't believe that kids ever watched movies with
subtitles _ or movies with subtleties, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS: This is where the '60s stamp series starts to come
completely unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris breaking Babe Ruth's home run record and the Green
Bay Packers perhaps deserve stamps, but how is it that the first
Super Bowl came in second in overall voting? (After the moon
landing.)
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't even called the Super Bowl, but the AFL-NFL World
Championship Game. It didn't even fill the Los Angeles Coliseum.
It's only famous in retrospect, as the beginning of a horrible
trend in American dietary history.
</P>
<P>
   Get with it, philately fans. The most important sports event of
the '60s, by far, was the invention of the Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   I can't argue with the '60s science and technology stamps. The
moon landing, the computer chip, lasers _ those are fine. We
weren't paying much attention to any science besides brain
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The lifestyle category winners include the Barbie and peace
symbol stamps and a Ford Mustang stamp _ sorry, no VW. You know,
back then we didn't even use the word ``lifestyle,'' a '70s
platform shoe of a word.
</P>
<P>
   Balloting starts for the '70s stamp series on Sept. 1, so start
watching ``Brady Bunch'' reruns to see how the '70s weren't.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decade of amorality and bad mustaches, presidential
malfeasance, recession, oil shortages and great American films, but
you probably won't see stamps for any of those.
</P>
<P>
   You will see a platform shoes stamp, although I never met anyone
wearing them until the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows what Cliff the postman is dreaming up for us to vote
on as '90s stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of the Soviet Union? If Ronald Reagan really caused it,
as claimed, it should be on an '80s stamp. An Internet stamp? It's
putting the Postal Service out of business.
</P>
<P>
   If Barbie and the first Super Bowl got on '60s stamps, this
decade is really in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Space aliens and Newt Gingrich (maybe on one stamp), cell phones
and beepers, the Teletubbies and the Spice Girls, and the Clinton
women series. Maybe a tattoo and piercing stamp, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's all I can think of, and the only drugs I've been taking
this decade are prescription.

THE PRINCE AND PRINCESSES OF DYE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DIANA RATHBONE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One way of ensuring the solvency of Social
Security would be to require at least one gray hair as a
prerequisite for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much to realize that aging baby boomers are not
bringing about, as predicted, the graying of America, but rather,
thanks to sky-rocketing sales of hair dye, its fanciful coloring in
rich tones of black, blond, red and lustrous brown. As Jonathan
Swift remarked, ``Every man desires to live long, but no man would
be old.''
</P>
<P>
   I should confess at the outset that my own hair turned
prematurely gray when I was in my early 40s, starting with a big
streak across the bangs which gradually spread salt and pepper all
over my head.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much fun when a ski lift operator offered me a senior
citizen discount, but at least it looked more striking than the
mousy brown hair that it had replaced. Anyway, there was no cause
for panic, having completed the process early; it could only be a
matter of time before my friends caught up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, of course, in order to stay looking young for their
middle-aged mates and dates, they all started dyeing their hair.
Gail Sheehy, in her latest book, ``Understanding Men's Passages,''
hardly made news when she claimed that men approaching the
half-century mark are desperate to stave off the sexy young hunks
pursuing them up the generational ladder.
</P>
<P>
   And as one of their favorite tactics is to run off with girls
barely old enough to be their daughters, what else can women do but
try to emulate the appearance of those very same daughters?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the recent pictures of Carolina and Carolina Adriana
Herrara, hawking their new perfume, it was impossible to tell
parent from child, despite a 30-year age gap.
</P>
<P>
   Even my cousin, solidly cemented in a rock-solid marriage, told
me that her husband, in an effort to reassure himself of his
continued potency, suddenly made her wear a bunch of sexy nighties
right after his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Lying in bed in her red and black lace, hair dyed, uncomfortable
and freezing cold, she could see how silly it was, but she worried
that if she refused, his young secretary might prove more willing.
</P>
<P>
   Then I found out that men were dyeing their hair, too. This, to
me, was the equivalent of them all suddenly wearing skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I have anything against men wearing skirts (after all,
women wear trousers), but I never dreamed that fear of old age
would force even John Wayne types into such an overtly feminine
activity.
</P>
<P>
   There was something almost daunting about imagining dour war
hero Bob Dole sitting in a beauty salon, his hair covered in pasty
dye, his head under a heating lamp.
</P>
<P>
   And what did the poor man take us for? Did he really believe
that we would all vote for him just because his hair looked black,
even though we all knew he was over 70 and it really wasn't black
at all?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, apparently, is yes. In a recent survey of more than
100 leading image consultants, it was reported, quite seriously,
that men were rated ``less capable'' if they had gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ridiculous, after the gray-haired subjects had their
natural color restored (courtesy of hair dye, of course) the
``capable'' rating given by the same consultants to these same men
jumped 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true, reality has been held hostage to perception,
and an entire generation will be forced to behave as if they are
middle-aged Peter Pans. In a few more years, everyone in America
(except President Clinton and me, of course) will look exactly the
same age.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think all this hair dyeing is a little like a
medieval morality play, where everyone tries to cheat Death,
parading around in painted finery, circling the shrouded figure
that hovers just inside the wings, ready to pounce if he catches a
straying gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   A counterattack seems indicated, something along the lines of a
``middle-aged is beautiful'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers, after all, have traditionally paid lip service to
the sanctity of life's processes; over the years we have refused to
shave beards, arm pits and legs; child birth with no pain killers
was a moral imperative; getting through menopause on nothing more
than Buddhist meditation is currently all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, with such a history behind us, a few gray hairs could be
seen as an ethical requirement.

SENATE CANDIDATE IN MISSOURI GETS A WAKE-UP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Jeremiah ``Jay'' Nixon has spent the day looking for
money and votes in rural Missouri towns, an Irish pub in this city,
and a suburban union hall. He's everywhere, it seems, but the most
likely destination for a Democratic candidate for the US Senate:
St. Louis's predominantly black north side.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, Missouri's attorney general and a top Senate prospect for
the Democrats nationally, has so angered black leaders with his
proposal to end state aid for school desegregation that many are
actively working to defeat him. So it's prudent for him to keep his
distance when he can.
</P>
<P>
   The local NAACP has picketed Nixon's public events. Black civic
leaders are raising money for Republican incumbent Senator
Christopher ``Kit'' Bond. And the state's senior black politician,
US Representative William L. Clay Sr., has been trying to drum up
opposition to Nixon. Nixon and Bond are white.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is expected to win his August primary and then challenge
Bond in a November contest that has become a lightning rod for
exploding black angst within the Democratic Party. Many black
voters say they are frustrated by being taken for granted and upset
that their issues _ from affirmative action to desegregation _ are
being ignored and sometimes even opposed by Democrats, who
typically get 80 to 90 percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not unlike the Christian right's disagreement within
the Republican Party: We are saying we are one of the backbones of
your political strength, and you are dealing with us in an
unacceptable way,'' said Dr. Donald Suggs, a St. Louis oral
surgeon, newspaper publisher, and member of a group of black
leaders opposing Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict black frustration with the Democratic
Party here and elsewhere could lower voter turnout in the fall
congressional elections and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, for example, Baltimore's black mayor, Kurt L.
Schmoke, stunned Democratic officials by backing Harford County
Executive Eileen M. Rehrmann in the upcoming primary instead of
Democratic Governor Parris N. Glendening. Schmoke, who helped
deliver predominantly black Baltimore in 1994 to Glendening, says
the governor reneged on a promise to raise funds for public
education.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, black officials, including US Representative Alcee
L. Hastings, worked to defeat the Democratic candidate for speaker
of the House after a black man in line for the nomination was
ousted in favor of a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   But it's here that the complicated relationship between black
voters and white Democratic politicians seems most strained. The
rancor forced President Clinton to delay a visit to a Nixon
fund-raiser last fall until threats by blacks to picket it were
withdrawn. Eight days after the fund-raiser, Nixon asked the US
Supreme Court to end state funding for desegreation programs,
leaving blacks stunned and dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the folks in Boston know, when you mix race and politics
and money and schools and courts together, that is not a sanguine
situation,'' Nixon explained.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general, Nixon has sought to end the court-ordered
busing of 13,000 black children from St. Louis city schools to
predominantly white suburban school districts. He has proposed
instead that the state pay $300 million to renovate schools and
build new ones to settle the city's 26-year-old desegregation case.
</P>
<P>
   Many black families believe Nixon's plan would rob their
children of access to high-quality education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we can push a lot of people toward Mr. Bond,
but we've done a fairly good job of pointing out that Nixon is
undeserving of Democratic support, and that I think will cut into
his margin in November,'' Suggs said. ``The Democratic Party has to
be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a moderate Republican who is seeking a third term in the
Senate, is in some ways an unlikely choice for black voters. He has
never received more than token support from blacks in any campaign;
the national NAACP recently gave him a failing grade for his civil
rights record; and he, like Nixon, opposes funding for
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   But many blacks here give Bond credit for appointing
African-Americans to high-profile jobs and judgeships during his
two terms as governor. They also say he has worked to restore
spending for federal housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked very hard to build a Republican base in the
African-American community from the time I was governor,'' Bond
said in an interview last week. ``It would change the entire
dynamics if we get a decent vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Mischeaux, president of the St. Louis NAACP, accuses
Nixon of dealing dishonestly with the black leaders and using
desegregation to woo voters in rural Missouri, where Democratic
candidates don't fare as well as Republicans and where residents
oppose the state spending of $1 billion so far on integrating
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you choose this issue?'' asked Nixon, who recently
won an end to Kansas City's court-ordered busing with state
payments of $320 million over three years to the city schools. ``No
other politician in the state ... spoke as forthrightly and as
directly as I have, and there aren't that many rewards for speaking
your mind in politics, and this is one example of that.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... TMC faculty).''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ozawa did invite the jazz pianist Marcus Roberts to appear at a
Boston Symphony concert where Roberts's performance was deplorable;
Roberts came back the following season to participate in a short
fund-raising concert with the TMC orchestra that mingled serious
and popular repertory. There's no other evidence that Ozawa is
pursuing a jazz or ``outside influence'' agenda (Keith Jarrett's
appearance in a Mozart concerto, cited by Pincus, was not Ozawa's
idea, but the result of the pianist's longtime professional
assocation with the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, with whom he
had recorded the work in question).
</P>
<P>
   And Ozawa has never said or done anything to suggest that he
wanted the TMC or even the BSO's Shed concerts to be about solo
careers and superstar performers. Certainly the BSO's concerts in
the 5,000-seat shed depend on the stars of the music business, and
the performances of some of them deteriorated over the years. (How
are you going to tell the Tanglewood public that loves Itzhak
Perlman that they shouldn't enjoy him any more?)
</P>
<P>
   For a person in his position, Ozawa himself has always seemed
remarkably free of star-worship. Some of his proteges did become
superstars, like Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle, but they were
promising young Americans when Ozawa started engaging them; they
remained loyal to him in their glory years, and he remained loyal
to them in their times of trouble. But he has also worked steadily
with musicians he admired who were not on that level of fame, or
even interested in it, like Peter Serkin, Maria Tipo, Benjamin
Luxon, Gidon Kremer and Vinson Cole; he has steered clear of some
dubious celebrities like Nadja Salerno-Sonenberg, and recently not
renewed his acquaintance with Evgeny Kissin or Midori.
</P>
<P>
   The revised TMC curriculum which went into place this summer,
and which Ozawa intends to keep evolving, was not ``devised in
large part by (the new director of the school, Ellen) Highstein,''
as Pincus says. It represented Highstein's organization,
consolidation and implementation of suggestions made during
meetings with Ozawa, last summer's faculty, students, and such
interested parties as Andre Previn, Bernard Haitink, John Williams,
members of the Juilliard Quartet, and others. Paradoxically there
does not seem to be anything in this summer's program that Kalish
and Fleisher could object to, at least on artistic grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Pincus's new book is a sequel to his earlier book,
``Scenes from Tanglewood'' (1989), a distillation of his first
dozen years of reporting. Pincus is more ambitious and inevitably
less successful this time out because this is not just a book about
Tanglewood. He uses Tanglewood as a lens through which to examine
the issues facing America's entire musical culture.
</P>
<P>
   His eye and his ear remain as acute as ever, and his accounts of
such episodes as the planning, construction, and opening of Seiji
Ozawa Hall; the final residencies and last concert of Leonard
Bernstein; the 50th anniversary revival of Benjamin Britten's
``Peter Grimes'' are accurate, thoughtful and interesting. They
will prove informative even to people who were there. There are
lively portraits of, tributes to, and conversations with, such
diverse Tanglewood figures as Bernard Haitink, John Williams, Louis
Krasner, Lukas Foss, John Harbison, Alfred Brendel, and Keith
Lockhart. One need not agree with Pincus's conclusion about Ozawa
(``Ozawa seems to have overstayed his time; neither he nor the
orchestra is growing'') in order to recognize that he has provided
a complex characterization of a complex figure, which benefits from
the writer's travels to Japan to observe the conductor at work in
his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably Pincus's intimate knowledge of Tanglewood overmatches
his knowledge of what is happening elsewhere. The book crucially
lacks a sense of context. It is odd to find American musical life
discussed only as it has been controversially codified in such
documents as the American Symphony Orchestra League's 1993 report
on ``Americanizing the American Orchestra'' (a study whose title
the book repeatedly gets wrong). Creeping commercialism at
Tanglewood, one of Pincus's major themes, needs to be discussed in
the context of what has been happening at such other summer
festivals as the Chicago Symphony's Ravinia, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's Hollywood Bowl, and the Cleveland Orchestra's
Blossom, all of which have made different, and far more
commercially opportunistic, responses to the same pressures
Tanglewood faces.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been less meticulously edited than its predecessor.
The individual chapters seem to have been written for independent
publication, so there is a lot of repetition that becomes
irritating to someone who is reading all the way through. There is
also a light dusting of uncharacteristic error. Mezzos Frederica
von Stade and Mitsuko Shirai have been squeezed up into sopranos;
the conductor James DePreist's name is misspelled; Isaiah Jackson
did not conduct ``Gospel Night'' ``sometimes,'' but once, and
Charles Floyd went on to shape it into a beloved new tradition in
five subsequent seasons. ``Gospel Night'' is not the only BSO
activity tailored to ethnic or minority groups. Arthur Fiedler did
Irish, Italian, Celtic, Hispanic and Armenian nights beyond
counting (as well as ``Negro Nights''), and such programming
continued through John Williams' era into Keith Lockhart's Pops
today.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever personal interpretation he puts on events, whatever
reasoning and motives he imputes to people who have not stated
them, Pincus has certainly identified some of the principal issues
and dangers that face Tanglewood and, by extension, all of serious
cultural life in this country today. But he may have produced this
particular book prematurely: The restructuring and re-animation of
the TMC is one of the most ambitious and important projects of
Ozawa's career, and the time to evaluate it is not before it is
under &UR;  &LR; way, but after it has produced some results. Instead of
beginning in medias res, Pincus ends there. On the other hand, if
you're talking about Tanglewood, that may be only fitting;
Koussevitzky intended the place to be in medias res all the time.

`SOLDIERS' CAPTURES SUMMER ACTION PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SMALL SOLDIERS 
Directed by: Joe Dante 
Screenplay by: Gavin Scott, Adam Rifkin, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio 
Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Gregory Smith, Jay Mohr, Phil Hartman,
Kevin Dunn, David Cross, Ann Magnuson, Denis Leary, Wendy Schaal,
with the voices of Tommy Lee Jones, Frank Langella, Ernest
Borgnine, Jim Brown, Bruce Dern, George Kennedy, Sarah Michelle
Gellar, Christina Ricci 
Running time: 109 minutes  
Rated: PG-13 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Small Soldiers'' is the summer's cleverest package of sizzle
yet. It's a toy story with attitude, a high-tech ``Gremlins''
driven by an army of attack toys that opens fire on human gamesters
after real battlefield technology is built into their microchips.
Bloodthirsty little cyberdevils, they explode from their boxes
dressed in commando gear, bulging with molded muscle, plastic faces
sculpted into macho sneers. It's up to a couple of kids _ Gregory
Smith and Kirsten Dunst _ to get these particular genies back into
the bottle, or, failing that, to destroy them before they vaporize
the storybook Ohio suburb where the mayhem unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The film hits a hip note of tongue-in-cheek mock outrage as it
peddles crazed, soulless high-tech aggressiveness, while pretending
to send a message deploring it. As Denis Leary's cynical honcho of
the conglomerate that owns the toy company puts it, ``Don't call it
violence, call it action.'' In case anyone misses the point,
Leary's character is named Mars, as in the god of war. It won't be
giving away too much to reveal that a key computer password is
gizmo. Certainly the gizmos keep the pot boiling here, behaving
like evil clones of G.I. Joe. What's terrifying about them is their
resourcefulness. With nightmarish rapidity, they keep throwing
lethal transformations of household objects _ toasters, dish
antennas, nail guns _ at the humans and the good dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, called Gorgons, are a noble race whose appearance is
grotesque, but whose souls are gentle. They're headed by a
lion-like leader voiced with sonorous dignity by Frank Langella. He
and the Gorgons personify a longing for the natural world of wood,
boats, forests, waterfalls, and bows and arrows as opposed to
high-tech zap. Evoking such previous antitechnology races as the
Hobbits and the ``Planet of the Apes'' denizens, they have their
human analog, especially Kevin Dunn as the back-to-the-simple-life
father of the kid played by Smith, whose Sorcerer's Apprentice ways
open the door to the mischief. Dunst puts a nice fearless edge on
her character and amusingly embraces her teen banality rather than
apologizing for it.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, played by the late Phil Hartman in his final movie
role, adds to the entertainment quotient as a caricature of a
boorish gadget freak. Her taste backfires amusingly when her
roomful of inhumanly slender Wendy (read Barbie) dolls is
transformed into a nasty girl gang who get turned on by the
soldiers and are inclined to tie people up by tying them down, as
the Lilliputians did to Gulliver. The computer graphics and effects
wizards certainly keep things popping. Joe Dante, who directed
``Gremlins,'' does a smooth job of meshing the live and
computerized components. Hollywood has been at this sort of thing
ever since Tod Browning directed Lionel Barrymore in ``The
Devil-Doll,'' but ``Small Soldiers'' rejiggers the formula in
smart, high-impact ways as it works both sides of the street on the
destruction-as-commodity issue. With summer far from over, ``Small
Soldiers'' will give teenage boys of all ages reason to go on.

BOOKLET GIVES CLIENTS TIPS ON DEALING WITH LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Website is CQ)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In 16 years of administering a fund that
compensates victims of crooked lawyers, Fred Miller has seen enough
disgruntled law clients to write a book. So he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoiding Grief With a Lawyer: A Practical Guide,'' however, is
anything but a lawyer-bashing tome.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the consumer booklet published by the New York Lawyers'
Fund for Client Protection _ and freely available for the asking _
outlines the responsibilities of both attorneys and clients, with
the aim of diverting conflicts before they arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most legal consumers will never need the Lawyers' Fund for
Client Protection, but there is a general consumer need for
education,'' Miller said. ``With every loss we prevent, it is less
money that we have to pay out, and more money we have available for
deserving clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lawyers' Fund is an unusual entity that uses attorney
registration funds to compensate people who are ripped off by their
counselor. Since the fund was established by the Legislature in
1981, the trustees have restored $70 million to clients of thieving
lawyers. In recent years, the fund has adopted a new approach in an
effort to not only resolve problems, but prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   Although only a tiny percentage of lawyers are ever accused _
let alone convicted _ of cheating clients, Miller urges a
buyer-beware attitude. He said consumers should scrutinize lawyers
the same way they do other people they hire to perform various
tasks. Miller said it is appropriate for a client to ask an
attorney where he or she went to law school and whether she or he
carries malpractice insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the power relationship, the consumer is afraid to
ask the lawyer questions,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet, written by Miller and illustrated by artist George
Thompson of New York City, can be viewed online at
www.nylawfund.org. It is also available from the Lawyers' Fund, and
Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco has ordered 10,000 copies to
distribute.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips from the booklet:
</P>
<P>
   _ A law client can fire a lawyer at any time for any reason and
is entitled to his or her file. However, the lawyer is entitled to
be paid for any work that was done, even if the job was not
completed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawyers are not allowed to charge ``unreasonable'' fees. In
divorce and other domestic relations cases, clients can use binding
arbitration to resolve disputes. Clients in other types of legal
matters may have to litigate fee disputes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attorneys can be discilpined for neglecting client matters,
malpractice, fraud, misuse of funds and other transgressions.

THE LITTLE THINGS ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ant man was there, discovering two new six-legged species on
the forest floor. The lichen lady was there, too, surrounded by
green, flaky growth.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, two mussel men peered into glass-bottomed buckets
searching for pearly mollusks, while the grass guy plucked up long,
slender blades.
</P>
<P>
   By a 10 p.m deadline Saturday (July 4), they were well on their
way toward entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for
identifying the largest number of species in one day, with a
tentative count of 1,620.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the marathon was held to spark a love of nature
and to help create annual species hunts and community nature clubs
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marvelous thing; I hope it catches on,'' said Edward
O. Wilson, a naturalist, Harvard professor, and Pulitzer Prize
winner who is known as ``the ant man'' for his study of the
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and a fellow Harvard ant specialist, Stefan Cover,
discovered two ant species. ``And that ought to tell you something
about how little we know about things,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   But what the experts found in Concord and Lincoln will now be
widely known and available _ compiled for the first time in a
master bug, plant, animal, fungus, fish, and bird list.
</P>
<P>
   They used almost every tool imaginable to spot the species:
vials filled with formaldehyde, night-vision goggles, chest waders,
and binoculars. Friday night, small groups strung bedsheets between
trees in backyards. Bright mercury vapor lights illuminated the
cloth, and moments later, the expected guests arrived: moths.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur moth man John Himmelman's favorite so far? ``The
olive-shaded bird dropping moth,'' he said. The moth mimics the
look of droppings _ ``really beautiful'' ones, he said _ so it
doesn't get eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Himmelman only had to gaze onto a sheet to find his object of
fascination, but some specialists like Northeastern University
professor and biologist Gwilym Jones had to stay out all night to
find his prey: animals. The best sightings were a mink and an
ermine, although the latter was road kill.
</P>
<P>
   July Fourth was chosen for the census because it is the day
Henry David Thoreau chose to move into his cabin at Walden Woods,
the setting for his famous book ``Walden.'' It is also Biodiversity
Day. Concord and Lincoln were chosen because of Walden and because
the area has some of the oldest records of plant and animal
sightings, said naturalist Peter Alden, a census organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The idea wasn't simply to discover species but to catalog and
highlight the many species that have always existed in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to the Serengeti to see all types of things, but we
don't look right where we are. The ultimate goal in doing something
crazy like this is to have nature clubs in schools like the
debating club or football team ... to have community nature
clubs,'' Alden said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like bird watchers, finding species was as easy as
looking up. For others, like fish experts, it involved quite a bit
of diving.
</P>
<P>
   All herpetologist Tom Tyning had to do was walk along the
causeway at Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge to find snakes,
turtles, salamanders, and frogs. His two best finds were a musk
turtle, a tiny 4-inch turtle that normally stays underwater, and an
emerald green leopard frog, so named for its black spots with
yellowish-orange halos.
</P>
<P>
   Mussel experts Brian Reid and Henry Barbour waded into water and
put their heads into glass-bottomed buckets. Their work paid off:
They found an eastern pond mussel, listed as a species of special
concern in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is not a kindergarten nature walk. Most of these people
are experts,'' Alden said. ``But we want to get people interested
in what is around them ... There is so much.''

BOND FUNDS REQUIRE SCRUTINY BEFORE JUMPING IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 35 years old, and I have $55,000 in stock mutual funds
with Vanguard, Janus, and Legg Mason (of which $17,000 is an IRA
account), $10,000 in U.S. Savings Bonds, $6,000 in an annuity, and
$10,000 in cash. I also have a $32,000 IRA invested in a CD which
matures soon. I'd like to invest the CD money somewhere with good
returns but relatively low market risk. A friend suggested a bond
fund. What do you think of this advice? Any ideas about a good bond
fund?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A.F., Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there are a lot of good bond funds out there, but I
won't tell you any names until I deliver a little lecture about
time and risk. At age 35, you will probably have this money working
for you for between 20 and 30 years. That's a long time. It's
certainly true that if you put your money in a good bond fund for
about 25 years, you will see a few bumpy seasons, but the general
trend will be relatively smooth. In my computer I have a program
tracking our investments, and an 18-month chart showing net asset
value (but not total returns) for one of our funds, Vanguard GNMA,
is nearly as flat as a table. The same is true if you look at the
longer records in the Morningstar Mutual Funds pages -- the net
asset value was $10.05 at the end of 1986; it's $10.44 as this is
written. Its 10-year record shows 9.26 percent average annual total
returns. If such a pace were sustained for 25 years, that would
turn your $32,000 into $294,890.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that when you're talking about two or three
decades, the odds are almost overwhelming that stock funds will
outpace bond funds. If you were to select a stock fund instead, and
if you achieved just one percentage point better returns than we
cited for the GNMA fund, the difference in returns over 25 years
would be $75,409. I suspect you're about as spooked with the
current market as I am, so I suggest a cowardly approach. Begin my
moving $31,000 of your IRA to Vanguard Prime Money Market fund,
putting the final $1,000 in Vanguard Index Value fund. Then
instruct Vanguard to move $925 from the money market to Index Value
every month. This will spread your investment period out over about
36 months (presuming average 5 percent returns from the money
fund). This is an investment discipline called dollar cost
averaging. If the market takes a substantial dip during the
investment period, you will be buying subsequent shares at lower
prices, reducing your average cost per share.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, suppose you're still hell-bent for bonds. My suggestion
then is this: build a portfolio of three bond funds, running most
of the risk spectrum. You might, for example, put a third each into
Vanguard Short-Term Bond, Vanguard GNMA, and Vanguard High- Yield
Corporate Bond funds. From this, you might expect a portfolio
average yield of about 7.1 percent, nbased on current levels. But I
still think you'd be better off adding that IRA account to your
list of stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're talking about Vanguard, here's an incidental note
for H.S. of East Falmouth: You can reach Vanguard by calling
800-662-6273.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Shortly I expect to receive $400,000 from the sale of my
home. From this amount, I must be able to pay for my rental
obligation. I'll need returns of 6 percent to 7 percent --
preferably 7 percent. My other living expenses are covered by
Social Security and CDs. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you might consider the bond portfolio I suggested for
A.F. in the question above, which would generate a 7.1 percent
yield at current rates.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with that is that the most aggressive leg of
that portfolio -- the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund -- is
a member of the fund class that's usually called ``junk bonds.''
You'll have to decide whether you are comfortable with the risks
these bring. Junk bond funds typically invest in portfolios of
bonds graded BBB, BB, B and lower. Because of their relatively low
credit quality, these funds can experience two kinds of volatility
-- the interest-rate volatility that affects all bond funds, and
credit volatility. The latter situation makes these funds subject
to market pressure when the economy weakens and investors worry
that some of these lower-rated companies might not be able to meet
their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, though, is that Vanguard's junk bond fund is a
very conservative entrant relative to its peers. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds' last report, it held 5 percent of assets
in AAA-rated issues, 38 percent in BB-rated bonds, and the
remaining 57 percent in B-rated holdings. The average effective
maturity of the portfolio is 8.2 years, and the current yield is
8.4 percent. Morningstar reports a 10.25 percent average annual
total return over the last 10 years, and accords the fund a top,
five-star rating. (For the record, I own shares in this fund.) If
this makes you uncomfortable, you might decide to divide the
portfolio evenly between Vanguard Short-Term Bond and Vanguard
GNMA, a move which would bring the current portfolio yield to 6.5
percent, but which should give you a lower level of volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because bond markets can be quite volatile, it's always
nice to withdraw a little less than the total yield if you can
afford it. For example, if you were to invest in the portfolio that
includes the junk bond fund, but to take distributions that
represent only 6.5 percent of your initial investment, the effect
would be that you would be reinvesting a little money each month --
probably enough to insulate your principal from market shocks over
the long haul, and eventually even to allow a little growth in
principal. If you were to follow such a course, withdrawing
$2,166.66 a month, and if rates held steady, you might expect that
over the course of a decade (which would of course see market bumps
of various proportions) your principal might have grown to
$421,659.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been out of college for about three years, and after
much soul-searching I've decided to enter the Peace Corps. After
paying all my debts, I have $7,500 in savings. My commitment will
be for 27 months service in a foreign country. Where would the best
place be to invest my savings over that period, providing little
risk and the ability to take out the money once I return?
</P>
<P>
   G.M., Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you are indeed looking for little risk, the menu of
options is pretty limited and boring. You might, for example, shop
around for the best two-year CD rate and then instruct the bank
that the funds should be automatically moved into a 90-day CD at
the prevailing rate when it matures. Thus your money would be
available to you precisely after 27 months, and you would know at
the outset what your earnings will be for the lion's share of the
time. Suppose you get 5.5 percent on the initial CD and that the
rate falls to 5 percent after the first 24 months; the result would
be that you'd have $8,570 upon your return.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be a fund money market fund from a mutual
fund company. Such funds provide an only minuscule level of risk
(but, unlike CDs, they are not insured by the government) and the
interest rate varies daily. As a general rule, if interest rates
tend to rise during those 27 months, you would be best off with a
money market fund; if rates tend to fall during the period, you'd
be best off if you locked in your interest rate through a CD.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be more venturesome, you might look at
conservative bond funds. For example, just looking at offerings
within the Fidelity family, the 30-day yield on June 30 for
Fidelity Cash Reserves -- its largest money market fund -- was 5.25
percent. If you went with Fidelity Short-Term Bond, the yield would
step up to only 5.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Imagining that such returns were constant over 27 months, that
would translate to a difference of only $52 in total returns for
the period -- not, in my opinion, enough to warrant changing from
the ultra-low risk money fund to the riskier short-term fund. In
fact, the only bond funds that seem to me to offer a significant
difference in total returns, given the relatively short period of
time involved, would be the junk bond funds. But these cannot truly
be considered offerings with ``little risk,'' so they probably
don't fit the bill.

RADIO SHACK'S ELECTRONIC BUFFET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. _ In 1921, a young immigrant named Theodore
Deutschmann opened a downtown Boston store that sold leftover Army
gear to ham radio operators; he called his store RadioShack.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-seven years later _ and 35 years after a Texas
entrepreneur named Charles Tandy essentially bought it in 1963 _
RadioShack opened its 5,000th company-owned store here in the
Northshore Mall Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Franchisees own another nearly 2,000 stores. As a result,
RadioShack and its corporate parent, Fort Worth-based Tandy Corp.,
can claim they operate more stores than virtually any other
retailer, with the possible exception of McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   As Tandy president Leonard H. Roberts likes to say,
``Ninety-four percent of all Americans live or work within five
minutes of a RadioShack.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Few chains can claim greater longevity. Five-and-dime stores
have given way to Wal-Mart and Kmart. Mom-and-pop stores have been
decimated by category-killers in big-box superstores that focus on
one category of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet RadioShack continues to thrive by selling many things in
small stores not much larger than fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Everybody knows that McDonald's is famous for hamburgers, but
if RadioShack were in the food business, it would be a dim sum
restaurant, a giant buffet line of accessories for the electronics
age.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of one dominant product line, it offers a little bit of
everything for customers whose houses are crammed with phones,
electric garage openers, boom boxes, timers to turn the lights on,
personal computers, and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Huge assortments are a holdover from the old days. In his first
store, founder Deutschmann sold vacuum tubes for radios _ and pots
and pans if he could get a good deal on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold the first police radio scanner,'' said Jerry Colella,
who began a 30-year career with RadioShack in 1958. ``The
Patrolman, it was called. It sold for $19.95.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutschmann was shrewd when it came to knowing what ham
operators wanted. What he didn't understand was credit. When he
began offering customers credit in the 1960s, the chain, now nine
stores, ran into trouble, allowing Charles Tandy to essentially buy
it for the bargain-basement price of $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy's family was in the leather business, selling laces and
heels first to cobblers, and later expanding into wallet-and
belt-making kits as leisure time exploded after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In Tandy's view, tinkering with TVs and hi-fis was a hobby for
the future, and he rapidly expanded RadioShack.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chain's best customers are do-it-yourselfers, but
president Roberts, who will assume the title of chief executive
Jan. 1, sees a new breed of customer, people who are a &UR;  &LR; little
intimidated by technology and who are asking, ``Do it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people want to be connected to technology, but they're
confused and they want help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's where RadioShack comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our job to demystify technology for the masses,'' said
Roberts, who five years ago came up with the RadioShack slogan:
``You've got questions. We've got answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' background isn't in surge protectors or batteries; it's
in roast beef sandwiches. He previously held the top jobs at
Shoney's Inc. and Arby's Inc., both fast-food restaurant chains.
</P>
<P>
   That experience was perfect training for RadioShack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both restaurants and RadioShack are all about providing service
to customers, says Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Small in square footage, RadioShack has consistently done well.
But Tandy ran into difficulties when it experimented with larger
formats that depended on low-margin, big-ticket items.
</P>
<P>
   Its Computer City stores, which it just sold to CompUSA Inc.,
are 25,000 square feet; its Incredible Universe stores, which it
exited from a few years ago, were nearly 200,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by Roberts to refocus Tandy on RadioShack are reflected
in company numbers. In fiscal 1996, Tandy lost about $92 million on
sales of $6.3 billion. In 1997, Tandy reported a profit of $187
million on sales of about $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, RadioShack has had success with store-within-a-store
concepts. It offers products from Sprint Corp. in such a setting,
and telephone-related products account for nearly 30 percent of
revenues. It also has a special section for products made by Compaq
Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   These alliances strengthen RadioShack and give it more leverage
with its vendors, said George F. Sutton, an analyst with Dain
Rauscher Wessels in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What RadioShack can say to a Compaq or a Sprint is, `We have
nearly 100 percent penetration (with our stores) in the United
States; if you want to reach a broad section of Americans, use us,
but we need something from you in return,''' said Sutton, who
thinks RadioShack can sustain monthly sales increases at its older
stores in the 5 to 8 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday RadioShack formally unveiled another
``store-within-a-store,'' this one called the PowerZone, which is
devoted to batteries, surge protectors, and similar accessories.
</P>
<P>
   An ad campaign will break soon starring James Doohan, the actor
who played Scotty in the original Star Trek series.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty, who powered up the Enterprise, will be joined in the ads
by power-hungry historical characters such as Cleopatra and
Napoleon. The ad's message: RadioShack can satisfy the power needs
of even the toughest of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries, telephone cables, wires for the satellite TV dish _
all these little things are adding up in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bread-and-butter business is really strong,'' said
analyst Lynn Detrick of Sanders Morris Mundy Inc. in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Because RadioShack sells so many things _ most stores carry
about 3,700 items, including 50 different batteries, it has no
direct competitors, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Roberts thinks RadioShack's future is bright.
With the rapid changes in technology, people will need RadioShack
more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to tell us, `We love technology, we can
afford technology, but please just come in to my house and tell us
what button to push,''' Roberts said.

FOR VERMONT, A NEW RECOGNITION OF ITS GETTYSBURG ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nearly inconsolable'' after the failure of Union campaigns in
the spring of 1862, President Abraham Lincoln called for 300,000
more men to serve nine months in the Union army. Nearly 5,000
Vermonters answered the call.
</P>
<P>
   Green soldiers from Vermont's Green Hills, they would play a
pivotal role in the most storied battle of the war: the epic July
1-3, 1863, conflict at Gettysburg. After the battle, a New York
Times account concluded that a Vermont brigade ``did more than any
other body of men to gain the triumph which decided the fate of the
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow over time, the Vermonters' story got lost. Books,
films, even tour guides at the Gettysburg battlefield scarcely
mentioned their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now research by historian Howard Coffin of Montpelier is
re-awakening appreciation for the accomplishments of Vermont
soldiers led by Brigadier General G.J. Stannard. Coffin's
interpretation gets official sanction this weekend, when history
buffs, descendants of Civil War veterans, battlefield enthusiasts,
and others converge on Gettysburg to reenact the momentous battle
and Vermont's role in it.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 reenactments have been held since the 1920s at
Gettysburg. But this one, on the 135th anniversary of the battle,
is the largest ever, with 20,000 reenactors and more than 35,000
spectators expected daily. The 1863 battle involved 160,000 men
from both sides, with more than 50,000 dead and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time that Stannard's part in the battle has
been recreated,'' said Steve Wakefield, one of the leaders of the
reenactment. He was referring to a wheeling maneuver by Stannard's
men that helped break the Confederate onslaught up Cemetery Ridge
known as Pickett's Charge.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever doubted that soldiers from Vermont fought at
Gettysburg. But exactly what they did, and how important it was, is
not well-known, Wakefield and others said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Maine regiment _ led by Colonel Joshua Chamberlain _ is
the New England unit perhaps most associated with the battle of
Gettysburg. But that hardy unit held the far left of the Union line
at a place called Little Round Top on the battle's second day _
rather than on the third day, when the Vermont brigade played its
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on battlefield tours at Gettysburg and never heard
the word `Vermont,''' said Brad Limoge, another reenactor and
amateur Civil War historian from Morrisville, Vt. ``Until Coffin's
book came out, I don't think anyone understood how Pickett's Charge
actually worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainers may still say their ancestors saved the Union Army. But
historians including James M. McPherson and D. Scott Hartwig have
praised Coffin's ``Nine Months to Gettysburg.'' He draws on old
diagrams of military maneuvers, eyewitness accounts in letters the
soldiers wrote home, and other reports to show conclusively, he
claims, that Vermonters played a decisive role.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 men who joined the Vermont Brigade in 1862 were a
well-educated bunch, many with political ambitions, most in their
early 20s, Coffin says.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran soldiers, who typically enlisted for two or three years,
derided the Vermonters as opportunists, ``nine-month boys'' trying
to get through their service as safely as possible. But other
Yankees supported them enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the unit in October, just after it had formed,
private Ralph Sturtevant wrote: ``Our camp was thronged with
visitors from all parts of (Vermont) of high and low degree,
beautiful women and red-cheeked girls and their anxious faces ...
there to make farewell visit and say good-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing never was large enough or long enough for the Green
Mountain boys. Supplies were inadequate. ``The tents are so short
that those who sleep in them get wet either at one end or the
other,'' Lieutenant Colonel Roswell Farnham wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   When the men reached Gettysburg near the end of their term, they
had hardly fought at all, but disease and the privations of camp
life _ rain and chill or heat exhaustion, crowded conditions,
inconsistent food _ had taken a fierce toll, reducing their ranks
to about 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies collided just north of Gettysburg on July 1.
Union troops fled through the town but managed to hold onto the
high ground along Cemetery Ridge as darkness fell. Fighting resumed
and intensified on July 2 as the Vermonters helped plug a hole in
the Union line, recaptured four cannons, and took about 80
Confederate prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive moment, Coffin claims, came on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   On that day the Union line resembled a giant fish hook,
stretching three miles from Culp's Hill, along to Cemetery Ridge
south to the Round Tops; Confederate soldiers were massed to the
east along Seminary Ridge. Previously, Confederate General Robert
E. Lee had attacked both ends of the Union line; on July 3, he
decided to attack the middle.
</P>
<P>
   His main target was the portion of the Union line near a clump
of trees on Cemetery Ridge. Just to one side, crouching in a
ravine, the Vermonters in three regiments formed the most advanced
part of the line.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., after an earth-shaking, two-hour artillery duel,
an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Confederates started across the mile
of farmland toward the Union line.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Frank Haskell, from Tunbridge, Vt., described the
scene as the enemy advanced: ``Every eye could see his legions, an
overwhelmingly resistless tide of an ocean of armed men sweeping
upon us! Regiment after regiment ... the red flags wave, their
horsemen gallop up and down; the arms of (15,000) men gleam in the
sun, a sloping forest of flashing steel.''
</P>
<P>
   As the massed Confederates neared the portion of the Union line
where soliders in blue crouched behind a stone wall near the copse
of trees, the Vermonters rose up to fire. The Confederates veered
to one side, exposing their right flank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stannard saw the military opportunity of the century,'' Coffin
said in an interview. ``If he could move the men around 90 degrees,
he could fire into the side of the Confederate forces as they moved
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a great door, the Vermonters swung out wide and began
firing,'' Coffin continued. ``Every time they fired, they moved
closer, getting off 8,000 to 10,000 bullets in about 20 minutes.
One soldier said the sound was like `a vast mournful roar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant George Benedict, in his report of the conflict,
recalled: ``Shells whizzed and popped and fluttered on every side;
spherical case shot exploded overhead, and rained showers of iron
bullets; solid shot tore the ground into furrows.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fighting was over, the high water mark of the
Confederacy had been reached, and the battle of Gettysburg had been
won for the Union. The Vermonters had lost 270 men killed, wounded,
and missing, Coffin writes.
</P>
<P>
   Sturtevant, surveying the area where General George Pickett's
charge had been broken, observed: ``If there was any spot on that
great field of battle that approximated more nearly than any other
the maelstrom of destruction, this was the place. They lay one upon
the other clutched in death, side by side. ... Some had on (Union)
blue, but nearly all wore the (Confederate) gray, and for on a few
square rods one could hardly step so thickly lay the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy July 4, the Vermonters helped with the formidable
task of burial. Corporal Mark Day, from Essex, Vt., remembered:
``In the pouring rain, band after band of regimental musicians
gathered, the dead of both armies on every hand (as bands played)
the national airs and hymns, until a great volume of music and
thanksgiving rose from the field.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Civil war buffs who gather at Gettysburg this weekend will try
to recreate what the battle was like _ while substituting blanks
for ammunition. They will sleep in blankets on the ground, wadding
up jackets for pillows; eat from tin plates; fire antique weapons,
or reproductions of them; wear heavy wool uniforms made to Army
specifications of the 1860s _ including the long underwear that
kept the scratchy wool off their skins.
</P>
<P>
   But no reenactment can do the battle justice, Coffin says. ``One
man wrote about seeing a soldier shot near the clump of trees. His
lower jaw was torn away, his tongue was flapping in the breeze, he
was struggling just to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were hundreds of stories like that,'' Coffin went on.
``It was carnage, and we'll never really understand it.''

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Starting when she was just three weeks old in 1963, Maynard,
Mass. native Diane Lockhart's parents would pile her in the station
wagon with her five older brothers and sisters to head out Route 2
and spend ``all summer, every summer,'' at Otter River State Forest
in Baldwinville.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks on end, they would live in a surplus Army tent or a
pop-up camper, splashing in the pond and finding secret places in
the woods. ``That was all my family could afford to do, but we
loved it up there. It was so beautiful,'' Lockhart recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she and her husband have a vacation home in Maine. But a
June weekend found them back at Otter River with their teenage
children trying to relive ``those wonderful family times,'' singing
songs, playing cards, and cooking pancakes on the campfire.
</P>
<P>
   Not many residents know it, but Massachusetts has the 10 biggest
state parks systems in the nation. Besides preserving some
remarkable physical wonders, many of the sites inspire loyalty from
families unable to afford a vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   But while the run-up to the park system's 100th birthday this
summer has brought substantial improvements, a broad range of park
visitors, advocates, and state officials agree it has barely
reached adolescence in living up to its potential.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular properties _ Walden Pond, Nickerson State Park
in Brewster on Cape Cod, and beaches in Salisbury and Westport _
attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. At parks like
Otter River, campsite reservations are snapped up months in advance
by families that feel a sense of ownership of their spot.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates fear that Massachusetts forests, parks, and
reservations _ which attract 18 million visitors a year _ are being
``loved to death,'' their trails rutted by mountain bikes and camp
sites denuded and worn to hardpan.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Department of Environmental Management system, many
state officials, park visitors, and environmental advocates see a
potentially first-class resource that sometimes falls far short of
what it could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general competence, an acceptability of the state
forests, but what is so often lacking is a realization of a
creative vision,'' said Theodore Ames, a Berkshire County
environmentalist who heads DEM's oversight board. ``A lot of the
parks just seem tired.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Robert A. Durand, a Marlborough Democrat and an
avid outdoorsman who heads the legislative committee that oversees
the parks, agrees: ``There's no question that our state park system
has paled in the past in comparison with our neighbors to the
north. With a little more effort, we could really have first-class
parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the $75 million DEM has invested in rebuilding the
parks system since 1991 can clearly be seen after a 20-year period
of neglect. During that time, park money was diverted first into
pools and skating rinks, then into Heritage Parks by Governor
Michael S. Dukakis in such urban settings as Lowell, Fall River,
and North Adams, with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to major work on trails and visitor centers at
prized properties like Salisbury Beach, Walden Pond, and Purgatory
Chasm in Sutton, dozens of parks have received attractive
pine-ceiling restrooms to replace pungent pit toilets. General
sprucing-up was obvious at more than 40 sites the Globe visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our wish _ they've got the nicest flushies over
there,'' said Frank Dowen, a Concord hairdresser who has been
bringing his family and grandchildren to Otter River for decades.
``It's a big improvement over six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair-accessible trails, beaches, and fishing facilities
are being added at a steady rate. Agency officials have also begun
installing about 16 cozy permanent tents called ``yurts,'' each
with beds, tables, and small decks. They will rent for $25 a night
at Nickerson State Park and several Berkshires parks, offering
winter camping for skiiers and hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Staff and funding increases made since the meat-cleaver cutbacks
of 1989-'91 have resulted in the reopening of dozens of parks and
beaches, including the pond at Harold Parker State Forest in North
Andover. Virtually all campgrounds again have a 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week official presence.
</P>
<P>
   But DEM has at least a $100 million backlog of maintenance work.
And parks advocates see all sorts of unmet opportunities to
constructively exploit some beautiful properties.
</P>
<P>
   Demand would clearly justify adding thousands of campsites to
the 3,500 already scattered around the state, widening dozens of
fresh-water beaches for peak weekends, and beefing up
interpretation of historic sites and natural wonders.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, camping could be moved to more inviting spots: At
the state's biggest park, 16,200-acre October Mountain State Forest
in Lee, the 50-site campground sits not on one of the many
Berkshire overlooks but next to a humming electric transformer yard
and a former dump.
</P>
<P>
   Some natural resources seem clumsily handled, like Natural
Bridge State Forest in North Adams, where rusting chain-link-
fenced walkways sprawl over a marble chasm waterfall. Or Bash Bish
Falls in Mount Washington, where no-swimming warnings have been
sloppily spray-painted on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The entire system has only a dozen cabins for rent at two parks.
``They should build a whole lot more of these _ they're
wonderful,'' said Monroe Bethea, a state Department of Mental
Retardation worker visiting a new log cabin at Savoy Mountain State
Forest last month with clients for a fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises by former Governor William F. Weld and Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci to make state government ``think
entrepreneurially,'' DEM officials are moving only haltingly toward
bringing in new partners and promoting many of its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   DEM has done nothing to take advantage of a ``Second Century''
fund legislators approved two years ago reserving park-revenue
increases for DEM use, and barely tapped an eight-year-old
conservation trust made up of private donations.

 UNDATED: ... private donations.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight years after its creation, the trust fund contains $920,000
that has mostly been stockpiled as an endowment. Last year, in its
first effort soliciting donations at the parks, DEM collected
$14,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been spending money for publicity, by any means,''
said Kelly Sinclair, director of the conservation trust.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Cellucci's administration implemented recommendations
from a 1997 study completed at a cost of $225,000 that said
Massachusetts could have a parks system ``second to none'' simply
by better budget management.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts lags many states in forging partnerships between
both private ventures and resorts and environmentally-minded
nonprofit groups. One exception: Its association with the
Appalachian Mountain Club, which runs a popular and well-equipped
visitors center at Mount Greylock in Lanesborough.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Steven Kulik, a Worthington Democrat, said
the state also should encourage more responsible logging, which
would generate revenue and improve the health of forests where
``good lumber is rotting in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   DEM Commissioner Peter C. Webber, a former five-term Republican
state senator from Pittsfield, said it has been hard enough just to
dig out from decades of underfunding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to get to a place where I could be a little more
proactive'' about establishing more and stronger partnerships to
enhance park operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Howard Fife, the manager for 20 years of Wells
State Park in Sturbridge and Brimfield State Forest, is typical of
DEM's successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things are improving,'' Fife said, citing new restrooms
at Brimfield and $70,000 in buildings and grounds renovations at
Wells. But both parks badly need and could easily accommodate more
campsites and trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of potential out there... (but) we don't know
what we've got, we don't know where we're going, and we don't know
what we need,'' said Fife.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews suggest several obstacles to creating the ``second to
none'' parks system DEM officials want:
</P>
<P>
   _Geography: Most state parks are located west and north of
Worcester, but the majority of Bay State residents live within
Interstate 495 and tend to head two hours north or south to New
Hampshire, Maine, or Cape Cod instead of two hours west to a state
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do a very good job of advertising within our own
state what we have,'' said Senator Durand. At least half of the
visitors to some parks are from Connecticut, New York, or New
Jersey _ not voters who can influence budget-writing legislators.
</P>
<P>
   _Private alternatives: The extensive, generally first-rate
sanctuaries and sites owned by the Trustees of Reservations and the
Massachusetts Audubon Society meet much demand for outdoor
recreation and thus reduce public pressure to improve state parks.
</P>
<P>
   _Lobbying: ``No group has had the parks as its single purpose,''
said James Gomes, head of the Environmental League of
Massachusetts, a group whose roots can be traced back 100 years to
the Massachusetts Forest and Park Association. ``If this had stayed
a single-purpose organization, there probably would be a different
picture for the parks system.''
</P>
<P>
   _Funding: Entrance and camping fees collected by DEM are
swallowed up by the state treasury, and legislators set DEM's
budget, creating little incentive for park workers to attract more
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing park advocates, state Representative Douglas W.
Petersen, a Marblehead Democrat who heads the Natural Resources
Committee, slammed as ``a horrendous decision'' Weld's
election-year gambit in 1994 to cut fees in half, reducing campsite
fees to $6 a night and day-use tickets to $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a soul complaining'' fees were too high,
Petersen said. Webber said camping fees could rise next year to $10
as a new telephone reservation system is finally installed, but
some advocates contend fees should be brought up to New Hampshire's
usual $12 level or to the $11-$17 charged in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Along with many other states, New Hampshire and Vermont, which
often are credited with having more attractive state parks than
Massachusetts, operate their systems on a self-funding basis,
pushing managers to keep sites attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to camp in New Hampshire state parks, you could
eat off the bathroom floor 24 hours a day,'' said Robert Guertin of
Springfield, visiting the Mohawk Trail State Forest in Charlemont.
</P>
<P>
   _Lingering bad reputation: ``I think a lot of Massachusetts
residents have had the experience of going to state parks, finding
they're not up to snuff, and not coming back,'' said Mark Primack,
a longtime open-space advocate who runs the Wildlands Trust of
Southeastern Massachusetts. ``Once people stop going to state
parks, they stop being advocates for state parks.''
</P>
<P>
   One widely praised change Webber made last year was banning
alcohol in all state parks, where drunken rowdies all too often
terrorized camping families and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Webber acknowledged using ``soft enforcement. We're not evicting
people if they have alcohol automatically; we're not confiscating
alcohol if they bring it in.'' Beer cans and liquor bottles in many
of the parks' trash bins prove Webber's point.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews show the ban is extremely popular and campers
understand that it is not intended to keep well-behaved visitors
from enjoying a quiet drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good the way it's prohibited, but if it goes on, people
keep it under control,'' said Bob Parker, a retired Guilford,
Conn., printing technician visiting the D.A.R. State Forest in
Goshen with his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But while DEM gets credit for pulling the system back from the
depths of neglect and focusing on basic amenities like clean
bathrooms and curbing drunken misbehavior, many supporters contend
it has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much to build on,'' said Deb Cary, a Worcester
Audubon Society sanctuary manager. ``I don't want to be accused of
tearing it down, but it is badly undermaintained. We really need to
elevate the level of stewardship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The parks are probably Massachusetts's most underutilized
natural resource,'' said state Representative Christopher J.
Hodgkins, a Lee Democrat who has spent several summer vacations
camping in Berkshire parks. ``They're like these secret treasures.
We ought to let opportunity happen on them.''

GENE LETOURNEAU TURNED ORDINARY TALK INTO BACKWOODSY WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine -- This has been a tough week for icons. Roy
Rogers went to meet Trigger in that great corral up in the sky.Then
the conglomerate that owns the B&AMP;M Baked Beans plant here announced
that New England's quintessential baked bean factory is on the
block. And then Maine's favorite newspaperman, outdoor writer Gene
Letourneau, died at 90, ending a 65-year run as a journalist and
environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   That's two good men no longer with us, and the fate of the baked
beans that are truly oven-baked hangs in the corporate balance.
Pillsbury Co. of Minneapolis says it hopes to find a buyer for the
waterfront factory that has been churning out the syruppy magical
fruit in cans or jars for 85 years at the same location. The 160
workers were informed Monday that the Pillsbury Doughboy is going
off baked beans, but because the plant runs two shifts and demand
for the B&AMP;M brand remains strong, Pillsbury expects to find a buyer
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the B&AMP;M brand sells well in New England and in
Seattle, which makes me suspect that a lot of those high-tech types
who bailed out of the Land of the Bean and the Cod took their
fondness for baked beans with them when they went west to seek
their fortune.
</P>
<P>
   So you can still get your B&AMP;M beans, at least for a while, and
you can watch old Rogers flicks on video. But the words and wisdom
of Gene Letourneau are a finite commodity, and there won't be any
more of the columns he wrote virtually daily from 1946 on.
</P>
<P>
   In the way the late columnist Herb Caen came to embody the
spirit of the city of San Francisco, Letourneau wrote to and for
the folks who learned to hunt, fish, trap, and log before
``yuppies'' was a plural noun, or flatlanders found the forests.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Waterville in 1906, youngest of six kids, Letourneau was
city editor of the Waterville Sentinel when the boss, Guy Gannett,
asked him to write a daily outdoors column.
</P>
<P>
   Letourneau became a minor legend among New England newspapermen
for an accident that befell him in 1993, when he was alone in the
Allagash at a camp far from civilization. He'd taken a bad fall,
couldn't walk, and crawled for seven hours to reach his station
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hauled himself in, and drove 200 miles to his home in
Waterville _ with what turned out to be a fractured hip socket.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Sportsmen Say'' column ran in the Sentinel, the Press
Herald, the Maine Sunday Telegram,the Kennebec Journal and the
Central Maine Morning Sentinel. Anyone with interest in the
outdoors read him, and he built up a reputation for trustworthiness
and reliability that is rare in the journalism of this era.
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the former senator, credited Gene and Ed Muskie
for spearheading the environmental movement in the Pine Tree State.
At his testimonal dinner, Roberta Scruggs of the Portland Press
Herald wrote that the old newspaperman said: ``I'm the luckiest man
in the world. Every day was a holiday. It was just a great life.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a remarkable way with people, and his sincerity and honor
won over even the most taciturn of Maine police, politicians, and
woodsmen. ``I'd get scooped once in a while,'' he said of his
earlier years as a police reporter and city editor, ``I'd hold
stuff in confidence and somebody would scoop me. But I'd win out in
the long run. I wouldn't break a confidence with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With that simple recipe for trust, he fashioned a remarkable
career. ``I realized right away that listening to people was the
best bet,'' he said of column-writing. ``Let them give me a story,
then I'd do the best I could with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned ordinary conversation into backwoodsy wisdom,
collected in the Press Herald Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   _``You've got to be careful talking about dogs. It's worse than
talking about a man's woman.
</P>
<P>
   _``One thing I've noticed is when a man gets to be about 60 he's
not gung-ho about shooting things. He loses that desire.
</P>
<P>
   _``In the outdoors, you learn something new every day. A fellow
used to tell me you go down Main Street and it doesn't change very
much. But the outdoors changes every day.
</P>
<P>
   _``You can be president of the United States, but if the fish
don't want to strike, they won't. It's the greatest equalizer there
is.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Gannett chain's incoming president discovered
Letourneau's name and 60 years of active service on the employees
list in 1991, he thought it was a mistake, wrote Scruggs.
</P>
<P>
   The new executive asked Letourneau whom he reported to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I always reported to Guy P. Gannett,'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene, Guy Gannett died in 1954,'' said the new boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Gene, ``That's been a problem.''

AN UNLIKELY SOURCE SHEDS LIGHT ON '66 KLAN KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ For three decades, Bob Stringer has lived
with the memory of a conversation he overheard in in the back booth
of John's Cafe, a Hopperesque hangout of the Ku Klux Klan in
Laurel, Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966, and Sam Bowers, a jukebox operator
who moonlighted as the imperial wizard of the White Knights of the
Klan, was voicing his frustration that Klan elements in neighboring
Forrest County had been unable to suppress the voting registration
efforts of the local NAACP leader, Vernon Dahmer Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer, in an interview, recalled the exchange the other day,
``Sam said: `Something's got to be done about that Dahmer nigger
down south,' and he slapped the counter. Then Henry deBoxtel said:
`We need to put a Code Four on him.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the parlance of the Klan, Code Four called for death.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Dahmer was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers and his band were quickly rounded up and charged with the
killing, but the prosecution of the case was inconclusive and
resulted in few convictions. Bowers himself went free after two
mistrials.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, at the Dahmer family's request, reopened an
investigation several years ago into what remains one of
Mississippi's most infamous civil rights murders. But the case lay
stalled until Stringer felt his conscience jarred after seeing the
Dahmer family appeal for fresh information on local television in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Stringer was enrolled in a 12-step program of
recovery for gambling addicts, and step nine called for him to make
``direct amends'' to those whom he had caused suffering if it was
possible to do so without causing injury to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' Stringer said. ``I wanted to make
amends to the Dahmer family, but on the other hand, I didn't want
to injure my old friends'' from the days of the Klan's campaign of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   After agonizing over his knowledge, Stringer drove to
Hattiesburg, the county seat of Forrest County, looked up the name
of Vernon Dahmer Jr. in a telephone directory, and used a pay phone
to call the son of the man killed when his house was firebombed
1966. Stringer shared little that he knew in that first, veiled
conversation, but he told Dahmer he had once been affiliated with
the Klan and wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   The call led to a series of telephone talks and clandestine
meetings over a four-year period that culminated May 28 with the
arrest of the 73-year-old Bowers and two of his associates, Charles
R. Noble and Devours Nix. Bowers and Noble are charged with murder
and arson; Nix is charged with arson.
</P>
<P>
   With Bowers' trial approaching next month, Stringer, the Klan
leader's onetime protege, agreed to talk publicly for the first
time about his role in the case. In several conversations over the
past 10 days, he laid out an extraordinary tale, the expressions of
a 52-year-old Mississippian wrestling with guilt, redemption, and
racial reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to do right,'' said Stringer, who operates a
landscaping business in a south Mississippi community. When he was
a teenager, he worked for Bowers, typing Klan manifestos and
distributing leaflets. ``I never took the oath, but I considered
myself part of the Klan,'' he said. ``I never went out on missions
with them, but they never asked me. If they had asked me, I
probably would have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although unwilling to identify the secret witness in the case,
Forrest County District Attorney Lindsey Carter confirmed Thursday
that a new informant was ``important because he's new evidence.
He's instrumental in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Vernon Dahmer Jr. said Stringer
provided the breakthrough in his family's long ordeal. ``Bob's
coming forward was the catalyst in giving us hope,'' he said. ``He
was valuable in the sense that he was the first informant who had
been affiliated with the Klan who agreed to come foward and tell
what he knew.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the Dahmers' farm home, on a night when the
pastures were covered in frost, is a legendary chapter in the
ugliest part of the state's history, and the recollections of
Dahmer's widow, Ellie Dahmer, are as vivid as Stringer's own
memories after 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been gettin' threats over the phone,'' she said this
week as she retold the story in her comfortable brick ranchhouse,
built on the site of the home that was burned. ``We knew the Klan
was active. They would put up signs on the trees, and when Vernon
would drive by, he'd stop and tear them down. They would call and
ask for Vernon.'' The anonyous callers accused him of ``wanting to
be white,'' she said, ``Then they would use the N-word and tell him
he was going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightriders burned down a shed full of hay on the Dahmer place,
but it did not deter him from advising blacks on how to register to
vote at his grocery store next door to his home. Windows were
knocked out of the store several times, Ellie Dahmer said.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the couple slept in shifts to protect their
home. Dahmer kept a shotgun and a pistol by his bed. But with the
passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, their fears ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had started going to bed like ordinary people,'' she said,
when their sleep was interrupted on the night of Jan. 10, 1966, by
the sound of gunfire and crashing glass. ``I told Vernon, `I
believe they got us this time.' There were two carloads of them.
One stopped by the grocery, the other by the house. They shot out
the plate glass window of our house and the display window of the
grocery.'' The raiders flung gallon jugs filled with gasoline to
drench the roofs and interiors of the two buildings, then they used
burning rags as torches.
</P>
<P>
   While Dahmer fired several loads of buckshot at the nightriders,
his wife escaped from the burning house by bundling their
10-year-old daughter, Bettie, in a coat, breaking through a back
window, and falling safely to the ground. Two other children and an
elderly relative who had been living in the rear of the grocery
also retreated to sanctuary in a barn. After the raiders fled,
Dahmer stumbled outside, but his lungs had been seared by the
flames. He died 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer's death, which followed the assassination of Medgar Evers
and the murder of three civil rights workers in Neshoba County,
triggered outrage in Mississippi. Dozens of FBI officers and state
investigators swarmed into the area and traced a dropped pistol to
a Klansman named Billy Roy Pitts. One of the cars used in the raid
was abandoned with a flat tire, and it produced more clues.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, the founder of the most dreaded unit of the Ku Klux
Klan, was quickly rounded up along with more than a dozen
confederates. Although 13 men were indicted on murder and arson
charges in state court, and federal charges of conspiracy and
intimidation resulted in 15 indictments, there were few
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were sentenced to life but none served more than 10
years. Another defendant served less than two years of a 10-year
term for arson after then Governor John Bell Williams, a darling of
the radical right, commuted his sentence in 1970.

 HATTIESBURG, Miss.: ... in 1970.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In exchange for his testimony against his fellow Klansmen, Pitts
was given a brief federal sentence and was allowed to disappear
without serving a day on his life term on state charges. But as the
Dahmer case intensified recently, Pitts was found in Louisiana and
is now being held in the Forrest County jail here. He is expected
to again testify against the Klansmen, and law enforcement sources
say Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordyce has privately agreed to
Pitts' release if he cooperates with the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, deBoxtel, whom Stringer heard suggest a ``Code
Four,'' died after a mistrial was declared in his case. Bowers
survived two mistrials in the Dahmer case, but spent six years in
prison following his conviction on federal charges growing out of
the Neshoba County murders. He has long been considered the kingpin
of the Klan and is believed to have directed much of the violent
opposition to integration that once terrorized the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been a free man for more than 20 years, Bowers
was never forgotten by Dahmer's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted out of this was justice,'' said Vernon Dahmer
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dahmer case gained renewed interest following the 1994
conviction in Mississippi of Byron de la Beckwith for the murder of
Evers, the state's leading NAACP official, 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, the Dahmers pressed the county district attorney's
office and the state for action, and the Legislature responded by
appropriating funds for a new investigation. During the 1995
election, the Dahmers asked each district attorney candidate for a
commitment to pursue the case. They wound up supporting a Democrat
who promised a vigorous reexamination. Carter, a Republican, was
elected. But he, too, had pledged, ``If it can be done, it will be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the newly-elected district attorney, talks between
Stringer and Vernon Dahmer Jr. were already under way.
</P>
<P>
   In their telephone chats, Stringer was unwilling to give his
name, but a relationship of trust was growing. ``We talked about
his affiliation with the Klan, what he knew, and how he felt about
trying to help us,'' Dahmer said. ``These conversations continued
for two years, but we never met face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in late 1996, an intermediary for Stringer contacted Dahmer
and said Stringer was willing to meet privately if his safety could
be ensured.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 1997, six men gathered in a motel room in Diamondhead,
a Gulf Coast resort: Stringer and a friend known only as ``Frank,''
Vernon Dahmer Jr. and his brother, Dennis Dahmer, Jerry Himelstein,
the director of the New Orleans office of the Anti-Defamation
League, and Jerry Mitchell, a reporter for The Clarion-Ledger
newspaper in Jackson, Miss., whose stories had helped revive the
case against Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer, a towering man with graying hair and a moustache, was
identified only as ``Bob.'' He spent most of the day talking about
his experiences as an ``errand boy'' for Sam Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation as a racial terrorist, Bowers was an
erudite man, the grandson of a congressman. Bowers' favorite book
was George Orwell's anticommunist allegory, ``Animal Farm.'' He ran
his affairs from Sambo Amusement Co., a business which distributed
juke boxes and pinball machines throughout tough, gritty Jones
County.
</P>
<P>
   When Stringer was 14, living with his grandparents and holding
down two jobs, he met Bowers. ``Sam took me in like a son,'' he
said. He handled small tasks, helped install amusement machines,
and when it was discovered Stringer could type, he was enlisted to
put Klan messages on paper. One of the ``Klan Ledgers'' carried the
lines:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now listen, you COMMUNIST and NIGGERS and JEWS.
</P>
<P>
   Tell all your buddies to spread the news.
</P>
<P>
   Your day of judgment will soon be nigh,
</P>
<P>
   As the Lord in his wisdom looks down from on high.
</P>
<P>
   Will this battle be lost? NEVER! I say,
</P>
<P>
   For the KU KLUX KLAN is here to stay!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Young Stringer distributed the leaflets around Jones County. He
also ferried packages. ``I didn't know what I was hauling. It could
have been dynamite or guns,'' he said. He attended Klan rallies,
where Bowers always appeared in a seersucker suit. As Bowers'
acolyte, Stringer was able to move with confidence among the
Klansmen at John's Cafe, where he heard the discussion of the
strike against Vernon Dahmer Sr.
</P>
<P>
   While he discussed his past at the Diamondhead meeting, Stringer
told the group about his fears for his future. After losing his job
and $30,000 gambling at Mississippi's new casinos, he was trying to
come back from the bottom. He and his son had taken lawn mowers and
rakes and begun knocking on doors to build up a business. He had
controlled his gambling addiction through group therapy. But
Stringer felt he might jeopardize his family if he agreed to become
a witness against the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Himelstein assured Stringer that the ADL could help him
relocate, to start over with a new job in a new state.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer agreed to come to a second meeting, a month later,
which included an investigator from the district attorney's office,
Ray Howell.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that meeting,'' Dahmer said, ``Bob said he was willing to
cooperate by wearing a wire and talking with the Klansmen.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Stringer met with Carter, the district
attorney, and Howell at a cafe in the south Mississippi town of
Wiggins, where Stringer offered the authorities more information.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the attempt to ensnare Bowers veered into a Keystone
Kops routine. The county investigator gave Stringer a bulky tape
recorder to wear. If someone asked about the protrusion in his
clothes, Stringer said, he was supposed to explain that it was the
aftermath of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   During one conversation with a member of the Klan's women's
auxiliary, who was unwittingly implicating the Klansmen, the tape
recorder clicked off loudly. Stringer was relieved when the state
attorney general's office joined the investigation and wired him
with more sophisticated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He had lengthy talks with Roy Wilson, Bowers' friend who ran a
truck stop in Laurel. According to Stringer, Wilson told him that
Bowers had given him his memoirs, titled ``Rifle in the Bush,'' to
hold for safekeeping. ``I was told it was all about Medgar Evers'
killing, Martin Luther King's killing,'' Stringer said, and it was
not to be revealed until after Bowers' death.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer secretly taped two conversations with Bowers _ one at
the truck stop, another as they rode around Jones County in
Stringer's pickup. Stringer said he asked Bowers why he had never
given him a more important role in the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam said: `Because you were too young. You were needed to type
up the propaganda while I was busy fighting the revolution. You
were important because your propaganda caused more revolution for
me to fight.'''
</P>
<P>
   After their second meeting last summer, Bowers grew suspicious
and broke off further contact. Stringer said he is convinced Bowers
knows he has become an informant; as a result, Stringer said he was
willing to be identified in this news story.
</P>
<P>
   In their last meeting, Stringer said, Bowers gave him a final
accolade. ``He called me `a great patriot and a good disciple.'''

A SEABIRD REFUGE IN MAINE TAKES FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTERN EGG ROCK, Maine _ The sky is alive with scores of angry
terns, each screeching within inches of Terry Goodhue's ears as
they swoop past. Needle-sharp orange beaks peck the kneeling
researcher on the head, knocking his hat askew, while a few bomb
him with warm guano.
</P>
<P>
   Goodhue, who works for the National Audubon Society, pays no
mind to the attacks as he methodically attaches leg bands to the
fluffy, coffee-colored tern chicks on the ground. There's a
cardboard liner inside his hat for protection, and, not
surprisingly, it looks like a dart board from all the pecking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only forget your hat once,'' jokes Sandra Ruggiero, a
Lexington, Mass., schoolteacher and mother of four who has
volunteered for a two-week stint working with Goodhue.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the kingdom of the birds, a rare place where
conservationists have restored a natural order that humans _ and
the gulls that eat their waste _ have wiped out elsewhere. Out
here, on a 7-acre pile of granite topped with grass and ragweed on
Muscongus Bay, more than 5,000 terns, laughing gulls, puffins, and
other seabirds run a cacophonous nursery that they zealously guard
against intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Egg Rock is the fruit of a 25-year effort by Audubon
biologist Stephen Kress that began when he brought his first
suitcase full of puffin chicks to the island. Capitalizing on
public affection for puffins, whose penguin-like bodies and parrot
beaks make them tourist darlings, Kress has made a home for
less-loved birds, too, such as the black guillemot, which looks
like a web-footed pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable what's going on out there,'' said Kress, a
genial man whose trademark tam-o'-shanter hat gives him a jaunty
highlands look _ even though he's from Ohio. ``This is almost a
museum of what Maine seabird colonies used to be like'' before
European settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This unlikely museum, which has inspired imitators around the
world as well as five island spinoffs in Maine under Kress' Project
Puffin, remains a work in progress, however. Without human
intervention, aggressive herring and black-backed gulls _ which
thrive on waste from landfills and fishing boats _ would return to
drive out the other birds, including endangered roseate terns.
</P>
<P>
   So, Goodhue and the volunteers spend their summers in a uniquely
hostile world, an island so rocky that boats have difficulty
approaching, where the avian residents put up a ruckus every time
humans venture out of the one-room cabin affectionately known as
the ``Egg Rock Hilton.'' On wet days, the cloister of cabin life
has driven people to such boredom beaters as celebrating ``Black
Guillemot Appreciation Day.''
</P>
<P>
   With no electricity or water supply and soil too poor even to
grow tomatoes, the researchers are utterly dependent on the
mainland for supplies, yet largely cut off from civilization and
almost completely without privacy in this treeless place. In fact,
one of the few nods to human needs is the new outhouse; previously
the intertidal zone served as the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling imprisoned, however, the Egg Rockers feel
privileged, allowed to witness the daily drama of life in a bird
city against a backdrop of stunning ocean views of a lighthouse,
the artist colony on Monhegan Island, and the spruce-lined Maine
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Old journals of Project Puffin include paeans to island life
from such famous visitors as the late Marlin Perkins of ``Mutual of
Omaha's Wild Kingdom,'' and legendary bird guide author Roger Tory
Peterson. Journals also contain writings from hundreds of the
not-so-famous, such as Tom French, Massachusetts' top endangered
species official, who wrote fondly of his fried dogfish dinner on
the island in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the perfect antidote'' to everyday life, says
Ruggiero, the schoolteacher, who, like Montreal college student
Genevieve Smith and National Geographic photo editor Steven Walker,
is spending her vacation on the island.
</P>
<P>
   If life is hard on humans, of course, it is hardly less so for
the birds. The rocks outside the cabin window look like a barnyard
as dozens of downy tern chicks squeak for the attention of
fish-bearing parents. Often, only the first-hatched and biggest
terns survive, shoving aside the runts to starve, while chicks of
all species die from exposure to heat or rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just life out here, the way nature does its work. But
why do they have to be so cute?'' asks Walker, a bearish man in an
Australian bush hat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the death, though, few places are more full of life.
In the tall grass, black-hooded laughing gulls throw back their
heads in hysterical cackles, while baby barn swallows with
comically oversized yellow bills peer out from a nest on the porch
of the cabin. The black guillemots carry blood-colored eels to
their young hiding among the granite slabs, as eider ducks in
formation rush by just above the water surface.
</P>
<P>
   The noise of this giant nursery never ceases as parents and
chicks call out to each other through the night, joined by a
strange nocturnal addition, Leach's storm-petrels. These black
robin-sized birds make almost eerie calls from nests beneath the
cabin, sometimes waking up whoever's inside.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the puffins are the unquestioned stars, attracting three
different tour boats that circle the island each day loaded with
tourists. Quiet and quirky, these so-called ``clowns of the sea''
stand apart from the hubbub, often lined up on the rocks at odd
angles, quizzically looking from side to side like idlers with
hands behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can't get enough of them,'' said Kress, who seems
to have lost none of his enthusiasm for the birds either. ``I think
it's because they're vertical as we are. We tend to enjoy animals
that are like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists resent the public preference for star animals
such as gorillas and eagles, when others, from scarab beetles to
kangaroo rats, are no less valuable. But Kress saw a chance in the
puffins to recreate a whole landscape that humans had largely
destroyed through careless disposal of waste that caused a gull
population explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we have one charismatic bird'' among the
seabirds, said Kress, a professor at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   By early in this century, hunters and hat makers had nearly
wiped out puffins from the coast of Maine, the only place in the
United States that Atlantic puffins nest. The birds had made a
modest comeback by 1969 when Kress arrived, but puffins had lost
all but one of at least six Maine nesting sites to the trash-eating
gulls. Today, puffins are listed as a threatened species in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the decline, Kress and his team played nursemaid to
954 puffin chicks brought to Eastern Egg Rock from Newfoundland
from 1973 to 1986, digging artificial burrows for them to live in,
feeding them fish, and removing gull nests.
</P>
<P>
   The major scientific issue was whether or not puffin chicks
would return to raise their own young after their customary two to
three years at sea. To improve the odds, Kress' team put up dozens
of wooden puffin decoys in hopes of convincing the puffins that Egg
Rock was already a bona fide colony.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two decoys cemented to the rocks stand as reminders of
the landmark experiment, but the 18 pairs of puffins nesting on the
island feel right at home without them. Some have been returning
since the early 1980s to the same burrow and same mate. As a
tribute to Kress' success, wildlife managers from Quebec to the
Galapagos Islands now use decoys to draw seabirds.
</P>
<P>
   On Eastern Egg Rock, the puffins' return set the stage for the
broader goal of recreating a bird colony as it would have been
before European settlement. Driving off the herring and
black-backed gulls was enough for some species, such as the less
aggressive laughing gulls, while decoys and taped bird sounds
brought back the terns. In addition, Leach's storm-petrels moved in
to burrows that had been dug for the puffins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everything on the island that was ever known to breed
here,'' said Kress, including the largest common tern colony in the
state and over half of the roseate terns in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   And the birds don't simply coexist: They provide for the common
defense. A walk across Egg Rock quickly demonstrates why Alfred
Hitchcock went to a tern colony to film his 1963 thriller ``The
Birds.'' In minutes, three species of terns as well as the laughing
gulls take angrily to the air to repel intruders.
</P>
<P>
   But Kress, who wears a tam-o'-shanter so the birds will peck the
pompom instead of his head, sympathizes. Pointing to an Arctic tern
egg as its parents swirled overhead, he says, ``Its parents came
all the way from Antarctica to lay that one egg on that rock, so
they've got a lot invested.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Project Puffin now, Kress says, is to build
public support, which is why, after 25 years, he still answers
almost every student's inquiry about puffins. He and writer Pete
Salmansohn penned a book for elementary school children last year,
and educators for the project have talked to 2,000 students.
Recently, Kress hired a fund-raiser for the first time in hopes of
greatly increasing funding beyond the current modest
$400,000-a-year budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't care about these birds, it doesn't matter what
we do in the long run,'' Kress said.

AN INSIDER'S SOLID LOOK AT TANGLEWOOD RANCOR

TANGLEWOOD 
The Clash Between Tradition and Change 
By Andrew L. Pincus 
Northeastern University Press, 210 pp., illustrated, $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clash between tradition and change probably began in the
second minute of Creation and it will continue until the
Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   The particular circumstances of this clash as they unfolded at
Tanglewood over the last couple of years have brought the Boston
Symphony Orchestra its worst press since 1984, when actress Vanessa
Redgrave sued the orchestra for canceling her contract because of
her political views. This controversy is paradoxical, because
Tanglewood's founder, former BSO music director Serge Koussevitzky,
sought to sidestep the immemorial conflict by creating a tradition
that would be about change.
</P>
<P>
   There are many good reasons to read ``Tanglewood: The Clash
Between Tradition and Change,'' by Andrew Pincus, the music critic
of The Berkshire Eagle. It is a serious, thoughtful, and
thought-provoking book. Over the last 23 years, Pincus has
certainly spent more hours on the Tanglewood grounds than any other
journalist and probably more than any musician or administrator. He
knows the greensward as well as any individual can, and what is
encrypted on every blade of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his readers, at least for now, will turn to his new book
to get the skivvy on the controversies swirling around the
Tanglewood Music Center, the BSO's summer institute for advanced
musical training, but they will not get to the bottom of the
matter. Pincus's account seems sketchy _ it has to be because too
much of what happened is unclear and key participants have chosen
not to talk publicly about it. But it also seems partial, which may
be why the BSO briefly contemplated forbidding the sale of the book
in the Tanglewood gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pincus's treatment of the TMC controversies is more solid
than it was in his recent overheated article in Boston Magazine. &UR;  &LR; 
It has become routine for commentators &UR;  &LR; to discuss a 1994 Sony/PBS
educational video project involving Wynton Marsalis, Yo-Yo Ma,
Seiji Ozawa, and students of the Tanglewood Music Center as if it
were a schlocky and purely commercial venture, as if the TMC
orchestra had had been commandeered to back up the Spice Girls on
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Marsalis on Music'' video project was flawed in conception
and execution, but objections to it came to the fore only after the
taping was underway. By that time, it was too late to do anything
about scheduling conflicts, which certainly should have been
foreseen. At that point, Ozawa's only option was the one every
professional musician has to exercise repeatedly throughout his
career _ to soldier on, making the best of a bad situation. It
could be argued that instead of exploiting the TMC students, he was
offering them a lesson in professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the Marsalis project crystalized a
longstanding conflict at Tanglewood between the ``ivory tower''
activities of the TMC and the populist requirements of a summer
festival that must attract an audience of thousands to every
concert. It also set in motion a chain of events that led to
Ozawa's dismissal of Richard Ortner as administrator of the TMC and
the high-profile resignations of the TMC's artistic director Leon
Fleisher and faculty chairman Gilbert Kalish. There is no evidence
that Ozawa either wanted or welcomed these resignations. In fact,
he repeatedly urged Fleisher, now 70, to remain in a reconfigured,
honorific and active position.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who love Tanglewood and the Tanglewood Music
Center in particular, Pincus seems troubled and confused by these
events, events in which people on both sides of the controversy
sought to wrap themselves in the cape of Koussevitzky, who made a
natural ally to both sides because he was both firmly attached to
tradition and profoundly committed to advancing the cutting edge.
He believed that the ``eternal verities'' expressed in music could
be found in the work unknown young Americans hadn't composed yet as
well as in classics by Beethoven, Brahms, and Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has said little about his reasons for wanting change at
the TMC, but what he has said makes sense. He was not happy with
the parts of the operation he knows best, the conducting and the
orchestra program, and he wanted to restore a more direct
involvement by the BSO in its own school. Orchestra training is a
core element of the TMC's curriculum, and the school was not making
full or effective use of the very resource that makes it unique,
the sponsorship of a resident world-class symphony orchestra. In
noting this, quite belatedly, (more than 20 years into his music
directorship), Ozawa was measuring the TMC of recent years against
the very different Tanglewood of his first experience, when he
arrived as a student in 1960. The principal change he wanted was
the restoration of a tradition which withered away back in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the dismissal of Ortner was handled
badly, and that the subsequent year of transition, which unfolded
in the absence of a general manager, was troubled by numerous
administrative missteps and misunderstandings that led to hurt
feelings and bruised egos. The resignations of Kalish and Fleisher
were a public-relations disaster; more importantly, they
represented an artistic loss to Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless it is an enormous jump from these unpleasant facts
to the even more unpleasant implications of Pincus's assessment
that Ozawa ``was unhappy with the traditionalist stance of the
Music Center, which since its beginning under Koussevitzky had been
dedicated to ensemble performance and the art of music rather than
solo careers and glorification of the performer. Wanting to open
the festival and school to outside influences as jazz, Ozawa felt
blocked by `the club' (of Fleisher, Kalish and other ``entrenched''
members of the TMC faculty).''

THINNED DOWN STAIN GIVES `WASHED' LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My 48-year-old knotty pine summer house in Marshfield has a
lot of knotty pine that I think was stained with a Minwax stain;
the finish is dull. Can I put a white semitransparent stain on that
knotty pine? I don't mind the knots that will bleed through. I
don't want a painted look, but rather a sort of washed look.
</P>
<P>
   LISA COZZA, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the paneling has not been varnished or waxed or treated in
any way other than the flat stain, then you can use a
semitransparent stain, but it won't be white, or at least white
white; off-white or light, light gray is the best you can do. While
that stain is designed for outdoor use, one thin coat on an inside
surface will be OK, although it would be a good idea to get out of
the house while the stain is drying.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get a semitransprent stain look is to thin down a
white solid color stain or interior latex wall paint, and apply one
coat of that. Use water to thin down the stain or paint. How much
to use is up to you to get the desired look.
</P>
<P>
   The way to do that is to make a small mix of one part stain and
one part water, and apply that to a small area of the wall. Make a
different mix, and try that until you get what you like. Then make
a bigger batch with the proper formula and finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A roofer redoing my roof proposes to put Ice &AMP; Water Shield
on my entire roof. Is this necessary? Also, there is a lot of snow
on the roof in winter; would the snow melt bring water into the
attic? I am having a ridge vent put in; how can I tell if the
roofer has cut a slot in the sheathing so the vent will actually
vent?
</P>
<P>
   A CALLER, from Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the Ice &AMP; Water Shield has to go up only six feet
from the eaves, but it wouldn't hurt to put it on the entire roof,
just somewhat more expensive. With six feet of Ice &AMP; Water Shield
and a proper roof installation, there should be no leaks into the
attic from snow melt or any other source. While the Ice &AMP; Water
Shield will not prevent ice dams, it will prevent water backed up
by the dam from getting under the shingles and causing a leak.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ridge vent and soffit vents (under the eaves) that
prevent ice dams.
</P>
<P>
   A certain amount of trust is required when you hire a pro to do
something. If you really don't trust the professional, find
another. But to determine if the sheathing were cut for a ridge
vent, go into the attic and inspect the under part of the ridge; if
the sheathing were cut, there should be a one- or two-inch-wide
strip open on each side of the ridge board. If you don't see these
open strips, or do not see daylight through them (you won't see a
lot of daylight, but there will be a little showing), then see the
roofer to make things right. Another way to check is to light a
match near the ridge; the movement of air from soffits to ridge
might be enough to blow the match out. Or, blow the match out and
see if the smoke goes up through the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been told that if you paint your siding blue or yellow,
it will prevent any nails holding the clapboards in place from
rusting. I find that hard to believe. Is it so?
</P>
<P>
   D.Z., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Huh, wha? The handyman has heard a lot of wacky things, but
that one takes the cake. In three words, it ain't so. No paint, any
color, will prevent rusting, nor will it cover rusted nails; the
rust will bleed through, sooner than later. Painting the nails with
Kilz or any other primer-sealer/stain-killer-type finish also will
not work. Painting the rusty nails with Rust Reformer may work for
a while, but not permanently. Rust Reformer and other brand names
for the material contain phosphoric acid, which turns the rust
black and makes it paintable.
</P>
<P>
   Even countersinking the nails and filling them with putty may
not work for very long. Besides, the clapboards are only 1/4 inch
thick, not thick enough for effective countersinking.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to conquer rust is to remove it, and remove its
source. So, pull the old nails and replace them with stainless
steel siding nails. You might be able to drive the stainless steel
nails into the holes of the old nails; if not, drive the stainless
steel nails beside the old nail holes, and fill those old holes
with exterior wood filler.
</P>
<P>
   If you find pulling the old nails tedious and labor intensive,
you could instead countersink them clear through the clapboard and
fill the holes with wood filler. This is not as good as pulling the
old nails, because countersinking clear through the clapboards
could spilt them.

   Q. The linoleum on the deck of a boat cabin looks like wood and
is still in pretty good shape, but the shine is gone. How can I get
it to shine again?

<P>
   A. Some linoleum are so old that not only have they lost their
shine but will not take a shine under any treatment. But it won't
hurt to try applying a coat of Future, and acrylic finish. If it
works, fine. If it doesn't, I don't think anything will.

ONE REAL LIFE TO LIVE IN OJAI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Hey, star man!'' hails a guy on the street,
wearing a grin and a gray sweat shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, how ya doin'?'' Wortham Krimmer responds, offering a
handshake and a grin of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the street, in a small English tearoom, a waitress
confides, ``I think both Tea and Cassie are both idiots for dumping
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell them you said that,'' Krimmer grins back, biting
into a scone.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he pulls his sturdy sport-utility vehicle to a halt at
a stop sign, a neighbor pulls up alongside. ``Where ya been?'' he
queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been workin','' Krimmer responds. ``Out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of town, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Krimmer, who's become part of the fabric of life in the bucolic
artists' town of Ojai, commutes 3,000 miles every four or five days
to work in New York City, where for the past seven years he's
played the upright-but-unpious Rev. Andrew Carpenter, rector of St.
James Church, on the ABC daytime drama ``One Life to Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's had some romantic reverses lately: His wife, Cassie,
divorced him for another man; his soul mate, Tea, turned down his
marriage proposal to return to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew's pathetically lonesome,'' said the curly haired actor,
sipping a cappuccino in an Ojai coffee shop. ``He desperately wants
a family, and with all the loss he's had (his amorous failures, the
death of his brother from AIDS, his father from cancer), he wonders
if he'll ever have one.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's on TV. In real life, Krimmer has no such problems. He
lives in the small Ventura County town he adores with a family _
his wife, Mary Ellen, son Max, 10, and daughter Tess, 5 _ he
cherishes in a comfortable home on two country acres covered with
fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my heaven,'' Krimmer said. ``Ojai's such a great place
for an actor, because here, you really get away from the whole
actor thing. People recognize me, but nobody cares. It's a
nonissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really, really blessed. I am almost sickeningly happy.
I have a very good life. But nothing comes without a price tag.''
</P>
<P>
   The price tag is that looooong commute to work. In New York, he
rents a tiny studio apartment a short jog from the Central
Park-adjacent 51st Street studio, where ``OLTL'' is filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come home for four or five days at a time,'' he said,
driving along a country road that parallels the brush-covered
mountains. ``If I have less than four days off, I don't come home.
I end up spending about half my time in New York, half here.
Actually, it works well. I'm 100 percent focused on my work in New
York, and I'm 100 percent focused on my family in Ojai.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a life _ and a career _ he didn't originally plan.
</P>
<P>
   Krimmer, who admits to being in his mid-30s and that his real
first name is Robert (his stage name, Wortham, is his wife's maiden
name), studied to be a lawyer, but abandoned law school for acting.
He worked his way through school waiting tables and managing
apartment buildings; as a result, he's become a jack-of-all-trades
who can unclog a toilet, hang drywall, build a fence and fix a
doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   And when he's home in Ojai, he puts those skills to use. He
plays Mr. Mom, delivering kids to school and dancing lessons,
taking the dog to the vet, doing laundry and cooking meals while
his wife, a well-known photographer, is working in her studio or
teaching photography at a local private school.
</P>
<P>
   Although his stint on ``OLTL'' is what's made him best-known, at
least among soap fans, Krimmer also appeared in many episodes of
TV's ``The Paper Chase,'' had a role in the short-lived drama
``Family Medical Center,'' and appeared last fall in five episodes
of the sci-fi drama ``Babylon 5.''
</P>
<P>
   But his favorite character is the one soap watchers see five
days a week on ``OLTL.'' Andrew Carpenter _ who's confronted such
issues as hypocrisy, homophobia, gang violence, teen drug use,
infertility and infidelity by both his wife and himself _ has
remained what Krimmer calls ``a great barometer'' for the people of
fictional Llanview, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew speaks to the part of all of us that wants to do the
right thing, to bring out the best in others,'' Krimmer said. ``To
me, Andrew is kind of a crucible for examining humanity. He's gone
beyond just being a religious guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Krimmer longs to have his character become less church-bound and
more of an ordinary man. It was his suggestion to show the reverend
less in his clerical garb and more in work shirts, jeans and boots.
</P>
<P>
   And he'd like to do more action-adventure, as he did several
years ago, when Andrew _ criticized as a coward by his career
military officer father _ shot and killed a Middle Eastern dictator
to save the life of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew's a pacifist by nature, but he doesn't believe you put
Ghandi up against Hitler,'' Krimmer said. ``There's a kind of deep
injustice crying out, a rage in Andrew. He's a gentle soul, but
don't cross him. When push comes to shove, he'll kick your butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Krimmer, like his character, ``has got a good heart and a good
head on his shoulders,'' said ``OLTL'' executive producer Jill
Farren Phelps. ``And he's a wonderful actor, wonderfully
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor admits at least one similarity between him and the
character he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Andrew, I'm definitely someone who always tries to do the
right thing _ and sometimes falls short.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, too, might be comfortable in Ojai, a low-key town of
less than 10,000 people that has become famous worldwide for its
music festivals and for the artists who have their studios there.
Other actors _ among them Scott Bakula, Larry Hagman and Linda
Kelsey _ also make their homes there.
</P>
<P>
   It was his wife Mary Ellen's allergy to Los Angeles smog that
brought the Krimmers there, steered to the town by a friend.
Searching for a home, they found ``a major fixer-upper'' and fell
in love with the town. Krimmer loves showing it off to visitors,
from the Mission-style downtown arcade to the park across the
street, from the walnut orchards and meadows filled with cattle to
the rolling hills that hem in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Parked on a high point, overlooking the valley, a smile steals
over his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that gorgeous?'' he asks. ``I love it here. The day we
bought the house, I was coming up to sign the final papers, and the
mountains were against the sky, and the sky was so blue ... and I
began to weep. I couldn't believe I would ever be able to give my
family this type of environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountains that ring the valley are old friends now; he and
his family hike through them nearly every weekend he's home.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike soap actors who seem to spend most of their time off
the set pursuing roles in movies or prime-time TV shows, Krimmer _
who envisions someday teaching English to elementary school
students _ would rather stay home with his wife and kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have time off from the show, I want to enjoy my
family,'' he said. ``That's what makes the New York-California
thing work.''

SLEZAK'S WILD RIDE ON `OLTL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Amid the mayhem, murder, seduction and
double-dealing that for 30 years has characterized the fictional
town of Llanview, Pa. _ home of the ABC soap ``One Life to Live'' _
staid Victoria Lord Carpenter has always been the calm, reasonable
eye of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, she's turned into one of her six alternate
personalities, shot a gangster, suffocated the father who sexually
abused her, or given birth while hypnotized, ``forgetting'' the
entire pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viki's been a very busy girl over the years,'' mused Hollywood
born-and-bred Erika Slezak, who's played the character for 28
years. ``She's done some remarkable things. And I'm sure she'll do
some more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OLTL,'' seen weekdays at 1 p.m., first aired on July 15, 1968.
Its creator, Agnes Nixon, initially focused story lines on the
blue-collar Polish Wolek family and the blue-blooded Lords, plus
their Irish, African-American and Jewish neighbors and friends.
</P>
<P>
   While the show has had a loyal following, the pinnacle of its
success so far was when it hit No. 2 in 1980-81, the year doctor's
wife Karen Wolek, played by actress Judith Light, was forced to
admit on the witness stand that she was turning tricks as a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the show and its cast has won 23 Emmys, one for
best actress for Light _ largely on the strength of those
confession scenes _ and five best-actress awards for Slezak.
</P>
<P>
   ``OLTL'' has also broken soap-opera ground with a number of
stories, including: having a light-skinned African-American woman
pass herself off as Caucasian (1969); filming inside a real-life
drug rehab center (1972); filming a soap opera within a soap opera
(``Fraternity Row,'' 1988) and even staging its own awards show;
exploring homophobia and reuniting the town's warring factions
through a moving display of the national AIDS Quilt (1992);
exploring the fallout from a brutal fraternity house gang rape
(1993); and delving into the world of Latino street gangs (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the show consistently hovering at No. 8 in the
11-soap field, executive producer Jill Ferren Phelps, who joined
the show six months ago, said she and head writer Pam Long are
aiming eventually for that elusive No. 1 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are people who tune in once or twice a week,''
Phelps said. ``The trick to getting the ratings up ... is being
able to weave through enough suspense that the audience will have
to watch the next day to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which has undergone some cast changes and has more new
characters waiting in the wings, was hauled out of the doldrums
recently with the ``Who Killed Georgie?'' murder mystery, which
culminated with misfit newspaper publisher Todd Manning _ Viki's
brother _ holding the show's pivotal characters hostage until one
of them confessed to bashing in the head of the town's wacko
troublemaker/bad girl.
</P>
<P>
   That episode, which was bumped from daytime to prime time by
World Cup soccer matches, was a hit after head writer Pam Long and
her crew juggled the story line to take advantage of a new
nighttime audience they hoped might follow the show back to
daytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``OLTL's'' daytime episodes routinely draw about 3.2 million
viewers, but the June 25 prime-time episode _ in a slot filled
during the regular season by ``Nothing Sacred,'' which lost out
regularly in the ratings to blockbuster ``Seinfeld'' _ pulled in
more than 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend Phelps hopes will continue.
</P>
<P>
   For a show that's reached the 30-year mark, there'll be
remarkably little fanfare to mark the milestone. All during this
month, the show's fans will be treated to daily 60-second interview
vignettes with Slezak and other cast members. And during the July
31 episode, many of the show's characters will meander down memory
lane, remembering the show's most intriguing story lines and most
complex and endearing characters through flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   And if die-hard ``OLTL'' buffs want more, they can check out
major bookstores for a glossy, engrossing coffee table book, ``One
Life to Live: Thirty Years of Memories'' (Hyperion; $29.95) that
recounts the soap's entire history.
</P>
<P>
   Slezak's character accounts for a good deal of the show's
history. Viki's spent the past three decades publishing a
newspaper, battling mental illness and a paralyzing stroke, and
time-traveling to 1888 Arizona, to the underground futuristic world
of Eterna and even to heaven. All that, !ital!plus!off! being
elected mayor and finding love six times with five husbands (her
full name is Victoria Lord Gordon Riley Burke Riley Buchanan
Carpenter).
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite story lines, Slezak says, was the 1997
scenario in which Viki warred with her six alternate personalities
_ wounded baby Princess, angry teen boy Tommy, truth-teller Tori,
seductive Niki, gatekeeper Jean and a manifestation of her own
dead, abusive father, Victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, but it was terrific fun,'' Slezak said. ``It was
such a challenge. I wanted to make them different enough so people
who tuned in in the middle of a scene would know which character
they were watching.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANSFIELD, Mass. _ This is a love story. As in Ann, Jennifer,
Jessica, and Tabitha love the Spice Girls. So when the four
Boston-area girls were chosen to meet the Spice Girls backstage,
before the group's Great Woods concert Wednesday night, you will
understand why they screamed and jumped and ran in circles. They
love the Spice Girls. More than anything, according to Ann LeBlanc,
who is 8. And a half.
</P>
<P>
   Think we're kidding? Witness the Herculean effort involved in
delivering the children from Ann's apartment in a Medford housing
development to the concert in Mansfield, 34 miles away. First, mom
Florence LeBlanc, 45, had to phone all of her friends who have
cars, because she can't afford one. Michael Stenson was willing to
drive, but his car was on the outs. Knowing how much the girls
loved the Spice Girls, he arranged to borrow his sister's rusty
gray Chevy. Everyone piled in, and Mike took off, so anxious to
make the kids' dream come true that he drove on the shoulder of
Interestate 93, weaving in and out of traffic like a daredevil.
Thirty miles later, he wrecked on the ramp from Interstate 495
South to Route 140, 1 mile shy of the destination.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, but the girls began to cry. A dream deferred.
Then the police, including State Police Lt. Frederick Morse, who
was on paid police duty at the concert venue, arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw them crying, we thought they were hurt,'' Morse
said in a phone interview from his Framingham post Thursday. ``But
when I realized it was because they weren't going to get to meet
the Spice Girls, I decided to take them down, blue lights and all.
It's traumatic enough being in an accident. I wanted to make it
better for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a ride home,'' said Florence LeBlanc, as she
crawled, dazed and stressed, out of the cruiser with her daughter,
sister, nieces, and daughter's best friend. ``But we couldn't pass
this up. We'll find a way home.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, before we get to the good part, where four squirming girls
come face to face with four very muscular, very rich British pop
stars, let's explain how LeBlanc and company could afford to attend
the show, which at $40 a pop would have cost them $240, which
Florence, the unemployed, single mother of four kids, says is
``more than a week's income'' for her household. Let's explain how
of the nearly 20,000 fans at the show, these kids were able to meet
the Girls.
</P>
<P>
   It was free, and arranged in the name of marketing, the magical
Spice Girls key word.
</P>
<P>
   Ann, who attends the Goodwill Fresh Air summer camp for
disadvantaged kids, was selected by counselors there for the free
tickets, which were donated by a board member with connections at
Aprilia, the Italian motorcycle company that sponsors the Spice
Girls tour. ``Ann was clearly the biggest Spice Girls fan at
camp,'' said Betsy Rosen, a Goodwill spokeswoman. ``She has the
necklace, the posters, the lollipops, the dolls. She's got it
all.'' Ann, in turn, chose to invite her best buddy, Jessica
Yanosky, age 9; and her cousins Jennifer and Tabitha Belbin, ages 9
and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann would never have even asked to go,'' said her mother.
``She knows I couldn't afford it. That's how much of a dream this
was for her.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains why the four girls, who spent painstaking hours
choosing their velvet outfits and platform shoes, ended up draped
in gigantic Aprilia T-shirts, which they were required to wear. ``I
wanted Sporty Spice to see my outfit,'' said Ann, who had finally
persuaded her mother to allow her to wear blue eye shadow. ``I've
never dressed up or gone anywhere like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   So there they were, half an hour before showtime, waiting at a
side gate, while everyone else watched the endless slew of
commercials on giant video screens. Sponsorship coordinator Ken
Smith, a Scot with short whitish hair and laughing eyes, tried to
soothe their nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long? How much longer? Is it time yet?'' Tabitha
questioned, her face twisted in agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute more,'' Smith said. So the girls started counting
the seconds, out loud. Florence, dressed in a black tank top and
tight jeans, puffed on her cigarette and eyed her anxious daughter.
A smile crept across mom's face as she recalled her first concert,
at 15 _ Seals and Crofts.
</P>
<P>
   ``57, 58, 59, 60!'' they cried in unison. Smith, true to his
word, turned, and opened the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the gate were two round tables set up on the grass under
a canopy, where the girls were told to wait along with another
group. As they walked toward the tables, an entourage including
Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler passed. At that point, Florence and
her sister Janet Belbin (Tabitha and Jennifer's mom) suddenly
resembled their children. The moms turned on their heels and began
to follow Tyler into a room where VIPs sat eating things like tiny
meatballs on toothpicks. They didn't get very far.
</P>
<P>
   If waiting at the gate was bad, waiting at the tables was worse.
``I'm shaking,'' said Jennifer. Ann tried to remember all the
questions she had thought up back in Medford _ What is girl power?
Why did you name the band Spice Girls? But her mind was blank.
``Mom,'' she said, grasping her throat dramatically. ``I'm so
thirsty, Mom, I'm going to die.'' Jennifer jumped up and down, her
brown eyes bright and shiny. Jessica, nerves shot, stared at her
toenails, painted pink for the occasion. Then Jennifer spotted Baby
Spice through the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see her! I see Baby!'' The Medford girls began jumping and
climbing over one another, screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Scary!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Sporty!''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they loved the Spice Girls so much, they answered,
variously, ``They're cool.'' ``They're sexy.'' ``They have girl
power.'' ``They dress cool.'' ``They don't let anyone push them
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), in velvet pants and halter top, was
the first to appear, ``You guys all right?'' she asked, signing
each of the girls' papers with a Magic Marker, moving along the row
of fans methodically. The girls, mouth agape, were speechless. And
then, as quickly as she had come, Scary was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Posh Spice (Victoria Adams), with her new short,
slicked-back hair. Ann stared, her breathing shallow, and could
only manage a whisper, ``Victoria ...'' To which Posh replied:
``Hello there. Are you all OK? Yeah? Thanks for coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), with her high blonde
ponytails. ``Everyone is OK?'' she asked, seeming rushed. Then she
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm), Ann's personal
favorite. She watched the girls for a moment, a look of amusement
on her face. ``Hello everyone,'' she said. The girls gulped and
stared. ``You all OK? Look at you. I want to see you up dancing and
singing, OK? I'm glad you came. Have a jolly good time, OK?'' She
smiled, kind. And then she, too, disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Ann collapsed dramatically onto the grass. Upon being lifted up
by her mother, she said ``I fainted, Mom, I really fainted. I just
could not believe it. They talked to me. Sporty talked to me. This
is the best day of my life.'' Jennifer stared at her paper with the
four signatures, held it up to her mother, and asked, ``Isn't that
beautiful?''
</P>
<P>
   Tabitha held her paper to her chest and said, over and over, ``I
can't believe it. I can't believe it.'' Jessica, still overcome
with emotion, said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As the girls walked hand in hand to their 12th row center seats
they talked about this, the biggest day of their lives, according
to Jennifer. It only got better, too, as the concert proceeded.
They danced and sang their way through, as Sporty had ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the coolest costumes,'' said Tabitha, who had a
minor accident just when the show started. Her foot got jammed in
the seat and security had to take her to the first aid tent. After
an attendant wrapped the ankle, she returned to her seat and
resumed singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for the Spice Girls,'' Ann said, after it was all
over and she and her group waited for a cab, whose flat $80 fee was
paid for by Goodwill. ``If there were no Spice Girls, I don't know
what I'd do. I'd probably like KISS. That's why I'm glad there are
Spice Girls. Because they make you realize how stupid KISS really
is. When I grow up, I want to be a Spice Girl. I already have my
name. Junior Spice.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of thought and care have gone into turning Ludwig
Bemelmans's beloved ``Madeline'' into a movie, and the result is a
quite charming translation from page to screen. Part of the appeal
of the Bemelmans books is the way their childlike drawings tap into
a sunny Paris of the mind, a Paris as everyone would like it to be.
Its proverbial 12 little girls in two straight lines bespeak a
world of privilege and gentility but _ as Bemelmans was aware in
1939, when he wrote the first Madeline book, and as we are reminded
whenever spunky little Madeline leads the others into trouble _ a
world barely able to sustain the illusion of serene order.
</P>
<P>
   The art direction and production design exquisitely capture the
book's old house in Paris, covered with vines, while gently moving
the story (an amalgam of four Madeline books) into the 1950s, out
from under the shadow of war and the grimness of postwar austerity.
Frances McDormand is a spot-on embodiment of Miss Clavel, the
clerical mother figure and beacon of safety. And Nigel Hawthorn
inscribes with a subtlety more than immediately apparent the role
of the English aristocrat, Lord Covington, who owns the boarding
school property and wants to sell it out from under Miss Clavel and
the girls.
</P>
<P>
   This brings home to the other girls the sense of life's
precariousness of which Madeline is already keenly aware, having
been orphaned. The film's one stretch involves giving Madeline a
British accent, presumably on the theory that one European country
is pretty much the same as another, and that an English-accented
Madeline poses less commercial risk than a French-accented one. The
important thing is that Hattie Jones captures Madeline's
fearlessness, whether giving Miss Clavel fits by balancing on a
bridge's stone railing or getting embroiled with kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The tonalities are seen to with sunny devotion to the original
on the part of director Daisy von Scherler Mayer. With Jones
leading the way, turning in the kind of confident performance that
only a 9-year-old actor (or an 89-year-old one) can, the screen is
filled with sweetly irrepressible energies that should satisfy all
but the most demanding Madeline fans (plus their parents), and more
than a few of the last category, too. If you've been wondering what
you can take your little girl to, in this summer of clunky comets
and clunkier lizards, look no further.

`LETHAL' DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LETHAL WEAPON 4 
Directed by: Richard Donner 
Screenplay by: Channing Gibson 
Starring: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Renee Russo, Chris
Rock, Jet Li 
Running time: 123 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jokey carnage has no more dependable brand name than the
``Lethal Weapon'' franchise. One of the few things that makes
``Lethal Weapon 4'' watchable is the ease and familiarity with
which Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, and Joe Pesci work
together. But that's also one of the things that makes it close to
unwatchable. The energetic extinguishings of human life are
insufferably glossed over with a series of genuflections to family
life on the most sentimentally manipulative level. Given the
insertion of kids and newborn babies into what passes for the plot
of this latest installment, the film turns into a game of gain a
life, lose a life, played for yuks.
</P>
<P>
   The plot barely bothers to go through the motions, stitching
together its set pieces aimed at the gonads and adrenals as LA cops
Gibson and Glover chase down a vicious Chinese triad. It's headed
by the film's only source of anything suggesting the presence of
fresh energy _ the deadly young ganglord played by Hong Kong
martial arts whiz Jet Li, making a dynamic US debut in an
uncharacteristic bad-guy role. After a fireball-filled prologue
that plays as if spliced in from a previous episode, Gibson and
Glover are nearly sent to the bottom of LA harbor by a Chinese
freighter while fishing with Pesci's snoop, incorporated into the
extended family. Also working her way into the group portrait is
Russo as the girlfriend whose pregnancy has Gibson's antsy cop,
Riggs, sweating over the M word.
</P>
<P>
   One of Glover's daughters is pregnant, too, which makes the bad
guys seem that much more killable when they go after the cops'
families in retaliation for the lawmen blowing the whistle on their
racket of smuggling illegal Chinese refugees into the States. The
lines are clearly drawn between the good guys and the bad. The
chases and shootouts unreel across rooftops, alleys, freeways, and
the inevitable waterfront warehouse. Speaking of inevitable, Glover
and especially Gibson are unable to avoid seeming a bit puffy with
the cops' physical exertions, so their advancing ages are written
into the script, especially when Jet Li's insolently unruffled
whirlwind almost Cuisinarts them both in combat.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the wisecrack-flavored pandemonium, which revels
in its political incorrectness as it dances on the borders of
racism and homophobia in its humor, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' has the
spiritual energy of a dead battery. It's a bunch of high-paid
favorites going to the well yet again, trying to recycle the same
old stuff and disarm us with unearned we-are-family pieties as it
amps up the explosions. In short, it's a high-budget snuff film
posing as a two-hour-long Kodak moment. Cynical, meretricious,
unable to disguise the fact that it's getting awfully tired,
``Lethal Weapon 4'' is the best possible argument against ``Lethal
Weapon 5.''

BROWN AND TAN MAY NOT BE SO LOVELY AS TIME GOES BY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are times I wish I'd never sat in the sun.
Like the day a dermatologist removed a pre-cancerous growth from my
face and said: ``You were a sun bunny, weren't you? You'll be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 15 years ago, and now I rarely put my face into direct
sunlight without at least a 30 block on and a big-brimmed hat. But
the skin doctor knew. He's probably seen it all, girls who dosed
baby oil with iodine, slathered it on like marinade, lay out by the
pool with an oven timer set to 15 minutes and then flipped like
shrimp for an even tan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we're all paying the price.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Glogau, chief of dermatology at the University of
California at San Francisco, calls it photo-aging. He has invented
a four-level scale. The pictures are very, very scary. If you're
not careful or, if with the enthusiasm of youth you think you're
impervious, consider this: You can look old, really old at 40.
</P>
<P>
   I also asked him what a woman would look like if she never let
the sun hit her: ``Denise Hale,'' he said. An Eastern European
whose mother told her never to go out in the sun, Denise, into her
60s, has skin like milk. Not a mark on her. So, it is possible to
protect yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Suntans were once a sign of the low-born, people who had to work
for a living. Fine ladies went to the beach covered up, sat under a
parasol or a beach umbrella and never let their sun and skin meet.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Coco Chanel showed
up in photographs brown as berries, suntans, particularly in the
dead of winter, became the status symbol of the idle rich, those
who could afford to luxuriate in Cap d'Antibes or Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE AGING FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine doesn't just burn you, it ages the skin and can produce
basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. There
are three different kinds of ultraviolet sun rays: UVBs, UVAs and
UVCs.
</P>
<P>
   The rays that we are concerned with are the B's, which are short
rays and produce sunburn and eventually squamous cell carcinomas,
and the more insidious UVAs, which penetrate the dermal layer of
the skin, break down collagen, the superstructure that keeps skin
plump and non-wrinkled, and set loose those pesky free radicals,
rogue ions (think rust here) that mutate skin cells into melanomas.
</P>
<P>
   Think mnemonically: B's burn and A's age. UVAs are also present
on gloomy, cloudy days; they can go through nine feet of water and
penetrate the glass windows in cars. As for the UVCs, the
fast-depleting ozone layer has kept them away from skin thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when you sit in the sun, a number of things can happen. Sun
rays raise the melanocytes, those tan-producing cells close to the
surface in the epidermal, or top layer, of the skin which are
designed to protect the skin of races whose natural habitat is
fairly close to the equator. Mediterranean types, Africans and
Semitic peoples all have more melanin in their skins than Nordic
types or the classic Irish/English rose who turns pink at the first
lick of a sunbeam.
</P>
<P>
   If you get a slight sunburn, the effects will show up
immediately with redness and discomfort. But over time, the more
treacherous damage shows up. It may take 20 years, but the payoff
for undisciplined sun exposure is photo-aging: loss of elasticity,
sun spots.
</P>
<P>
   You see them on women over 40 who have spent a lot of time in
the sun gardening, playing tennis, swimming and boating and have
forgotten to slather sunscreen on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAMAGE CAN'T BE REVERSED
</P>
<P>
   All of this damage can be slowed or prevented, but not reversed
unless by surgical process, which is expensive, painful and not
always guaranteed. One of the new procedures for getting rid of
advanced sun damage is a TCA or Trichloracetic acid peel, which
burns off the top layers of the skin.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Says New York plastic surgeon Gerald Imber, ``With a TCA peel, a
28 percent solution is relatively effective. You just don't look
all that good. And you have to repeat it every couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Another radical procedure for getting rid of sun damage is a
computerized laser peel. ``It has to destroy the top layer of the
skin,'' Imber says. ``We can do the whole face, but it is not a
pleasant thought.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what to do if you don't want plastic surgery to tighten up
your drooping, collagen-reduced, dry, dull and lifeless skin or
laser resurfacing or even a chemical peel?
</P>
<P>
   Alphahydroxy (AHA) and Betahydroxy (BHA) acids, used over time,
can exfoliate the epidermis, or top layer of your skin, and produce
some clarity, lighten up some sun spots and generally resurface
your skin ... but don't expect too much. The change is gradual and
a lot more subtle than medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Your dermatologist can prescribe Retin-A or Renova which, again,
over time, resurfaces your skin. For the first few months, your
skin is dry, patchy, red and hypersensitive to sunshine. And once
you start on a prescribed regimen like this, you should never go
out in the sun again without sunblock on your face and a hat on
your head.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCREENS VS. BLOCKS
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to note the difference between sunblock and sunscreen.
Sunscreens _ which carry a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 2 to 15 _
contain products such as Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate and
Benzophenone-3 which are sun screens. They filter out the burning
UVB rays but allow enough in to ensure tanning. The higher the SPF
number, the more protection you have.
</P>
<P>
   If a product contains titanium dioxide or Z-cote, transparent
micro-fine zinc oxide like the white stuff lifeguards slather on
their noses, it is a physical sun block, which prevents any UVB ray
from damaging your skin. These are indicated by products which have
SPFs of 20 and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all well and good, if you remember to 1) use a lot of
product and 2) reapply every hour to account for perspiration and
swimming, which can wash it off.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, there is a new UBA blocker, Parsol 1789
(Avobenzone), which is in a limited amount of products. Parsol only
screens out UVAs and is known to cause sensitivity in some people,
as did the first sunscreen, PABA or Padimate-O, to which a number
of people have developed sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the sun, respect the power of nature and take
proper steps to protect yourself. Do not sun at high noon when the
sun's rays are the strongest. Use the appropriate sunscreen or
sunblock and reapply often. Wear a hat. Wear a tight-weave,
long-sleeved shirt. And don't pay any attention to some bronzed
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Just because they're rich and trendy doesn't mean they're right.
</P>

COUNTING CROWS GIVES FANS WHAT THEY WANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Counting Crows took a look on the Internet and found more
than 250 bootlegs of their music were available. That included
``almost every show on our last tour,'' says singer Adam Duritz,
who wasn't happy to learn that some of the bootlegs cost an ungodly
$40 each.
</P>
<P>
   So the Counting Crows took action, creating their own ``official
bootlegs,'' as it were. They'll release a double-CD of live
performances next Tuesday, consisting of their trimmed-down,
acoustic gig on VH1's ``Storytellers'' and a full-blast electric
show recorded for MTV's ``Live at the 10 Spot'' at New York's
Hammerstein Ballroom last November _ the last date of their tour.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the two CDs are being priced as one. ``It's like
$16 or $17,'' Duritz says from his Los Angeles home. ``You get
better sound quality and you get two full concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crows, whose song ``Mr. Jones'' remains one of the most
influential modern-rock hits of the decade, have nothing against
bootlegs per se, unless they're total copies of their records.
``But bootleg concerts? Hey, I have vinyl bootlegs from when I was
a kid,'' says Duritz. ``I have Springsteen. I have Petty. I have
some really good ones. I've never believed that bootlegs take away
from your album sales. They're strictly for fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly the intent of the fan-friendly Crows with their
new double-CD. ``If you're a big Counting Crows follower, you'll
probably love it,'' says Duritz. ``If not, chances are you probably
won't get it. We're not going to beat anyone over the head to go
buy it. And we're barely promoting it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Both CDs are impressive and show why the Crows, who carved their
reputation by touring, have become such a populist band. The
``Storytellers'' CD is a special treat, as the Crows strip down
their personalized pop-rock and find new ways to frame songs. They
add banjo to ``Catapult'' and a new intro to the Dylanesque ``Mr.
Jones,'' which now starts with Duritz intoning the Byrds' ``So You
Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if we didn't come up with a completely different
version, we didn't do it,'' Duritz says of the band's modus
operandi on the ``Storytellers'' CD, which he describes as ``the
real keeper of the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Crows are off the road (last summer they toured
with the Wallflowers in one of the season's most successful double
bills), but they're already starting to record their next studio
album. Duritz has penned lyrics to seven new songs, while
musically, there has been more democratic involvement from the
other Crows (guitarists David Bryson and Dan Vickrey, keyboardist
Charle Gillingham, bassist Matt Malley, and drummer Ben Mize). The
record is being produced by David Lowery (of Cracker) and should be
released by next spring.

GROWING UP GAY IN SENATOR HELMS'S STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DEAR JESSE 
Documentary written and directed by: Tim Kirkman 
Running time: 81 minutes 
Rated: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Helms _ and William Weld will bear me out on this _ is
against a lot of things. Tim Kirkman's autobiographgical memoir,
``Dear Jesse,'' reminds us that the Republican senator is against
abortion rights and federal funding for the arts, among other
things. While Helms would not vote against tobacco, he almost
certainly would turn thumbs down on Kirkman's gentle documentary,
which juxtaposes Kirkman's own personal history as a gay man
growing up in Monroe, N.C., with a scrapbook chronicling Helms's
rise as a conservative politician there following stints as a
newspaper columnist and TV commentator that made him, if not rich,
media-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   When Helms spoke out against the staging of the gay-themed
Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Angels in America'' in Charlotte, N.C., he
said, ``I didn't see any point in a naked man cavorting around the
stage.'' No naked man cavorts around the stage in Tony Kushner's
play, a point obscured in what passes for aesthetic debate in
Helms's circle. But the useful thing about ``Dear Jesse'' is that
it snaps the viewer out of any feeling of intellectual smugness and
back to stark reality with interviews in Helms's home state that
leave no doubt about Helms's vast popularity there.
</P>
<P>
   More than one voter says that he or she doesn't like Helms's
history, but that at least they know where they stand with Helms
and believe he'll keep his word. Leaving aside that the same could
have been said of Hitler or Stalin or Mao, it sheds some light on
the reason Helms gets voted in year after year, anachronism that he
is, with his appeals to ignorance. Without ever resorting to
stridency, Kirkman, who long ago moved to Helms's version of Sodom
and Gomorrah _ New York _ shows Helms shrewdly manipulating
attention away from his tobacco-based financing.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's technique is simple but, so far, effective. Helms
divisively scapegoats the arts and minorities ranging from
African-Americans to gays and lesbians, while righteously
proclaiming in passing that people who die of AIDS deserve what
they get. Kirkman's personal diary, with its homegrown flavor, is
on the soft side, but the link between Kirkman's departure for a
more tolerant environment and the kind of thinking Helms embodies
is made trenchantly clear. ``Dear Jesse'' doesn't raise its voice
to make its points. With Helms doing most of the talking, it
doesn't have to.

`LAND GIRLS' TILLS ROCKY SOIL IN WWII FARM DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LAND GIRLS 
Directed by: David Leland 
Screenplay by: Leland, Peter Prince (novel: Angela Hurth) 
Starring: Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel, Steven
Mackintosh, Tom Georgeson, Maureen O'Brien 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: R (some sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Land Girls,'' writer-director David Leland gets the
hard part right. He richly invokes the wartime 1940s, specifically
life on a British farm where the hastily-recruited Women's Land
Army has been summoned to fill in for the men called to war and
keep the food coming. Skepticism and sexist wisecracks are quickly
silenced by the diligence and competence with which three young
women _ the so-called Land Girls of the title _ from different
backgrounds pitch in and get the job done, often ankle-deep in muck
and manure, and never with any complaining.
</P>
<P>
   From the turbans to the tweed jackets everyone wore to work,
``The Land Girls'' puts you on the farm managed by Tom Georgeson's
crusty patriarch, whose misgivings about the women's abilities
quickly give way to admiration as they keep the farm going,
although with more spirit and independence than he's used to
encountering in his docile wife. Leland, who made his mark as a
director sympathetic to strong women in ``Wish You Were Here,''
skillfully integrates a rather too obviously orchestrated trio of
characters _ Rachel Weisz's cerebral university grad, Anna Friel's
sassy hairdresser, and Catherine McCormack's introspective
romantic, waiting for the war to end so she can marry her naval
officer fiance.
</P>
<P>
   What they share is an attraction to the farmer's grown son,
Steven Mackintosh's Joe, who dreams of being a flier, but never is
called to service because of health problems and the high priority
assigned to keeping the farm running. They each take turns bedding
him, partly out of curiosity and a desire to get their respective
sexual initiations out of the way. Each goes on to other love, some
of it predictably tragic, although one remains emotionally attached
to him _ giving rise to a poignant epilogue. But the characters
seem fuller than the emotional trajectories they're assigned.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``The Land Girls'' doesn't provide enough story to go
with its superb atmospherics. The harshness of the farm regimen _
and the integrity of that harshness _ is never matched by the
almost slickly mechanical channelings of the Land Girls's emotions.
Weisz, McCormack, and Friel certainly provide enough contour to
establish each of the three as distinct personalities, but the
hoped-for sense of heightened chanciness thrown at young hearts by
the imperatives and chaos of war never materializes. Nor does any
sense of romantic destiny. ``The Land Girls'' looks great and
convinces us it got where it wanted to go, but only geographically.
Emotionally, it's earthbound.

LYRICAL `PASSION' BONDS MAN AND NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
PASSION IN THE DESERT 
Directed by: Lavinia Currier 
Screenplay by: Currier, Martin Edmunds (novella: Balzac) 
Starring: Ben Daniels, Michel Piccoli, Paul Meston, Kenneth
Collard, Nadi Odeh, Auda Mohammed Badoul 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (violence, including some depictions of barbarism, and
for nudity) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Passion in the Desert'' is an oddly beautiful little nonesuch
that beats the odds and succeeds as a compelling contemplation of
the distance between man and nature as played out in the
relationship between a soldier and a leopard in the desert. The
story, adapted from a novella by Balzac, rides the fascination of
the French novelist and his age with the exotic,as an officer in
Napoleon's army, cut off from his regiment, finds the trappings of
the Age of Enlightenment stripped away with astonishing haste and
completeness as he's absorbed into the reality of the desert world.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen ways in which this film could have gone
ludicrously wrong, but the conviction of writer-director Lavinia
Currier sustains the delicate visual fabric, enhanced no end by the
cinematography of Alexei Rodionov. He takes full advantage of the
hallucinatory possibilities of the displacement experienced by the
strung-out officer, who staggers into a cave on the edge of a
ruined city, a place feared by pursuing bedouins. It's ruled by a
leopard whose presence is first revealed to the fugitive as a
Blakean pair of amber eyes glowing in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of eating the soldier, however, the leopard takes a
shine to him, leads him to water, and even shares its catch. What
follows is at times dreamlike, helped by the necessary absence of
dialogue. That which had gone before, in a prologue with Ben
Daniels's soldier leading a visionary painter played by Michel
Piccoli is not, to put it softly, credibility-enhancing. It helps
that Daniels is lithe enough to get with the crouching and body
language and feline moves he finds himself slipping into as he
enters the leopard's world, sometimes tensely, sometimes
wonderstruck at the animal's unexpected acceptance of him. The film
even succeeds in combining the lyrical and the sensual in a moment
when they touch pleasurably.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brave gamble, brought off. So is the moment when the
soldier can't shed his rational mindset fast enough as he cakes
himself with mud and dabs spots onto himself with a charred stick,
rendering himself leopardlike, recalling the painter's remark that
in the desert a man forgets he even has a name. The receding of
civilization and onset of otherworldly strangeness eclipse one's
marveling at the performance of the leopard (actually three cats
bred for the film) willing to allow the soldier to co-exist, then
cohabit, with it. Eventually, of course, the man must decide
between final immersion in nature or return to civilization. It's
to the film's credit that the ending is both dignified and
believable as Balzac's parable is brought full circle in this
steadily absorbing take on a kind of purity that has all but
vanished from films.

STAFF FEARS NEW YORKER REVAMP IN WAKE OF BROWN DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day after Tina Brown announced she was quitting
her job as editor of The New Yorker, her staffers started worrying
the magazine might soon be pushed into changes as deep and
unnerving as those that Brown herself fostered when she took over
the esteemed publication six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big fear,'' said one longtime senior editor, who asked not
to be identified, is that Conde Nast, the magazine's owner, will
turn the weekly into a biweekly or even a monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the end of The New Yorker, as we know it,'' the
senior editor said Thursday. Articles would be less timely and
news-breaking _ and there would be far fewer articles, which would
discourage, and may prompt the departure of, its most prolific
writers.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker has been in dreadful financial shape for the past
several years _ a state of affairs which an article in this month's
Fortune magazine attributes more to the owners than to the editor.
Brown boosted circulation during her reign from 500,000 to 800,000
_ but, last year alone, the magazine lost $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries many of us,'' the senior editor said, ``is that
the problem will be defined as 'too high editorial costs''' _ and
that those costs will then be slashed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of turning it into a biweekly or monthly has ``been in
the wind for a long time, even before Tina got there,'' the senior
editor said. Brown, the editor said, ``always resisted'' the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Si Newhouse, the 70-year-old billionaire who owns Conde Nast,
paid a rare visit to The New Yorker's offices Thursday morning,
partly to relieve fears.
</P>
<P>
   One staff writer who attended the meeting said Newhouse was
asked whether Draconian cuts would be imposed on the editorial
budget and whether the magazine would go biweekly or monthly.
Newhouse said, ``No,'' to both.
</P>
<P>
   However, one skeptic noted that Newhouse also pledged to keep
then-editor William Shawn onboard when he bought The New Yorker in
1985 _ and then fired him two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse has not yet chosen a replacement for Brown. He told the
assembled staff members Thursday he would not rush into a decision
but hoped to make an announcement next week.
</P>
<P>
   One Conde Nast insider, who also asked for anonymity, said
Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, was called to a meeting
with Newhouse Wednesday evening to discuss the job.
</P>
<P>
   According to the insider, Carter said he would rather stay at
Vanity Fair _ also owned by Conde Nast. Brown was Vanity Fair's
editor _ and transformed that magazine, commercially and otherwise
_ before she joined The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Many names have been bandied about as possible replacements, but
some of these named say they have not been contacted by anyone.
Even the rumor-mongers admit nobody really knows who the new editor
will be.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers Thursday noted that Newhouse's meeting with
Carter might suggest little interest in changing the basic
direction of the Brown-era New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 44, has been hailed and reviled for taking the country's
most serious literary and political magazine and making it more
glitzy, commercial and occasionally sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some critics concede her magazine is more
consistently interesting than it was under her immediate
predecessor, Robert Gottlieb, and that she cultivated writers _
such as David Remnick, Jeffrey Toobin, Henry Louis Gates, and
Anthony Lane _ who are now considered among the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   Brown announced Wednesday she will be joining Miramax, the
independent film production company owned by Disney, where she will
run a multi-media enterprise involving a magazine, movies, and
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker's spokeswoman, Maurie Perl, elaborated in an
interview Thursday that Brown's new magazine will be a monthly,
with its first issue slated for the Fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The new magazine will up the stakes on a growing ``synergy''
between Hollywood and the publishing world, in which film producers
more and more seek ideas from magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are certain properties from this magazine that will
lend themselves to future film or TV productions,'' Perl said,
``then, before they get optioned or sold to other studios, Miramax
will be in the position to make these deals happen for their own
company.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she emphasized, it ``will be a stand-alone magazine
first,'' just as her New Yorker and Vanity Fair were.
</P>
<P>
   One senior editor at The New Yorker said Thursday that Brown
quit of her own accord and was not about to be pushed out by Conde
Nast. The main factors were the recent death of her mother _ ``one
of those 'life-is-short' epiphanies'' _ and Fortune's recent
article, which ``may have solidified her impession'' that The New
Yorker's financial problems were ``systemic and insolvable.''

TENNIS HALL READIES ROOM FOR THE TWO-FISTED BASHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Jimmy Connors' Records text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ He swaggered in like an old-time saloon fighter,
letting it be known he could beat any man in the house.
</P>
<P>
   And he did, eight out of every 10 times anyway, over a stretch
of two decades, a two-fisted belterweight whose constant striving
for knockout punches gave tennis the lusty flavor of prizefighting.
That was _ and is _ James Scott Connors, the 45-year-old Brash
Basher from Belleville, who tells you in no uncertain terms: ``I am
not retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when he can yet command attention, big bucks and the
respectful handshakes of his prey on the Nuveen geezers circuit,
generally known as the Connors Tour, which comes to Boston Aug. 5.
No, not while he's moonlighting for the Kansas City Explorers of
World Team Tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jimmy Connors, the icon, agreed to put the Newport Casino
on his dance card for Saturday afternoon. Flying in from Kansas
City after the Explorers' match tonight against Idaho, he'll stick
around long enough to be lionized and canonized at the
International Tennis Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   When recently he was elected to the Hall, there was some concern
that he'd give it a miss as an archrival, Bjorn Borg, did in 1987.
Ever a maverick, not overly fond of tradition or pomp, Connors had
skipped the assemblages of champions at the Wimbledon Centenary of
1977 and the unveiling of Arthur Ashe Stadium last August at the US
Open.
</P>
<P>
   But, jagged edges smoothed considerably, he'll show on
semifinals day of the Miller Hall of Fame tournament. ``Absolutely.
I've never been to Newport, and I'm anxious to see the Hall,'' he
said. ``I'm very honored to go in with the greats.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be accompanied by wife, Patty, two kids and his determined
mother. Gloria Connors, a good amateur player herself, built a
court in their Belleville, Ill., backyard, and reared her ``Jimbo''
to be a champ of such enduring intensity and accomplishment that he
resided in the pros' planetary top 10 for 16 successive years, No.
1 five straight (1974-78), both records.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, they were an insular trio _ Jimbo and Gloria
plus manager Bill Riordan _ against the world, usually winning,
relishing their anti-establishment success. Connors turned his back
on the men's union, ATP, and Davis Cup, while turning his withering
double-handed backhand loose to play and win more matches and
tournaments than any other guy ever.
</P>
<P>
   He was one-third of another '70s trio _ with first great love,
Chris Evert, and first great hate, Borg _ who changed the look of
the game. Until them, occasional two-handed backhanders were looked
on as freaks. Today their style is high church orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Of Connors's Everestian 109 singles titles (Pete Sampras, with
55, doesn't even hallucinate about climbing that high), the first
of consequence was taken at Longwood a quarter-century ago. He
arrived, slight of build but ready to conquer. Socks and confidence
high, helmeted in Prince Valiant coiffure, he was twirling that
distinctive lightning rod: the Wilson T2000 steelie with its small
head and big control problems.
</P>
<P>
   No problem for Jimmy. He attacked boldly from the baseline with
it, and responded boldly, too, when he saw that he was not only
unfairly unseeded in the US Pro but scheduled to face world No. 1
Stan Smith in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to beat him somewhere, and if I can't do it in the
first round, I don't deserve to win anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnetically flinging his wispy self at every ball as though it
were match point, Jimmy beat Smith and two other seeds, climaxing
in his national TV debut with a gritty five-set triumph over No. 5
Ashe. Said Ashe, ``I never played anybody who hit the ball so hard
for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   That seeding injustice and his barring from the French Open the
following year did nothing to improve Jimmy's regard for ``them''
in his them-against-me struggle. His towering 1974 is another
Connors summit unlikely to be scaled: US, Wimbledon, Australian
crowns among 15 titles on a 99-4 match record. Yet he was gallingly
deprived of a shot at a Grand Slam by officious French refusal to
accept his entry.
</P>
<P>
   As a player for the short-lived Baltimore Banners of World Team
Tennis, he was ruled off, victim of now forgotten political strife,
the brief French war against WTT. Though justifiably outraged, he
may have cost himself that major title by boycotting Paris until
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Small town kid, he took to New York like Sherman to Atlanta,
although the Apple adored being baked in his flames. For almost 20
years, Jimmy Connors was the US Open and the US Open was Jimmy
Connors. ``New Yorkers pushed me to my best,'' he says of the love
affair that brought forth five championships in seven finals as
well as seven other semifinal runs. ``I left my blood on that
court, and people knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   There, at Flushing Meadow, the transformation from prickly
upstart to icon began in 1978 as he roused crowds with animated
self-pumping, appealing for their help, literally baying at the
moon and sun. His Forest Hills triumphs at the starchy West Side
Tennis Club, on grass in 1974 and clay in 1976, rankled many
because he struttingly beat the estimable Ken Rosewall and Borg.
</P>
<P>
   But at Flushing he became the man of the people, never more so
than in his Indian Summer performance of 1991. As a lowly ranked
39-year-old wild card he staged a wild charge to the semis,
electrifying the country during a reborn fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, often put down as a personality-zero champ, concedes,
``No doubt Connors's era had more excitement. You had him, John
McEnroe, Bjorn Borg, Ivan Lendl with different personalities that
stood out _ and they all hated each other. People loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's epic battles across the world with the other three made
it a rare period. Whether stunning Borg to win the 1977 Masters,
McEnroe in the 1982 Wimbledon finale or Lendl to seize the 1983
Open, he overflowed with an elixir that outweighed the titles,
money and tirades: an undying passion for tennis.

SCORING NEVER REALLY HAS BEEN THURAM'S GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The craziest thing is that the man never scores.
(itals)Jamais.(unitals) ``Even during training, I don't score,''
says Lilian Thuram.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday night, Thuram had played 37 soccer matches for
France and never produced a goal. He scored eight in six seasons
with Monaco, just one in three seasons with Parma. When coach Aime
Jacquet sent five men to the penalty spot for the quarterfinal
shootout with Italy, Thuram wasn't among them. ``Not my thing,'' he
shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram is a central defender, one of the best in the world. An
impeder, a disrupter, a preventer. Yet now, because he scored two
improbable and glorious goals to beat Croatia and put France into
Sunday's World Cup final for the first time, ``Thuthu'' has become
a demigod.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates hoisted Thuram on their shoulders on the floor of
the Stade de France. Along the boulevards and quais of the city, as
horns honked and firecrackers popped, celebrants chanted his name.
Le Monde and Le Figaro had his photo on their front pages. Even
Jacques Chirac singled him out for special tribute.
``Extraordinaire,'' the French president proclaimed,
(itals)``Vraiment formidable.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens against the Brazilians in the final, Les
Bleus have already made history, have already brought le reve, the
dream, to life and touched off the most exuberant celebration in
the City of Light since the Liberation. And the 26-year-old Thuram,
who grew up playing the game on the black sand of Guadeloupe's
beaches in the Caribbean, is the unlikely architect of triumph.
``It's a wonderful thing,'' he said. ``I can't get over it. But
just because I scored two goals doesn't make me a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   For one terrible minute against the Croats, Thuram was the bobo,
who forgot to get back in time and watched from the wrong side of
the field as Davor Suker dashed in unbothered and scored 25 seconds
into the second half. And then, barely after the replay had been
shown, his gaffe in slow motion from five angles for the entire
world, Thuram produced a better one.
</P>
<P>
   Picking off a lateral pass from Zvonimir Boban 30 meters from
the Croatian goal, Thuram slipped the ball to Youri Djorkaeff, then
dashed behind the defense on a give-and-go and slammed home
Djorkaeff's return from the spot. Twenty-two minutes later, Thuram
came back for the coup de grace, stripping Robert Jarni of the ball
and firing it to the far corner before keeper Drazen Ladic could
react.
</P>
<P>
   It was the (itals)demi-heure,(unitals) the half hour, of a
lifetime and it left Thuram on his knees, stunned. ``In general,
when I'm in the attack zone, I'm not good,'' he admitted. ``I was
200 percent lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Thuram never scores because he's not supposed to. He's strictly
a rear-guard guy, a defender whom teammates, rivals and
connoisseurs appreciate more than the public does. ``He's the best
in the world at his position,'' says Croatian midfielder Mario
Stanic, who plays alongside Thuram in Parma.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thuram is playing out of position for France, outside on the
right where he's actually been set free to explore space, to become
who he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram, whom the French consider the best athlete ever to play
for Les Bleus, was an attacker when he first began playing for
Portugais de Fontainebleau in the Paris suburbs, scoring four goals
in his first match. ``For me, to be a defender was unthinkable,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   When Nice put him there, Thuram told himself it wasn't possible.
When Monaco kept him there, Thuram committed errors on purpose. ``I
wanted to prove that I was a danger to them back there,'' he told
L'Equipe, the French sporting daily. ``But I quickly learned that I
didn't have the right to weaken the team to suit myself. In life,
you must be happy with what you have and not demand what people
don't want to give you.''
</P>
<P>
   So Thuram settled in at central defender for the Monegasques,
went to Parma in Italy's Serie A two years ago and quickly earned a
reputation as one of the league's top foreigners. He was Le
Parmesan now, living in an old and graceful city which made him
feel as if time had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   His roots, though, were still in Guadeloupe, where Thuram had
lived without a father with four siblings while his mother
Christiane worked as a maid in the 16th arrondissement here to earn
the plane fare to bring the children over. Thuthu had wanted to be
a priest. ``Because in the Antilles, the priest is a hero,'' he
once said. ``He represents strength and wisdom. He counsels the
good road.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the 10-year-old Thuram got to France, realized that priests
couldn't have children, and switched vocations. FIFA, which runs
soccer worldwide, requires players to keep their shirts tucked in,
but does not insist upon celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   So Thuram became a (itals)pur defenseur,(unitals) until French
national coach Aime Jacquet moved him to right back with freedom to
indulge his craving for open space. Nobody said anything about
scoring and for the first three matches, when France piled up nine
goals, nobody was asking the defenders to do anything more than
defend.
</P>
<P>
   But by halftime of Wednesday's semifinal, after Les Bleus had
managed just one goal in their last 313 minutes, they were
desperate for someone to step up, to do something (iteals)vraiment
formidable.(unitals) So Thuram came front and center, sticking out
his endless legs twice to filch balls and creating, in a
(itals)demi-heure(unitals) something France had been fantasizing
about for 68 years.
</P>
<P>
   When it was done, and he'd come back to earth from shoulder
height, France's improbable hero ran to the locker room, wiping
away tears. ``To play in the World Cup is a kid's dream,'' Lilian
Thuram said. ``And if it ends as you dream it, you never have to
wake up.''

EVERYBODY'S IN ON THE FUN BUT THE UNITED STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I have a fairly simple rating system
for a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   Would I really, really, really want to be there, or would I
prefer to sit home with a good book and a preferred CD?
</P>
<P>
   I am not a soccer buff. I am neither a soccer lover nor a soccer
hater. In my mind, I could improve it, but I've always said the
same thing about hockey. (That's ice, as opposed to field, about
which I have no opinion). But even in its curiously flawed state,
there is a lot to be said for it. The World Cup is the ultimate
forum, and so, yes, dammit, I am very envious of my distinguished
colleagues John Powers and Frank Dell'Apa because they are there
and I am here.
</P>
<P>
   In vast overwhelming numbers, my fellow Americans just don't
care. Since it is not about us, or for us, or particularly friendly
to us, we US folks are not interested. The USA team flamed out in
three games, returning home amid a smidgen of controversy
concerning who played and who didn't, and whether or not the coach
could or should survive. The American public at large quickly got
over losing to Iran, and two weeks later not one American in 1,000
could tell you who Eric Wynalda or Steve Sampson is. It is almost
as if the 1994 World Cup never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Major American newspapers cover the World Cup, but we are
decades away from justifying a Sunday London Times-style 64-page
magazine preview that included, among other things, a
heavily-diagrammed four-page rating of the all-time Top Ten World
Cup goals. In case you are interested, Diego Maradona's 1986
astounding dash through practically the entire English team (as
opposed to the controversial ``Hand of God'' goal in the very same
game) was rated No. 1 by the 62-member panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
   We are quite happy pursuing our own parochial interests, and the
fact is we have more of them than any other country on this earth.
Most countries are lucky to have one decent football league, but
we've got highly organized and historically relevant leagues in
baseball, football, basketball and hockey, not to mention the
50-year-old NASCAR circuit and various other forms of automobile
racing, which are currently attracting more spectators than
anything, for reasons which will forever escape many of us.
</P>
<P>
   The above, of course, is just the beginning. We have the
largest, most diverse sports smorgasbord imaginable, so why does it
matter if we are not major players in the world of FIFA?
</P>
<P>
   Because we're missing out on all the fun, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   France is a reasonably reserved country. It spends a great
percentage of its time fending off the old ennui. The French are
difficult to please. Not unlike us, they like what they like and
are very happy to take a pass on everything else. What they really
like is cycling. The unquestioned No. 1 sporting event in France is
the Tour de France. To have the Tour pass through your village is
an unimaginable thrill. They have a first-rate soccer/football
league, but their passion for the sport in no way rivals that of
neighboring Spain or Italy, just to name two.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is no other topic in France but its football team,
which will play Brazil Sunday for the championship. The nation is
galvanized. Every cafe is Rick's, and everyone is getting misty
singing ``La Marseilleise'' while toasting the crafty Zinedine
Zidane (and we thought the only ol' Double Z we'd ever know would
be Zarley Zalapski) or the fearless goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. The
country is united in its passion for a team many of them were
ignoring a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's harmless fun.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people can take this stuff too seriously. Did
England's David Beckham deserve to be referred to in one London
tabloid headline as a ``Stupid Boy'' because he was sent off the
pitch with a red card during England's painful loss to Argentina?
Should the entire country of Croatia be plunged into mourning
because they were ousted from the competition by France two days
ago? We know the answers.
</P>
<P>
   But what is wrong with a little national caring? We in America
have no true bonding national interests, and when we actually had
one _ the original Dream Team _ it was dismissed by some as being
uninteresting because it was too good. Our No. 1 sport is football,
and no one else, aside from a few hearty Canadians, plays it. Not
enough people care about hockey to make that a point of true
national pride. We have never been able to make up our minds what
we want and expect from our various national basketball teams. A
true national baseball team might produce some talk if it had the
opportunity to play a seven-game series against a Latin American
counterpart, but the results wouldn't even make the agate in Paris,
Riyadh or Harare.
</P>
<P>
   There really is nothing to bring us together. The World Series
used to, but no longer. Back when the networks had a 90-95 percent
share, it seemed as if Everybody watched the World Series, ``The Ed
Sullivan Show,'' the Miss America Pageant, the Rose Bowl and ``I
Love Lucy.'' And we could always stand around together and curse
the Commies. Now you can watch the Food Channel or the X-Games. We
don't get together to celebrate anything. We don't even vote.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one sport that brings planet earth to the same
mental sporting arena, and that is soccer, er, football. The idea
that people staged protests in Bangladesh (which won't qualify for
the Cup in the next thousand years) because the power went off
during televised World Cup games is, well, charming. We know they
are watching in China. We know they are watching all over Africa,
South America and Asia. We also know not very many are watching in
America.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one sport that will ever enable us to take part in
the fun, and that sport is soccer. There is something very
intrinsically important about caring. It is why we are so haunted
by the 1918 business here. It's silly. It's stupid. It shouldn't
matter, but it does.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in this World Cup business. America would
benefit from some communal caring. We could make do with a little
stranger-hugging over a Golden Goal.
</P>
<P>
   More than a billion people will be watching the game on Sunday.
Now that's a stage. I would dearly love to be either a Frenchman or
Brazilian for the next four days.

REEBOK CAMPAIGN FINDS JUSTICE DOUGLAS A GOOD FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reebok International Ltd. has a new copy writer for its sneaker
ads _ the late William O. Douglas, a former US Supreme Court
justice known for his defense of individual liberties.
</P>
<P>
   The voiceover for a new Reebok ad is taken from a speech Douglas
wrote for a 1976 bar association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Douglas warned young lawyers to remain vigilant against
totalitarian threats.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Douglas's words seem to allude to Reebok's footwear
rivals, which Stoughton-based Reebok portrays as fashion purveyors
of oppressive conformity in contrast to its emphasis on
individuality, empowerment, and performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does
oppression,'' says the voiceover, slightly paraphrasing from a
speech that Douglas was too ill to deliver in person. ``It is in
such twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air,
however slight, lest we become victims of the darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin Cameron &AMP; Partners, the New York agency that created the
ad, had been writing another script for the ad's voiceover.
</P>
<P>
   But when someone at the agency found a copy of the Douglas
speech, Reebok said it decided to get permission from the Douglas
estate to use excerpts from it.
</P>
<P>
   The words of Douglas ``really multiplied the effectiveness'' of
Reebok's message, says Ewen Cameron, the ad agency's creative
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard it,'' says Reebok's Dave Fogelson, ``everyone
said, `Whoa! This is a perfect fit.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Reebok ad is likely to be first encountered on movie screens
rather than on TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, the young consumers who buy the most sneakers are
more often found in theaters rather than in front of TV sets
watching reruns. So Reebok is going where its customers are.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, ads in movie theaters have a long
tradition, says Cameron, a Scotsman.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer TV stations in the United Kingdom, there are fewer
opportunities to advertise in other countries. Now movie
advertising is becoming more prevalent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, though, many ads in US movie theaters were
``appalling, with very low production values,'' Cameron says.
</P>
<P>
   That's beginning to change, in part because of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sheila Wyle, director of advertising at Cineplex
Odeon Corp., 105 million Americans went to the movies last year.
</P>
<P>
   To weed out appalling ads, the chain imposes tough standards on
what it allows to be shown on its 856 movie screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't accept anything that has already run on TV,'' Wyle
says. ``We want only work that is fresh and creative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans go to theaters to get away from TV and TV
advertising,'' Cameron says.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ads are spectacular and on par with the special
effects used in most summer blockbusters, even an American movie
audience will be receptive to an ad's message, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the hopes of not irritating paying customers, Cineplex Odeon
shows no more than three ads before a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Most TV ads tend to be 30 seconds long. At the movies, many ads
last 60 or 90 seconds. So long as an ad premieres in a theater, a
shorter version may later be shown on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the insistence on high quality, only the largest
companies, such as Levi's, AT&AMP;T, and Reebok, find it feasible to
advertise at the movies, Wyle says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A new ad from Dunkin' Donuts opens at a city construction site.
It's a hot summer day, and suddenly the workers start emitting
appreciative grunts and other macho noises.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the hubba-hubba blonde strolling by the work site
that's got the lads in a lather _ it's the return of a worker from
a Dunkin' Donuts with a tray of Coffee Coolattas.
</P>
<P>
   The work is the first from Dunkin' Donuts' new ad agency, Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The first ads from Hill Holliday weren't supposed to appear
until the fall, but Dunkin' Donuts, based in Randolph, Mass., was
apparently so disappointed with the Coolatta ads from its previous
agency that Hill Holliday wound up coming to the rescue.

JEB BUSH, LIKE HIS BROTHER, FINDS THE RIGHT TOUCH WITH DEMOCRATS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, July 12) 
(See optional ending) 
 
By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Four years ago, speculating about two Bush
brothers winning their races for governor was just a political day
dream. Conventional wisdom gave Jeb Bush a shot at winning Florida,
but the pundits said George W. Bush was unlikely to unseat Ann
Richards in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, George W. is the popular governor of Texas and poised to
capture a second term. Polls show that brother Jeb, who lost his
first race, is so far ahead in the Florida governor's race that
people are joking about the start of a Bush political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the Bush brothers worth watching this time around
is less their family name than the new standard they are setting
for Republican candidates to court traditionally Democratic
minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, 45, joked about his attempts to woo Democrats at a
recent campaign appearance. He described a visit he paid to a
towering Broward County condominium enclave of mostly retired
Jewish Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been the first Republican allowed into that village
of 15,000,'' Jeb Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not expect to make serious inroads among what Florida
calls its ``condo Democrats.'' Bush lost Broward County by a huge
margin in 1994 despite a narrow loss statewide. He is determined
not to let it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush also is capitalizing on a nasty schism between the
state Democratic Party's black and white leadership to court black
voters who may stay angry enough to vote Republican if he makes
himself accessible enough.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of Florida's voters are black. Because Jeb
Bush only lost the 1994 governor's race by 64,000 votes, even a
small shift in the black vote could be important in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is campaigning in some of Florida's poorest black
neighborhoods as enthusiastically as he trolls for votes among the
moneyed, white country club set.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Jeb Bush who, when asked in 1994 what he would
do for black voters, glibly answered, ``Probably nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people say Jeb has changed, most publicly by his conversion
to Catholicism, his wife's religion. Others say the narrow 1994
loss taught Bush how to win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his associates says there's truth in both camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``And frankly, he's more prepared this time,'' says Houston
political consultant David Hill, who worked on Jeb Bush's campaign
four years ago. ``No matter how much you do, say, for Dad, that's
not the same as campaigning for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had to mature in that role as the candidate, not
just the (former president's) son. You see that in his speaking
style, even in the way he works the room,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that I think has changed in my ideological
framework ... is that in '94 I was focusing on how do we
institutionalize the limitations of government,'' &UR;  &LR; Bush said &UR; .
 &LR; ``I've been involved in a lot of different things between '94 and
'98 and it led me to believe the better approach is how do you
identify policies that lessen the demand on government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subtle, but pretty profoundly different approach,'' Jeb
Bush said, then paraphrased his father's campaign remark after
Republicans were criticized for veering too far to the right:
``Because of that it may sound kinder and gentler.''
</P>
<P>
   He also talks a lot about the lessons he has learned working
with a charter school he helped establish in Liberty City, a deeply
impoverished black neighborhood in Miami. The charter school was
funded by Bush's Foundation for Florida's Future, a public policy
organization funded by many political friends of his father and
Texas brother. The foundation also kept his name in the news
between elections.
</P>
<P>
   He now calls for ``putting aside party labels'' and building a
statewide education system strong enough to lessen the demand on
government by creating better, more self sufficient citizens. When
told he sounds like a conservative Democrat, Jeb Bush laughs and
says, ``Well, they're voting for me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeb Bush will also say, quite candidly, that circumstances
are allowing him to run a different campaign this time around. He
started the primary season in 1994 with five strong, extremely
conservative GOP opponents. To win that primary, he took as his
running mate an anti-abortion rights conservative and positioned
himself as far right as he could get.
</P>
<P>
   But his primary-season posture was unpalatable to moderate
Republicans and swing voters and cost him a November victory. And
when incumbent Gov. Lawton Chiles launched 11th-hour attacks on Jeb
Bush, people tended to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he is unopposed for the GOP nomination in the Sept. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not underfunded in his last race, but he's
jet-propelled in 1998 after a huge infusion of Texas money, thanks
to the political connections of his father, former President George
Bush, and his brother George W.
</P>
<P>
   Texans had donated $372,000 to Jeb Bush's campaign and another
$455,000 to the Florida Republican Party by the end of the spring
campaign reporting period. The largest Texas donor, Hushang Ansary
of Houston, gave $100,000 to the GOP, and his company, IRI
International, donated another $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, candidates cannot accept donations of more
than $500 from any individual, but there is no cap on donations to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   With those benefits, Jeb Bush says he can follow his instincts
this time, to take his message ``to places where Republicans don't
go.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush appears to be listening to the
same muse, if not reacting to exactly the same set of
circumstances, as he courts Texas' Hispanic vote with a strong
defense of bilingual education, opposition to military patrols of
the U.S. border with Mexico, and a pitch for improved education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Hispanics in our state who are learning the
power of voting,'' George W. Bush told reporters at the recent
League of United Latin American Citizens annual convention. ``And
you bet it's going to make a difference in campaigns in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to mean an enormous difference in the future, and I
think it's important for both parties to pay attention to the
Hispanic vote and Hispanic concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates such as myself must go out and go to the barrios
and knock on the doors and campaign, and that's exactly what I
intend to do,`` the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Texas brother, 52, had some advice for other Republicans
eager for support from historically Democratic Hispanic voters:
``First and foremost I think what Republicans should say is I want
your vote (and) I've got a plan that's optimistic and hopeful for
you.'' George W. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing in Florida, Jeb Bush is selling himself to all voters as
a man with ``a hopeful, optimistic agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But his pitch to black voters, who recent polls indicate are
giving him double-digit support, is putting Florida Democrats on
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To decide that is a constituency that not only Republicans
could win over, but he could win over, most people thought he was
crazy,'' said Jim Kane, pollster and editor of Florida Voter
magazine. ``It's turned out to be rather insightful, and perhaps
due to a certain amount of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Willie Logan, an African-American, was dumped as the
Democratic leader in the Florida House of Representatives, and
replaced by white legislator Ann MacKenzie. Party leaders claimed
Logan hadn't been doing his job, but black Democrats took it as a
racially motivated slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Willie Logan situation was manna from heaven'' for Bush,
says U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings. The Florida Democrat is threatening
to shift his support to Republican candidates and take other
disenchanted black voters with him if the state's Democratic
hierarchy does not apologize for its treatment of Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said Jeb Bush seized on the opportunity created by
Logan's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical of situations like that, he was in the right place at
the right time,'' Hastings said. &UR;  &LR; ``Added to that is the new
situation of blacks who don't have the history with the civil
rights movement. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Hastings says he is ``no defender of Jeb Bush,'' but he's
obviously intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the Bush brothers are seemingly mindful that they cannot
conduct business as their Dad did and expect to be national
leaders,'' Hastings said. ``What their Dad did was immoral,''
Hastings said, referring to Bush's decision not to denounce a
campaign ad made on his behalf that used a picture of black felon
Willie Horton as a scare tactic in his 1988 presidential campaign
against Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're serious about the business of wanting to correct
those mistakes, they'll do what George W. is doing with Hispanics
and what Jeb is doing with black and Jewish voters,'' Hastings
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the Florida governor's mansion at stake here.
State Democrats worry that if too many jump ship in this election,
they'll keep jumping when it comes time to vote in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of having Jeb Bush in a position to deliver Florida
votes to his brother should George W. decide to run for president,
makes Florida Democratic Party Chairman Mitch Caesar nervous. He
suspects many of the Texas donations to Jeb Bush's campaign and the
Florida GOP are really intended to help the older brother carry the
third most populous state in the United States in a bid for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone in Texas want to give money to Florida?
Obviously, it's his brother,'' Caesar said. ``They're playing
politics with Florida's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill says he doubts most donors are thinking strategically
enough to tie dollars for Jeb to the presidency for George W.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they're brothers, and both Republicans, I think they
operate in their own circles and worlds,'' Hill said. ``I know four
years ago people always suspected somehow the campaigns were
running in tandem. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida Democrats also are complaining loudly about the Texas
donations, many of them from the oil industry, to play to
Floridians' concerns about the environment and their adamant
opposition to offshore drilling. ``Everyone is suspicious,`` Caesar
says.
</P>
<P>
   Kane said he thought Jeb Bush would eventually regret taking the
Texas money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb has come out and said he's against drilling off the coast,
but saying it and taking the money _ people are skeptical of
politicians to begin with and they may not believe his campaign
rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats in Florida don't understand brotherly love
then they better reassess their emotions,'' responded the Texas
governor. ``I help my brother because he is my brother. If he asked
for help, I'm more than willing to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business about how because of Texas he's going to somehow
change his position on offshore drilling in Florida just goes to
show they have no idea how he thinks,'' George W. Bush said,
``because Jeb is going to do what he says he is going to do, and
he's going to be a great governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said he sought the Texas contributions, in part,
because he's not taking government money to fund his campaign.

   ``Secondly, the amount of oil money, whatever amount that was,
was a small fraction of what was raised overall,'' Jeb Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the oil money is more than a ``small fraction.''
Ansary, the biggest Texas donor, heads a large, Houston-based
company that manufactures oil and gas rigs _ including offshore
rigs. The combined contribution of $150,000 to the Florida GOP from
Ansary and IRI adds up to nearly one-fifth of the Texas money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's completely idiosyncratic to the Bush brothers _
this is a very unusual situation,'' said Larry Makinson, executive
director for the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. ``I
can tell you that (nearly) $850,000 traveling from Texas to Florida
is extraordinary _ there's no question, and it's clearly related to
the relationship between the two brothers and the potential for
higher office for George.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Donors flock,'' Makinson said. ``There's a certain logic for
contributors from Texas or anywhere, who want to make a good
impression on brother George to give to brother Jeb _ especially if
they knew Papa George.``
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family has a pretty golden touch with the donor
community, Makinson said, ``and they're taking full advantage of
it.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ It is evidently the quest for international status which
underlies India's determination to be, and to be recognized as, a
nuclear power. Pakistan also feels a need for protection against
India's overwhelming conventional force, and likes the idea of ``me
too.''
 &HT;    But despite India's references to the need for a ``minimum
deterrent'' against China, pointing out that it has neither ``the
resources nor the will for parity,'' New Delhi's statements make
clear that it is a long simmering resentment at what seemed the
world's disregard for India's weight that decided the
nationalist-leaning coalition government to hold and publicize
nuclear tests.
 &HT;    A European diplomat recently asked Indian officials why, if they
felt the need for nuclear weapons, they didn't copy the Israeli
tactic of building them without attracting the international
opprobrium of vaunting it.
 &HT;    At one point, that had been the strategy. An unidentified Indian
``senior official'' formally told Western correspondents last week
that aside from the recent nuclear tests, India already has atomic
arms it could use, and the systems to deliver them.
 &HT;    This, of course, has been suspected for some time. But beyond
the thesis for deterrence, India craved recognition.
 &HT;    A New Delhi communique, denouncing the joint U.S.-China summit
call for both India and Pakistan to curb a possible arms race, was
blunt. It said, ``India categorically rejects the notion of these
two countries arrogating to themselves joint or individual
responsibility for the maintenance of peace, stability and security
in the region. This approach reflects the hegemonistic mentality of
a bygone era in international relations and is completely
unacceptable and out of place in the present day world.''
 &HT;    The Indians have a point in complaining that despite their size
and numbers, they are routinely put in a class well below China in
status. And they can make a fair argument that with the end of a
two superpower world, permanent membership in the U.N. Security
Council is by no means an evident measure of importance.
 &HT;    It happens that the five permanent members are all nuclear
powers, the only avowed ones until the Indian and Pakistani tests.
None had atomic weapons when the Council membership and its rules
were adopted, not even the United States. The distinction is ex
post facto.
 &HT;    Status, ranking in the world, has always been a consideration
for states alongside the influence that actual power brings. Now,
however, it is becoming a prime factor which distorts conventional
strategic analysis and cannot be overlooked.
 &HT;    Russia is the most obvious current example. Whatever else it
disagrees on, the Russian establishment is unanimously
hypersensitive to making sure their country continues to be
regarded as a great power, in big things and small. That, many will
tell you, is the real reason they are so upset by the expansion of
NATO, which they do not see as a military threat but as a
psychological one which could produce a backlash of nationalism.
 &HT;    Likewise, China's satisfaction with the deferent warmth
displayed by President Bill Clinton on his nine-day trip was more
what I call ``geo-psychics'' than any substantive gain or
agreement. What mattered to Beijing was the symbolism, given added
relative weight by his willingness to skip a courtesy stop in
Japan.
 &HT;    France's Charles de Gaulle practised geo-psychics to the hilt,
in purely ceremonial and sometimes peevishly iconoclastic ways as
well as by insisting on joining the ``nuclear club.'' From the
French point of view, it worked.
 &HT;    In fact, there is a profound contradiction between the U.N.
founding principle of the sovereign equality of all states and
reality. Geo-psychics is an attempt to bridge the gap by induced
perception. The urge cannot be ignored. There is no inherent reason
why possession of nuclear arms should be the test, and many reasons
for rejecting it.
 &HT;    But then there has to be some other way to acknowledge that some
states are, at the least, more equal than others. This is a problem
of the gradual transition in the way nations deal with one another.
New measures, new protocols are needed to satisfy the need for
symbolic importance, so it doesn't have to go nuclear.
 &HT;    Psychologists should be recruited alongside diplomats and
military staff to sort out ways to accommodate sensitivities which
don't really require weapons, or spheres of influence, or even
money, but do provoke tangible irritation.
 &HT;    Geo-psychics is harder than geopolitics, but if it's taken into
account, it's less dangerous.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   I live in New York City, the capital of English-speaking
culture. But I can go entire days without ever speaking English.
Today was one of those days. This morning, I didn't have exact
change for the bus ride so I went into a Korean deli and asked the
Ecuadorian behind the register for it.
</P>
<P>
   On the bus, coming down Seventh Avenue, I tried reading a few
pages of ``Three Trapped Tigers,'' by the Cuban writer Guillermo
Cabrera Infante. But I was distracted by the stories of a Dominican
mother, who, on a nearby seat, was telling her young son about his
grandmother's house in Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   I closed my book and decided to notice New York's Latin face.
Behind me, two teen-age girlfriends chatted half in English, half
in Spanish. One of them carried a keychain with the Colombian flag
hooked to the pocket of her backpack; the other was wearing a
necklace of yellow, blue and red plastic beads that ended in the
three-color flag of five Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled how at the Sunday rumba in Central Park, the bata
drums might as easily have been played by a Puerto Rican or a
Dominican as a Cuban. New York, I thought, has shown me so much of
my own culture. It is here, not in my native Colombia, after all,
where I have tried to dance a tango and a ``danzon.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has always been a city of immigrants. A 1998 report by
the Census Bureau shows that one out of five New Yorkers is
foreign-born. If at the turn of the century, they arrived from
Europe, today they are arriving from the Caribbean and from Central
and South America. Most of them come from the Dominican Republic.
They are followed, in the order of greatest numbers, by
Ecuadorians, Colombians, Peruvians, Hondurans, Salvadoreans,
Mexicans, Guatemalans and Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   New York is living the dream of Latin American unity that Simon
Bolivar, the Great Liberator, held most dear _ the belief that a
single people has been divided only by the turmoil of historical
events. And now, curiously, there never has been the opportunity
for Latin Americans to know each other as there is today in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   I got off the bus at 14th Street, a wide, store-lined, two-way
path that reminds me of Panama's Avenida Calidonia or the
commercial thoroughfare of any Latin American downtown area. It is
a reflection of the Latino community which, according to the
Department of City Planning, will soon be the largest minority in
New York City _ surpassing even the African-American community,
which currently constitutes about 24 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteenth Street mirrors the needs, the growth and the
idiosyncrasy of the Latino community. Here a Latino finds whatever
he or she might need or yearn for _ from work offers, to law firms
offering green cards, to two Spanish-language bookstores where one
can find the novels that won this year's Alfaguara Prize, Spain's
new prestigious international literary award, as well as the
magazines covering the latest news of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores sell guayaberas, CDs in Spanish, brand names at a
discount. On the sidewalk you are offered cellular phones, games of
Three-Card Monty, compliments, pushes, dirty looks, smiles _ all
Latino-style, in Spanish, and in the accents of many countries.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, I went to a restaurant where they offer the entire
Latin American region in their menu _ from chicken soup,
``empanadas chilenas,'' black and red beans to slivers of yellow
plantain, mango juice and flan.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a ``batido de mamey,'' a milkshake made of a pink
tropical fruit, and asked the Mexican at the counter what was the
difference between a Cuban Sandwich, or a sanduche cubano, and a
Midnight Sandwich, or a media noche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is in the bread,'' the young man from Puebla,
in central Mexico, told me. And I was sure he had never tasted a
Cuban sandwich before coming to New York. ``The Midnight is made
with `pan de huevo,' which is bread made with eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   I ordered it because that bread, sweet and yellowy, reminds me
of afternoons in Barranquilla, Colombia, where I was born. The
baker would pass by my house on his bicycle selling pan de huevo,
also made into rolls filled with a guava paste sprinkled with sugar
on top. I have not lived in Barranquilla for 20 years, but it only
takes a sip of the shake _ its smell, its taste _ or the sounds of
the chords of a Colombian vallenato song, to feel as if I am
sitting in the rocking chair on my grandmother's patio.
</P>
<P>
   My experience is not unique. It must be the same for that
Dominican woman who was talking to her son on the Seventh Avenue
bus, or for the hundreds of people who walk or work on 14th Street
every day. It is a surprise even to hear English here.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I turned around when I heard a masculine voice say,
in the tone that North Americans use when they go on vacation to
Latin America and their tourist package includes a native dance and
a cocktail of tropical fruit, ``This surely is colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him that this is the new face of New York. That
this wonderful convergence of cultures is more than a colorful
novelty. That this is his new country.

in the tone that North Americans use when they go on vacation to
Latin America and their tourist package includes a native dance and
a cocktail of tropical fruit, ``This surely is colorful.''

   I wanted to tell him that this is the new face of New York. That
this wonderful convergence of cultures is more than a colorful
novelty. That this is his new country.

   The fire raging in East Asia today jeopardizes one of the
central achievements of postwar American foreign policy _ the
stabilization and growth of East Asia. Even more dangerously, if it
continues to fester, this crisis could undermine support for an
open global economy and economic and political liberalization
across the world.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are bleak. In the last two years Indonesia's economy
has shrunk by almost 80 percent, Thailand's by 50 percent, South
Korea's by 45 percent, Malaysia's by 25 percent. Even islands of
prosperity such as Hong Kong and Singapore are in deepening
recessions. Currencies and stock markets have plunged to
unimaginable lows; unemployment and poverty are climbing to new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   To take the worst example, Indonesia's per capita gross domestic
product has dropped from $3,500 to less than $750, wiping out 25
years of economic progress. Some 100 million people _ almost half
of that vast country _ have sunk below the poverty level, and fears
of a famine are growing.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie has called on his citizens to fast twice
a week to lessen the need to import food. Japan, the only nation
that could spur a new round of growth in the region, has now
slipped firmly into its second recession in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund
had an initial strategy to deal with what began as a financial
crisis in Thailand in June 1997. First, they assumed it would be
temporary, ``a few small glitches along the road'' in President
Clinton's words. Second, they assumed it would be localized. Third,
they assumed that the IMF would restore stability.
</P>
<P>
   All three assumptions have been proved wrong. The IMF's
prescriptions have not worked; currencies and stock markets
continue to fall. The panic is now a depression and has spread
beyond East Asia. Markets as large as Russia and Australia and as
distant as Mexico and South Africa have been battered.
</P>
<P>
   If official responses have been inadequate, the reactions of
American foreign policy pundits to the crisis have been worse. Much
of this commentary has been to note gleefully that Asia's troubles
confirm the virtues of the American system and the bankruptcy of
``Asian values.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, as Europe struggled to cope with similar
economic hardships, George Marshall warned Americans that ``the
patient is sinking as the doctors deliberate.'' Today it is as if
the doctors are vivisecting the patient to score points about
anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity and stability of East Asia are _ were? _
extraordinary achievements. Thirty years ago, most of these
countries seemed stuck in the dismal poverty that afflicted the
Third World, and the region was the most troubled part of the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, more than 300,000 people had died in mob riots
after a failed Communist-backed military coup in 1965. Malaysia, in
civil war from 1948, lifted its state of emergency only in 1960.
China, Taiwan and the Koreas had all been through grueling
conflicts in the late 1940s and 1950s. And the Vietnam War was
still in full fury.
</P>
<P>
   One generation later, most of these nations had dramatically
raised their living standards, substantially alleviating poverty
and disease. Many, such as Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia, had
begun liberalizing their politics as well. It was the fastest move
out of misery in history.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the region owes much to the hard work of its
people but also to American foreign policy. The United States
fought two wars after 1945 to maintain stability in East Asia. It
advocated economic and foreign policies that were adopted in much
of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with countries such as Brazil, Egypt and India _ whose
protectionism and central planning were cheered on by socialist
governments and left-wing economists _ East Asian regimes adopted
policies that were broadly hospitable to free markets and free
trade. They opened themselves up to foreign investment and
multinational corporations and allowed the private sector to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War they were consistently anti-Soviet,
banding together to form the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, practically the only pro-American regional grouping in the
world outside of NATO. For these policies they became the pariahs
of the Third World, often branded as American stooges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the growth and stability of East Asia have been a
central achievement of American foreign policy in the post-war era,
a living refutation of once fashionable theories about American
neo-imperialism, Third World dependence and the necessity for
socialism in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   All this is at risk today. If East Asia does not begin to
recover soon, the dangers to its own well-being are obvious, but
those to regional stability and American interests are also great.
South Korea's growing weakness makes that peninsula even more
unstable than it already was (and with 36,000 American troops
stationed there, any internal problem will quickly become an
international one). Indonesia, a geographic absurdity comprising
2,000 islands and 1,100 dialects, could easily lapse into violence
and begin splintering.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shift in the balance of power away from Japan and
toward China will not serve regional peace or American interests.
Japan remains the second-largest economy in the world and a liberal
democratic partner of the United States. Its decision to stay a
nonnuclear and largely nonmilitary power is a cornerstone of East
Asian stability.
</P>
<P>
   China, on the other hand, is a rising power in the midst of
transforming its entire political and economic system, ruled by a
regime seeking legitimacy. Great power transitions are never easy,
but it is better when they happen slowly, surely and, in any event,
not in an atmosphere of general crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To take one example, anger directed against the wealthy Chinese
minorities in much of Southeast Asia is growing. Already, more than
1,000 ethnic Chinese were killed last May during riots in
Indonesia. One can only hope that Beijing will not feel the need to
intervene in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   Most dangerously, however, the continued unraveling of East
Asia's economies could derail economic and political liberalization
across the globe. East Asia's governments have already tried to
quell unrest by sounding more populist and protectionist.
Indonesia's President Suharto chose Habibie as his successor partly
because the latter has economic nationalist leanings.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia had until now
practiced a clever form of duplicity, making fiery anti-Western
speeches while adopting liberal policies _ usually through his
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. But Mahathir's talk is now turning into
action: He has put an old friend in charge of the economy,
slighting Ibrahim and his reformist agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has also warned of a ``guerrilla war'' if
foreigners try to come in and buy cheap Asian assets. Labor unions
and opposition figures in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have
begun demanding an end to the IMF-forced liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond East Asia, one can also see people drawing the wrong
lessons. In India, Egypt and Mexico, intellectuals and politicians
have begun to point to East Asia's fate as the reason not to move
toward free markets and free trade. Support for liberalization has
always been weak in most of the Third World. But when a country is
growing at 8 percent a year, the opposition to reform is
effectively silenced. When growing at 0.8 percent, as Malaysia will
probably do this year, opponents are emboldened and their arguments
gain currency.
</P>
<P>
   If the world appears to be divided once again between the
Western nations, all rich, and the non-Western ones, all poor,
these fires of resentment will only grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done? The IMF's initial approach to this crisis
was misguided in two vital areas _ its requirements for low
government spending and large-scale domestic reform. It treated
East Asian countries as if they had the usual developing country
disease _ out-of-control budgets. In fact, most were running budget
surpluses, had high domestic savings rates and had little
inflation. In this context, an insistence on a tight fiscal policy
was unnecessary and probably counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the fund's insistence on tight monetary
policy _ high interest rates _ is an understandable compromise
between those who advocate even stronger methods of maintaining the
value of currency (linking it inflexibly to the dollar) and those
who want deflation. Given the huge devaluations that have already
taken place across the region, some measures to restore confidence
in East Asian currencies are not just appropriate, they are vital.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements for domestic reform, especially of the
financial sector, are of course based on impeccable economic logic.
East Asia's economies do indeed practice a form of ``crony
capitalism'' with under-regulated banks and much nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   But as a political matter, was this the time to attempt a
radical overhaul? After all, many countries have major
inefficiencies in their systems. Were the IMF to focus its gaze on,
say, France and Germany (let alone another developing country like
Brazil), it would surely find extravagant subsidies, cartels and
other market-distorting mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's reform requirements have only undermined the
legitimacy and support of East Asia's governments at a time of
acute crisis. If the situation does not improve, we may well see
five or six major countries _ including South Korea, which is a
member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
_ default on their foreign debts and impose capital controls on
their currency. Say goodbye to globalization.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the crisis in East Asia is largely unprecedented.
The IMF has already begun to relax its constraints on spending, and
Robert Rubin, the U.S. Treasury secretary, has called repeatedly
for a social safety net in the region. He has also properly
identified Japan as the key to reversing the slide.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico recovered after its financial crisis of 1994 because of
that great sucking sound to the north _ the U.S. economy buying
Mexican goods. East Asia's economies can grow their way out of
their current misery only if Japan similarly fuels their export
expansion. With Tokyo's economy declining about 3 percent this
year, this seems unlikely. But the Japanese can solve this problem
by spending and investing some of the vast sums they have, both in
public and private hands.
</P>
<P>
   But more than any specific economic policy, the Clinton
administration must fashion an overall political and economic
strategy for East Asia. The people of these countries need to be
given the sense that economic and political liberalization has not
caused their problems, that they are not being abandoned, and that
the West _ and in particular the United States _ is ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Rubin must push for a coordinated strategy of public
rhetoric, loans and aid _ involving the major Western powers, the
IMF and the World Bank _ to give the people of East Asia a sense of
hope. Even if default becomes inevitable, better that it be done in
an orderly manner. A retreat is better than a rout.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is associated around the world with the cause
of globalization, a connection it should proudly accept. The
opening up of the world economy in the last 40 years has led to
enormous economic and political progress for hundreds of millions
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But free markets and free trade are not naturally occurring and
self-sustaining. They rest on an edifice of politics. The last
great flourishing of the world economy began in the late 19th
century, with British power undergirding it. It collapsed in the
1930s, when the liberal capitalist states seemed to be foundering
in depression while fascist and communist states were rapidly
industrializing. What followed was the breakdown of the world
economy, autarky, economic nationalism, increasing political
tension and world war.
</P>
<P>
   With American leadership, we can make sure that Europe's past
will not be East Asia's future.

TRASH TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
  By CULLEN MURPHY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, the rulers of two of the world's most populous
countries were compelled to relinquish their hold on power:
Indonesia's Suharto left office amid mounting violence, and
Nigeria's Gen. Sani Abacha fell afoul of a fatal heart attack--one
key element, apparently, in his nation's constitutional system of
checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   Both Suharto and Abacha, of course, were despicable tyrants,
with records of venality and bloody oppression. Their
successors--B.J. Habibie in Indonesia and Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
in Nigeria--did not quite concede as much in the first public
statements they made, but they did use language that seemed to
indicate an awareness of the value of human rights and democratic
procedures. Habibie committed himself to running ``a clean
government, free from corruption, collusion, and nepotism.''
Abubakar declared himself ``fully committed'' to a
``social-political transition program'' leading to an elected
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, observers quoted on BBC radio described the two new
leaders as ``making all the right noises.''
</P>
<P>
   Making all the right noises: The phrase has proliferated over a
period of little more than two decades--perhaps in part because it
itself makes all the right noises. It signals that the noisemaker
under discussion may be no more than a golden-tongued hypocrite,
even as it suggests that a reporter, having seen it all, could not
possibly be taken in by the noisemaker's blandishments. It also
leaves open the unlikely possibility that the actions will indeed
live up to the noises.
</P>
<P>
   Making all the right noises, carrying the connotation just
described, seems to have surfaced mainly in British publications in
the late 1970s and early 1980s. It surely evolved from earlier use
in more literal, straightforward contexts (for instance, to
describe the sound of an automobile engine or a musical
performance) and ultimately from the long-established and
nonjudgmental phrase to make noises (that is, to express oneself
about something), a construction that happily accommodates all
manner of adjectival prefixes.
</P>
<P>
   All the right noises, with its stance of jaded cynicism, quickly
spread from British organs (the Economist, the Guardian, the
Financial Times) into most parts of the far-flung Anglophone
circulatory system. Today it is applied in a wide range of
circumstances, especially when the noises being talked of invite a
presumption of hollowness, sanctimony, or hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is New York's Newsday earlier this year, analyzing the
economic situation in South Korea: ``Kim Jong Pil, in line to
become Kim Dae Jung's prime minister, may make all the right noises
about economic reform, but his own ties to the chaebol (industrial
conglomerates) may be too tight to break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London, writing about the British prime minister:
``Tony Blair must do something. And a making-all-the-right-noises
kind of Valentine message is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald, assigning blame for the failure of campaign
finance reform: ``In his presidency so far, Clinton has made all
the right noises, but has done nothing while playing the same old
games to raise vast sums.''
</P>
<P>
   Given some of the tendencies of Scripture translation in recent
decades, it would hardly be surprising to see Matthew 26:33-35--the
passage in which Peter promises to remain a loyal disciple scant
hours before turning disloyal--rewritten and embellished to render
the response from Jesus as follows: ``Truly you make all the right
noises. But this night you will deny me three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Aong the reasons why an expression such as making all the right
noises achieves wide usage quickly is this simple one: The
phenomenon of empty talk is so prevalent that new ways of
describing it--especially ones that possess a modest elegance and
formality--are always welcome. As it happens, many wonderful terms
for empty or hypocritical talk are by now quaint and archaic
(humbuggery, Pharisaism, Tartuffery), and some of the most common
terms are simply vulgar (bull****).
</P>
<P>
   Lip service, as in the phrase to pay lip service--from the act
of raising one's voice publicly in prayer or song while inwardly
harboring contrary convictions--is probably the most widespread and
durable formulation. (Thus, the New York Democrats currently vying
for the nomination to run for the Senate this fall recently accused
the Republican incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato, of ``paying lip service
to gay issues.'') Similarly, lip salve is insincere flattery,
though it may be enjoyed by the recipient nonetheless as a form of
ear candy.
</P>
<P>
   Lip, with its satisfying mouthfeel (to use the jargon of the
food-service industry) and its still-obvious link to an elemental
root (the Indo-European leb, with the connotation ``hanging
loosely''), has formed numerous slang combinations whose meanings
touch all the compass points of verbal intention. To shoot from the
lip is to speak rashly. To zip your lip is to shut up. To invite
someone to read your lips is to emphasize your sincerity. To
lip-sync is to move one's lips in synchronization with a
prerecorded sound--and, metaphorically, to mouth someone else's
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Like paying lip service, making all the right noises possesses
just enough color to be memorable and yet not so much color as to
cloy. It may be in for a long run. In contrast, one has to wonder
about the longevity of its main rival in the linguistic marketplace
right now: talking the talk, but not walking the walk--a vivid
expression from black English that seems lately to have become a
mandatory part of the repertoire of white politicians, corporate
executives, consultants, motivational speakers, newscasters and
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   A person who talks the talk and walks the walk is one who acts
naturally and stylishly, whose words and behavior are of a piece; a
person who talks the talk without walking the walk, therefore, is
one who is dissembling, ineffectual, or insincere. The
incorporation of walk the walk and talk the talk into white-bread
English, often by people whose jus' folks colloquialism is a pose,
may not bode well. One need only remember how the appropriation of
the verbs dig, rap, and groove by grown-ups during the late 1960s
and early 1970s proved to be a kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the expression has found favor was brought
home a few weeks ago when Archbishop Harry Flynn of St. Paul and
Minneapolis traveled to Rome to ordain a Minnesota-bound candidate
for the priesthood. There, in a chapel at the North American
College on the slopes of the Janiculum Hill, during a service
otherwise conducted entirely in Latin, Flynn delivered a sermon
that included this injunction to the young man: ``When you teach,
be sure you receive the word into your heart before the word forms
on your lips. Walk the walk and talk the talk. Don't preach one
thing and turn around and do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   One can assume that the new priest, in response, made all the
right noises.

ANYONE CAN WHISTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this point, saying that U.S. investors are whistling past the
graveyard does seem a little bit like saying ``This television
thing is just a gimmick. It'll never take off,'' but what can I
say? U.S. investors are whistling past the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly irresistible flow of money into mutual funds, the
exaltation of large-cap stocks into supposedly risk-free
investments, and the now almost laughable discounting of present
troubles in favor of a brighter future that's purportedly just
around the corner have combined to create a growth in stock prices
that is out of all proportion to the growth in actual earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the bull market have been, of course,
well-rehearsed by this point. Low inflation, low interest rates
(though hardly historically low), globalization, the spread of
information technology and so on. In general terms, at least, the
case for continued bullishness is not dissimilar from the case for
the so-called New Economy. Just as we've enjoyed steady economic
growth and low inflation with low unemployment for a surprisingly
long time now, so too we're supposed to continue to enjoy an
ever-rising spiral of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The case for a real New Economy should, of course, be regarded
with serious skepticism, but there are clearly things--global
domination by capitalism, remarkable dedication to low inflation on
the part of central bankers, capital's increasingly disciplinary
role (at least everywhere but in the U.S.)--that do make a real
difference in the business climate. And it would be plausible that
companies should deserve higher multiples than they've received in
the past if their prospects for perpetual growth were so good that
buying stocks was like buying a U.S. bond.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with this scenario is, unfortunately, rather
glaring: U.S. corporations are not turning that blissful business
climate into profits.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings growth for the S&AMP;P in the first quarter was somewhere
between 0 percent and 4 percent (depending on how you account for
write-offs, one-time sales, etc.), and earnings growth for this
quarter is now estimated to be somewhere around 2.5 percent.
Needless to say, the S&AMP;P is up considerably more than 6 percent
this year, even as the Nasdaq--which is laden with companies that
have been hard-hit by the crisis in Asia--has now hit an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls argue that investors are now looking ahead, and seeing
stronger earnings growth in the next few quarters. But surely that
means that investors five or six months ago were dramatically
overpricing stocks, since they weren't anticipating stagnant
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, the Street is proving remarkably
tolerant of floundering companies. Take Nike, which last week
reported its first quarterly loss in 10 years, and which even with
a major restructuring charge earned just four cents a share, down
from 52 cents a year ago. Nike also said that a turnaround in its
business was still a year away, and that conditions in Asia had not
improved at all.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Three brokerage houses raised their
recommendations on Nike to ``strong buy,'' and the stock jumped 3
1/2 points. One analyst actually cut her estimates on how much Nike
would earn in the coming year and still boosted the stock to a
``strong buy,'' saying she expected something called ``an
uptrend.'' Now that's wonderful whistling.

 WERE TRIPP'S TAPES ILLEGAL?  
 By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Tripp recorded 20 hours of phone conversation with Monica
Lewinsky. Many commentators have argued that Tripp violated an
implicit rule of friendship. But did she violate a rule of law? And
if the tapes were illegal, why can the special prosecutor use them?
</P>
<P>
   The law is generally easier on taping of conversations when the
taper is a participant in the conversation. The logic is that the
other parties know you're listening. But Maryland has a law
prohibiting secret tape-recording of your own phone conversations.
Maryland's law applies to Tripp because she called from that state;
it makes no difference where Lewinsky was.
</P>
<P>
   The law also generally holds that ``ignorance of the law is no
excuse.'' But Maryland courts have ruled that the law against
tape-recording does not apply to a person who is unaware that the
taping is illegal. That's hard to prove. So bottom line: it is
unclear whether Tripp's taping broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tripp broke the law in making them, the tapes could
still be used by Ken Starr. First, Starr is currently presenting
evidence to a grand jury, where all the rules against tainted
evidence don't apply.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if an ordinary jury ever hears a case against President
Clinton or Lewinsky, it will be under Federal rules of evidence.
Federal statutes do not prohibit one party from secretly taping a
conversation (although they also don't stop states from prohibiting
it), so federal courts won't exclude the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Third, except for the last tapes she made at Starr's behest by
wearing a wire during face-to-face conversations, Tripp was acting
as a private citizen and not as an agent of the government. The
purpose of excluding illegally obtained evidence is to make sure
the government (police, prosecutors, etc.) has no incentive to
violate people's constitutional rights. Therefore, the
``exclusionary rule'' rarely applies to evidence illegally obtained
by a private citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was legal for Starr to assist Tripp in wearing a
body-wire because with a body-wire, unlike a wiretap, a Federal
prosecutor does not have to get permission from a judge. The law
distinguishes between body-wires and wiretaps because body-wires
indicate that at least one participant, Linda Tripp in this
instance, consents to taping the conversation.

 TINA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD  
 By JONATHAN MAHLER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The queen is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Come Aug. 1, New Yorker editor Tina Brown will depart and make
room for the magazine's fifth--but not yet announced--editor. The
bomb was dropped at a hastily convened meeting at 10:30 Wednesday
morning. Indeed, many of the magazine's staffers were still sipping
their first cup of coffee when word went out that Tina wanted to
address ``the staff.'' And so they gathered in what is known as
``the piazza,'' an open space adjacent to the corridor where the
magazine's senior editors sit.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a simple blue suit, her hair streaked with just the
right amount of blond, Tina walked into the piazza and started
speaking while stragglers were still making their way up the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   This was, she said, a very difficult thing to do, but she had
been presented with an opportunity that she simply couldn't refuse.
After uttering the usual platitudes about how The New Yorker is the
best magazine in the business, Tina became farklempt as she
pronounced, ``I love you all.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, came the hugs--along with tears from the
members of Tina's inner-circle who are surely wondering what all of
this means for them.
</P>
<P>
   And what does it mean for Tina's devotees? Slate can only
speculate. Tina is certainly responsible for bringing in most of
the magazine's hottest writers, and here we're referring to people
like the unrivaled David Remnick and Malcolm Gladwell, both of whom
cut their teeth at the Washington Post. Some will probably follow
Tina to her next stop, a new media venture formed by Miramax that
will publish a monthly magazine and books, as well as produce films
and television shows. (She will be the chairwoman and a part owner
of the new company.)
</P>
<P>
   But what will become of The New Yorker? During Tina's tenure,
the magazine's editors were always talking about ``the mix''--the
never-ending struggle to strike the right balance between the
slashy and the serious. The charge that Tina was too fond of the
former is by now a cliche. It is also probably the last thing on
the mind of billionaire Si Newhouse, who suddenly seems concerned
with turning a profit at the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame him? After all, as Fortune put it recently,
the president and CEO of Conde Nast, Steven Florio, ``turned a
mildly profitable property into one of the greatest money pits in
American magazine history.'' Under the Florio brothers, Steve and
Tom, The New Yorker has lost a whopping $175 million. It's no
surprise, then, that Newhouse has decided to merge the magazine
into his Conde Nast empire. Next year, the The New Yorker's
sinecured staffers will move into Conde
</P>
<P>
   Nast's new headquarters and will fight for phone lines and desk
space with the rest of Si's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   As for who will preside over this dark day in New Yorker
history, we can only report what we have gleaned from the rumor
mill over on 43rd Street. The most obvious candidate seems to be
Graydon Carter, the celebrity (if not celebrated) editor of Vanity
Fair who has perfected the formula for the profile that
simultaneously glamorizes and eviscerates its subject.
</P>
<P>
   It seems less likely that Newhouse will go with an inside The
New Yorker candidate, though if he does, the best choice might be
James Stewart, a respected newspaperman who did a tour as Page One
editor of the Wall Street Journal in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Dark horses inside the magazine include Remnick and Kurt
Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   To this mix, Culturebox would like to add a candidate of its
own: Chip McGrath, the editor of the New York Times Book Review. A
former staff member at The New Yorker, McGrath was passed over when
Robert Gottlieb acceded to power, but over the past few years he
has done a bang-up job at the Book Review, giving it all of the
heft of the New York Review of Books with none of the intellectual
snobbery. All the while, he has been writing nifty pop culture
pieces for the New York Times Magazine, so he seems to have that
ingredient of ``the mix'' covered as well.
</P>
<P>
   Place your bets.

   US-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had made no secret over the last several
months that they would like to have a summit in the fall. As
Clinton wound down his long trip to China, the word began spreading
that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it
on Monday, the White House can expect a wave of criticism from
opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and
space cooperation. Clinton had been awaiting Russia's Parliament to
ratify the SALT II nuclear arms pact, but his decision to go seems
to be aimed at pressuring the Duma into such a ratification vote.

symbolic.'' Speaking to a Democratic group here on a wide range of
Israeli issues, Gold said the U.N. vote -- which passed ov
overwhelmingly -- represents ``no effective change'' in the PLO
status at the United Nations. Gold's remarks came a day before
Palestinian negotiators were set to arrive in Washington on Friday
for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

   USCHINA _ The congressional investigation of satellite exports
to China is likely to expand outside Loral Space and Communications

head of monitoring nuclear proliferation at the Pentagon during the
Bush Administration, the select committee that Gingrich appointed
will look at defense and makers of other high-tech equipment such
as Lockheed Martin and Motorola to see if national security was put
at risk. Since Georgia is such a big defense state, what does the
delegation views on the investigations. What do the companies think

   NIH _ WASHINGTON _ In the middle of fights over campaign
finances, tobacco legislation and other bones of contention,
President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Senate
Republican leaders and congressional Democrats all agree on a
fairly major initiative: that the research budget of the National
Institutes of Health should be dramatically increased, even doubled
over the next decade. To officials at Emory University in Atlanta,
which hopes to propel itself into one of the ``top 10'' research
institutions in the country during that time, this is welcome news.
The University of Texas, Eastern Carolina University and other
universitities around the country are also thrilled at the prospect
of easier access to what is already the largest pool of research
money in the world, by a factor of 10. Why is this idea suddenly so
popular? There are several theories, including the fact that
politicians sense that meaningful medical breakthroughs lie just
ahead and the aging of the politically powerful Baby Boomers, who
are now reaching the stage in life where their own health has
replaced earlier concerns. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

LINES DRAWN OVER MERGER OF NATIONSBANK, BANKAMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Federal Reserve Bank here was pelted with
testimony about the planned merger of San Francisco's venerable
BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank Corp. of North Carolina, a deal
some consumer groups believe could threaten lending to minority and
lower-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people were scheduled to testify in hearings
Thursday and Friday in a plain conference room at the Federal
Reserve Bank. On the opening day, hand-painted banners lined the
walls, bearing messages such as, ``Keep my money in California,''
and ``Say no to the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the $60 billion merger proposal, Charlotte-based
NationsBank would become BankAmerica, but the merged bank's
headquarters would move from San Francisco to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Announced in April, the merger would create a bank with $570
billion in assets and 29 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was a two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank and its supporters flew in elderly folks, low-income
home buyers and small-business people to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without NationsBank's help, I would have lost my home,'' said
Ginnie McNab, 70, a retired hospital employee who was approved for
a $75,000 mortgage at 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents speaking Thursday were poised for a battle, but
acknoweleged the merger was destined for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a street fight _ we'll close NationsBank down,'' said
Mario Obledo of the California Coalition of Hispanic Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica has been a corporate institution in San Francisco
for nearly a century, since it was founded in North Beach by
Italian immigrant A.P. Giannini.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials fear the merger will lead to thousands of lost
jobs, poorer service for consumers and a reduction in loans and
investment for low-income and minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the merger proposal, NationsBank and BankAmerica
announced a record $350 billion commitment over 10 years for
nationwide community lending. The plan includes $180 billion for
small businesses, $115 billion for affordable housing, $25 billion
for economic development and $30 billion for consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica has enjoyed a reputation as its industry's pioneer
and leader in community lending over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: BankAmerica executives have placed a high priority
on serving women and minorities, small businesses and people in
low- to moderate-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians and community groups fear that NationsBank,
which will run the new bank, may neglect its community investments
in California _ despite NationsBank's strong lending record in
other parts of the country. Studies suggest local community lending
tails off when a bank moves its headquarters to another region.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing bank mergers, the Fed must look at the banks'
community lending records. Banks are required under the 1977
Community Reinvestment Act to provide loans and capital in all
neighborhoods in which they have branches.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have never killed a major bank merger on these
grounds, although a handful of smaller deals have been stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, the Justice Department and the Treasury Department are
expected to sign off on the proposed BankAmerica-NationsBank merger
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the Fed hearing Thursday were NationsBank Chairman
Hugh McColl and the head of BankAmerica, Dave Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My company has been through many mergers over the past 20
years,'' McColl said. ``We have found _ almost universally _ that
employment, lending, community development efforts and charitable
contributions actually increase. This has been our vision, and will
continue to be so with this merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter added, ``I can assure you that BankAmerica has brought
unparalleled commitment to the communities we serve. The new
BankAmerica will continue in this manner, but on a much larger
scale than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger foes _ led by San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno, the
Greenlining Institute and the California Reinvestment Committee _
urged that concrete financial promises to California be part of the
merger proposal before the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Every major bank merger in California since 1992 has had
community lending agreements added to the Fed applications, said
Alan Fisher of the California Reinvestment Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If the new BankAmerica refuses to set firm lending goals in the
Golden State, the community groups threatened to steer consumers to
other banks.
</P>
<P>
   Merger opponents also said they could delay the merger for
several months, costing the banks millions of dollars. But they
conceded they don't have the legal or political firepower to derail
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know the merger is going to be approved,'' said Kevin
Williams of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. ``This
merger was approved on the golf course. This deal has already been
cut, and we've been cut out.''

TEXAS TRAINING SITE TEACHES SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES

<P>
   DILLEY, Texas _ The battleground to combat international
terrorism has spread to the mesquite-studded ranchland of southern
Texas, where crashing cars and firearms training are all part of
life-saving instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Learning how to ram a vehicle blocking the roadway to help
escape a trap and being proficient enough to shoot down a would-be
assailant are elements of instruction at the newly opened
International Training Inc. facility here.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal is much simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach recognition and avoidance,'' Jerry Hoffman, president
of the ITI, said Thursday at a grand opening of the training site
in Dilley, about 50 miles south of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are forced to shoot (an assailant), it means you have
probably missed a lot of things to get you into that situation,''
Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The training is designed for business executives, wealthy
families and even Defense Department employees who might be targets
of kidnapping or terrorist threats in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Dilley operation is the company's first U.S. venture outside
its headquarters in West Point, Va. That facility opened in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of individuals who have received the training in
Virginia, none has been kidnapped or killed, said Chuck Torpy,
another ITI official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 46 documented cases where our training has been used
in overseas situations to avoid a kidnapping or terrorism,'' Torpy
said. ``The 100 percent effectiveness result is something we're
proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said Dilley was selected as a training site because of
its proximity to Central and South America, where kidnappings and
violent crime against wealthy residents and visitors have reached
near-epidemic proportions in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three biggest threats are international terrorism,
international kidnapping and domestic/international violent
crime,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The normal course lasts about three days, including classroom
instruction, evasive driving and firearms training. It costs about
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most valuable tools you have are your eyes and head, not
any weapons you might have,'' said Bob Lukens, director of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Using vehicles as a weapon, however, is a part of the
specialized training on more than two miles of paved roadways that
have been built on the 275-acre training campus.
</P>
<P>
   In one session, clients learning to become security officers are
taught to ram a vehicle blocking their exit route, spinning the
vehicle out of the way to allow them and the people they are
protecting to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing how little (push) is needed to cause a vehicle
to spin out of your way,'' Lukens said, explaining that technique
is the key.
</P>
<P>
   The training center is operated in conjunction with ITI's parent
company, O'Gara-Hess &AMP; Eisenhardt, the world's leading manufacturer
of protective vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   W. Daniel Heimbrock, the marketing manager, said the company had
constructed the armored vehicles for U.S. presidents since Truman
and sells to customers throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal mobile security is valuable to some people, but not
everyone,'' he said. ``You can install security measures in your
home and at your business, but you are most vulnerable when you are
out on the streets.''

 &HT;    CLINTON HOPES TO BUOY YELTSIN AND IMPROVE U.S-RUSSIA RELATIONS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-US-BOX-$ADV11.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ World leaders prefer to hold summits without surprises,
well-scripted meetings before the television cameras which portray
men of action, but where usually nothing much happens.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dangerous prospects of a Russian economic collapse
and a widening war in the Balkans forced U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to wait no longer for a
chance at talks on an serene stage.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S.-Russia summit in 18 months, announced this week,
is scheduled to take place in Moscow in September amid growing
uncertainty about Russia's future and increasingly strained
relations between Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton understands that Yeltsin is in a very difficult
position domestically and the longer he waits to visit the riskier
the situation could become,'' said Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy
director of the USA and Canada Institute, a Moscow-based think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S.-Russian relations have been frozen over the past year,
nothing is happening, and that is a very dangerous thing,''
Kremenyuk added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accepted the invitation to visit Russia despite the
failure of the opposition-led Russian legislature to fulfill a
request to ratify the START II arms control treaty signed with the
United States in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's mounting economic problems and the spreading
violence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the White House
concluded it could no longer wait for a summit celebrating a START
II ratification that is no where in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin needs help, and Clinton has decided to come to his side.
Aides insist the two men enjoy a close, personal rapport,
exchanging telephone calls about once a month and meeting at
international forums, like the May summit of world leaders in
England.
</P>
<P>
   But while the two countries have grown closer since the days of
the Soviet Union and their Cold War rivalry, they are not staunch
allies, a fact clearly demonstrated by an array of foreign policy
differences.
</P>
<P>
   During his recently concluded trip to China, some critics
questioned whether Clinton was neglecting a more important
strategic relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last Clinton-Yeltsin summit in March 1997 in Helsinki,
U.S.-Russia relations have soured on issues including NATO
expansion in eastern Europe, international sanctions against Iraq,
and Russian arms and technology sales to Iran and other developing
nations
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit to Moscow is chiefly being characterized by
analysts here as an urgent mission of mercy intended to bolster
Yeltsin's image as a world leader, back his efforts at economic
reform and restore confidence in Russia's sagging financial markets
among foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   An all-out economic meltdown would send consumer prices
skyrocketing, further diminishing Yeltsin's clout and ruining
chances for more democratic and market reforms in the foreseeable
future, analysts predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West doesn't need Yeltsin, but it predicts chaos were he
to be forced from office before his term ended. They don't see a
figure reliable enough to substitute for the current leader,'' said
political scientist Alexei Bogaturov.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to travel to Moscow later
this month for meetings with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to
formulate and agenda for the Clinton-Yeltsin summit.
</P>
<P>
   But just how Clinton's visit will play in Russia is difficult to
predict, given the volatile economy, simmering nationwide labor
strikes and Yeltsin's low ratings in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's early honeymoon years as a champion of Western-style
reform following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 have given way
to disillusionment as most Russians have seen their standard of
living diminished during the long, ongoing transition to democracy
and free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, controlled by
Communists and nationalists hostile to Yeltsin, is scheduled in
September to consider an unpopular, belt-tightening budget and the
long-delayed ratification of the START II agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a political moderate and the Duma's first
deputy speaker, warned that a contentious autumn is looming just as
Clinton arrives in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can safely say that unfortunately it will be a hot autumn,''
he told a news conference this week. It is already clear that
growing arrears on pensions, wages and the defense order will
exacerbate social tensions and popular discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is currently negotiating an aid package with the
International Monetary Fund to help it meet its short-term debt
obligations and strengthen the ruble. But some foreign investors
predict Russia may need $20 billion or more to restore confidence
in the economy and prevent a devaluation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma is scheduled to meet next Wednesday and Thurday to
consider a austerity measures prompted by the Yeltsin government
and considered necessary before the IMF approves an assistance
package.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economic slide -- its markets have lost almost
two-thirds of their value in the past year -- may have prompted the
Clinton White House to abandon hopes of a START II ratification,
which the Duma has announced it will not consider before it
convenes for its fall session.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate ratified the arms control treaty in 1996. But
despite pleas from Yeltsin, the opposition-dominated Duma has
continually put off a vote on the treaty, which would cut Russian
and American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Another pressing issue is Kosovo and the Serbian crackdown on
separatist ethnic Albanian forces. The Clinton administration has
pushed for tougher economic and military sanctions to temper
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and prevent a wider conflict
in the Balkans. Russia has opposed harsh steps against the Serbs,
whom they view as traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the United States and Russia have confronted one
another at the United Nations over policy toward Iraq, another
traditional Soviet-era ally where Russia has potentially lucrative
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's promise to continue pushing for enlargement of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization also has alarmed Russians, many
of whom regard NATO expansion as an implicit declaration that the
U.S. continues to consider Russia a potential enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the U.S. Senate ratified a NATO agreement to admit three
former Warsaw Pact countries: Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic. Yeltsin is expected to reiterate Russia's opposition to
the expansion, and particularly proposed NATO membership for the
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once part of the
Soviet Union.

RADIO SHACK'S ELECTRONIC BUFFET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. _ In 1921, a young immigrant named Theodore
Deutschmann opened a downtown Boston store that sold leftover Army
gear to ham radio operators; he called his store RadioShack.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-seven years later _ and 35 years after a Texas
entrepreneur named Charles Tandy essentially bought it in 1963 _
RadioShack opened its 5,000th company-owned store here in the
Northshore Mall Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Franchisees own another nearly 2,000 stores. As a result,
RadioShack and its corporate parent, Fort Worth-based Tandy Corp.,
can claim they operate more stores than virtually any other
retailer, with the possible exception of McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   As Tandy president Leonard H. Roberts likes to say,
``Ninety-four percent of all Americans live or work within five
minutes of a RadioShack.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Few chains can claim greater longevity. Five-and-dime stores
have given way to Wal-Mart and Kmart. Mom-and-pop stores have been
decimated by category-killers in big-box superstores that focus on
one category of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet RadioShack continues to thrive by selling many things in
small stores not much larger than fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Everybody knows that McDonald's is famous for hamburgers, but
if RadioShack were in the food business, it would be a dim sum
restaurant, a giant buffet line of accessories for the electronics
age.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of one dominant product line, it offers a little bit of
everything for customers whose houses are crammed with phones,
electric garage openers, boom boxes, timers to turn the lights on,
personal computers, and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Huge assortments are a holdover from the old days. In his first
store, founder Deutschmann sold vacuum tubes for radios _ and pots
and pans if he could get a good deal on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold the first police radio scanner,'' said Jerry Colella,
who began a 30-year career with RadioShack in 1958. ``The
Patrolman, it was called. It sold for $19.95.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutschmann was shrewd when it came to knowing what ham
operators wanted. What he didn't understand was credit. When he
began offering customers credit in the 1960s, the chain, now nine
stores, ran into trouble, allowing Charles Tandy to essentially buy
it for the bargain-basement price of $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy's family was in the leather business, selling laces and
heels first to cobblers, and later expanding into wallet-and
belt-making kits as leisure time exploded after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In Tandy's view, tinkering with TVs and hi-fis was a hobby for
the future, and he rapidly expanded RadioShack.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chain's best customers are do-it-yourselfers, but
president Roberts, who will assume the title of chief executive
Jan. 1, sees a new breed of customer, people who are a &UR;  &LR; little
intimidated by technology and who are asking, ``Do it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people want to be connected to technology, but they're
confused and they want help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's where RadioShack comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our job to demystify technology for the masses,'' said
Roberts, who five years ago came up with the RadioShack slogan:
``You've got questions. We've got answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' background isn't in surge protectors or batteries; it's
in roast beef sandwiches. He previously held the top jobs at
Shoney's Inc. and Arby's Inc., both fast-food restaurant chains.
</P>
<P>
   That experience was perfect training for RadioShack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both restaurants and RadioShack are all about providing service
to customers, says Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Small in square footage, RadioShack has consistently done well.
But Tandy ran into difficulties when it experimented with larger
formats that depended on low-margin, big-ticket items.
</P>
<P>
   Its Computer City stores, which it just sold to CompUSA Inc.,
are 25,000 square feet; its Incredible Universe stores, which it
exited from a few years ago, were nearly 200,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by Roberts to refocus Tandy on RadioShack are reflected
in company numbers. In fiscal 1996, Tandy lost about $92 million on
sales of $6.3 billion. In 1997, Tandy reported a profit of $187
million on sales of about $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, RadioShack has had success with store-within-a-store
concepts. It offers products from Sprint Corp. in such a setting,
and telephone-related products account for nearly 30 percent of
revenues. It also has a special section for products made by Compaq
Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   These alliances strengthen RadioShack and give it more leverage
with its vendors, said George F. Sutton, an analyst with Dain
Rauscher Wessels in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What RadioShack can say to a Compaq or a Sprint is, `We have
nearly 100 percent penetration (with our stores) in the United
States; if you want to reach a broad section of Americans, use us,
but we need something from you in return,''' said Sutton, who
thinks RadioShack can sustain monthly sales increases at its older
stores in the 5 to 8 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday RadioShack formally unveiled another
``store-within-a-store,'' this one called the PowerZone, which is
devoted to batteries, surge protectors, and similar accessories.
</P>
<P>
   An ad campaign will break soon starring James Doohan, the actor
who played Scotty in the original Star Trek series.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty, who powered up the Enterprise, will be joined in the ads
by power-hungry historical characters such as Cleopatra and
Napoleon. The ad's message: RadioShack can satisfy the power needs
of even the toughest of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries, telephone cables, wires for the satellite TV dish _
all these little things are adding up in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bread-and-butter business is really strong,'' said
analyst Lynn Detrick of Sanders Morris Mundy Inc. in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Because RadioShack sells so many things _ most stores carry
about 3,700 items, including 50 different batteries, it has no
direct competitors, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Roberts thinks RadioShack's future is bright.
With the rapid changes in technology, people will need RadioShack
more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to tell us, `We love technology, we can
afford technology, but please just come in to my house and tell us
what button to push,''' Roberts said.

 &HT;    IRAN'S HARDLINERS TRY TO TURN BACK THE REFORMERS

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's hardliners are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   A fact brought home recently when conservative clerics -- those
men with the long brown robes, turban-like headwear and cellular
telephones -- hustled around the parliament that they control to
efficiently orchestrate the ouster of moderate President Mohammed
Khatami's top cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   To ordinary Iranians, it was ominous but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   A year into the term of the popular but not-so-powerful
president, the political climate in this country of 60 million
people swings daily between Khatami's quest for reform and
conservative backlashes against him.
</P>
<P>
   While Khatami stocks his government with moderates, the
religious conservatives run the parliament, courts and the
military.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers are now free to take their case to the streets,
their demonstrations are sometimes broken up by semi-official mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The political and cultural clash is laid out in the pages and
offices of the lively Iranian press.
</P>
<P>
   At Shalamche magazine's storefront office, the walls are covered
in burlap, one corner is ringed with sandbags and artillery shells
are used as trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   The young, idealistic, editors do not talk to foreign
journalists, but their magazine defends Islamic values under
attack. Originally dedicated to the memory of the 1980s Iran-Iraq
war, its latest target is across town: The Jameah daily.
</P>
<P>
   Jameah is a snappy broad-sheet that started in the bloom of more
than 300 publications founded since Khatami's election. It pokes
fun at political leaders and prints long interviews with
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Its office is also staffed with young idealists, but it is in a
California-styled villa. A tongue-in-cheek staff petition posted on
the wall asks editors why the swimming pool is empty.
</P>
<P>
   But Jameah has bigger problems than an empty pool. The Iranian
courts have ordered it to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from traditionalism to modernism,'' urges the
paper's editor, Mashallah Shamsolvazeen. ``Don't let this newborn
baby, the (Khatami) election, die now.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami supporters sometimes call themselves ``The May 23
Front,'' referring to the election last year when Khatami stunned
the world by winning 70 percent of the Iranian vote.
</P>
<P>
   Youth and women _ two groups especially hard-pressed under
Iran's strict Islamic rule _ were strong supporters. In his
cautious talk about a ``civil society,'' Khatami offered hope of
more personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The poor were attracted to his pledges to improve the Iranian
economy, largely controlled by quasi-government conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   His win inspires open, but still dangerous, questioning of
whether religious rulers should have the final say in government.
</P>
<P>
   The press is flourishing. Women are asking for more rights to
divorce and for child custody. Unmarried couples feel freer to hold
hands in public.
</P>
<P>
   But, Khatami's mandate recently suffered losses on three fronts:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last month, the parliament, run by Khatami's conservative
election opponent, impeached Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri was a key Khatami confidante whose office gave him a say
in how future elections will be organized and the power to appoint
the mayor's of Iran's cities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The judiciary, run by religious authorities, has placed Tehran
Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi on trial for corruption. Seen as a
reformer and an effective administrator of the city of 10 million
people, he helped run Khatami's election.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The judiciary, also, ordered the closing of the Jameah
newspaper after complaints were filed against it by a large,
quasi-government business group and the prisons department. The
paper is still running, as it appeals the order.
</P>
<P>
   The attack against Nouri illustrated the hardliners' approach.
</P>
<P>
   They accused him of allowing too many public demonstrations and
replacing too many old administrators. They said crime and disorder
were rising and that he was encouraging supporters of Karbaschi to
challenge the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has preferred one man (Karbaschi) over a nation,'' said
parliament member Taher Taheri(cq). ``He has given permission to
too many to speak out and comment, causing great stress in the
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami supporters say the hardliners know the president is too
popular to attack directly. So they attack his advisers, hoping to
tarnish the president and the idea of reform in this
still-conservative society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever anyone talks about freedom, soon (the hardliners)
connect the word 'freedom' to immorality,'' said student activist
Serajeddin Mirdamad (cq).
</P>
<P>
   Even in south Tehran, a working-class area where people adhere
to strict Muslim customs, they worry about their beloved president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting pressure on him . . . If he weren't limited,
he could do so many good things,'' said Abbas Zavaraian, 35, who
works in his father's ice cream store.
</P>
<P>
   He explains Khatami's popularity simply: ``A good man will be
loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives are trying to preserve their power in a
society where the sources of power have always been hard to define
and are now getting even cloudier.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameni, is the ultimate
director of the police, military, courts and many business groups.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Khatami, who had served in the government in the
past, to run for president at a time most thought he had no chance
of winning.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Khameni was visibly weak at a public appearance and
Tehran is flush with whispers that he has a terminal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's own influence is limited both by the narrow powers of
his office and Iran's history of harshness with reformers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, clerics in the parliament impeached President Abolhasan
Bani Sadr after he tried to centralize power and reform the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami enters while Iran's fortunes are mixed. It has largely
recovered from it's eight-year war against Iraq. It is modern and
productive despite a U.S. trade embargo against this country it
says sponsors terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But, slumping oil prices are gouging deficits into the
government's budget and increasing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all Iranians were born after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution that ousted the dictatorial Shah of Iran, and they are
restless for material and social freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami is wary of giving his opposition any ammunition in their
claims that reform leads to chaos. He consistently urges followers
to stick to only legal, non-violent avenues for activism.
</P>
<P>
   Many have urged him to respond more forcefully, which he finally
did when the parliament fired his interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as the impeachment, Khatami appointed Nouri to a
newly created position with broader authority -- a move reportedly
viewed as a direct challenge to the conservative offensive.

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ These are dicey times for Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   On my trip last month, I could sense the difference from my last
visit in December.
</P>
<P>
   Then, reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing
their fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Iranians are channel-surfing between World Cup soccer games
and the trial of the popular Tehran mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Gholamhossein Karbaschi is accused of corruption, but most
Iranians think he was targeted by the religious hardliners who run
the courts because he managed Khatami's surprisingly successful
election.
</P>
<P>
   As in December, Iranians are still seeing increased freedom.
But, the Karbaschi trial is just one example that reform still has
its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues causing friction is how Iran should show
itself to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The day after watching a televised World Cup match with a group
of young Iranians, one called and asked that I not tell anyone I
was with there.
</P>
<P>
   These days, an evening with a foreign journalist can be
controversial, especially if the evening in question includes
cassettes of Western dance music.
</P>
<P>
   When hardliners in the Iranian parliament last month impeached
Khatami's top cabinet minister, Abdullah Nouri, they cited his
comments in the foreign press. There were too many outsiders, they
said, carrying news about Iran's private business.
</P>
<P>
   I got the same response when my translator tried to set up an
appointment with the head of the unofficial ``club wielders,'' the
hardline mobs that break up reformist demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they want to know about our internal affairs,'' he
asked, saying it seemed like a form of ``espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's identity is built around martyrdom and persecution. Some
are afraid that if Iran opens up, people will see that Iranians are
not all stern religious zealots.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a hard secret to keep. Iranians are, in fact, fun and
sophisticated, friendly and educated. Go to this capital city's
working-class south side and interview the grocery store owner, and
he'll want to treat you to lunch. The ice cream salesman insists
that you fill up while you ask him your questions.
</P>
<P>
   The many parks and shopping districts in Tehran are some of the
most fertile ground for interviews in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   One western observer noted that hardliners are afraid Iran will
be perceived as ``the kind of country America doesn't have to worry
about.'' That would almost be contrary to Iran's national
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   But, the reformers are glad to have foreign journalists around.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate government officials, led by Khatami, are making it
easier for foreigners to get visas and are encouraging American
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The average Iranian on the street wanted me to know that Iran is
changing, even as they are nervous about how far they will be
allowed to go.
</P>
<P>
   They told me not to pay attention to the people who shout
``Death to America'' at Friday prayers, saying it was passe
sloganism.
</P>
<P>
   One should not take this too far. Overall, Iranians still
believe in the basic principles of the Islamic revolution. The late
Ayatollah Khomeini is still beloved.
</P>
<P>
   But one intellectual also reminded me that, ever since the
Muslims conquered the country in the 7th Century, Iranians have
adopted stern public behaviors to satisfy their religious rulers,
while leading much more relaxed, accommodating, private lives.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, in the carousing described by the Persian poets
Omar Khayam or Hafiz, that Iran has always had many faces.
</P>
<P>
   You could have looked at the streets of Tehran after the
national team beat the United States in World Cup soccer. The team
is a patriotic phenomenon and has become a vehicle for Iranians to
test out new freedoms without fear of reprisal from the Islamic
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that hard-line Iranian officials made it difficult
for American networks to beam out much video of the jubilant soccer
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The world would have seen happy Iranians having what any
American would consider clean fun. One clip that was censored
showed youths saying they were ready for good relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   There was even one girl in the street stretching modesty laws by
wearing make up in public. She had the Iranian flag's red, white
and green painted on her face.
</P>
<P>
   What are the conservatives supposed to do about that?

   TEHRAN, Iran _ These are dicey times for Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   On my trip last month, I could sense the difference from my last
visit in December.
</P>
<P>
   Then, reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing
their fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Iranians are channel-surfing between World Cup soccer games
and the trial of the popular Tehran mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Gholamhossein Karbaschi is accused of corruption, but most
Iranians think he was targeted by the religious hardliners who run
the courts because he managed Khatami's surprisingly successful
election.
</P>
<P>
   As in December, Iranians are still seeing increased freedom.
But, the Karbaschi trial is just one example that reform still has
its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues causing friction is how Iran should show
itself to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The day after watching a televised World Cup match with a group
of young Iranians, one called and asked that I not tell anyone I
was with there.
</P>
<P>
   These days, an evening with a foreign journalist can be
controversial, especially if the evening in question includes
cassettes of Western dance music.
</P>
<P>
   When hardliners in the Iranian parliament last month impeached
Khatami's top cabinet minister, Abdullah Nouri, they cited his
comments in the foreign press. There were too many outsiders, they
said, carrying news about Iran's private business.
</P>
<P>
   I got the same response when my translator tried to set up an
appointment with the head of the unofficial ``club wielders,'' the
hardline mobs that break up reformist demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they want to know about our internal affairs,'' he
asked, saying it seemed like a form of ``espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's identity is built around martyrdom and persecution. Some
are afraid that if Iran opens up, people will see that Iranians are
not all stern religious zealots.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a hard secret to keep. Iranians are, in fact, fun and
sophisticated, friendly and educated. Go to this capital city's
working-class south side and interview the grocery store owner, and
he'll want to treat you to lunch. The ice cream salesman insists
that you fill up while you ask him your questions.
</P>
<P>
   The many parks and shopping districts in Tehran are some of the
most fertile ground for interviews in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   One western observer noted that hardliners are afraid Iran will
be perceived as ``the kind of country America doesn't have to worry
about.'' That would almost be contrary to Iran's national
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   But, the reformers are glad to have foreign journalists around.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate government officials, led by Khatami, are making it
easier for foreigners to get visas and are encouraging American
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The average Iranian on the street wanted me to know that Iran is
changing, even as they are nervous about how far they will be
allowed to go.
</P>
<P>
   They told me not to pay attention to the people who shout
``Death to America'' at Friday prayers, saying it was passe
sloganism.
</P>
<P>
   One should not take this too far. Overall, Iranians still
believe in the basic principles of the Islamic revolution. The late
Ayatollah Khomeini is still beloved.
</P>
<P>
   But one intellectual also reminded me that, ever since the
Muslims conquered the country in the 7th Century, Iranians have
adopted stern public behaviors to satisfy their religious rulers,
while leading much more relaxed, accommodating, private lives.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, in the carousing described by the Persian poets
Omar Khayam or Hafiz, that Iran has always had many faces.
</P>
<P>
   You could have looked at the streets of Tehran after the
national team beat the United States in World Cup soccer. The team
is a patriotic phenomenon and has become a vehicle for Iranians to
test out new freedoms without fear of reprisal from the Islamic
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that hard-line Iranian officials made it difficult
for American networks to beam out much video of the jubilant soccer
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The world would have seen happy Iranians having what any
American would consider clean fun. One clip that was censored
showed youths saying they were ready for good relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   There was even one girl in the street stretching modesty laws by
wearing make up in public. She had the Iranian flag's red, white
and green painted on her face.
</P>
<P>
   What are the conservatives supposed to do about that?

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Here are the issues facing U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who are scheduled to meet in
Moscow in September:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA'S ECONOMY: The prospect of a crash is spurring Clinton to
visit Moscow. Russia needs an international bailout. Yeltsin and
his democratic reforms could be in danger should the ruble crash
and poor Russians face skyrocketing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   THE BALKANS: The U.S. warns that a broader Balkans war is
possible unless international pressure is placed on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the Serbian crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Russia has resisted, regarding the
Serbs as traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
   NATO EXPANSION: The security organization designed to counter
Soviet aggression during the Cold War is looking to expand to
countries once behind the Iron Curtain, a move many Russians regard
as a threat. Invitations have gone to Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS REDUCTION: In their last summit, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed
to pursue new strategic arms cuts as soon as the Duma ratified
START II, a treaty signed in January 1993. The Duma, Russia's lower
house of Parliament controlled by Communists and other Yeltsin
opponents, have withheld the political plum.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ: Russia has been a leading voice in the United Nations to
relax economic sanctions and weapons inspections imposed on Iraq
since the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The U.S. wants to keep the
pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pending proof that he
has abandoned his weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN: The U.S. wants Russia to curb its exports of nuclear and
missile technology to Iran. Yeltsin has offered assurances that
Russia will halt shipments that could help Iran become a nuclear
power, but U.S. intelligence reports indicate that the transfers
continue.

GENE LETOURNEAU TURNED ORDINARY TALK INTO BACKWOODSY WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine -- This has been a tough week for icons. Roy
Rogers went to meet Trigger in that great corral up in the sky.Then
the conglomerate that owns the B&AMP;M Baked Beans plant here announced
that New England's quintessential baked bean factory is on the
block. And then Maine's favorite newspaperman, outdoor writer Gene
Letourneau, died at 90, ending a 65-year run as a journalist and
environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   That's two good men no longer with us, and the fate of the baked
beans that are truly oven-baked hangs in the corporate balance.
Pillsbury Co. of Minneapolis says it hopes to find a buyer for the
waterfront factory that has been churning out the syruppy magical
fruit in cans or jars for 85 years at the same location. The 160
workers were informed Monday that the Pillsbury Doughboy is going
off baked beans, but because the plant runs two shifts and demand
for the B&AMP;M brand remains strong, Pillsbury expects to find a buyer
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the B&AMP;M brand sells well in New England and in
Seattle, which makes me suspect that a lot of those high-tech types
who bailed out of the Land of the Bean and the Cod took their
fondness for baked beans with them when they went west to seek
their fortune.
</P>
<P>
   So you can still get your B&AMP;M beans, at least for a while, and
you can watch old Rogers flicks on video. But the words and wisdom
of Gene Letourneau are a finite commodity, and there won't be any
more of the columns he wrote virtually daily from 1946 on.
</P>
<P>
   In the way the late columnist Herb Caen came to embody the
spirit of the city of San Francisco, Letourneau wrote to and for
the folks who learned to hunt, fish, trap, and log before
``yuppies'' was a plural noun, or flatlanders found the forests.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Waterville in 1906, youngest of six kids, Letourneau was
city editor of the Waterville Sentinel when the boss, Guy Gannett,
asked him to write a daily outdoors column.
</P>
<P>
   Letourneau became a minor legend among New England newspapermen
for an accident that befell him in 1993, when he was alone in the
Allagash at a camp far from civilization. He'd taken a bad fall,
couldn't walk, and crawled for seven hours to reach his station
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hauled himself in, and drove 200 miles to his home in
Waterville _ with what turned out to be a fractured hip socket.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Sportsmen Say'' column ran in the Sentinel, the Press
Herald, the Maine Sunday Telegram,the Kennebec Journal and the
Central Maine Morning Sentinel. Anyone with interest in the
outdoors read him, and he built up a reputation for trustworthiness
and reliability that is rare in the journalism of this era.
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the former senator, credited Gene and Ed Muskie
for spearheading the environmental movement in the Pine Tree State.
At his testimonal dinner, Roberta Scruggs of the Portland Press
Herald wrote that the old newspaperman said: ``I'm the luckiest man
in the world. Every day was a holiday. It was just a great life.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a remarkable way with people, and his sincerity and honor
won over even the most taciturn of Maine police, politicians, and
woodsmen. ``I'd get scooped once in a while,'' he said of his
earlier years as a police reporter and city editor, ``I'd hold
stuff in confidence and somebody would scoop me. But I'd win out in
the long run. I wouldn't break a confidence with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With that simple recipe for trust, he fashioned a remarkable
career. ``I realized right away that listening to people was the
best bet,'' he said of column-writing. ``Let them give me a story,
then I'd do the best I could with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned ordinary conversation into backwoodsy wisdom,
collected in the Press Herald Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   _``You've got to be careful talking about dogs. It's worse than
talking about a man's woman.
</P>
<P>
   _``One thing I've noticed is when a man gets to be about 60 he's
not gung-ho about shooting things. He loses that desire.
</P>
<P>
   _``In the outdoors, you learn something new every day. A fellow
used to tell me you go down Main Street and it doesn't change very
much. But the outdoors changes every day.
</P>
<P>
   _``You can be president of the United States, but if the fish
don't want to strike, they won't. It's the greatest equalizer there
is.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Gannett chain's incoming president discovered
Letourneau's name and 60 years of active service on the employees
list in 1991, he thought it was a mistake, wrote Scruggs.
</P>
<P>
   The new executive asked Letourneau whom he reported to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I always reported to Guy P. Gannett,'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene, Guy Gannett died in 1954,'' said the new boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Gene, ``That's been a problem.''

`SOLDIERS' CAPTURES SUMMER ACTION PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SMALL SOLDIERS 
Directed by: Joe Dante 
Screenplay by: Gavin Scott, Adam Rifkin, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio 
Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Gregory Smith, Jay Mohr, Phil Hartman,
Kevin Dunn, David Cross, Ann Magnuson, Denis Leary, Wendy Schaal,
with the voices of Tommy Lee Jones, Frank Langella, Ernest
Borgnine, Jim Brown, Bruce Dern, George Kennedy, Sarah Michelle
Gellar, Christina Ricci 
Running time: 109 minutes  
Rated: PG-13 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Small Soldiers'' is the summer's cleverest package of sizzle
yet. It's a toy story with attitude, a high-tech ``Gremlins''
driven by an army of attack toys that opens fire on human gamesters
after real battlefield technology is built into their microchips.
Bloodthirsty little cyberdevils, they explode from their boxes
dressed in commando gear, bulging with molded muscle, plastic faces
sculpted into macho sneers. It's up to a couple of kids _ Gregory
Smith and Kirsten Dunst _ to get these particular genies back into
the bottle, or, failing that, to destroy them before they vaporize
the storybook Ohio suburb where the mayhem unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The film hits a hip note of tongue-in-cheek mock outrage as it
peddles crazed, soulless high-tech aggressiveness, while pretending
to send a message deploring it. As Denis Leary's cynical honcho of
the conglomerate that owns the toy company puts it, ``Don't call it
violence, call it action.'' In case anyone misses the point,
Leary's character is named Mars, as in the god of war. It won't be
giving away too much to reveal that a key computer password is
gizmo. Certainly the gizmos keep the pot boiling here, behaving
like evil clones of G.I. Joe. What's terrifying about them is their
resourcefulness. With nightmarish rapidity, they keep throwing
lethal transformations of household objects _ toasters, dish
antennas, nail guns _ at the humans and the good dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, called Gorgons, are a noble race whose appearance is
grotesque, but whose souls are gentle. They're headed by a
lion-like leader voiced with sonorous dignity by Frank Langella. He
and the Gorgons personify a longing for the natural world of wood,
boats, forests, waterfalls, and bows and arrows as opposed to
high-tech zap. Evoking such previous antitechnology races as the
Hobbits and the ``Planet of the Apes'' denizens, they have their
human analog, especially Kevin Dunn as the back-to-the-simple-life
father of the kid played by Smith, whose Sorcerer's Apprentice ways
open the door to the mischief. Dunst puts a nice fearless edge on
her character and amusingly embraces her teen banality rather than
apologizing for it.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, played by the late Phil Hartman in his final movie
role, adds to the entertainment quotient as a caricature of a
boorish gadget freak. Her taste backfires amusingly when her
roomful of inhumanly slender Wendy (read Barbie) dolls is
transformed into a nasty girl gang who get turned on by the
soldiers and are inclined to tie people up by tying them down, as
the Lilliputians did to Gulliver. The computer graphics and effects
wizards certainly keep things popping. Joe Dante, who directed
``Gremlins,'' does a smooth job of meshing the live and
computerized components. Hollywood has been at this sort of thing
ever since Tod Browning directed Lionel Barrymore in ``The
Devil-Doll,'' but ``Small Soldiers'' rejiggers the formula in
smart, high-impact ways as it works both sides of the street on the
destruction-as-commodity issue. With summer far from over, ``Small
Soldiers'' will give teenage boys of all ages reason to go on.

A SEABIRD REFUGE IN MAINE TAKES FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTERN EGG ROCK, Maine _ The sky is alive with scores of angry
terns, each screeching within inches of Terry Goodhue's ears as
they swoop past. Needle-sharp orange beaks peck the kneeling
researcher on the head, knocking his hat askew, while a few bomb
him with warm guano.
</P>
<P>
   Goodhue, who works for the National Audubon Society, pays no
mind to the attacks as he methodically attaches leg bands to the
fluffy, coffee-colored tern chicks on the ground. There's a
cardboard liner inside his hat for protection, and, not
surprisingly, it looks like a dart board from all the pecking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only forget your hat once,'' jokes Sandra Ruggiero, a
Lexington, Mass., schoolteacher and mother of four who has
volunteered for a two-week stint working with Goodhue.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the kingdom of the birds, a rare place where
conservationists have restored a natural order that humans _ and
the gulls that eat their waste _ have wiped out elsewhere. Out
here, on a 7-acre pile of granite topped with grass and ragweed on
Muscongus Bay, more than 5,000 terns, laughing gulls, puffins, and
other seabirds run a cacophonous nursery that they zealously guard
against intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Egg Rock is the fruit of a 25-year effort by Audubon
biologist Stephen Kress that began when he brought his first
suitcase full of puffin chicks to the island. Capitalizing on
public affection for puffins, whose penguin-like bodies and parrot
beaks make them tourist darlings, Kress has made a home for
less-loved birds, too, such as the black guillemot, which looks
like a web-footed pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable what's going on out there,'' said Kress, a
genial man whose trademark tam-o'-shanter hat gives him a jaunty
highlands look _ even though he's from Ohio. ``This is almost a
museum of what Maine seabird colonies used to be like'' before
European settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This unlikely museum, which has inspired imitators around the
world as well as five island spinoffs in Maine under Kress' Project
Puffin, remains a work in progress, however. Without human
intervention, aggressive herring and black-backed gulls _ which
thrive on waste from landfills and fishing boats _ would return to
drive out the other birds, including endangered roseate terns.
</P>
<P>
   So, Goodhue and the volunteers spend their summers in a uniquely
hostile world, an island so rocky that boats have difficulty
approaching, where the avian residents put up a ruckus every time
humans venture out of the one-room cabin affectionately known as
the ``Egg Rock Hilton.'' On wet days, the cloister of cabin life
has driven people to such boredom beaters as celebrating ``Black
Guillemot Appreciation Day.''
</P>
<P>
   With no electricity or water supply and soil too poor even to
grow tomatoes, the researchers are utterly dependent on the
mainland for supplies, yet largely cut off from civilization and
almost completely without privacy in this treeless place. In fact,
one of the few nods to human needs is the new outhouse; previously
the intertidal zone served as the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling imprisoned, however, the Egg Rockers feel
privileged, allowed to witness the daily drama of life in a bird
city against a backdrop of stunning ocean views of a lighthouse,
the artist colony on Monhegan Island, and the spruce-lined Maine
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Old journals of Project Puffin include paeans to island life
from such famous visitors as the late Marlin Perkins of ``Mutual of
Omaha's Wild Kingdom,'' and legendary bird guide author Roger Tory
Peterson. Journals also contain writings from hundreds of the
not-so-famous, such as Tom French, Massachusetts' top endangered
species official, who wrote fondly of his fried dogfish dinner on
the island in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the perfect antidote'' to everyday life, says
Ruggiero, the schoolteacher, who, like Montreal college student
Genevieve Smith and National Geographic photo editor Steven Walker,
is spending her vacation on the island.
</P>
<P>
   If life is hard on humans, of course, it is hardly less so for
the birds. The rocks outside the cabin window look like a barnyard
as dozens of downy tern chicks squeak for the attention of
fish-bearing parents. Often, only the first-hatched and biggest
terns survive, shoving aside the runts to starve, while chicks of
all species die from exposure to heat or rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just life out here, the way nature does its work. But
why do they have to be so cute?'' asks Walker, a bearish man in an
Australian bush hat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the death, though, few places are more full of life.
In the tall grass, black-hooded laughing gulls throw back their
heads in hysterical cackles, while baby barn swallows with
comically oversized yellow bills peer out from a nest on the porch
of the cabin. The black guillemots carry blood-colored eels to
their young hiding among the granite slabs, as eider ducks in
formation rush by just above the water surface.
</P>
<P>
   The noise of this giant nursery never ceases as parents and
chicks call out to each other through the night, joined by a
strange nocturnal addition, Leach's storm-petrels. These black
robin-sized birds make almost eerie calls from nests beneath the
cabin, sometimes waking up whoever's inside.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the puffins are the unquestioned stars, attracting three
different tour boats that circle the island each day loaded with
tourists. Quiet and quirky, these so-called ``clowns of the sea''
stand apart from the hubbub, often lined up on the rocks at odd
angles, quizzically looking from side to side like idlers with
hands behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can't get enough of them,'' said Kress, who seems
to have lost none of his enthusiasm for the birds either. ``I think
it's because they're vertical as we are. We tend to enjoy animals
that are like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists resent the public preference for star animals
such as gorillas and eagles, when others, from scarab beetles to
kangaroo rats, are no less valuable. But Kress saw a chance in the
puffins to recreate a whole landscape that humans had largely
destroyed through careless disposal of waste that caused a gull
population explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we have one charismatic bird'' among the
seabirds, said Kress, a professor at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   By early in this century, hunters and hat makers had nearly
wiped out puffins from the coast of Maine, the only place in the
United States that Atlantic puffins nest. The birds had made a
modest comeback by 1969 when Kress arrived, but puffins had lost
all but one of at least six Maine nesting sites to the trash-eating
gulls. Today, puffins are listed as a threatened species in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the decline, Kress and his team played nursemaid to
954 puffin chicks brought to Eastern Egg Rock from Newfoundland
from 1973 to 1986, digging artificial burrows for them to live in,
feeding them fish, and removing gull nests.
</P>
<P>
   The major scientific issue was whether or not puffin chicks
would return to raise their own young after their customary two to
three years at sea. To improve the odds, Kress' team put up dozens
of wooden puffin decoys in hopes of convincing the puffins that Egg
Rock was already a bona fide colony.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two decoys cemented to the rocks stand as reminders of
the landmark experiment, but the 18 pairs of puffins nesting on the
island feel right at home without them. Some have been returning
since the early 1980s to the same burrow and same mate. As a
tribute to Kress' success, wildlife managers from Quebec to the
Galapagos Islands now use decoys to draw seabirds.
</P>
<P>
   On Eastern Egg Rock, the puffins' return set the stage for the
broader goal of recreating a bird colony as it would have been
before European settlement. Driving off the herring and
black-backed gulls was enough for some species, such as the less
aggressive laughing gulls, while decoys and taped bird sounds
brought back the terns. In addition, Leach's storm-petrels moved in
to burrows that had been dug for the puffins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everything on the island that was ever known to breed
here,'' said Kress, including the largest common tern colony in the
state and over half of the roseate terns in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   And the birds don't simply coexist: They provide for the common
defense. A walk across Egg Rock quickly demonstrates why Alfred
Hitchcock went to a tern colony to film his 1963 thriller ``The
Birds.'' In minutes, three species of terns as well as the laughing
gulls take angrily to the air to repel intruders.
</P>
<P>
   But Kress, who wears a tam-o'-shanter so the birds will peck the
pompom instead of his head, sympathizes. Pointing to an Arctic tern
egg as its parents swirled overhead, he says, ``Its parents came
all the way from Antarctica to lay that one egg on that rock, so
they've got a lot invested.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Project Puffin now, Kress says, is to build
public support, which is why, after 25 years, he still answers
almost every student's inquiry about puffins. He and writer Pete
Salmansohn penned a book for elementary school children last year,
and educators for the project have talked to 2,000 students.
Recently, Kress hired a fund-raiser for the first time in hopes of
greatly increasing funding beyond the current modest
$400,000-a-year budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't care about these birds, it doesn't matter what
we do in the long run,'' Kress said.

THE LITTLE THINGS ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ant man was there, discovering two new six-legged species on
the forest floor. The lichen lady was there, too, surrounded by
green, flaky growth.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, two mussel men peered into glass-bottomed buckets
searching for pearly mollusks, while the grass guy plucked up long,
slender blades.
</P>
<P>
   By a 10 p.m deadline Saturday (July 4), they were well on their
way toward entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for
identifying the largest number of species in one day, with a
tentative count of 1,620.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the marathon was held to spark a love of nature
and to help create annual species hunts and community nature clubs
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marvelous thing; I hope it catches on,'' said Edward
O. Wilson, a naturalist, Harvard professor, and Pulitzer Prize
winner who is known as ``the ant man'' for his study of the
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and a fellow Harvard ant specialist, Stefan Cover,
discovered two ant species. ``And that ought to tell you something
about how little we know about things,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   But what the experts found in Concord and Lincoln will now be
widely known and available _ compiled for the first time in a
master bug, plant, animal, fungus, fish, and bird list.
</P>
<P>
   They used almost every tool imaginable to spot the species:
vials filled with formaldehyde, night-vision goggles, chest waders,
and binoculars. Friday night, small groups strung bedsheets between
trees in backyards. Bright mercury vapor lights illuminated the
cloth, and moments later, the expected guests arrived: moths.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur moth man John Himmelman's favorite so far? ``The
olive-shaded bird dropping moth,'' he said. The moth mimics the
look of droppings _ ``really beautiful'' ones, he said _ so it
doesn't get eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Himmelman only had to gaze onto a sheet to find his object of
fascination, but some specialists like Northeastern University
professor and biologist Gwilym Jones had to stay out all night to
find his prey: animals. The best sightings were a mink and an
ermine, although the latter was road kill.
</P>
<P>
   July Fourth was chosen for the census because it is the day
Henry David Thoreau chose to move into his cabin at Walden Woods,
the setting for his famous book ``Walden.'' It is also Biodiversity
Day. Concord and Lincoln were chosen because of Walden and because
the area has some of the oldest records of plant and animal
sightings, said naturalist Peter Alden, a census organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The idea wasn't simply to discover species but to catalog and
highlight the many species that have always existed in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to the Serengeti to see all types of things, but we
don't look right where we are. The ultimate goal in doing something
crazy like this is to have nature clubs in schools like the
debating club or football team ... to have community nature
clubs,'' Alden said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like bird watchers, finding species was as easy as
looking up. For others, like fish experts, it involved quite a bit
of diving.
</P>
<P>
   All herpetologist Tom Tyning had to do was walk along the
causeway at Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge to find snakes,
turtles, salamanders, and frogs. His two best finds were a musk
turtle, a tiny 4-inch turtle that normally stays underwater, and an
emerald green leopard frog, so named for its black spots with
yellowish-orange halos.
</P>
<P>
   Mussel experts Brian Reid and Henry Barbour waded into water and
put their heads into glass-bottomed buckets. Their work paid off:
They found an eastern pond mussel, listed as a species of special
concern in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is not a kindergarten nature walk. Most of these people
are experts,'' Alden said. ``But we want to get people interested
in what is around them ... There is so much.''

 UNDATED: ... private donations.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight years after its creation, the trust fund contains $920,000
that has mostly been stockpiled as an endowment. Last year, in its
first effort soliciting donations at the parks, DEM collected
$14,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been spending money for publicity, by any means,''
said Kelly Sinclair, director of the conservation trust.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Cellucci's administration implemented recommendations
from a 1997 study completed at a cost of $225,000 that said
Massachusetts could have a parks system ``second to none'' simply
by better budget management.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts lags many states in forging partnerships between
both private ventures and resorts and environmentally-minded
nonprofit groups. One exception: Its association with the
Appalachian Mountain Club, which runs a popular and well-equipped
visitors center at Mount Greylock in Lanesborough.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Steven Kulik, a Worthington Democrat, said
the state also should encourage more responsible logging, which
would generate revenue and improve the health of forests where
``good lumber is rotting in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   DEM Commissioner Peter C. Webber, a former five-term Republican
state senator from Pittsfield, said it has been hard enough just to
dig out from decades of underfunding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to get to a place where I could be a little more
proactive'' about establishing more and stronger partnerships to
enhance park operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Howard Fife, the manager for 20 years of Wells
State Park in Sturbridge and Brimfield State Forest, is typical of
DEM's successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things are improving,'' Fife said, citing new restrooms
at Brimfield and $70,000 in buildings and grounds renovations at
Wells. But both parks badly need and could easily accommodate more
campsites and trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of potential out there... (but) we don't know
what we've got, we don't know where we're going, and we don't know
what we need,'' said Fife.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews suggest several obstacles to creating the ``second to
none'' parks system DEM officials want:
</P>
<P>
   _Geography: Most state parks are located west and north of
Worcester, but the majority of Bay State residents live within
Interstate 495 and tend to head two hours north or south to New
Hampshire, Maine, or Cape Cod instead of two hours west to a state
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do a very good job of advertising within our own
state what we have,'' said Senator Durand. At least half of the
visitors to some parks are from Connecticut, New York, or New
Jersey _ not voters who can influence budget-writing legislators.
</P>
<P>
   _Private alternatives: The extensive, generally first-rate
sanctuaries and sites owned by the Trustees of Reservations and the
Massachusetts Audubon Society meet much demand for outdoor
recreation and thus reduce public pressure to improve state parks.
</P>
<P>
   _Lobbying: ``No group has had the parks as its single purpose,''
said James Gomes, head of the Environmental League of
Massachusetts, a group whose roots can be traced back 100 years to
the Massachusetts Forest and Park Association. ``If this had stayed
a single-purpose organization, there probably would be a different
picture for the parks system.''
</P>
<P>
   _Funding: Entrance and camping fees collected by DEM are
swallowed up by the state treasury, and legislators set DEM's
budget, creating little incentive for park workers to attract more
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing park advocates, state Representative Douglas W.
Petersen, a Marblehead Democrat who heads the Natural Resources
Committee, slammed as ``a horrendous decision'' Weld's
election-year gambit in 1994 to cut fees in half, reducing campsite
fees to $6 a night and day-use tickets to $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a soul complaining'' fees were too high,
Petersen said. Webber said camping fees could rise next year to $10
as a new telephone reservation system is finally installed, but
some advocates contend fees should be brought up to New Hampshire's
usual $12 level or to the $11-$17 charged in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Along with many other states, New Hampshire and Vermont, which
often are credited with having more attractive state parks than
Massachusetts, operate their systems on a self-funding basis,
pushing managers to keep sites attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to camp in New Hampshire state parks, you could
eat off the bathroom floor 24 hours a day,'' said Robert Guertin of
Springfield, visiting the Mohawk Trail State Forest in Charlemont.
</P>
<P>
   _Lingering bad reputation: ``I think a lot of Massachusetts
residents have had the experience of going to state parks, finding
they're not up to snuff, and not coming back,'' said Mark Primack,
a longtime open-space advocate who runs the Wildlands Trust of
Southeastern Massachusetts. ``Once people stop going to state
parks, they stop being advocates for state parks.''
</P>
<P>
   One widely praised change Webber made last year was banning
alcohol in all state parks, where drunken rowdies all too often
terrorized camping families and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Webber acknowledged using ``soft enforcement. We're not evicting
people if they have alcohol automatically; we're not confiscating
alcohol if they bring it in.'' Beer cans and liquor bottles in many
of the parks' trash bins prove Webber's point.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews show the ban is extremely popular and campers
understand that it is not intended to keep well-behaved visitors
from enjoying a quiet drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good the way it's prohibited, but if it goes on, people
keep it under control,'' said Bob Parker, a retired Guilford,
Conn., printing technician visiting the D.A.R. State Forest in
Goshen with his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But while DEM gets credit for pulling the system back from the
depths of neglect and focusing on basic amenities like clean
bathrooms and curbing drunken misbehavior, many supporters contend
it has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much to build on,'' said Deb Cary, a Worcester
Audubon Society sanctuary manager. ``I don't want to be accused of
tearing it down, but it is badly undermaintained. We really need to
elevate the level of stewardship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The parks are probably Massachusetts's most underutilized
natural resource,'' said state Representative Christopher J.
Hodgkins, a Lee Democrat who has spent several summer vacations
camping in Berkshire parks. ``They're like these secret treasures.
We ought to let opportunity happen on them.''

CREATE A STORIED VACATION WITH BOOKS FOR KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're traveling this summer, be sure to pack some books for
the kids. One if by land, two if by sea.
</P>
<P>
   If you're stuck at home, cheer up. That leaves more time to work
through a whole stack of the best new children's books, from
rhythmic read-alouds to hard-edged novels for young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some contenders worthy of a ``golden hammock award.''
Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Picture books
</P>
<P>
   ``If You Give a Pig a Pancake,'' by Laura Numeroff, illustrated
by Felicia Bond (HarperCollins, $14.95). Ages 3 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   We already know what happens ``If You Give a Mouse a Cookie'' or
``If You Give a Moose a Muffin.'' One thing leads zanily to another
until the story comes full circle. In this sequel, if you give a
pig a pancake, she'll want some syrup. Then she'll get sticky and
want a bath. The rubber duck will make her homesick for the farm
... and on and on, until the only logical thing is to have another
pancake! Warm-spirited fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful Warrior: The Legend of the Nun's Kung Fu,'' by Emily
Arnold McCully (Levine/Scholastic, $16.95). Ages 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   In this original tale set in 17th-century China, young Mingyi
seeks help from a Buddhist nun with unusual prowess as a fighter
after a bandit demands her for a bride. Instead, the nun teaches
Mingyi to harness her own inner strength. Both elegant and warm,
this oversize book by Caldecott Medalist McCully has lively action
and expressive artwork that leaps off the page.
</P>
<P>
   (For slightly older readers, see ``Fa Mulan'' by Robert D. San
Souci, illustrated by Jean &AMP; Mou-Sien Tseng (Hyperion, $15.95).
Visually rich and sophisticated, it's based on the same legend that
inspired the Disney movie ``Mulan,'' about a Chinese woman who
becomes a great warrior.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A Home for Spooky,'' by Gloria Rand, illustrated by Ted Rand
(Holt, $15.95). Ages 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   A girl finds a starving, abandoned dog, Spooky, at the dump and,
against all odds, helps him recover and start a new life. The
Rands, who live on Mercer Island, have included notes and photos
(including a grim ``before'' photo) about the true events that
inspired this suspenseful, heartwarming tale. While Spooky finally
lands on his feet, there's a sobering message here about the
suffering faced by abandoned animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bad Case of Stripes,'' by David Shannon (Blue Sky Press,
$15.95). Ages 5 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon takes the old saw, ``be yourself,'' to comic extremes.
Here, Camilla Cream is so shackled to public opinion, she refuses
to eat lima beans because her friends hate them. Her conformity
backfires when she breaks out in Technicolor stripes, then proceeds
to morph into whatever she encounters. The art is striking and the
book is selling well. But it gets off to a lurching start that begs
the question, ``Why stripes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I Love You, Little One,'' by Nancy Tafuri (Scholastic,
$15.95). Ages 1 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   Next time your child asks, ``Do you love me?'' you can whip out
this book and reply with the poetry and firm assurance the question
demands. Here six baby animals and one child learn how they will be
loved ``forever and ever and always.'' The book is a lap full, with
wide pages filled with soft, full-frame pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!'' by Dr. Seuss, with some help
from Jack Prelutsky and Lane Smith (Knopf, $17). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss' rough, unfinished manuscript about a special teacher
and her lively school comes to life with help from two contemporary
icons. Prelutsky, a Seattle versemeister with great kid appeal,
captures the spirit of Dr. Seuss' rhyming tale. Smith's hip, visual
anarchy gives the mayhem a modern twist. Dr. Seuss fans will
especially enjoy the appendix, which explains the genesis of the
book and includes Dr. Seuss' rough draft and original sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tulip Sees America,'' by Cynthia Rylant and Lisa Desimi (Blue
Sky Press, $15.95). Ages 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   A young man who has never left home packs up his green
Volkswagen one day and journeys across the land, reveling in the
quiltlike farms of Iowa, the vast, dark skies of Nebraska, the
winds of Wyoming and the ocean of Oregon. The book, rooted in
Rylant's own 1993 cross-country trek, has a simple, poetic text and
good-natured, color-saturated artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jungle ABC,'' by Michael Roberts, forward by Iman
(Callaway Hyperion, $19.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   This riveting collection of cut-paper collages will appeal to
visually sophisticated kids and adults. The images are bold and
abstract, printed on thick, oversize pages. Part of the fun is
trying to figure out what word each picture suggests. Check the
back for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Snoops,'' by Miriam Moss, illustrated by Delphine Dorand
(Dutton, $14.99). Ages 6 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   With dry wit, this tale describes a neighborhood that plots
revenge on busybodies who tally their every misstep. The book
climaxes with a clever 3-D peek through the Snoops' own keyhole.
Original and droll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Knowledge of Grownups,'' by David Wisniewski
(Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard/Morrow, $16). Ages 7 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this cover, which resembles a top-secret file folder,
lies the truth about parents' rules. Why do grownups really say to
eat your vegetables? To keep the wild things under control, of
course. Why comb your hair? To stop it from going back into those
little holes in your head! Clever fun, with fairly lengthy text.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Circle of Days, From Canticle of the Sun,'' by Reeve
Lindbergh (Candlewick, $15.99). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   This hymn of praise, written by St. Francis of Assisi in 1225,
makes a lovely read-aloud for the end of day. ``Lord, we offer
thanks and praise for the circle of our days. For sister moon, and
for the stars, brilliant, precious, always ours.'' The book is
beautifully designed, with a panel of inset illustrations below
each double spread. The pictures have the bold but cheerful look of
folk art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little White Dog,'' by Laura Godwin, illustrated by Dan
Yaccarino (Hyperion, $14.95). Ages 2 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   This rhyming, cumulative story asks, ``Little white dog in the
snow, snow's so white, where did you go?'' In turn, a bluebird,
green bug, brown horse, yellow chick and black cat blend into their
backgrounds until the cat turns on a flashlight and sets each
animal searching for the next. Large type and stylized images lend
crisp simplicity to this fun read-aloud
</P>
<P>
   tale.

   CHAPTER BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing on the Edge,'' by Han Nolan (Harcourt Brace, $16, 244
pages). Ages 12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Pulled from the womb of a dead woman, Miracle McCloy is lucky to
be alive, as she's constantly reminded by her grandmother, a medium
with a knack for killing the spirit. After her father disappears,
Miracle descends into despair and nearly dies before a young
psychiatrist helps her build an identity based on hope. Depressing
as this sounds, it's a great read with some outrageously wacko
characters and flashes of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, a release from last fall, won the 1997 National Book
Award in the Young People's Literature category. Nolan's previous
book ``Send Me Down a Miracle'' was a finalist in 1996, the first
year a young-adult category was recognized. Nolan is the only
author in any category to have books nominated two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine Eyes Have Seen,'' by Ann Rinaldi (Scholastic, $16.95, 274
pages). Ages 12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1859, abolitionist John Brown spent three furtive months at
the Kennedy Farm preparing for his suicidal raid on the U.S.
Arsenal at Harper's Ferry. His 15-year-old daughter, Annie, was
assigned to ward off strangers and oversee the 18 raiders hidden at
the farm. Viewed through her troubled eyes, this historical novel
is a spellbinding and nuanced character study of a man who embodied
both idealism and harsh zealotry. When the raiders bid Annie
farewell and march off to certain death, the scene is unbearably
sad and nothing short of haunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Friends,'' by Kazumi Yumoto, translated by Cathy Hirano
(Yearling, $4.50 paper, 170 pages). Ages 10 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the 1997 Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, this widely
acclaimed coming-of-age novel tells of three Japanese boys who
begin spying on an old man to satisfy their curiosity about death.
Pressured by the demands of ``cram school'' and worried about their
futures, they are drawn instead into a life-affirming friendship
with the lonely castoff. Written in a breezy American style, this
book offers fascinating glimpses of contemporary Japanese life, as
well as an original, highly engaging story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddy Goes to Florida,'' by Walter R. Brooks, illustrated by
Kurt Wiese (Overlook Press, $23.95, 196 pages). Ages 8 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   First published in 1927 as ``To and Again,'' this book launched
the classic Freddy the Pig series about a daydreaming,
poetry-writing pig who is by turns a cowboy, explorer, pilot and
all-round Renaissance Pig. The series grew to 26 titles by 1958
before disappearing from print and has never been available in its
entirety. Now Overlook is reissuing two titles a year in their
original format. Volume One is a little dated in spots, but our
7-year-old field tester not only ate it up, but begged to hear the
book a second time. Also out this year is the 1932 volume, ``Freddy
the Detective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smack,'' by Melvin Burgess (Henry Holt, $16.95, 327 pages).
Ages 14 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned: This novel, winner of England's Carnegie Medal, is a
powerful and stark cautionary tale about two young runaways who
become mired in heroin addiction. It's a difficult book to read,
full of squalor and pathetically misguided characters. But the book
sticks with you and presents a far more compelling anti-drug
argument than ``Just Say No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Love of Venice,'' by Donna Jo Napoli (Delacorte,
$15.95, 245 pages). Ages 12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Light enough for summer reading but meatier than the typical
teen romance, this novel explores the political issues behind
Venice's picturesque facade. Seventeen-year-old Percy feels lost
the summer his family visits the ``jewel of Italy.'' Then he meets
Graziella, a beautiful ice cream vendor who introduces him to
activists struggling over the city's domination by tourism, foreign
investment, floods and the weight of its own past. Against this
intriguing backdrop, Napoli keeps it light.
</P>
<P>
   NON-FICTION
</P>
<P>
   AND SUMMER FUN
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kids Summer Games Book,'' by Jane Drake and Ann Love,
illustrated by Heather Collins (Kids Can Press, $10.95, 175 pages).
Ages 7 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   This beat-the-blahs manual explains the rules of traditional
lawn games such as croquet and Capture the Flag, indoor games from
marbles to double solitaire and beach games for sand and sea. The
Disappearing Coin Trick suffers from a flopped illustration that
confuses the text's left-right directions, but otherwise the
instructions are simple and clear. For more specialized outdoor
activities, see ``The Kids Campfire Book'' by the same authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``National Audubon Society First Field Guild to Insects,'' by
Christina Wilsdon (Scholastic, $10.95 softcover, 160 pages). Ages 6
to adult.
</P>
<P>
   Useful both as a home reference and a child's field guide, this
book has more than 450 color photos and illustrations of 175
insects. It includes a waterproof identification card of 50 of the
most common North American insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reader's Digest Children's Atlas of the World'' (Reader's
Digest Young Families, $22.99, 128 pages). Ages 7 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   This oversize book is a feast for the eyes, with more than 3,000
illustrations of places, people and wildlife plus more than 50
full-color maps. It includes sections on ecology, weather, space
and basic map reading, plus fun facts and suggested projects. Use
it now to prepare for summer travel and later as a school reference
book.

YOUR VEHICLE MAY HAVE A MIND OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think the impending Year 2000 crisis in computer systems
is too big to grasp, how about something a little closer to home .
. . like the computer system that now runs your vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   There is a dark side to ``on-board diagnostics,'' now in the
so-called ``II'' or second stage, going into OBDIII. It's not a bad
thing. Quite the opposite, it will call attention to the slightest
malfunction of your vehicle and even identify what needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   It could save a whole lot of money and even lives.
</P>
<P>
   And it could mean a whole lot more money to the big automakers,
especially if they continue to stonewall the independent and
after-market auto industry about sharing the new computer
information. ``Despite the strong language of the (Clean Air) Act,
the (federal and state) agencies are allowing vehicle manufacturers
to restrict the independent automotive parts and service industry's
access to all on-board diagnostics systems and OBD computers,''
reports a position paper by the Automotive Parts &AMP; Accessories
Association.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the big guys are sitting on the computer codes
that control the whole smear. No codes means no can do repair work.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, if your local independent mechanic is up to speed, he
can plug your vehicle into an expensive _ probably leased _
diagnostic testing machine and track your problem. And there's a
pro-rated charge for using the software put into the system by the
diagnostic machine folks, who, in turn, paid a bundle to get the
software from the automakers.
</P>
<P>
   But as we move to stage III, there appears to be a reluctance on
the part of automakers to share this information. That's
understandable, since greed is an integral part of marketing. You
want a larger share of the market, and what better way than to put
out a product that can only be serviced by your own dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The after-market, including your local independent mechanic,
says it's willing to pay a fair price for use of the diagnostic
software. That price no doubt will be passed along to us, but we
still have the option of dealing with an independent. So far, the
big automakers have been downright reluctant to share _ or sell, or
lease _ that software with the after-market. Does this all begin to
sound a little like an Eastside software firm wanting a larger
share of the market?
</P>
<P>
   I was first flagged on this by my trusty local mechanic, Kinnon
O. McKinnon, of K &AMP; M Automotive of Kirkland, Wash. I trust
McKinnon more than I trust my family doctor (but then, I take my
vehicles in more frequently and more regularly than I take this ol'
1940 body into the doc shop).
</P>
<P>
   Kinnon's initial warning had to do with the Big Brother aspect
of OBDII and III. And there is no doubt that the government, under
the Clean Air Act, might see and use the potential for monitoring
more than our tailpipe emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The government and industry are experimenting now with a system
that could monitor your vehicle emissions as you drive down the
road _ without your ever knowing it, according to Aaron Lowe, vice
president for governmental affairs for the Automotive Parts &AMP;
Accessories Association, a nationwide group of 1,400 companies and
auto parts dealers with retail service locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, which has the lead in this thing, wants to
eliminate its current (vehicle emission) testing system, and is
experimenting with linking the on-board computer with a
transponder, which could be monitored by roadside devices that take
the information off the car to see if there is an OBD `fault,'''
Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information would be relayed to a department of vehicles
and soon you'd get a notice that says your car needs such-and-such
repairs and that you have X number of days to make the repair and
prove that the work's been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the little dashboard light that warns, Get engine
serviced, is more than a gentle reminder. It has potential as a
tattletale, a snitch.
</P>
<P>
   When something causes your vehicle's warning light to flash, it
``throws a fault'' which registers in the computer. And almost
always, it's for a good reason. ``Any good technician should be
able to find and fix whatever's wrong; there's very little
guesswork,'' concedes McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some systems will throw a fault if your gas cap isn't
tightly screwed on _ they monitor pressure in the fuel system _ or
if you've changed to a larger size tire or a performance muffler,''
McKinnon says. ``It used to be that you could `burn' a new code
into the computer to allow for variance in those situations, but
not any longer. And in the end, they have limited adaptability from
the after-market.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Bohanan, of the Specialty Equipment Market Association,
also warned that without automakers sharing software information,
it would be almost impossible to manufacture after-market parts and
equipment compatible with any vehicle's on-board tolerances. ``So,
if you drive to Home Depot and pick up a load of bricks, you're
going to swerve a bit as you drive home. And that is going to
register on board and throw a fault. And the fault code will stay
in the computer until it's checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   And where must you go to have it checked out? Why, the major
automaker dealership, of course.
</P>
<P>
   We'll hope to get their side of this on-board diagnostics thing
a bit down the road.

</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Starting when she was just three weeks old in 1963, Maynard,
Mass. native Diane Lockhart's parents would pile her in the station
wagon with her five older brothers and sisters to head out Route 2
and spend ``all summer, every summer,'' at Otter River State Forest
in Baldwinville.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks on end, they would live in a surplus Army tent or a
pop-up camper, splashing in the pond and finding secret places in
the woods. ``That was all my family could afford to do, but we
loved it up there. It was so beautiful,'' Lockhart recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she and her husband have a vacation home in Maine. But a
June weekend found them back at Otter River with their teenage
children trying to relive ``those wonderful family times,'' singing
songs, playing cards, and cooking pancakes on the campfire.
</P>
<P>
   Not many residents know it, but Massachusetts has the 10 biggest
state parks systems in the nation. Besides preserving some
remarkable physical wonders, many of the sites inspire loyalty from
families unable to afford a vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   But while the run-up to the park system's 100th birthday this
summer has brought substantial improvements, a broad range of park
visitors, advocates, and state officials agree it has barely
reached adolescence in living up to its potential.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular properties _ Walden Pond, Nickerson State Park
in Brewster on Cape Cod, and beaches in Salisbury and Westport _
attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. At parks like
Otter River, campsite reservations are snapped up months in advance
by families that feel a sense of ownership of their spot.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates fear that Massachusetts forests, parks, and
reservations _ which attract 18 million visitors a year _ are being
``loved to death,'' their trails rutted by mountain bikes and camp
sites denuded and worn to hardpan.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Department of Environmental Management system, many
state officials, park visitors, and environmental advocates see a
potentially first-class resource that sometimes falls far short of
what it could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general competence, an acceptability of the state
forests, but what is so often lacking is a realization of a
creative vision,'' said Theodore Ames, a Berkshire County
environmentalist who heads DEM's oversight board. ``A lot of the
parks just seem tired.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Robert A. Durand, a Marlborough Democrat and an
avid outdoorsman who heads the legislative committee that oversees
the parks, agrees: ``There's no question that our state park system
has paled in the past in comparison with our neighbors to the
north. With a little more effort, we could really have first-class
parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the $75 million DEM has invested in rebuilding the
parks system since 1991 can clearly be seen after a 20-year period
of neglect. During that time, park money was diverted first into
pools and skating rinks, then into Heritage Parks by Governor
Michael S. Dukakis in such urban settings as Lowell, Fall River,
and North Adams, with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to major work on trails and visitor centers at
prized properties like Salisbury Beach, Walden Pond, and Purgatory
Chasm in Sutton, dozens of parks have received attractive
pine-ceiling restrooms to replace pungent pit toilets. General
sprucing-up was obvious at more than 40 sites the Globe visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our wish _ they've got the nicest flushies over
there,'' said Frank Dowen, a Concord hairdresser who has been
bringing his family and grandchildren to Otter River for decades.
``It's a big improvement over six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair-accessible trails, beaches, and fishing facilities
are being added at a steady rate. Agency officials have also begun
installing about 16 cozy permanent tents called ``yurts,'' each
with beds, tables, and small decks. They will rent for $25 a night
at Nickerson State Park and several Berkshires parks, offering
winter camping for skiiers and hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Staff and funding increases made since the meat-cleaver cutbacks
of 1989-'91 have resulted in the reopening of dozens of parks and
beaches, including the pond at Harold Parker State Forest in North
Andover. Virtually all campgrounds again have a 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week official presence.
</P>
<P>
   But DEM has at least a $100 million backlog of maintenance work.
And parks advocates see all sorts of unmet opportunities to
constructively exploit some beautiful properties.
</P>
<P>
   Demand would clearly justify adding thousands of campsites to
the 3,500 already scattered around the state, widening dozens of
fresh-water beaches for peak weekends, and beefing up
interpretation of historic sites and natural wonders.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, camping could be moved to more inviting spots: At
the state's biggest park, 16,200-acre October Mountain State Forest
in Lee, the 50-site campground sits not on one of the many
Berkshire overlooks but next to a humming electric transformer yard
and a former dump.
</P>
<P>
   Some natural resources seem clumsily handled, like Natural
Bridge State Forest in North Adams, where rusting chain-link-
fenced walkways sprawl over a marble chasm waterfall. Or Bash Bish
Falls in Mount Washington, where no-swimming warnings have been
sloppily spray-painted on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The entire system has only a dozen cabins for rent at two parks.
``They should build a whole lot more of these _ they're
wonderful,'' said Monroe Bethea, a state Department of Mental
Retardation worker visiting a new log cabin at Savoy Mountain State
Forest last month with clients for a fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises by former Governor William F. Weld and Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci to make state government ``think
entrepreneurially,'' DEM officials are moving only haltingly toward
bringing in new partners and promoting many of its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   DEM has done nothing to take advantage of a ``Second Century''
fund legislators approved two years ago reserving park-revenue
increases for DEM use, and barely tapped an eight-year-old
conservation trust made up of private donations.

`LETHAL' DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LETHAL WEAPON 4 
Directed by: Richard Donner 
Screenplay by: Channing Gibson 
Starring: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Renee Russo, Chris
Rock, Jet Li 
Running time: 123 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jokey carnage has no more dependable brand name than the
``Lethal Weapon'' franchise. One of the few things that makes
``Lethal Weapon 4'' watchable is the ease and familiarity with
which Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, and Joe Pesci work
together. But that's also one of the things that makes it close to
unwatchable. The energetic extinguishings of human life are
insufferably glossed over with a series of genuflections to family
life on the most sentimentally manipulative level. Given the
insertion of kids and newborn babies into what passes for the plot
of this latest installment, the film turns into a game of gain a
life, lose a life, played for yuks.
</P>
<P>
   The plot barely bothers to go through the motions, stitching
together its set pieces aimed at the gonads and adrenals as LA cops
Gibson and Glover chase down a vicious Chinese triad. It's headed
by the film's only source of anything suggesting the presence of
fresh energy _ the deadly young ganglord played by Hong Kong
martial arts whiz Jet Li, making a dynamic US debut in an
uncharacteristic bad-guy role. After a fireball-filled prologue
that plays as if spliced in from a previous episode, Gibson and
Glover are nearly sent to the bottom of LA harbor by a Chinese
freighter while fishing with Pesci's snoop, incorporated into the
extended family. Also working her way into the group portrait is
Russo as the girlfriend whose pregnancy has Gibson's antsy cop,
Riggs, sweating over the M word.
</P>
<P>
   One of Glover's daughters is pregnant, too, which makes the bad
guys seem that much more killable when they go after the cops'
families in retaliation for the lawmen blowing the whistle on their
racket of smuggling illegal Chinese refugees into the States. The
lines are clearly drawn between the good guys and the bad. The
chases and shootouts unreel across rooftops, alleys, freeways, and
the inevitable waterfront warehouse. Speaking of inevitable, Glover
and especially Gibson are unable to avoid seeming a bit puffy with
the cops' physical exertions, so their advancing ages are written
into the script, especially when Jet Li's insolently unruffled
whirlwind almost Cuisinarts them both in combat.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the wisecrack-flavored pandemonium, which revels
in its political incorrectness as it dances on the borders of
racism and homophobia in its humor, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' has the
spiritual energy of a dead battery. It's a bunch of high-paid
favorites going to the well yet again, trying to recycle the same
old stuff and disarm us with unearned we-are-family pieties as it
amps up the explosions. In short, it's a high-budget snuff film
posing as a two-hour-long Kodak moment. Cynical, meretricious,
unable to disguise the fact that it's getting awfully tired,
``Lethal Weapon 4'' is the best possible argument against ``Lethal
Weapon 5.''

A CHARMING TRANSLATION FOR `MADELINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MADELINE 
Directed by: Daisy von Scherler Mayer 
Screenplay by: Mark Levin, Jennifer Flackett 
Starring: Frances McDormand, Nigel Hawthorne, Hatty Jones, Ben
Daniels, Kristian De La Osa, Arturo Venegas, Stephane Audran 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: PG (momentary language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of thought and care have gone into turning Ludwig
Bemelmans's beloved ``Madeline'' into a movie, and the result is a
quite charming translation from page to screen. Part of the appeal
of the Bemelmans books is the way their childlike drawings tap into
a sunny Paris of the mind, a Paris as everyone would like it to be.
Its proverbial 12 little girls in two straight lines bespeak a
world of privilege and gentility but _ as Bemelmans was aware in
1939, when he wrote the first Madeline book, and as we are reminded
whenever spunky little Madeline leads the others into trouble _ a
world barely able to sustain the illusion of serene order.
</P>
<P>
   The art direction and production design exquisitely capture the
book's old house in Paris, covered with vines, while gently moving
the story (an amalgam of four Madeline books) into the 1950s, out
from under the shadow of war and the grimness of postwar austerity.
Frances McDormand is a spot-on embodiment of Miss Clavel, the
clerical mother figure and beacon of safety. And Nigel Hawthorn
inscribes with a subtlety more than immediately apparent the role
of the English aristocrat, Lord Covington, who owns the boarding
school property and wants to sell it out from under Miss Clavel and
the girls.
</P>
<P>
   This brings home to the other girls the sense of life's
precariousness of which Madeline is already keenly aware, having
been orphaned. The film's one stretch involves giving Madeline a
British accent, presumably on the theory that one European country
is pretty much the same as another, and that an English-accented
Madeline poses less commercial risk than a French-accented one. The
important thing is that Hattie Jones captures Madeline's
fearlessness, whether giving Miss Clavel fits by balancing on a
bridge's stone railing or getting embroiled with kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The tonalities are seen to with sunny devotion to the original
on the part of director Daisy von Scherler Mayer. With Jones
leading the way, turning in the kind of confident performance that
only a 9-year-old actor (or an 89-year-old one) can, the screen is
filled with sweetly irrepressible energies that should satisfy all
but the most demanding Madeline fans (plus their parents), and more
than a few of the last category, too. If you've been wondering what
you can take your little girl to, in this summer of clunky comets
and clunkier lizards, look no further.

SENATE CANDIDATE IN MISSOURI GETS A WAKE-UP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Jeremiah ``Jay'' Nixon has spent the day looking for
money and votes in rural Missouri towns, an Irish pub in this city,
and a suburban union hall. He's everywhere, it seems, but the most
likely destination for a Democratic candidate for the US Senate:
St. Louis's predominantly black north side.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, Missouri's attorney general and a top Senate prospect for
the Democrats nationally, has so angered black leaders with his
proposal to end state aid for school desegregation that many are
actively working to defeat him. So it's prudent for him to keep his
distance when he can.
</P>
<P>
   The local NAACP has picketed Nixon's public events. Black civic
leaders are raising money for Republican incumbent Senator
Christopher ``Kit'' Bond. And the state's senior black politician,
US Representative William L. Clay Sr., has been trying to drum up
opposition to Nixon. Nixon and Bond are white.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is expected to win his August primary and then challenge
Bond in a November contest that has become a lightning rod for
exploding black angst within the Democratic Party. Many black
voters say they are frustrated by being taken for granted and upset
that their issues _ from affirmative action to desegregation _ are
being ignored and sometimes even opposed by Democrats, who
typically get 80 to 90 percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not unlike the Christian right's disagreement within
the Republican Party: We are saying we are one of the backbones of
your political strength, and you are dealing with us in an
unacceptable way,'' said Dr. Donald Suggs, a St. Louis oral
surgeon, newspaper publisher, and member of a group of black
leaders opposing Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict black frustration with the Democratic
Party here and elsewhere could lower voter turnout in the fall
congressional elections and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, for example, Baltimore's black mayor, Kurt L.
Schmoke, stunned Democratic officials by backing Harford County
Executive Eileen M. Rehrmann in the upcoming primary instead of
Democratic Governor Parris N. Glendening. Schmoke, who helped
deliver predominantly black Baltimore in 1994 to Glendening, says
the governor reneged on a promise to raise funds for public
education.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, black officials, including US Representative Alcee
L. Hastings, worked to defeat the Democratic candidate for speaker
of the House after a black man in line for the nomination was
ousted in favor of a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   But it's here that the complicated relationship between black
voters and white Democratic politicians seems most strained. The
rancor forced President Clinton to delay a visit to a Nixon
fund-raiser last fall until threats by blacks to picket it were
withdrawn. Eight days after the fund-raiser, Nixon asked the US
Supreme Court to end state funding for desegreation programs,
leaving blacks stunned and dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the folks in Boston know, when you mix race and politics
and money and schools and courts together, that is not a sanguine
situation,'' Nixon explained.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general, Nixon has sought to end the court-ordered
busing of 13,000 black children from St. Louis city schools to
predominantly white suburban school districts. He has proposed
instead that the state pay $300 million to renovate schools and
build new ones to settle the city's 26-year-old desegregation case.
</P>
<P>
   Many black families believe Nixon's plan would rob their
children of access to high-quality education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we can push a lot of people toward Mr. Bond,
but we've done a fairly good job of pointing out that Nixon is
undeserving of Democratic support, and that I think will cut into
his margin in November,'' Suggs said. ``The Democratic Party has to
be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a moderate Republican who is seeking a third term in the
Senate, is in some ways an unlikely choice for black voters. He has
never received more than token support from blacks in any campaign;
the national NAACP recently gave him a failing grade for his civil
rights record; and he, like Nixon, opposes funding for
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   But many blacks here give Bond credit for appointing
African-Americans to high-profile jobs and judgeships during his
two terms as governor. They also say he has worked to restore
spending for federal housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked very hard to build a Republican base in the
African-American community from the time I was governor,'' Bond
said in an interview last week. ``It would change the entire
dynamics if we get a decent vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Mischeaux, president of the St. Louis NAACP, accuses
Nixon of dealing dishonestly with the black leaders and using
desegregation to woo voters in rural Missouri, where Democratic
candidates don't fare as well as Republicans and where residents
oppose the state spending of $1 billion so far on integrating
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you choose this issue?'' asked Nixon, who recently
won an end to Kansas City's court-ordered busing with state
payments of $320 million over three years to the city schools. ``No
other politician in the state ... spoke as forthrightly and as
directly as I have, and there aren't that many rewards for speaking
your mind in politics, and this is one example of that.''

FOR VERMONT, A NEW RECOGNITION OF ITS GETTYSBURG ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nearly inconsolable'' after the failure of Union campaigns in
the spring of 1862, President Abraham Lincoln called for 300,000
more men to serve nine months in the Union army. Nearly 5,000
Vermonters answered the call.
</P>
<P>
   Green soldiers from Vermont's Green Hills, they would play a
pivotal role in the most storied battle of the war: the epic July
1-3, 1863, conflict at Gettysburg. After the battle, a New York
Times account concluded that a Vermont brigade ``did more than any
other body of men to gain the triumph which decided the fate of the
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow over time, the Vermonters' story got lost. Books,
films, even tour guides at the Gettysburg battlefield scarcely
mentioned their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now research by historian Howard Coffin of Montpelier is
re-awakening appreciation for the accomplishments of Vermont
soldiers led by Brigadier General G.J. Stannard. Coffin's
interpretation gets official sanction this weekend, when history
buffs, descendants of Civil War veterans, battlefield enthusiasts,
and others converge on Gettysburg to reenact the momentous battle
and Vermont's role in it.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 reenactments have been held since the 1920s at
Gettysburg. But this one, on the 135th anniversary of the battle,
is the largest ever, with 20,000 reenactors and more than 35,000
spectators expected daily. The 1863 battle involved 160,000 men
from both sides, with more than 50,000 dead and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time that Stannard's part in the battle has
been recreated,'' said Steve Wakefield, one of the leaders of the
reenactment. He was referring to a wheeling maneuver by Stannard's
men that helped break the Confederate onslaught up Cemetery Ridge
known as Pickett's Charge.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever doubted that soldiers from Vermont fought at
Gettysburg. But exactly what they did, and how important it was, is
not well-known, Wakefield and others said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Maine regiment _ led by Colonel Joshua Chamberlain _ is
the New England unit perhaps most associated with the battle of
Gettysburg. But that hardy unit held the far left of the Union line
at a place called Little Round Top on the battle's second day _
rather than on the third day, when the Vermont brigade played its
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on battlefield tours at Gettysburg and never heard
the word `Vermont,''' said Brad Limoge, another reenactor and
amateur Civil War historian from Morrisville, Vt. ``Until Coffin's
book came out, I don't think anyone understood how Pickett's Charge
actually worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainers may still say their ancestors saved the Union Army. But
historians including James M. McPherson and D. Scott Hartwig have
praised Coffin's ``Nine Months to Gettysburg.'' He draws on old
diagrams of military maneuvers, eyewitness accounts in letters the
soldiers wrote home, and other reports to show conclusively, he
claims, that Vermonters played a decisive role.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 men who joined the Vermont Brigade in 1862 were a
well-educated bunch, many with political ambitions, most in their
early 20s, Coffin says.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran soldiers, who typically enlisted for two or three years,
derided the Vermonters as opportunists, ``nine-month boys'' trying
to get through their service as safely as possible. But other
Yankees supported them enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the unit in October, just after it had formed,
private Ralph Sturtevant wrote: ``Our camp was thronged with
visitors from all parts of (Vermont) of high and low degree,
beautiful women and red-cheeked girls and their anxious faces ...
there to make farewell visit and say good-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing never was large enough or long enough for the Green
Mountain boys. Supplies were inadequate. ``The tents are so short
that those who sleep in them get wet either at one end or the
other,'' Lieutenant Colonel Roswell Farnham wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   When the men reached Gettysburg near the end of their term, they
had hardly fought at all, but disease and the privations of camp
life _ rain and chill or heat exhaustion, crowded conditions,
inconsistent food _ had taken a fierce toll, reducing their ranks
to about 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies collided just north of Gettysburg on July 1.
Union troops fled through the town but managed to hold onto the
high ground along Cemetery Ridge as darkness fell. Fighting resumed
and intensified on July 2 as the Vermonters helped plug a hole in
the Union line, recaptured four cannons, and took about 80
Confederate prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive moment, Coffin claims, came on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   On that day the Union line resembled a giant fish hook,
stretching three miles from Culp's Hill, along to Cemetery Ridge
south to the Round Tops; Confederate soldiers were massed to the
east along Seminary Ridge. Previously, Confederate General Robert
E. Lee had attacked both ends of the Union line; on July 3, he
decided to attack the middle.
</P>
<P>
   His main target was the portion of the Union line near a clump
of trees on Cemetery Ridge. Just to one side, crouching in a
ravine, the Vermonters in three regiments formed the most advanced
part of the line.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., after an earth-shaking, two-hour artillery duel,
an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Confederates started across the mile
of farmland toward the Union line.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Frank Haskell, from Tunbridge, Vt., described the
scene as the enemy advanced: ``Every eye could see his legions, an
overwhelmingly resistless tide of an ocean of armed men sweeping
upon us! Regiment after regiment ... the red flags wave, their
horsemen gallop up and down; the arms of (15,000) men gleam in the
sun, a sloping forest of flashing steel.''
</P>
<P>
   As the massed Confederates neared the portion of the Union line
where soliders in blue crouched behind a stone wall near the copse
of trees, the Vermonters rose up to fire. The Confederates veered
to one side, exposing their right flank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stannard saw the military opportunity of the century,'' Coffin
said in an interview. ``If he could move the men around 90 degrees,
he could fire into the side of the Confederate forces as they moved
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a great door, the Vermonters swung out wide and began
firing,'' Coffin continued. ``Every time they fired, they moved
closer, getting off 8,000 to 10,000 bullets in about 20 minutes.
One soldier said the sound was like `a vast mournful roar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant George Benedict, in his report of the conflict,
recalled: ``Shells whizzed and popped and fluttered on every side;
spherical case shot exploded overhead, and rained showers of iron
bullets; solid shot tore the ground into furrows.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fighting was over, the high water mark of the
Confederacy had been reached, and the battle of Gettysburg had been
won for the Union. The Vermonters had lost 270 men killed, wounded,
and missing, Coffin writes.
</P>
<P>
   Sturtevant, surveying the area where General George Pickett's
charge had been broken, observed: ``If there was any spot on that
great field of battle that approximated more nearly than any other
the maelstrom of destruction, this was the place. They lay one upon
the other clutched in death, side by side. ... Some had on (Union)
blue, but nearly all wore the (Confederate) gray, and for on a few
square rods one could hardly step so thickly lay the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy July 4, the Vermonters helped with the formidable
task of burial. Corporal Mark Day, from Essex, Vt., remembered:
``In the pouring rain, band after band of regimental musicians
gathered, the dead of both armies on every hand (as bands played)
the national airs and hymns, until a great volume of music and
thanksgiving rose from the field.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Civil war buffs who gather at Gettysburg this weekend will try
to recreate what the battle was like _ while substituting blanks
for ammunition. They will sleep in blankets on the ground, wadding
up jackets for pillows; eat from tin plates; fire antique weapons,
or reproductions of them; wear heavy wool uniforms made to Army
specifications of the 1860s _ including the long underwear that
kept the scratchy wool off their skins.
</P>
<P>
   But no reenactment can do the battle justice, Coffin says. ``One
man wrote about seeing a soldier shot near the clump of trees. His
lower jaw was torn away, his tongue was flapping in the breeze, he
was struggling just to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were hundreds of stories like that,'' Coffin went on.
``It was carnage, and we'll never really understand it.''

 HATTIESBURG, Miss.: ... in 1970.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In exchange for his testimony against his fellow Klansmen, Pitts
was given a brief federal sentence and was allowed to disappear
without serving a day on his life term on state charges. But as the
Dahmer case intensified recently, Pitts was found in Louisiana and
is now being held in the Forrest County jail here. He is expected
to again testify against the Klansmen, and law enforcement sources
say Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordyce has privately agreed to
Pitts' release if he cooperates with the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, deBoxtel, whom Stringer heard suggest a ``Code
Four,'' died after a mistrial was declared in his case. Bowers
survived two mistrials in the Dahmer case, but spent six years in
prison following his conviction on federal charges growing out of
the Neshoba County murders. He has long been considered the kingpin
of the Klan and is believed to have directed much of the violent
opposition to integration that once terrorized the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been a free man for more than 20 years, Bowers
was never forgotten by Dahmer's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted out of this was justice,'' said Vernon Dahmer
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dahmer case gained renewed interest following the 1994
conviction in Mississippi of Byron de la Beckwith for the murder of
Evers, the state's leading NAACP official, 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, the Dahmers pressed the county district attorney's
office and the state for action, and the Legislature responded by
appropriating funds for a new investigation. During the 1995
election, the Dahmers asked each district attorney candidate for a
commitment to pursue the case. They wound up supporting a Democrat
who promised a vigorous reexamination. Carter, a Republican, was
elected. But he, too, had pledged, ``If it can be done, it will be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the newly-elected district attorney, talks between
Stringer and Vernon Dahmer Jr. were already under way.
</P>
<P>
   In their telephone chats, Stringer was unwilling to give his
name, but a relationship of trust was growing. ``We talked about
his affiliation with the Klan, what he knew, and how he felt about
trying to help us,'' Dahmer said. ``These conversations continued
for two years, but we never met face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in late 1996, an intermediary for Stringer contacted Dahmer
and said Stringer was willing to meet privately if his safety could
be ensured.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 1997, six men gathered in a motel room in Diamondhead,
a Gulf Coast resort: Stringer and a friend known only as ``Frank,''
Vernon Dahmer Jr. and his brother, Dennis Dahmer, Jerry Himelstein,
the director of the New Orleans office of the Anti-Defamation
League, and Jerry Mitchell, a reporter for The Clarion-Ledger
newspaper in Jackson, Miss., whose stories had helped revive the
case against Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer, a towering man with graying hair and a moustache, was
identified only as ``Bob.'' He spent most of the day talking about
his experiences as an ``errand boy'' for Sam Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation as a racial terrorist, Bowers was an
erudite man, the grandson of a congressman. Bowers' favorite book
was George Orwell's anticommunist allegory, ``Animal Farm.'' He ran
his affairs from Sambo Amusement Co., a business which distributed
juke boxes and pinball machines throughout tough, gritty Jones
County.
</P>
<P>
   When Stringer was 14, living with his grandparents and holding
down two jobs, he met Bowers. ``Sam took me in like a son,'' he
said. He handled small tasks, helped install amusement machines,
and when it was discovered Stringer could type, he was enlisted to
put Klan messages on paper. One of the ``Klan Ledgers'' carried the
lines:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now listen, you COMMUNIST and NIGGERS and JEWS.
</P>
<P>
   Tell all your buddies to spread the news.
</P>
<P>
   Your day of judgment will soon be nigh,
</P>
<P>
   As the Lord in his wisdom looks down from on high.
</P>
<P>
   Will this battle be lost? NEVER! I say,
</P>
<P>
   For the KU KLUX KLAN is here to stay!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Young Stringer distributed the leaflets around Jones County. He
also ferried packages. ``I didn't know what I was hauling. It could
have been dynamite or guns,'' he said. He attended Klan rallies,
where Bowers always appeared in a seersucker suit. As Bowers'
acolyte, Stringer was able to move with confidence among the
Klansmen at John's Cafe, where he heard the discussion of the
strike against Vernon Dahmer Sr.
</P>
<P>
   While he discussed his past at the Diamondhead meeting, Stringer
told the group about his fears for his future. After losing his job
and $30,000 gambling at Mississippi's new casinos, he was trying to
come back from the bottom. He and his son had taken lawn mowers and
rakes and begun knocking on doors to build up a business. He had
controlled his gambling addiction through group therapy. But
Stringer felt he might jeopardize his family if he agreed to become
a witness against the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Himelstein assured Stringer that the ADL could help him
relocate, to start over with a new job in a new state.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer agreed to come to a second meeting, a month later,
which included an investigator from the district attorney's office,
Ray Howell.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that meeting,'' Dahmer said, ``Bob said he was willing to
cooperate by wearing a wire and talking with the Klansmen.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Stringer met with Carter, the district
attorney, and Howell at a cafe in the south Mississippi town of
Wiggins, where Stringer offered the authorities more information.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the attempt to ensnare Bowers veered into a Keystone
Kops routine. The county investigator gave Stringer a bulky tape
recorder to wear. If someone asked about the protrusion in his
clothes, Stringer said, he was supposed to explain that it was the
aftermath of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   During one conversation with a member of the Klan's women's
auxiliary, who was unwittingly implicating the Klansmen, the tape
recorder clicked off loudly. Stringer was relieved when the state
attorney general's office joined the investigation and wired him
with more sophisticated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He had lengthy talks with Roy Wilson, Bowers' friend who ran a
truck stop in Laurel. According to Stringer, Wilson told him that
Bowers had given him his memoirs, titled ``Rifle in the Bush,'' to
hold for safekeeping. ``I was told it was all about Medgar Evers'
killing, Martin Luther King's killing,'' Stringer said, and it was
not to be revealed until after Bowers' death.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer secretly taped two conversations with Bowers _ one at
the truck stop, another as they rode around Jones County in
Stringer's pickup. Stringer said he asked Bowers why he had never
given him a more important role in the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam said: `Because you were too young. You were needed to type
up the propaganda while I was busy fighting the revolution. You
were important because your propaganda caused more revolution for
me to fight.'''
</P>
<P>
   After their second meeting last summer, Bowers grew suspicious
and broke off further contact. Stringer said he is convinced Bowers
knows he has become an informant; as a result, Stringer said he was
willing to be identified in this news story.
</P>
<P>
   In their last meeting, Stringer said, Bowers gave him a final
accolade. ``He called me `a great patriot and a good disciple.'''

BOND FUNDS REQUIRE SCRUTINY BEFORE JUMPING IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 35 years old, and I have $55,000 in stock mutual funds
with Vanguard, Janus, and Legg Mason (of which $17,000 is an IRA
account), $10,000 in U.S. Savings Bonds, $6,000 in an annuity, and
$10,000 in cash. I also have a $32,000 IRA invested in a CD which
matures soon. I'd like to invest the CD money somewhere with good
returns but relatively low market risk. A friend suggested a bond
fund. What do you think of this advice? Any ideas about a good bond
fund?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A.F., Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there are a lot of good bond funds out there, but I
won't tell you any names until I deliver a little lecture about
time and risk. At age 35, you will probably have this money working
for you for between 20 and 30 years. That's a long time. It's
certainly true that if you put your money in a good bond fund for
about 25 years, you will see a few bumpy seasons, but the general
trend will be relatively smooth. In my computer I have a program
tracking our investments, and an 18-month chart showing net asset
value (but not total returns) for one of our funds, Vanguard GNMA,
is nearly as flat as a table. The same is true if you look at the
longer records in the Morningstar Mutual Funds pages -- the net
asset value was $10.05 at the end of 1986; it's $10.44 as this is
written. Its 10-year record shows 9.26 percent average annual total
returns. If such a pace were sustained for 25 years, that would
turn your $32,000 into $294,890.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that when you're talking about two or three
decades, the odds are almost overwhelming that stock funds will
outpace bond funds. If you were to select a stock fund instead, and
if you achieved just one percentage point better returns than we
cited for the GNMA fund, the difference in returns over 25 years
would be $75,409. I suspect you're about as spooked with the
current market as I am, so I suggest a cowardly approach. Begin my
moving $31,000 of your IRA to Vanguard Prime Money Market fund,
putting the final $1,000 in Vanguard Index Value fund. Then
instruct Vanguard to move $925 from the money market to Index Value
every month. This will spread your investment period out over about
36 months (presuming average 5 percent returns from the money
fund). This is an investment discipline called dollar cost
averaging. If the market takes a substantial dip during the
investment period, you will be buying subsequent shares at lower
prices, reducing your average cost per share.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, suppose you're still hell-bent for bonds. My suggestion
then is this: build a portfolio of three bond funds, running most
of the risk spectrum. You might, for example, put a third each into
Vanguard Short-Term Bond, Vanguard GNMA, and Vanguard High- Yield
Corporate Bond funds. From this, you might expect a portfolio
average yield of about 7.1 percent, nbased on current levels. But I
still think you'd be better off adding that IRA account to your
list of stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're talking about Vanguard, here's an incidental note
for H.S. of East Falmouth: You can reach Vanguard by calling
800-662-6273.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Shortly I expect to receive $400,000 from the sale of my
home. From this amount, I must be able to pay for my rental
obligation. I'll need returns of 6 percent to 7 percent --
preferably 7 percent. My other living expenses are covered by
Social Security and CDs. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you might consider the bond portfolio I suggested for
A.F. in the question above, which would generate a 7.1 percent
yield at current rates.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with that is that the most aggressive leg of
that portfolio -- the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund -- is
a member of the fund class that's usually called ``junk bonds.''
You'll have to decide whether you are comfortable with the risks
these bring. Junk bond funds typically invest in portfolios of
bonds graded BBB, BB, B and lower. Because of their relatively low
credit quality, these funds can experience two kinds of volatility
-- the interest-rate volatility that affects all bond funds, and
credit volatility. The latter situation makes these funds subject
to market pressure when the economy weakens and investors worry
that some of these lower-rated companies might not be able to meet
their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, though, is that Vanguard's junk bond fund is a
very conservative entrant relative to its peers. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds' last report, it held 5 percent of assets
in AAA-rated issues, 38 percent in BB-rated bonds, and the
remaining 57 percent in B-rated holdings. The average effective
maturity of the portfolio is 8.2 years, and the current yield is
8.4 percent. Morningstar reports a 10.25 percent average annual
total return over the last 10 years, and accords the fund a top,
five-star rating. (For the record, I own shares in this fund.) If
this makes you uncomfortable, you might decide to divide the
portfolio evenly between Vanguard Short-Term Bond and Vanguard
GNMA, a move which would bring the current portfolio yield to 6.5
percent, but which should give you a lower level of volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because bond markets can be quite volatile, it's always
nice to withdraw a little less than the total yield if you can
afford it. For example, if you were to invest in the portfolio that
includes the junk bond fund, but to take distributions that
represent only 6.5 percent of your initial investment, the effect
would be that you would be reinvesting a little money each month --
probably enough to insulate your principal from market shocks over
the long haul, and eventually even to allow a little growth in
principal. If you were to follow such a course, withdrawing
$2,166.66 a month, and if rates held steady, you might expect that
over the course of a decade (which would of course see market bumps
of various proportions) your principal might have grown to
$421,659.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been out of college for about three years, and after
much soul-searching I've decided to enter the Peace Corps. After
paying all my debts, I have $7,500 in savings. My commitment will
be for 27 months service in a foreign country. Where would the best
place be to invest my savings over that period, providing little
risk and the ability to take out the money once I return?
</P>
<P>
   G.M., Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you are indeed looking for little risk, the menu of
options is pretty limited and boring. You might, for example, shop
around for the best two-year CD rate and then instruct the bank
that the funds should be automatically moved into a 90-day CD at
the prevailing rate when it matures. Thus your money would be
available to you precisely after 27 months, and you would know at
the outset what your earnings will be for the lion's share of the
time. Suppose you get 5.5 percent on the initial CD and that the
rate falls to 5 percent after the first 24 months; the result would
be that you'd have $8,570 upon your return.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be a fund money market fund from a mutual
fund company. Such funds provide an only minuscule level of risk
(but, unlike CDs, they are not insured by the government) and the
interest rate varies daily. As a general rule, if interest rates
tend to rise during those 27 months, you would be best off with a
money market fund; if rates tend to fall during the period, you'd
be best off if you locked in your interest rate through a CD.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be more venturesome, you might look at
conservative bond funds. For example, just looking at offerings
within the Fidelity family, the 30-day yield on June 30 for
Fidelity Cash Reserves -- its largest money market fund -- was 5.25
percent. If you went with Fidelity Short-Term Bond, the yield would
step up to only 5.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Imagining that such returns were constant over 27 months, that
would translate to a difference of only $52 in total returns for
the period -- not, in my opinion, enough to warrant changing from
the ultra-low risk money fund to the riskier short-term fund. In
fact, the only bond funds that seem to me to offer a significant
difference in total returns, given the relatively short period of
time involved, would be the junk bond funds. But these cannot truly
be considered offerings with ``little risk,'' so they probably
don't fit the bill.

STUDY CRITICIZES CHIROPRACTIC TREATMENT OF BACK PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new study could revive an old debate over
whether chiropractic treatment for lower back pain does any good.
</P>
<P>
   In the study by the Rand Corp., 29 percent of initial
chiropractic treatments for lower back pain were found to be
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, 46 percent of the treatments were ruled
appropriate, says study author Dr. Paul G. Shekelle of the West Los
Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Twenty-five percent were
rated as being of uncertain value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, a 29 percent inappropriateness rate is too high and
should be decreased,'' Shekelle said. The total number of
inappropriate treatments is probably higher, he said, because the
study examined only initial visits to a chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the 46 percent appropriateness rate
means that ``everybody needs to stop treating chiropractors as if
they are quacks,'' he said, adding that under certain
circumstances, he would refer a patient, even himself, to a
chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   Shekelle's study appears in the June 30 issue of a prestigious
medical journal, Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Chiropractors manipulate the human spine in the belief that this
treatment can relieve medical complaints. They disagree over how
widely the technique should be used.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the American Medical Association and other orthodox
doctors' groups waged a fierce war on chiropractic, arguing that it
harmed many patients.
</P>
<P>
   One camp of chiropractors restricts itself to musculoskeletal
manipulations of backs and necks. Another camp claims that
chiropractic can benefit sufferers of conditions such as asthma,
ear infections and hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   And ``there is one group that believes chiropractors can be
primary care providers (like medical doctors) who can take care of
a whole gamut of symptoms,'' says Shekelle, an internist who
received his medical degree at the Duke University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Shekelle's study examined only one application of chiropractic _
treating lower back pain. He and colleagues examined the medical
records of 1,310 patients who sought treatment for lower back pain
at 131 randomly sampled chiropractic offices in the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by three chiropractic organizations. Its
seven authors, led by Shekelle, include three chiropractors.
Shekelle said the funding groups had no control over Rand's
analysis and publication of its findings.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the 1940s, the Santa Monica-based Rand Corp. is best
known as a private think tank heavily funded by the Defense
Department. Rand stands for ``Research and Development.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's 29 percent finding of inappropriateness upset some
chiropractors, Shekelle said. ``We've heard from some
chiropractors, `Why did you publish such a negative article about
us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wallace Sampson, a Stanford University Medical School
professor who edits the journal Scientific Review of Alternative
Medicine, expressed skepticism about the Rand findings.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, an oncologist, insisted chiropractic manipulation can
harm patients by causing herniated discs or by delaying orthodox
treatment of a serious illness like cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Argyelan, president of the 4,000-member California
Chiropractic Association, said the Shekelle study was ``a good
report'' but expressed concern over the meaningfulness of the terms
``appropriate'' and ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Argyelan said he agreed with Shekelle's statement that a 29
percent rate of improper procedures is ``too high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The chiropractic profession needs to support more research on
spinal manipulative therapy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANSFIELD, Mass. _ This is a love story. As in Ann, Jennifer,
Jessica, and Tabitha love the Spice Girls. So when the four
Boston-area girls were chosen to meet the Spice Girls backstage,
before the group's Great Woods concert Wednesday night, you will
understand why they screamed and jumped and ran in circles. They
love the Spice Girls. More than anything, according to Ann LeBlanc,
who is 8. And a half.
</P>
<P>
   Think we're kidding? Witness the Herculean effort involved in
delivering the children from Ann's apartment in a Medford housing
development to the concert in Mansfield, 34 miles away. First, mom
Florence LeBlanc, 45, had to phone all of her friends who have
cars, because she can't afford one. Michael Stenson was willing to
drive, but his car was on the outs. Knowing how much the girls
loved the Spice Girls, he arranged to borrow his sister's rusty
gray Chevy. Everyone piled in, and Mike took off, so anxious to
make the kids' dream come true that he drove on the shoulder of
Interestate 93, weaving in and out of traffic like a daredevil.
Thirty miles later, he wrecked on the ramp from Interstate 495
South to Route 140, 1 mile shy of the destination.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, but the girls began to cry. A dream deferred.
Then the police, including State Police Lt. Frederick Morse, who
was on paid police duty at the concert venue, arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw them crying, we thought they were hurt,'' Morse
said in a phone interview from his Framingham post Thursday. ``But
when I realized it was because they weren't going to get to meet
the Spice Girls, I decided to take them down, blue lights and all.
It's traumatic enough being in an accident. I wanted to make it
better for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a ride home,'' said Florence LeBlanc, as she
crawled, dazed and stressed, out of the cruiser with her daughter,
sister, nieces, and daughter's best friend. ``But we couldn't pass
this up. We'll find a way home.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, before we get to the good part, where four squirming girls
come face to face with four very muscular, very rich British pop
stars, let's explain how LeBlanc and company could afford to attend
the show, which at $40 a pop would have cost them $240, which
Florence, the unemployed, single mother of four kids, says is
``more than a week's income'' for her household. Let's explain how
of the nearly 20,000 fans at the show, these kids were able to meet
the Girls.
</P>
<P>
   It was free, and arranged in the name of marketing, the magical
Spice Girls key word.
</P>
<P>
   Ann, who attends the Goodwill Fresh Air summer camp for
disadvantaged kids, was selected by counselors there for the free
tickets, which were donated by a board member with connections at
Aprilia, the Italian motorcycle company that sponsors the Spice
Girls tour. ``Ann was clearly the biggest Spice Girls fan at
camp,'' said Betsy Rosen, a Goodwill spokeswoman. ``She has the
necklace, the posters, the lollipops, the dolls. She's got it
all.'' Ann, in turn, chose to invite her best buddy, Jessica
Yanosky, age 9; and her cousins Jennifer and Tabitha Belbin, ages 9
and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann would never have even asked to go,'' said her mother.
``She knows I couldn't afford it. That's how much of a dream this
was for her.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains why the four girls, who spent painstaking hours
choosing their velvet outfits and platform shoes, ended up draped
in gigantic Aprilia T-shirts, which they were required to wear. ``I
wanted Sporty Spice to see my outfit,'' said Ann, who had finally
persuaded her mother to allow her to wear blue eye shadow. ``I've
never dressed up or gone anywhere like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   So there they were, half an hour before showtime, waiting at a
side gate, while everyone else watched the endless slew of
commercials on giant video screens. Sponsorship coordinator Ken
Smith, a Scot with short whitish hair and laughing eyes, tried to
soothe their nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long? How much longer? Is it time yet?'' Tabitha
questioned, her face twisted in agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute more,'' Smith said. So the girls started counting
the seconds, out loud. Florence, dressed in a black tank top and
tight jeans, puffed on her cigarette and eyed her anxious daughter.
A smile crept across mom's face as she recalled her first concert,
at 15 _ Seals and Crofts.
</P>
<P>
   ``57, 58, 59, 60!'' they cried in unison. Smith, true to his
word, turned, and opened the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the gate were two round tables set up on the grass under
a canopy, where the girls were told to wait along with another
group. As they walked toward the tables, an entourage including
Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler passed. At that point, Florence and
her sister Janet Belbin (Tabitha and Jennifer's mom) suddenly
resembled their children. The moms turned on their heels and began
to follow Tyler into a room where VIPs sat eating things like tiny
meatballs on toothpicks. They didn't get very far.
</P>
<P>
   If waiting at the gate was bad, waiting at the tables was worse.
``I'm shaking,'' said Jennifer. Ann tried to remember all the
questions she had thought up back in Medford _ What is girl power?
Why did you name the band Spice Girls? But her mind was blank.
``Mom,'' she said, grasping her throat dramatically. ``I'm so
thirsty, Mom, I'm going to die.'' Jennifer jumped up and down, her
brown eyes bright and shiny. Jessica, nerves shot, stared at her
toenails, painted pink for the occasion. Then Jennifer spotted Baby
Spice through the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see her! I see Baby!'' The Medford girls began jumping and
climbing over one another, screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Scary!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Sporty!''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they loved the Spice Girls so much, they answered,
variously, ``They're cool.'' ``They're sexy.'' ``They have girl
power.'' ``They dress cool.'' ``They don't let anyone push them
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), in velvet pants and halter top, was
the first to appear, ``You guys all right?'' she asked, signing
each of the girls' papers with a Magic Marker, moving along the row
of fans methodically. The girls, mouth agape, were speechless. And
then, as quickly as she had come, Scary was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Posh Spice (Victoria Adams), with her new short,
slicked-back hair. Ann stared, her breathing shallow, and could
only manage a whisper, ``Victoria ...'' To which Posh replied:
``Hello there. Are you all OK? Yeah? Thanks for coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), with her high blonde
ponytails. ``Everyone is OK?'' she asked, seeming rushed. Then she
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm), Ann's personal
favorite. She watched the girls for a moment, a look of amusement
on her face. ``Hello everyone,'' she said. The girls gulped and
stared. ``You all OK? Look at you. I want to see you up dancing and
singing, OK? I'm glad you came. Have a jolly good time, OK?'' She
smiled, kind. And then she, too, disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Ann collapsed dramatically onto the grass. Upon being lifted up
by her mother, she said ``I fainted, Mom, I really fainted. I just
could not believe it. They talked to me. Sporty talked to me. This
is the best day of my life.'' Jennifer stared at her paper with the
four signatures, held it up to her mother, and asked, ``Isn't that
beautiful?''
</P>
<P>
   Tabitha held her paper to her chest and said, over and over, ``I
can't believe it. I can't believe it.'' Jessica, still overcome
with emotion, said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As the girls walked hand in hand to their 12th row center seats
they talked about this, the biggest day of their lives, according
to Jennifer. It only got better, too, as the concert proceeded.
They danced and sang their way through, as Sporty had ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the coolest costumes,'' said Tabitha, who had a
minor accident just when the show started. Her foot got jammed in
the seat and security had to take her to the first aid tent. After
an attendant wrapped the ankle, she returned to her seat and
resumed singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for the Spice Girls,'' Ann said, after it was all
over and she and her group waited for a cab, whose flat $80 fee was
paid for by Goodwill. ``If there were no Spice Girls, I don't know
what I'd do. I'd probably like KISS. That's why I'm glad there are
Spice Girls. Because they make you realize how stupid KISS really
is. When I grow up, I want to be a Spice Girl. I already have my
name. Junior Spice.''

BIG NEW FORD F250 SUPER IN A LOT OF WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, July 12 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sooner had I departed for Colorado in a large red Dodge Ram
cum 24-valve Cummins diesel, obviously the largest, best-suited
vehicle available for the task of hauling a heavily laden 22-foot
trailer up into the Rockies, than did Ford's version of a Big Red
Truck arrive on my doorstep. I come home from 4,600 miles in the
cab of a truck to find ... a (itals)bigger(unitals) truck.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ford's F250 4 x 4 Supercab XLT, a heavy-duty giant that
stands a shade more than 77 inches tall on a 158-inch wheelbase,
its bright red clearcoat paint job gleaming in the sun. Standard
powertrain for this truck is a 5.4-liter, V-8 engine with 5-speed,
manual transmission _ but this is the heavy heavy duty. This Big
Red Truck has a 4-speed electronically controlled transmission
attached to a 275 horsepower _ 410 ft/lb of torque _ 6.8-liter,
V-10 gas engine.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge has a big V-10 gas engine, had it before Ford did. But the
Dodge engine, good as it is, is a bit rough-sounding, an audio
arrhythmiadue to the design process _ the stretching of an existing
V-8 by cobbling together an extra couple of cylinders with an
asymmetrical crankshaft. The Ford V-10 is one of a series of
modular engines, a family of motors designed with components in
common; it was conceived as a V-10 from the get-go with a
symmetrical crankshaft. The end Ford product is whisper quiet,
silky smooth.
</P>
<P>
   So here I am with this humongous truck designed for stump
pulling, barge hauling, and other such beastly employment, and
nothing of any consequence to pull, haul, carry, or drag. If it
were winter now, I would fill the truck's cavernous plastic-lined
bed with ice and snow, stuff that weighs plenty, doesn't scratch
the paint, and is easy to unload _ just wait for a warm spell. But
this is summer; snow is hard to come by (except in the Rockies, but
I'm not there now) and I have no prospect for hauling anuything
more than a couple of sticks of lumber and some pegboard from which
I hope to fashion a pot rack. To this end, I head for Maine in the
Big Red Truck and the barn where the ancient Toolcraft radial arm
saw and the jointer/planer are stored.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the F250 has running boards, otherwise it might be
necessary to drag along a ladder for entry and exit. The bumper as
step facilitates the mounting/dismounting. The seat is a
three-section bench; the back of the middle section folds down to
reveal a large storage bin with coin holder _ something I think
Ford copied from Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are clear, the controls pretty straightforward _ this is
a work truck. But I wish the fashion clowns who design radios would
get that message; working stiffs on the job don't have time to be
bothering with little rockers and cute tuning bars _ a couple of
knobs will suffice, guys. The preset buttons at least are large
enough for a human hand, even a hand swathed in a glove, but
controls fashioned for audio dilettantes are not welcome, out of
place, in a work vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The route north takes me over that mix of rough pavement, short
stretch of dirt, and scenic back roads. I note with sadness that
the church with the peculiar four-gabled steeple, so long a
landmark for a route change, was a wreck, its steeple on the
ground, roof timbers laid bare _ either in the process of
demolition or reconstruction _ the latter, one hopes. It is sad to
lose structures of unique character in a world full of
cookie-cutter plastic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The F250 is sprung for a load _ it needs a ton or two to smooth
it out. Still, it is far from harsh. A little hoppy at times on the
uneven pavement, but it never loses its footing, is stable in the
corners, exhibits very nice handling characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the driver/passengers up front is a bench seat wide
enough for three more, and while the front-to-back space is a bit
scant for adult thighs, knees, and feet, three kids will be OK. I
pile it with stuff. This is, by the way, a four-door 4(MUL)4. The
rear doors cannot be opened until the front doors are open, a
safety thing, but four doors make this a very convenient vehicle.
Better yet, the seat flips out, folds down, and forms a hard
surface on which to pile heavy stuff _ toolboxes and the like. Or a
place for the dog, right under the gun rack (your option).
</P>
<P>
   I run the Ford out to Glenn By-ron's place, he who prepped the
Dodge and trailer for Colorado; he goes over it admiringly. ``You
know this is a heavy-duty truck soon as you see those eight-lug
wheels,'' he says. ``Love to have this to pull the trailer.'' Love
to have this, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got an engine or two you need delivered?'' I ask jokingly.
Byron is serious in his well-considered answer in the negative.
</P>
<P>
   The mirrors are big, set way out to see around trailers; the
mirrors are segmented, too, with a small wide-angle bottom portion
designed to show you the rear wheels as you back up, a safety plus.
</P>
<P>
   Empty _ or virtually so _ this truck wants to gallop; all that
power and nothing to pull, like a sled dog too long confined to the
yard. I spend a day cutting wood, dadoing, shaping _ measure twice,
cut once, I remember. Still, when I get home, the pieces of this
complicated contraption that look perfect assembled on the barn
floor will prove to be a quarter-inch off on two sides _ and 150
miles distant from the machine that can fix that in jiffy. Thus
cut, the pieces of the prefab pot rack are even lighter going home.
I am tempted to go rock-picking and maybe build a wall, anything to
try this truck with a proper load.
</P>
<P>
   The bed has a liner, and the usual four tie-downs are hidden
behind waterproof plugs, two friction type in the rear, two screwed
in place up front. In the box are three slots for 2 x 6s to lie
athwart the cargo area to support flat loads such as sheet rock or
plywood and six slots for 2 x 6s or 8s to divide the box into
compartments. If you need the 4WD, by the way, there is a switch on
the dash to engage the front axle and hubs in either high or low
range at the touch of a finger and thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Price? This is not a toy. Basic sticker is $25,055 plus $640
destination for 5.4-liter V-8 and manual, fairly well equipped. The
V-10, automatic, trailer package, 4-wheel antilock brakes and a
host of other options bring the final tally to $32,110 delivered.
Fuel mileage is tough, too; this is not a mini suitable for the
dump on weekends and commuting weekdays. This is a serious truck
with a serious fuel appetite as evidenced by its 38-gallon fuel
tank, just a wee bit smaller than a DC-3's. For just over 900
miles, the Ford averages 11.59 miles to the gallon _ that's empty;
figure a lot less as the load increases.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, though, I found myself wishing for a real job that
needed a real truck ... well, for a few seconds anyway. This gig
beats real work most days.

THINNED DOWN STAIN GIVES `WASHED' LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My 48-year-old knotty pine summer house in Marshfield has a
lot of knotty pine that I think was stained with a Minwax stain;
the finish is dull. Can I put a white semitransparent stain on that
knotty pine? I don't mind the knots that will bleed through. I
don't want a painted look, but rather a sort of washed look.
</P>
<P>
   LISA COZZA, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the paneling has not been varnished or waxed or treated in
any way other than the flat stain, then you can use a
semitransparent stain, but it won't be white, or at least white
white; off-white or light, light gray is the best you can do. While
that stain is designed for outdoor use, one thin coat on an inside
surface will be OK, although it would be a good idea to get out of
the house while the stain is drying.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get a semitransprent stain look is to thin down a
white solid color stain or interior latex wall paint, and apply one
coat of that. Use water to thin down the stain or paint. How much
to use is up to you to get the desired look.
</P>
<P>
   The way to do that is to make a small mix of one part stain and
one part water, and apply that to a small area of the wall. Make a
different mix, and try that until you get what you like. Then make
a bigger batch with the proper formula and finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A roofer redoing my roof proposes to put Ice &AMP; Water Shield
on my entire roof. Is this necessary? Also, there is a lot of snow
on the roof in winter; would the snow melt bring water into the
attic? I am having a ridge vent put in; how can I tell if the
roofer has cut a slot in the sheathing so the vent will actually
vent?
</P>
<P>
   A CALLER, from Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the Ice &AMP; Water Shield has to go up only six feet
from the eaves, but it wouldn't hurt to put it on the entire roof,
just somewhat more expensive. With six feet of Ice &AMP; Water Shield
and a proper roof installation, there should be no leaks into the
attic from snow melt or any other source. While the Ice &AMP; Water
Shield will not prevent ice dams, it will prevent water backed up
by the dam from getting under the shingles and causing a leak.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ridge vent and soffit vents (under the eaves) that
prevent ice dams.
</P>
<P>
   A certain amount of trust is required when you hire a pro to do
something. If you really don't trust the professional, find
another. But to determine if the sheathing were cut for a ridge
vent, go into the attic and inspect the under part of the ridge; if
the sheathing were cut, there should be a one- or two-inch-wide
strip open on each side of the ridge board. If you don't see these
open strips, or do not see daylight through them (you won't see a
lot of daylight, but there will be a little showing), then see the
roofer to make things right. Another way to check is to light a
match near the ridge; the movement of air from soffits to ridge
might be enough to blow the match out. Or, blow the match out and
see if the smoke goes up through the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been told that if you paint your siding blue or yellow,
it will prevent any nails holding the clapboards in place from
rusting. I find that hard to believe. Is it so?
</P>
<P>
   D.Z., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Huh, wha? The handyman has heard a lot of wacky things, but
that one takes the cake. In three words, it ain't so. No paint, any
color, will prevent rusting, nor will it cover rusted nails; the
rust will bleed through, sooner than later. Painting the nails with
Kilz or any other primer-sealer/stain-killer-type finish also will
not work. Painting the rusty nails with Rust Reformer may work for
a while, but not permanently. Rust Reformer and other brand names
for the material contain phosphoric acid, which turns the rust
black and makes it paintable.
</P>
<P>
   Even countersinking the nails and filling them with putty may
not work for very long. Besides, the clapboards are only 1/4 inch
thick, not thick enough for effective countersinking.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to conquer rust is to remove it, and remove its
source. So, pull the old nails and replace them with stainless
steel siding nails. You might be able to drive the stainless steel
nails into the holes of the old nails; if not, drive the stainless
steel nails beside the old nail holes, and fill those old holes
with exterior wood filler.
</P>
<P>
   If you find pulling the old nails tedious and labor intensive,
you could instead countersink them clear through the clapboard and
fill the holes with wood filler. This is not as good as pulling the
old nails, because countersinking clear through the clapboards
could spilt them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The linoleum on the deck of a boat cabin looks like wood and
is still in pretty good shape, but the shine is gone. How can I get
it to shine again?
</P>
<P>
   REBECCA SCHULTES, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Some linoleum are so old that not only have they lost their
shine but will not take a shine under any treatment. But it won't
hurt to try applying a coat of Future, and acrylic finish. If it
works, fine. If it doesn't, I don't think anything will.

AN INSIDER'S SOLID LOOK AT TANGLEWOOD RANCOR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
TANGLEWOOD 
The Clash Between Tradition and Change 
By Andrew L. Pincus 
Northeastern University Press, 210 pp., illustrated, $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clash between tradition and change probably began in the
second minute of Creation and it will continue until the
Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   The particular circumstances of this clash as they unfolded at
Tanglewood over the last couple of years have brought the Boston
Symphony Orchestra its worst press since 1984, when actress Vanessa
Redgrave sued the orchestra for canceling her contract because of
her political views. This controversy is paradoxical, because
Tanglewood's founder, former BSO music director Serge Koussevitzky,
sought to sidestep the immemorial conflict by creating a tradition
that would be about change.
</P>
<P>
   There are many good reasons to read ``Tanglewood: The Clash
Between Tradition and Change,'' by Andrew Pincus, the music critic
of The Berkshire Eagle. It is a serious, thoughtful, and
thought-provoking book. Over the last 23 years, Pincus has
certainly spent more hours on the Tanglewood grounds than any other
journalist and probably more than any musician or administrator. He
knows the greensward as well as any individual can, and what is
encrypted on every blade of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his readers, at least for now, will turn to his new book
to get the skivvy on the controversies swirling around the
Tanglewood Music Center, the BSO's summer institute for advanced
musical training, but they will not get to the bottom of the
matter. Pincus's account seems sketchy _ it has to be because too
much of what happened is unclear and key participants have chosen
not to talk publicly about it. But it also seems partial, which may
be why the BSO briefly contemplated forbidding the sale of the book
in the Tanglewood gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pincus's treatment of the TMC controversies is more solid
than it was in his recent overheated article in Boston Magazine. &UR;  &LR; 
It has become routine for commentators &UR;  &LR; to discuss a 1994 Sony/PBS
educational video project involving Wynton Marsalis, Yo-Yo Ma,
Seiji Ozawa, and students of the Tanglewood Music Center as if it
were a schlocky and purely commercial venture, as if the TMC
orchestra had had been commandeered to back up the Spice Girls on
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Marsalis on Music'' video project was flawed in conception
and execution, but objections to it came to the fore only after the
taping was underway. By that time, it was too late to do anything
about scheduling conflicts, which certainly should have been
foreseen. At that point, Ozawa's only option was the one every
professional musician has to exercise repeatedly throughout his
career _ to soldier on, making the best of a bad situation. It
could be argued that instead of exploiting the TMC students, he was
offering them a lesson in professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the Marsalis project crystalized a
longstanding conflict at Tanglewood between the ``ivory tower''
activities of the TMC and the populist requirements of a summer
festival that must attract an audience of thousands to every
concert. It also set in motion a chain of events that led to
Ozawa's dismissal of Richard Ortner as administrator of the TMC and
the high-profile resignations of the TMC's artistic director Leon
Fleisher and faculty chairman Gilbert Kalish. There is no evidence
that Ozawa either wanted or welcomed these resignations. In fact,
he repeatedly urged Fleisher, now 70, to remain in a reconfigured,
honorific and active position.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who love Tanglewood and the Tanglewood Music
Center in particular, Pincus seems troubled and confused by these
events, events in which people on both sides of the controversy
sought to wrap themselves in the cape of Koussevitzky, who made a
natural ally to both sides because he was both firmly attached to
tradition and profoundly committed to advancing the cutting edge.
He believed that the ``eternal verities'' expressed in music could
be found in the work unknown young Americans hadn't composed yet as
well as in classics by Beethoven, Brahms, and Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has said little about his reasons for wanting change at
the TMC, but what he has said makes sense. He was not happy with
the parts of the operation he knows best, the conducting and the
orchestra program, and he wanted to restore a more direct
involvement by the BSO in its own school. Orchestra training is a
core element of the TMC's curriculum, and the school was not making
full or effective use of the very resource that makes it unique,
the sponsorship of a resident world-class symphony orchestra. In
noting this, quite belatedly, (more than 20 years into his music
directorship), Ozawa was measuring the TMC of recent years against
the very different Tanglewood of his first experience, when he
arrived as a student in 1960. The principal change he wanted was
the restoration of a tradition which withered away back in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the dismissal of Ortner was handled
badly, and that the subsequent year of transition, which unfolded
in the absence of a general manager, was troubled by numerous
administrative missteps and misunderstandings that led to hurt
feelings and bruised egos. The resignations of Kalish and Fleisher
were a public-relations disaster; more importantly, they
represented an artistic loss to Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless it is an enormous jump from these unpleasant facts
to the even more unpleasant implications of Pincus's assessment
that Ozawa ``was unhappy with the traditionalist stance of the
Music Center, which since its beginning under Koussevitzky had been
dedicated to ensemble performance and the art of music rather than
solo careers and glorification of the performer. Wanting to open
the festival and school to outside influences as jazz, Ozawa felt
blocked by `the club' (of Fleisher, Kalish and other ``entrenched''
members of the TMC faculty).''

 UNDATED: ... TMC faculty).''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ozawa did invite the jazz pianist Marcus Roberts to appear at a
Boston Symphony concert where Roberts's performance was deplorable;
Roberts came back the following season to participate in a short
fund-raising concert with the TMC orchestra that mingled serious
and popular repertory. There's no other evidence that Ozawa is
pursuing a jazz or ``outside influence'' agenda (Keith Jarrett's
appearance in a Mozart concerto, cited by Pincus, was not Ozawa's
idea, but the result of the pianist's longtime professional
assocation with the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, with whom he
had recorded the work in question).
</P>
<P>
   And Ozawa has never said or done anything to suggest that he
wanted the TMC or even the BSO's Shed concerts to be about solo
careers and superstar performers. Certainly the BSO's concerts in
the 5,000-seat shed depend on the stars of the music business, and
the performances of some of them deteriorated over the years. (How
are you going to tell the Tanglewood public that loves Itzhak
Perlman that they shouldn't enjoy him any more?)
</P>
<P>
   For a person in his position, Ozawa himself has always seemed
remarkably free of star-worship. Some of his proteges did become
superstars, like Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle, but they were
promising young Americans when Ozawa started engaging them; they
remained loyal to him in their glory years, and he remained loyal
to them in their times of trouble. But he has also worked steadily
with musicians he admired who were not on that level of fame, or
even interested in it, like Peter Serkin, Maria Tipo, Benjamin
Luxon, Gidon Kremer and Vinson Cole; he has steered clear of some
dubious celebrities like Nadja Salerno-Sonenberg, and recently not
renewed his acquaintance with Evgeny Kissin or Midori.
</P>
<P>
   The revised TMC curriculum which went into place this summer,
and which Ozawa intends to keep evolving, was not ``devised in
large part by (the new director of the school, Ellen) Highstein,''
as Pincus says. It represented Highstein's organization,
consolidation and implementation of suggestions made during
meetings with Ozawa, last summer's faculty, students, and such
interested parties as Andre Previn, Bernard Haitink, John Williams,
members of the Juilliard Quartet, and others. Paradoxically there
does not seem to be anything in this summer's program that Kalish
and Fleisher could object to, at least on artistic grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Pincus's new book is a sequel to his earlier book,
``Scenes from Tanglewood'' (1989), a distillation of his first
dozen years of reporting. Pincus is more ambitious and inevitably
less successful this time out because this is not just a book about
Tanglewood. He uses Tanglewood as a lens through which to examine
the issues facing America's entire musical culture.
</P>
<P>
   His eye and his ear remain as acute as ever, and his accounts of
such episodes as the planning, construction, and opening of Seiji
Ozawa Hall; the final residencies and last concert of Leonard
Bernstein; the 50th anniversary revival of Benjamin Britten's
``Peter Grimes'' are accurate, thoughtful and interesting. They
will prove informative even to people who were there. There are
lively portraits of, tributes to, and conversations with, such
diverse Tanglewood figures as Bernard Haitink, John Williams, Louis
Krasner, Lukas Foss, John Harbison, Alfred Brendel, and Keith
Lockhart. One need not agree with Pincus's conclusion about Ozawa
(``Ozawa seems to have overstayed his time; neither he nor the
orchestra is growing'') in order to recognize that he has provided
a complex characterization of a complex figure, which benefits from
the writer's travels to Japan to observe the conductor at work in
his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably Pincus's intimate knowledge of Tanglewood overmatches
his knowledge of what is happening elsewhere. The book crucially
lacks a sense of context. It is odd to find American musical life
discussed only as it has been controversially codified in such
documents as the American Symphony Orchestra League's 1993 report
on ``Americanizing the American Orchestra'' (a study whose title
the book repeatedly gets wrong). Creeping commercialism at
Tanglewood, one of Pincus's major themes, needs to be discussed in
the context of what has been happening at such other summer
festivals as the Chicago Symphony's Ravinia, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's Hollywood Bowl, and the Cleveland Orchestra's
Blossom, all of which have made different, and far more
commercially opportunistic, responses to the same pressures
Tanglewood faces.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been less meticulously edited than its predecessor.
The individual chapters seem to have been written for independent
publication, so there is a lot of repetition that becomes
irritating to someone who is reading all the way through. There is
also a light dusting of uncharacteristic error. Mezzos Frederica
von Stade and Mitsuko Shirai have been squeezed up into sopranos;
the conductor James DePreist's name is misspelled; Isaiah Jackson
did not conduct ``Gospel Night'' ``sometimes,'' but once, and
Charles Floyd went on to shape it into a beloved new tradition in
five subsequent seasons. ``Gospel Night'' is not the only BSO
activity tailored to ethnic or minority groups. Arthur Fiedler did
Irish, Italian, Celtic, Hispanic and Armenian nights beyond
counting (as well as ``Negro Nights''), and such programming
continued through John Williams' era into Keith Lockhart's Pops
today.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever personal interpretation he puts on events, whatever
reasoning and motives he imputes to people who have not stated
them, Pincus has certainly identified some of the principal issues
and dangers that face Tanglewood and, by extension, all of serious
cultural life in this country today. But he may have produced this
particular book prematurely: The restructuring and re-animation of
the TMC is one of the most ambitious and important projects of
Ozawa's career, and the time to evaluate it is not before it is
under &UR;  &LR; way, but after it has produced some results. Instead of
beginning in medias res, Pincus ends there. On the other hand, if
you're talking about Tanglewood, that may be only fitting;
Koussevitzky intended the place to be in medias res all the time.

STAFF FEARS NEW YORKER REVAMP IN WAKE OF BROWN DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day after Tina Brown announced she was quitting
her job as editor of The New Yorker, her staffers started worrying
the magazine might soon be pushed into changes as deep and
unnerving as those that Brown herself fostered when she took over
the esteemed publication six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big fear,'' said one longtime senior editor, who asked not
to be identified, is that Conde Nast, the magazine's owner, will
turn the weekly into a biweekly or even a monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the end of The New Yorker, as we know it,'' the
senior editor said Thursday. Articles would be less timely and
news-breaking _ and there would be far fewer articles, which would
discourage, and may prompt the departure of, its most prolific
writers.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker has been in dreadful financial shape for the past
several years _ a state of affairs which an article in this month's
Fortune magazine attributes more to the owners than to the editor.
Brown boosted circulation during her reign from 500,000 to 800,000
_ but, last year alone, the magazine lost $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries many of us,'' the senior editor said, ``is that
the problem will be defined as 'too high editorial costs''' _ and
that those costs will then be slashed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of turning it into a biweekly or monthly has ``been in
the wind for a long time, even before Tina got there,'' the senior
editor said. Brown, the editor said, ``always resisted'' the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Si Newhouse, the 70-year-old billionaire who owns Conde Nast,
paid a rare visit to The New Yorker's offices Thursday morning,
partly to relieve fears.
</P>
<P>
   One staff writer who attended the meeting said Newhouse was
asked whether Draconian cuts would be imposed on the editorial
budget and whether the magazine would go biweekly or monthly.
Newhouse said, ``No,'' to both.
</P>
<P>
   However, one skeptic noted that Newhouse also pledged to keep
then-editor William Shawn onboard when he bought The New Yorker in
1985 _ and then fired him two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse has not yet chosen a replacement for Brown. He told the
assembled staff members Thursday he would not rush into a decision
but hoped to make an announcement next week.
</P>
<P>
   One Conde Nast insider, who also asked for anonymity, said
Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, was called to a meeting
with Newhouse Wednesday evening to discuss the job.
</P>
<P>
   According to the insider, Carter said he would rather stay at
Vanity Fair _ also owned by Conde Nast. Brown was Vanity Fair's
editor _ and transformed that magazine, commercially and otherwise
_ before she joined The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Many names have been bandied about as possible replacements, but
some of these named say they have not been contacted by anyone.
Even the rumor-mongers admit nobody really knows who the new editor
will be.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers Thursday noted that Newhouse's meeting with
Carter might suggest little interest in changing the basic
direction of the Brown-era New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 44, has been hailed and reviled for taking the country's
most serious literary and political magazine and making it more
glitzy, commercial and occasionally sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some critics concede her magazine is more
consistently interesting than it was under her immediate
predecessor, Robert Gottlieb, and that she cultivated writers _
such as David Remnick, Jeffrey Toobin, Henry Louis Gates, and
Anthony Lane _ who are now considered among the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   Brown announced Wednesday she will be joining Miramax, the
independent film production company owned by Disney, where she will
run a multi-media enterprise involving a magazine, movies, and
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker's spokeswoman, Maurie Perl, elaborated in an
interview Thursday that Brown's new magazine will be a monthly,
with its first issue slated for the Fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The new magazine will up the stakes on a growing ``synergy''
between Hollywood and the publishing world, in which film producers
more and more seek ideas from magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are certain properties from this magazine that will
lend themselves to future film or TV productions,'' Perl said,
``then, before they get optioned or sold to other studios, Miramax
will be in the position to make these deals happen for their own
company.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she emphasized, it ``will be a stand-alone magazine
first,'' just as her New Yorker and Vanity Fair were.
</P>
<P>
   One senior editor at The New Yorker said Thursday that Brown
quit of her own accord and was not about to be pushed out by Conde
Nast. The main factors were the recent death of her mother _ ``one
of those 'life-is-short' epiphanies'' _ and Fortune's recent
article, which ``may have solidified her impession'' that The New
Yorker's financial problems were ``systemic and insolvable.''

AN UNLIKELY SOURCE SHEDS LIGHT ON '66 KLAN KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ For three decades, Bob Stringer has lived
with the memory of a conversation he overheard in in the back booth
of John's Cafe, a Hopperesque hangout of the Ku Klux Klan in
Laurel, Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966, and Sam Bowers, a jukebox operator
who moonlighted as the imperial wizard of the White Knights of the
Klan, was voicing his frustration that Klan elements in neighboring
Forrest County had been unable to suppress the voting registration
efforts of the local NAACP leader, Vernon Dahmer Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer, in an interview, recalled the exchange the other day,
``Sam said: `Something's got to be done about that Dahmer nigger
down south,' and he slapped the counter. Then Henry deBoxtel said:
`We need to put a Code Four on him.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the parlance of the Klan, Code Four called for death.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Dahmer was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers and his band were quickly rounded up and charged with the
killing, but the prosecution of the case was inconclusive and
resulted in few convictions. Bowers himself went free after two
mistrials.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, at the Dahmer family's request, reopened an
investigation several years ago into what remains one of
Mississippi's most infamous civil rights murders. But the case lay
stalled until Stringer felt his conscience jarred after seeing the
Dahmer family appeal for fresh information on local television in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Stringer was enrolled in a 12-step program of
recovery for gambling addicts, and step nine called for him to make
``direct amends'' to those whom he had caused suffering if it was
possible to do so without causing injury to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' Stringer said. ``I wanted to make
amends to the Dahmer family, but on the other hand, I didn't want
to injure my old friends'' from the days of the Klan's campaign of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   After agonizing over his knowledge, Stringer drove to
Hattiesburg, the county seat of Forrest County, looked up the name
of Vernon Dahmer Jr. in a telephone directory, and used a pay phone
to call the son of the man killed when his house was firebombed
1966. Stringer shared little that he knew in that first, veiled
conversation, but he told Dahmer he had once been affiliated with
the Klan and wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   The call led to a series of telephone talks and clandestine
meetings over a four-year period that culminated May 28 with the
arrest of the 73-year-old Bowers and two of his associates, Charles
R. Noble and Devours Nix. Bowers and Noble are charged with murder
and arson; Nix is charged with arson.
</P>
<P>
   With Bowers' trial approaching next month, Stringer, the Klan
leader's onetime protege, agreed to talk publicly for the first
time about his role in the case. In several conversations over the
past 10 days, he laid out an extraordinary tale, the expressions of
a 52-year-old Mississippian wrestling with guilt, redemption, and
racial reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to do right,'' said Stringer, who operates a
landscaping business in a south Mississippi community. When he was
a teenager, he worked for Bowers, typing Klan manifestos and
distributing leaflets. ``I never took the oath, but I considered
myself part of the Klan,'' he said. ``I never went out on missions
with them, but they never asked me. If they had asked me, I
probably would have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although unwilling to identify the secret witness in the case,
Forrest County District Attorney Lindsey Carter confirmed Thursday
that a new informant was ``important because he's new evidence.
He's instrumental in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Vernon Dahmer Jr. said Stringer
provided the breakthrough in his family's long ordeal. ``Bob's
coming forward was the catalyst in giving us hope,'' he said. ``He
was valuable in the sense that he was the first informant who had
been affiliated with the Klan who agreed to come foward and tell
what he knew.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the Dahmers' farm home, on a night when the
pastures were covered in frost, is a legendary chapter in the
ugliest part of the state's history, and the recollections of
Dahmer's widow, Ellie Dahmer, are as vivid as Stringer's own
memories after 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been gettin' threats over the phone,'' she said this
week as she retold the story in her comfortable brick ranchhouse,
built on the site of the home that was burned. ``We knew the Klan
was active. They would put up signs on the trees, and when Vernon
would drive by, he'd stop and tear them down. They would call and
ask for Vernon.'' The anonyous callers accused him of ``wanting to
be white,'' she said, ``Then they would use the N-word and tell him
he was going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightriders burned down a shed full of hay on the Dahmer place,
but it did not deter him from advising blacks on how to register to
vote at his grocery store next door to his home. Windows were
knocked out of the store several times, Ellie Dahmer said.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the couple slept in shifts to protect their
home. Dahmer kept a shotgun and a pistol by his bed. But with the
passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, their fears ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had started going to bed like ordinary people,'' she said,
when their sleep was interrupted on the night of Jan. 10, 1966, by
the sound of gunfire and crashing glass. ``I told Vernon, `I
believe they got us this time.' There were two carloads of them.
One stopped by the grocery, the other by the house. They shot out
the plate glass window of our house and the display window of the
grocery.'' The raiders flung gallon jugs filled with gasoline to
drench the roofs and interiors of the two buildings, then they used
burning rags as torches.
</P>
<P>
   While Dahmer fired several loads of buckshot at the nightriders,
his wife escaped from the burning house by bundling their
10-year-old daughter, Bettie, in a coat, breaking through a back
window, and falling safely to the ground. Two other children and an
elderly relative who had been living in the rear of the grocery
also retreated to sanctuary in a barn. After the raiders fled,
Dahmer stumbled outside, but his lungs had been seared by the
flames. He died 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer's death, which followed the assassination of Medgar Evers
and the murder of three civil rights workers in Neshoba County,
triggered outrage in Mississippi. Dozens of FBI officers and state
investigators swarmed into the area and traced a dropped pistol to
a Klansman named Billy Roy Pitts. One of the cars used in the raid
was abandoned with a flat tire, and it produced more clues.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, the founder of the most dreaded unit of the Ku Klux
Klan, was quickly rounded up along with more than a dozen
confederates. Although 13 men were indicted on murder and arson
charges in state court, and federal charges of conspiracy and
intimidation resulted in 15 indictments, there were few
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were sentenced to life but none served more than 10
years. Another defendant served less than two years of a 10-year
term for arson after then Governor John Bell Williams, a darling of
the radical right, commuted his sentence in 1970.

 EPA CHIEF BLASTS GENERAL ELECTRIC OVER PCBs IN HUDSON RIVER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the Clinton administration's harshest
criticism of the General Electric Co., the head of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency accused GE of conducting a ``public
disinformation'' campaign about the dangers of PCBs in the Hudson
River.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner, testifying at a state
Assembly hearing on her agency's progress in assessing the dangers
of the river's PCBs, also accused the corporation of promoting
``politics at its most cynical'' by deploying legions of
Washington-based lobbyists to water down federal Superfund
legislation to clean up toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
   GE is currently listed as a responsible party at 75 Superfund
sites in the nation, including 200 miles of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE would have the people believe that _ and I quote _ living
in a PCB-laden area is not dangerous,'' Browner said in a 65-minute
hearing Thursday before five Democratic assemblymen and attended by
more than 100 people at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell people that PCBs are not dangerous is simply wrong,''
she said. ``Clearly, the science has spoken. PCBs are a serious
threat. They are a threat to our health, our environment and our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is engaged in a contentious years-long reassessment of
its decision not to dredge the Hudson River to remove PCBs, an
industrial chemical banned in 1976 and known to cause cancer in
animals. Earlier this year, the agency postponed its final
recommendation on the matter until December 2000, largely due to
erroneous data supplied by GE, Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   GE said its officials did not attend Thursday's hearing because
the company was not given enough advance notice, but it disputed
Browner's comments on the danger PCBs pose to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``PCBs do not cause cancer in humans,'' nor have the chemicals
been shown to cause any other adverse health effects in humans, GE
spokesman David Warshaw said in a telephone interview from the
company's headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. ``The risk scenarious
(of the danger of PCBs to humans) overstate the risk and don't
reflect real-world conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was the first in a series to address the health and
environmental risks along the Hudson, said Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky, a Democrat who chairs the Environmental Conservation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs were legally discharged into the Hudson for about 30 years,
beginning in the mid-1940s, by factories along the river. GE plants
at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward were the largest contributors,
dumping an estimated 500,000 pounds of the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   During her remarks, Browner repeated the agency's scientific
findings that PCB, or polychorinated biphenyl, has been linked to
birth defects and non-Hodgkins lymphoma in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Browner is the second Clinton Cabinet member in the past year to
blast GE's treatment of the Hudson. In October, Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt stood at a historic site near Hudson and blamed GE
for ``the sickness'' of the river.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has come under fire by environmentalists for continually
pushing back its deadline to decide whether to dredge the Hudson.
But on Thursday, Browner pledged to stick to the December 2000
deadline and vowed to force GE to pay for the cost of any cleanup.

BIG NEW FORD F250 SUPER IN A LOT OF WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, July 12 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sooner had I departed for Colorado in a large red Dodge Ram
cum 24-valve Cummins diesel, obviously the largest, best-suited
vehicle available for the task of hauling a heavily laden 22-foot
trailer up into the Rockies, than did Ford's version of a Big Red
Truck arrive on my doorstep. I come home from 4,600 miles in the
cab of a truck to find ... a (itals)bigger(unitals) truck.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ford's F250 4 x 4 Supercab XLT, a heavy-duty giant that
stands a shade more than 77 inches tall on a 158-inch wheelbase,
its bright red clearcoat paint job gleaming in the sun. Standard
powertrain for this truck is a 5.4-liter, V-8 engine with 5-speed,
manual transmission _ but this is the heavy heavy duty. This Big
Red Truck has a 4-speed electronically controlled transmission
attached to a 275 horsepower _ 410 ft/lb of torque _ 6.8-liter,
V-10 gas engine.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge has a big V-10 gas engine, had it before Ford did. But the
Dodge engine, good as it is, is a bit rough-sounding, an audio
arrhythmiadue to the design process _ the stretching of an existing
V-8 by cobbling together an extra couple of cylinders with an
asymmetrical crankshaft. The Ford V-10 is one of a series of
modular engines, a family of motors designed with components in
common; it was conceived as a V-10 from the get-go with a
symmetrical crankshaft. The end Ford product is whisper quiet,
silky smooth.
</P>
<P>
   So here I am with this humongous truck designed for stump
pulling, barge hauling, and other such beastly employment, and
nothing of any consequence to pull, haul, carry, or drag. If it
were winter now, I would fill the truck's cavernous plastic-lined
bed with ice and snow, stuff that weighs plenty, doesn't scratch
the paint, and is easy to unload _ just wait for a warm spell. But
this is summer; snow is hard to come by (except in the Rockies, but
I'm not there now) and I have no prospect for hauling anuything
more than a couple of sticks of lumber and some pegboard from which
I hope to fashion a pot rack. To this end, I head for Maine in the
Big Red Truck and the barn where the ancient Toolcraft radial arm
saw and the jointer/planer are stored.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the F250 has running boards, otherwise it might be
necessary to drag along a ladder for entry and exit. The bumper as
step facilitates the mounting/dismounting. The seat is a
three-section bench; the back of the middle section folds down to
reveal a large storage bin with coin holder _ something I think
Ford copied from Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are clear, the controls pretty straightforward _ this is
a work truck. But I wish the fashion clowns who design radios would
get that message; working stiffs on the job don't have time to be
bothering with little rockers and cute tuning bars _ a couple of
knobs will suffice, guys. The preset buttons at least are large
enough for a human hand, even a hand swathed in a glove, but
controls fashioned for audio dilettantes are not welcome, out of
place, in a work vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The route north takes me over that mix of rough pavement, short
stretch of dirt, and scenic back roads. I note with sadness that
the church with the peculiar four-gabled steeple, so long a
landmark for a route change, was a wreck, its steeple on the
ground, roof timbers laid bare _ either in the process of
demolition or reconstruction _ the latter, one hopes. It is sad to
lose structures of unique character in a world full of
cookie-cutter plastic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The F250 is sprung for a load _ it needs a ton or two to smooth
it out. Still, it is far from harsh. A little hoppy at times on the
uneven pavement, but it never loses its footing, is stable in the
corners, exhibits very nice handling characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the driver/passengers up front is a bench seat wide
enough for three more, and while the front-to-back space is a bit
scant for adult thighs, knees, and feet, three kids will be OK. I
pile it with stuff. This is, by the way, a four-door 4(MUL)4. The
rear doors cannot be opened until the front doors are open, a
safety thing, but four doors make this a very convenient vehicle.
Better yet, the seat flips out, folds down, and forms a hard
surface on which to pile heavy stuff _ toolboxes and the like. Or a
place for the dog, right under the gun rack (your option).
</P>
<P>
   I run the Ford out to Glenn By-ron's place, he who prepped the
Dodge and trailer for Colorado; he goes over it admiringly. ``You
know this is a heavy-duty truck soon as you see those eight-lug
wheels,'' he says. ``Love to have this to pull the trailer.'' Love
to have this, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got an engine or two you need delivered?'' I ask jokingly.
Byron is serious in his well-considered answer in the negative.
</P>
<P>
   The mirrors are big, set way out to see around trailers; the
mirrors are segmented, too, with a small wide-angle bottom portion
designed to show you the rear wheels as you back up, a safety plus.
</P>
<P>
   Empty _ or virtually so _ this truck wants to gallop; all that
power and nothing to pull, like a sled dog too long confined to the
yard. I spend a day cutting wood, dadoing, shaping _ measure twice,
cut once, I remember. Still, when I get home, the pieces of this
complicated contraption that look perfect assembled on the barn
floor will prove to be a quarter-inch off on two sides _ and 150
miles distant from the machine that can fix that in jiffy. Thus
cut, the pieces of the prefab pot rack are even lighter going home.
I am tempted to go rock-picking and maybe build a wall, anything to
try this truck with a proper load.
</P>
<P>
   The bed has a liner, and the usual four tie-downs are hidden
behind waterproof plugs, two friction type in the rear, two screwed
in place up front. In the box are three slots for 2 x 6s to lie
athwart the cargo area to support flat loads such as sheet rock or
plywood and six slots for 2 x 6s or 8s to divide the box into
compartments. If you need the 4WD, by the way, there is a switch on
the dash to engage the front axle and hubs in either high or low
range at the touch of a finger and thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Price? This is not a toy. Basic sticker is $25,055 plus $640
destination for 5.4-liter V-8 and manual, fairly well equipped. The
V-10, automatic, trailer package, 4-wheel antilock brakes and a
host of other options bring the final tally to $32,110 delivered.
Fuel mileage is tough, too; this is not a mini suitable for the
dump on weekends and commuting weekdays. This is a serious truck
with a serious fuel appetite as evidenced by its 38-gallon fuel
tank, just a wee bit smaller than a DC-3's. For just over 900
miles, the Ford averages 11.59 miles to the gallon _ that's empty;
figure a lot less as the load increases.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, though, I found myself wishing for a real job that
needed a real truck ... well, for a few seconds anyway. This gig
beats real work most days.

FIRING OFF SOME NOT QUITE RANDOM THOUGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just too hot for my mind to hold one thought for long, so
what follows are miscellaneous musings with a common thread.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made an emotional appeal during a White House
ceremony this week for stiffer penalties against gun owners who
fail to keep firearms out of the reach of children.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I, legal gun owners both, share our house with a
90-pound German shepherd and a slightly odd cat. No children living
at home. But should a situation occur like the one in Arkansas, in
which a twisted little juvenile illegally enters our secured home,
steals our property and uses it in a heinous act, under Clinton's
proposal we would be held responsible because we didn't keep the
guns locked up _ which would defeat one of the purposes why we own
them in the first place: easy access in the event that our safety
is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Is this not the craziest logic ever posed as justification for
more controls on law-abiding gun owners? Gun owners with children
living in the house have a moral responsibility to keep firearms
secured. But to hold gun owners legally responsible if a juvenile
steals a gun from their secured home is lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The volume of response to my column on the Second Amendment was
awesome. I'd like to share some of the thoughts that came in from
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many politicians who favor more restrictive gun laws
don't get is that crime is all about behavior,'' wrote Capt. James
D. Eisel of the Department of Public Safety at Michigan's Wayne
State University. ``It's simple, really. A lot of people are
misbehaving, sometimes violently, and sometimes they use firearms.
Removing firearms won't change their behavior, only the weapon they
will use. Changing behavior takes time and legislation can't do it.
Parents and society must effect this change, but this solution is
unacceptable to those who want immediate results. And so the real
problem and solution are invisible to those who earnestly, but
mistakenly, strive to control violent crime by controlling guns.''
</P>
<P>
   C.D. Blair of Charleston, W.V., wrote: ``Regarding the recent
spate of youthful violence, I fear that we have neglected for some
years to instill in our children the values necessary for them to
restrain their violent (and natural) impulses, and I'd rather see a
serious public health/education movement to correct this than a
blanket banning of the tools they have used to express their
discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard L. Sellers, a native Texan who is in his second term as
sheriff of Aiken County, S.C., wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``In a free society, the idea of government protecting us from
ourselves by vesting authority and power only in that government is
an invitation to a loss of that freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a career member of the law enforcement establishment, first
on the federal level, now locally elected, I am constantly
frustrated that we cannot legally act to intercept a known criminal
on the basis of what he or she might do, but at the same time we
consider denial of weapons to responsible citizens on the premise
that they might misuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The central Queensland coast of Australia has a problem with
roaming packs of hungry dingoes that are terrorizing its human
inhabitants. The wild dogs have taken to stalking people in their
hunt for food.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the good ol' U.S. of A., the answer to that problem
would be easy: Wild dog bites man; man shoots dog. But our friends
Down Under don't have that option. Australia has some of the
toughest gun laws on the books; individual gun ownership is nigh on
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Seems every dog will have its day Down Under.

FOUR DEGREES OF `LETHAL WEAPON'

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the ``Lethal Weapon'' series started 11 years ago, it was
fairly simple: two mismatched detectives vs. virtually
indestructible bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   As the sequels came, two good guys just weren't enough. Each new
entry has added a good guy, to the point where ``Lethal Weapon 4''
(which opened Friday) has five actors sharing poster space.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys have been used more economically, usually one
super-villain leading an army of goons. Here's a look at the
series' evolution:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon'' (1987)
</P>
<P>
   The good guys: Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are unlikely partners
Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. Riggs, near-suicidal after the
death of his wife, will do just about anything to save the day;
Murtaugh is a family man who prefers that his life stay calm.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys: Gary Busey, with a peroxide 'do, is Joshua, a
killer even more psychotic than Riggs; he's a sidekick to the
General (veteran heavy Mitchell Ryan), leader of a drug ring.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable scene: Riggs stops a suicide by handcuffing himself to
the guy and jumping off a building with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 2'' (1989)
</P>
<P>
   The good guys: Joe Pesci joins Riggs and Murtaugh as Leo Getz,
an annoying, noisy, motor-mouthed and did we mention annoying
two-bit hustler who ``helps'' the cops in their fight against South
African gold smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guy: Joss Ackland is easily the series' best villain as
Arjen Rudd, who uses diplomatic immunity to get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable scene: Riggs uses a truck to tear the bad guys'
elevated mansion off its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992)
</P>
<P>
   The good guys: Rene Russo joins Riggs, Murtaugh and Getz as
Lorna Cole, an Internal Affairs cop so tough that her idea of
foreplay is comparing scars with Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guy: Stuart Wilson is the series' weakest villain as
Jack Travis, an ex-cop turned weapons dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable scene: The series' lamest entry starts off with a long
bomb-defusing gag in a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 4'' (1998)
</P>
<P>
   The good guys: Chris Rock joins Riggs, Murtaugh, Getz and Cole
as Lee Butters, a young, gung-ho detective with an unusual fondness
for Murtaugh _ but not for the reasons Murtaugh thinks. They go
after Chinese smugglers/slave traders/counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guy: Asian actor star Jet Li brings back delicious
villainy as Wah Sing Ku, whose martial-arts moves are too much for
Riggs and Murtaugh. Well, almost too much.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable scene: In one of the best chase scenes in years, Riggs
water-skis down a freeway on the underside of a dining-room table.

 &HT;    REPORT SAYS SHARK PROTECTION EFFORTS LAG
 &HT;    For release Monday, July 13
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal efforts to protect endangered sharks in the
Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico are being hampered by a lack of
state regulation, an environmental coalition reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, shark populations in the Atlantic and
Gulf regions have declined by as much as 85 percent. To counter
this trend, the National Marine Fisheries Service five years ago
created a plan to prevent overfishing of sharks in federally
controlled waters.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report, ``Sharks on the Line,'' noted that sharks'
seasonal migration brings them inside the federal three-mile limit,
where they often fall prey to fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juvenile mortality must be reduced to speed the recovery of
large coastal sharks,'' said the report's author, Dr. Merry Camhi,
a staff scientist at the Audubon Society. ``The best way to do this
is to reduce fishing in nursery grounds, which primarily occur in
state waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ellen Pikitch, director of fisheries programs for the
Wildlife Conservation Society, said that ``even if all fishing of
large coastal sharks were to cease, recovery could take decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Ocean Wildlife Campaign ranked Florida, which
has by far the most active commercial shark fishery in the region,
first among 18 states for responsible management of the shark
catch.
</P>
<P>
   But it recommended that most states in the region take one or
more of the following steps:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Closing of state waters to shark fishing during federal
closure periods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imposing limits on the number and size of sharks allowed to be
caught.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prohibiting the catching or possession of species protected in
federal waters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Banning finning, the process of cutting the fins off live
sharks and dumping the wounded shark back into the water, where it
dies. The fin is then used in the popular shark fin soup.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Ocean Wildlife Campaign are the National Audubon
Society, the National Coalition for Marine Conservation, the
Natural Resources Defense Council, the Wildlife Conservation
Society and the World Wildlife Fund. The group is supported
financially by the Pew Charitable Trusts.

GETTING ATTACHED TO E-MAIL PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My husband cannot send photos (not dirty ones)
from America Online 4.0 to people with older versions of AOL.
What's up with that?
</P>
<P>
   _ Perfectly Innocent
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INNOCENT: Hey, it's not up to me to judge what's dirty and
what isn't _ as long as I get a copy, purely in the interest of
scholarly research, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   The new AOL software gives you two ways to send pictures. You
can embed photos in the body of your letter or you can attach them
to the E-mail, which is the way most of the world already operates.
If hubby mailed somebody an embedded picture of you dusting the
crystal chandelier, the recipient can only see it if he has AOL 4.0
or a really good imagination.
</P>
<P>
   If the photos are attached as separate files, just about anybody
should be able to see what a great housekeeper you are.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: We have Win95 on our PC. We just purchased a
notebook with Win98 installed. Some games will not load in Win98.
Is this the Evil Empire's way of ensuring we are going to retire
broke and have to eat dog food because we must keep buying new
software?
</P>
<P>
   _ Alpo Gourmet
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GOURMET: It's so easy to sit back and blame Big Bill for
every little thing that goes wrong in your pathetic little life,
isn't it? Bill isn't evil. He's a guy just like you or me who
happened to be in the right place at the right time. Do you think
he can't still feel your pain?
</P>
<P>
   Geez, of course not. What were you possibly thinking? This guy
is worth $51 billion, and you're about as important to him as a
gnat is to an elephant. He could buy you, sell you and forget you
in a heartbeat, and the only thing about our lonely existence he
confirms is that a good haircut must cost $52 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But, just this once, it's probably not his fault. Windows 98
shouldn't make that big a difference when it comes to games. It is,
after all, just a spiffed-up version of Win95. My guess is that
your games have some particular hardware requirements _ most likely
video or memory _ that the notebook just isn't up to.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just bought a refurbished laptop from
somebody for $700. It has Word Perfect and ProComm already loaded.
If this guy can provide software that cheaply, why can't the big
manufacturers do the same and lower prices?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bargain Hunter
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BARGAIN: And I suppose you got certificates of authenticity
and original documentation with all that cheap software? No? I'm so
surprised. Congratulations on your bootlegs. You'll be happy to
know I forwarded your mail to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding! They already had your name and address anyway. As
for the guy you bought the stuff from, sleazebuckets like that
ought to be locked up. You don't steal books from the library or
tapes from Blockbuster. Don't steal from software publishers
either.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My clock keeps perfect time when the PC is on,
but not when it's off. A technician suspects the motherboard is
about to go. Am I being snowed?
</P>
<P>
   _ Complete Novice
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOVICE: Like Aspen in December. Most PC clocks keep time
about as well as what you get at Free Watch Night at the ballgame.
When you turn on the PC, Windows gets the time from the clock, then
takes over timekeeping and does a much better job. You should get a
time synchronization program from someplace like www.tucows.com to
reset your clock any time you're on the Net. You should also go to
Free Bat Night, then have a serious talk with your technician.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lincoln Center Festival '98 has brought the Stuttgart
Ballet back to New York City with the tried and true. After John
Cranko's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' his ``Onegin,'' the company's
signature piece, introduced new dancers in familiar roles at
Lincoln Center's New York State Theater on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In this first of three casts, the Korean dancer Sue Jin Kang as
Tatyana, the heroine in love with Onegin, one of Romantic
literature's well-heeled misfits, proved outstanding in her dancing
and acting.
</P>
<P>
   Cranko's three-act treatment of ``Eugene Onegin,'' the great
Russian narrative poem by Aleksandr Pushkin, took New York by storm
in 1969. The opera-house scale of the ballet, its sumptuous decor
by Jurgen Rose, pretty in its pastels and clever in its oversize
lace curtains, tantalized further with its score. Cranko's 1965
ballet did not turn to music from Tchaikovsky's opera about Onegin
but used a persuasive patchwork of other Tchaikovsky music
effectively arranged and orchestrated by Kurt-Heinz Stolze.
</P>
<P>
   To a public yearning for full-evening dramatic ballets,
``Onegin'' was so seductive that company after company throughout
the world snapped up the work for their own repertory. Oddly, the
Joffrey Ballet, which performed Cranko's ``Romeo'' and ``The Taming
of the Shrew'' did not. ``Onegin'' was last seen in New York in
1993, when the Bavarian National Ballet from Munich offered Kirill
Melnikov's sensational and revealing performance in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   This was a performance imbued with Stanislavskian esthetics,
charting the hero's emotional progression from world-weary snob
full of coldness and formality to an Onegin, physically spent and
disheveled in his powerfully projected passion. Perhaps it took a
Russian (Melnikov was once in the Kirov Ballet) to open up the
role's deeper dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of profundity was missing on Wednesday, although the
cast on view did its visible best to fill in the outlines of
clearly sketched roles. One of the problems after Cranko's death in
1973 was that his ballets were so meticulously accurate in their
details that they began to look preserved in amber.
</P>
<P>
   The current production has new touches. Perhaps in an attempt to
revitalize the action, there are broader flourishes. Certainly
Robert Tewsley, a British dancer most recently seen in the National
Ballet of Canada, gives Lensky, Onegin's friend, an unexpectedly
violent edge. Enraged when Onegin flirts with his fiancee, Olga,
this Lensky is anything but Pushkin's (or Tchaikovsky's) gentle
victim. A stylish dancer who keeps to a clean line in the signature
arabesques of Lensky's solos, Tewsley challenges Onegin to a duel
in a rage that goes over the top. One expected Onegin to be killed,
but of course it is Lensky who is shot by Onegin. In that duel
scene, Cranko offers some of his silliest choreography: Lensky is
caught in a tug of war between Olga and Tatyana or is sandwiched
between the two women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all such lapses when Cranko misfired in his search for
an expressive use of the academic idiom, he was essentially a
classical choreographer with a firm theatrical touch. One can
quarrel with dramatic details: Would the mature Tatyana at the end
really show Onegin the door by pointing her finger after he
realizes his mistake in rejecting her years ago?
</P>
<P>
   This ``Onegin'' is more Cranko than Pushkin, and Ms. Kang's
concentrated performance showed how well she understood her role.
Trained in South Korea and Monte Carlo after winning a top prize at
the Prix de Lausanne competition in 1985, she joined the Stuttgart
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Her toe work is strong and she was fearless in the tosses and
lifts of the duets that Cranko employs to develop Tatyana's
relationship with Onegin. In his most brilliant theatrical device,
Cranko gives physical shape to the famous love letter that the
young Tatyana writes to Onegin. A mirror dance with a double leads
to a fantasy love scene where rapture soars through the
choreography's twists and arching shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoint of this pas de deux is the farewell when
Tatyana, remaining faithful to an elderly husband (Ivan Cavallari),
rejects Onegin in turn. Roland Vogel as Onegin was more than
impressive as a partner and less than persuasive as Onegin.
Cranko's distilled gestures (hand to brow) encouraged him to go
through the motions rather than the emotions of his role.
</P>
<P>
   If he was too refined, Elena Tentschikova's Olga lacked nuance.
But Ms. Kang, progressing from intimidated adolescent to a complex
character, knew how to shade her performance. It was her show.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Kershaw, now with the Pacific Northwest Ballet in
Seattle, was the guest conductor.

SUSPECTED KILLER WANTS TO BURNISH HIS IMAGE, THE POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gary Evans, suspected of killing at least five
people, is worried about his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically said to me, `I don't want to come across as a
monster,''' said James Horton, an investigator for the New York
State Police. ``He's familiar with the (mass murderer) Ted Bundys
of the world. He's well-read. He wants to come across as a career
criminal and this is part of his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime experts say the killings Evans describes don't fit the
profile of the typical serial killer. Rather, they appear to be
acts of a ruthless criminal who feels little remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of his burglary business,'' Horton said. ``And to
facilitate his burglaries and in order not to get arrested, he felt
he needed to kill this or that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, 43, has not been charged with murder. He is in jail on a
probation violation and other charges. But in lengthy conversations
with Horton, Evans has led the police to two bodies and admitted to
three other killings, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is described by investigators as an antiques thief who
killed during robberies or when he needed to eliminate an
associate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the police said they unearthed two pistols in
Albany Rural Cemetery that were used in killings linked to Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The police and acquaintances describe Evans as intelligent and
well-read. He kept such books as ``Madness &AMP; the Macabre'' and had
a videotape collection with ``The Mafia's Greatest Hits,''
suggesting a fascination with the criminal mind.
</P>
<P>
   Evans talks about killing as something occasionally necessary to
maintain his chosen life as a career criminal, Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really finds it distasteful,'' Horton said.
``He finds it a necessary evil. He's somewhat remorseful, but not
overly, because he continued killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a pattern, said Horton, is consistent with the label of
``multiple killer'' not ``serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a serial killer does it more for the thrill of killing
and they have deep-rooted problems that are other than
crime-related,'' Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   N.G. Berrill, a forensic psychologist on the faculty of John Jay
College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said: ``With the real
serial killers, if you will, there really is a type they are going
after and the killing is fulfilling a certain need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The serial killers have a lust for the kill, a desire for a
certain kind of victim,'' Berrill said. ``It often fulfills their
sexual need. That seems to be very different from this guy, who is
just a bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities are continuing in their effort to link
Evans' travels elsewhere to unsolved cases matching his criminal
pattern, most notably killings associated with the theft of
antiques and rare coins, a specialty of his, the investigators say.
The police said Evans has traveled extensively and the search might
eventually take them to all 50 states.

jump rope.
</P>
<P>
   Four Zebras walked away with national titles last week at the
National Jump Rope Championship at Walt Disney World in Orlando,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy McDonald, 13, competing in the 12- to 14-year-old
category, was tops in the single-rope speed jumping competition.
She jumped 302 times in one minute, or about five times a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no trick,'' this no-nonsense champ said. ``I just do it,
but it takes a lot of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the double-dutch (two ropes going in opposite directions)
speed relay, the 11-year-old team of Kalyn Gaston, Brittany
Richardson and Melissa Baird also took the gold. They jumped 590
times in two minutes. They said it has taken four years of practice
and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' they said, almost in unison.
</P>
<P>
   The team of Jena Rhine, Kyla Johnson, Molly Buker and Brandy
McDonald, all 13, took the silver in the double-dutch pairs speed
competition and the bronze medal in the double-dutch pairs
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Harvey (one of five boys on the team), Natalie Deloach and
Brandy McDonald, all 13, won the silver medal in the double-dutch
single freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   This was the team's third trip to the nationals, but it was the
first time any Zebra brought home a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The team started about seven years ago when Trina Griffith, a
rookie physical education teacher at Grandview Elementary School,
had a brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Her kids were doing Jump Rope for Heart, an annual event
sponsored in most schools by the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that the kids could learn the tricks,'' Griffith said.
It was also a sport in which everyone can participate. And so a
team was formed.
</P>
<P>
   From 15 the first year, it has grown to about 70 this year, but
only 21 traveled to Orlando for the national championships, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   How the ZZ Skippers helped raise money for the trip is as
unusual as the sport itself.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser involved 40 life-size pink plastic flamingos and
a scheme that bordered on extortion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, many of the 1,200 people in this quiet
southern Johnson County community awoke to find a herd of 10 pink
plastic flamingos grazing in their front yards.
</P>
<P>
   For any cash donation to the team, the flamingos were removed.
For $25 you could buy ``insurance'' that they wouldn't come back
and the right to send the flamingos to a friend or neighbor of your
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said some people actually felt left out if the
flamingos didn't show up in their yard.
</P>
<P>
   The flamingos raised $3,600.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said jump rope has a camaraderie sometimes lacking in
other events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not cutthroat. Everybody shares tricks,'' she said. It
provides an extensive aerobic workout and the equipment isn't
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   One jump-rope mom, Karen Richardson, said the kids also don't
have to be as tall or strong or fast as they might have to be to
play football or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that the elementary kids can do. They don't
have to wait for middle school to participate in a sport and it
gets them in great shape,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just have a good time,'' said Kay Gaston, another
jump-rope mom. ``They travel all over, make new friends. As a
parent, this is one of the best organizations I've ever had my kids
involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids said the travel is one of the best things about it.
</P>
<P>
   They've attended tournaments all over Texas and traveled to New
Orleans and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said they are also ]one of seven All Star Demonstration
Teams in Texas for the American Heart Association's Jump Rope for
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   They average about 40 performances a year at schools, churches,
civic clubs, parades and festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even do family reunions,'' Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, they plan to go back to the nationals, providing they
can raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said she has a garage full of pink plastic flamingos
that might be some help.

HITS AND MYTHS: WHAT GETS ON TV _ AND STAYS THERE _ IS ANYBODY'S
GUESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hits and flops come and go with such regularity in the
television industry that they are mostly taken for granted. To
better understand why is to know that only 27 of the 128 new
prime-time programs ordered by the major networks over the past
four seasons were welcomed back. And seven of those switched
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Call this the throw-mud-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks way
of doing business _ which I'm sure punches holes in your theory
that sane reasoning was behind, say, UPN's decision to unearth
``Love Boat: The Next Generation'' from its watery depths.
</P>
<P>
   Even with millions of dollars at stake in the production,
promotion and airing of series programming, snagging a hit these
days appears to be about that simple and _ let's be candid _
senseless.
</P>
<P>
   The network executives know it, the show producers sense it, the
actors deny it and, unfortunately, viewers experience it. When one
series fails, another like it merely emerges to happily take its
place, continuing a cycle that hinges on a viewer's short-term
memory.
</P>
<P>
   This appears to be the sentiment as the networks showcase their
rookie stock for the 1998-'99 season to the nation's TV press over
the next three hype-filled weeks. Before us: 37 new series, many
cloned and clunky, carrying unwanted buzz or having little or no
buzz to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, a giddy WB will arrive with ``Felicity,'' a promising
drama about an introspective coed (Keri Russell) who'll remind you
of a collegiate Ally McBeal. And the 38-minute tape provided on the
WB drama ``Hyperion'' (with a surprisingly effective Mark-Paul
Gosselaar of ``Saved by the Bell'') caught my interest, believe it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, the pickings I've viewed are so thin it's
troubling. NBC, the No. 1 network in terms of viewership, offers
Nathan Lane and his ``Encore! Encore!,'' a sitcom from the
``Frasier'' creators, who have pretty much ripped off themselves.
High-brow humor will fly as Lane plays a snobby opera singer
returning home to live with his low-brow family.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Olin, back for more abuse after ``EZ Streets,'' will pitch
hard for ``L.A. Docs'' on CBS, which is an ``L.A. Law'' with
stethoscopes, while in ``The Kings of Queens,'' Kevin James
(''Everybody Loves Raymond'') plays yet another pudgy working-class
stiff having to deal with a live-in interruption of his
testosterone activities. (The networks continue to look for the
next ``Roseanne.)''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from ABC's decision to remake ``Fantasy Island'' (this one
with Malcolm McDowell as Mr. Roarke) nothing is more bothersome
than CBS' green light to clone another ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any other, the ``60 Minutes'' move represents the
nervousness among programmers these days as they try to figure out
how to lure viewers back into the fold. CBS basically was forced to
keep pace with NBC, which now has ``Dateline NBC'' stretched over
five nights; ABC, which has combined ``PrimeTime Live'' with
``20/20''; and even CNN, which has just launched three newsmags.
</P>
<P>
   With profits high and ratings better than sitcoms or dramas
appearing in the same time period, the seven-night-a-week
newsmagazine might not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Hit series are becoming harder to find as audiences
continue to give more time to nontraditional channels like Comedy
Central (''South Park'') and even mininetworks like The WB, whose
savvy, aggressive style in creating shows like ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' has made it a serious contender to
knock off Fox as the hip programmer of choice for the highly
coveted young viewer.
</P>
<P>
   (Talk among the critics is that it has already replaced Fox as
the network of choice when it comes to attending its evening
entertainment events; stars AND poolside dancing!)
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? According to Nielsen numbers, the network share
of prime-time audience since 1994 has fallen from 68 percent to a
projected 58 percent. This is significant because it's the first
time the networks have controlled less than 60 percent of the
available audience.
</P>
<P>
   And cable smells blood. Having already made TV movies look
laughably amateurish by comparison (except for the consistently
stellar ``Hallmark Hall of Fame'' or ``Oprah Winfrey Presents ...''
franchises), HBO and Showtime are now attacking with some half-hour
and hour series high in quality and risk-taking subject matter. On
Aug. 1, Showtime will offer ``Lincs,'' a black-cast comedy starring
Pam Grier, and ``Rude Awakenings,'' with Sherilyn Fenn.
</P>
<P>
   Since USA silenced skeptics with its thoughtful version of the
feature film ``La Femme Nikita,'' talk is increasing on how it will
handle ``The Net,'' a takeoff of the Sandra Bullock film about a
woman fighting to win back the identity stolen from her via
technology. It begins July 19. Even Lifetime leaps into the mix
with three original series in August.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few weeks, the networks will trot out a range of
stars. Some are spinning off from longtime shows (''Murphy
Brown's'' Faith Ford as a new single in CBS' ``Maggie Winters'').
Some are returning to television (Shannen Doherty as a modern-day
witch in The WB's ``Charmed''). Others show up after coming up
empty on the big screen (Moira Kelly of the romantic comedy drama
``To Have and to Hold'' on CBS).
</P>
<P>
   That audiences have traditionally been unfazed by big names (Ted
Danson's sitcom crashed and burned, as did shows headed by Gregory
Hines and Danny Aiello), perhaps the key is the material
surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on a talent pool sucked dry. Not only are casts being
stocked with second-rate performers, but second-rate writers are
doling out the lines. No wonder we're witnessing more newsmagazines
and reality shows like ``World's Scariest Police Chases.'' They
attract ratings and make money.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of programming continues to rise. ``ER'' set a new
standard for the cost of a regular series at $13 million an
episode. This season, Helen Hunt (who probably won't appear at the
press tour; she doesn't need the ink) and co-star Paul Reiser (who
probably will make an appearance; he needs the ink) will pocket $1
million for each episode of NBC's ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it supply and demand, not to mention being in the right
place at the right time. Needing to secure the veteran show after
losing ``Seinfeld,'' NBC negotiated with Hunt shortly before her
Oscar win for ``As Good as It Gets.'' Not a bad deal for stars of a
series that failed to crack the Nielsen top 30, finishing behind
``Hiller and Diller'' and ``Soul Man,'' both ABC casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's the simple, senseless world of network television. Pay
first and think second. Who knows? Something might stick.

MOM'S AND DAD'S EASY-PC ADVENTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Personal computers are a lot easier to set up and use than they
used to be, according to the monolithic industry that builds and
sells them. But as anyone without a degree in computer science will
tell you, they're not easy enough.
</P>
<P>
   In order to use a PC so it becomes a pleasure rather than a
hassle, users still need to know the basics of how it works. For
example, they must understand the concepts of where files are
stored in order to be able to retrieve something downloaded from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers say their current crop of machines, combined
with Microsoft's new Windows 98 operating system, is easier to use
than ever. I decided to put that to the test, but I needed some
help. I've set up and tested so many PCs that it's hard for me to
really know what novices will think. I needed a newbie's
perspective; so I called upon two people who have helped me out
time and again throughout my life: dear old mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   My parents are not completely computer illiterate, but they're
close. They've had a hand-me-down PC that uses an older 80486 chip
for about 18 months. They know how to turn it on, get onto the
Internet via America Online, send e-mail to family members, play a
few simple games and browse through CD-ROM-based encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many novice users, they don't understand the plumbing
of the Windows 95 file system. They don't snap to the difference
between America Online's content and that of the Internet. When I
tell them to launch the AOL browser, they say, ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   They aren't dumb. It's just that the vagaries of the personal
computer are not second nature to them, which is the case with many
who have not grown up with PCs omnipresent in the home and
workplace. They don't want to know how the damn thing works _ they
just want it to work, period, and be easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. agreed to be the technology guinea pig in
a little experiment with my parents. The Houston company just
launched a new line of consumer PCs, which the company claims is
its friendliest yet, with pushbuttons on the keyboard for launching
Internet services and favorite programs. The Presarios come with
software that makes it easy to download updated drivers and other
software for keeping the PC in top shape.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is loaning them one of these machines for about a month.
They are trying out a Presario 2254, the lowest-end system, and a
14-inch MV400 monitor. I took the system to their home in Corpus
Christi over the Fourth of July weekend and watched as they set it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, not ``they,'' but he. My mother had no interest
in assembling the thing. Now, my father, who is in his late 60s, is
as mechanically inclined as they come. I remember watching him
restore a Triumph TR3 sports car when I was a child, and the week
before I drove down there he designed and built an all-wood patio
cover over his back porch.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted being intimidated about setting up a new PC,
just because it was a computer. ``I'm always intimidated by
something I'm not in complete control of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2254, which sells for just $899, is aimed at novice users
who don't want to spend a lot of money on a system, but don't want
to be stuck with a slow, out-of-date machine. It is not fancy, but
it's more than adequate, with a 233-megahertz Advanced Micro
Devices K6 processor; 32 megabytes of memory; a four-gigabyte hard
drive; a 56K fax modem; and a 64-bit 3-D graphics card. It comes in
a desktop, rather than a mini-tower case.
</P>
<P>
   As with most consumer PCs, it comes with a poster that uses
pictures to show how the PC should be assembled. Also, most of the
connections that need to be made are color-coded _ for example, the
green keyboard plug goes into a socket on the back of the unit
that's rimmed in green. Both of these features were a great help to
my father.
</P>
<P>
   But there were three points at which his progress came to a dead
halt. If I had not been there, he would have given up and called
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved hardware. The speakers that come with the
monitor must be joined together, and then connected to the back of
the PC. The poster just showed the cable from one speaker linking
with the other, but didn't show the connections, which are standard
RCA male-female stereo jacks. My father's not into stereo systems,
so he didn't recognize the plugs, and relying on the poster left
him baffled.
</P>
<P>
   The second snag came when he installed the drivers for his
printer. Windows 95's setup routine wanted to look in a particular
folder on the hard drive where other drivers are kept. My father
kept clicking on the OK button, only to be told the driver couldn't
be found.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't realize that you had to tell Windows to look in a
different place _ the floppy drive, which is A: _ to find the disk
he'd just inserted. Although he's used that 80486 machine for some
time, he's seldom had to use the floppy, and it didn't occur to him
from what he saw on the screen that he needed to direct Windows'
attention to it. He also didn't know that it's drive A:. I suspect
a lot of novices get stuck at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The final problem involved America Online's software, which came
with an old list of modems that did not include the high-speed, new
Presario model. We could not get the modem to connect to the
high-speed dialup number in Corpus Christi for AOL, and had to fall
back to a lowly 14.4K line just to connect. Once we signed on, AOL
downloaded a set of updated modem information and the software then
worked as it should. But again, if I had not been there, my parents
would have had to suffer with AOL's tech support line before
figuring out to fall back to the slower dialup number.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the real test, with the machine in place. My parents
will live with this system for a month, and I'll report back on how
they did. I figure letting them use a system designed for novices
is the ultimate test of any PC's user-friendliness.

   &UR; TAXING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charm School for the IRS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A bill to rework the IRS cleared Congress by an overwhelming
vote. It aims to reduce the fear that the agency strikes in the
hearts of taxpayers and to increase the help it gives to citizens
on the complex tax code. The bill, which President Clinton said he
would speedily sign, also strengthens the role of a taxpayer
advocate. The small number of people who get into serious disputes
with the agency receive new rights and protections, and the burden
of proof will fall on the agency, instead of on the taxpayer. And
the bill has something even for those people already on good terms
with the IRS: It reduces to 12 months, from 18 months, the time
that investors must hold stocks, bonds and other assets to qualify
for the lowest capital gains tax rate, which is 20 percent for most
people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAVING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Einstein Bond &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The government is bringing out savings bonds linked to the
inflation rate. The bonds have denominations ranging from $50 to
$10,000, and bear the likenesses of heroes including Helen Keller,
Martin Luther King Jr. and Albert Einstein. The Clinton
administration hopes that the 30-year bonds, the first of which go
on sale in September, will appeal to small investors saving for
college costs or retirement. Like other saving bonds, they offer
special tax benefits. As long as investors hold the bonds, they may
defer paying taxes on their earnings, which are reinvested and
added to the principal. If the bond is redeemed to pay for college
tuition, investors may exclude part or all of the interest in
calculating their income taxes. About one in three households own
savings bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MEDIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Era at New Yorker &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, the editor who transformed The New Yorker, for
better or worse, is leaving to work at a new venture owned by
Disney's Miramax films unit. The new venture puts her in
collaboration with Harvey Weinstein, right, a co-chairman of
Miramax, and Ron Galotti, center, who quit as publisher of
Vogue.The idea is to invent a magazine from scratch to dig up the
kind of articles that might be turned into movies and television
specials. An editor with a flair for show business, Ms. Brown
transformed The New Yorker from a venerated icon that some said was
verging on irrelevance into a kind of news magazine of the power
elite. It won awards and new readers during her six years at the
helm, but lost money for the publisher, Conde Nast. But S.I.
Newhouse Jr., the owner, ruled out major changes, and said he would
pick an editor who would make him both ``comfortable and excited.''
Whomever that may be, the days when The New Yorker was famous for
high-quality literary journalism and humor, mixed with sometimes
seemingly endless articles on obscure topics, may be long gone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ACCESSORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Southern Style &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue, another New York landmark, is getting a
Southern owner, Proffitt's Inc., which is paying a hefty $2.1
billion for the 96-store chain. Proffitt's itself runs 234 stores
that serve middle-income shoppers in the South and Midwest, at the
Proffitt's, Younkers, Carson Pirie Scott and Herberger's chains.
The company will change its name to Saks Inc., to win some of the
glamour and air of fashion savvy of the acquired chain, which
carries goods by Gucci, de la Renta and Saint Laurent. Through
acquisition, Proffitt's has built itself into the fourth-largest
department store company in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIABILITY I &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Accord on Breast Implants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning agreed to pay $3.2 billion to settle tens of
thousands of claims of injury from silicone breast implants. The
tentative agreement would end a legal battle of nearly a decade and
let the plaintiffs receive money as early as next year. It would
also enable Dow Corning to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. But
the agreement leaves unresolved the dispute over the extent of harm
from silicone implants. Dow Corning, supported by a growing body of
research, has denied throughout the battle that implants cause
systemic illness like autoimmune disorders. One of the plaintiffs,
Peggy Pardo, said Dow Corning would get on with business, and the
women would get on with their lives, but ``a lot of them have been
destroyed.'' Upwards of a million American women received implants
in the 1970s and 1980s. The manufacturers, besieged by lawsuits,
had agreed in 1993 to settle all litigation with a payout of $4
billion, but that deal fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIABILITY II &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No Lid on Damages &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A move in Congress to limit big jury awards for injuries caused
by faulty products suffered defeat, leaving the issue stuck again
in the legislative wilderness, perhaps for years. Republicans
backed the measure but failed to win the 60 votes needed in the
Senate to end a filibuster. The bill would have provided nationwide
standards including broad immunity for retailers and wholesalers
and would have limited punitive damages for small companies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SNEAKERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `Shaq Attack' Falls Short &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Reebok and its rivals are beginning to back away from costly
dependence on stars to deliver the buzz to lift sales. Reebok and
Nike have reported quarterly losses, and Reebok canceled its $3
million-a-year marketing deal with 7-foot-1 Shaquille O'Neal, whose
Shaq Attack sneaker failed to deliver what Reebok counted on.
``Even Dennis Rodman didn't work for Converse,'' said Bob Williams,
whose company, Burns Sports, matches athletes and advertisers. Many
teen-agers have turned to casual footwear by the likes of Doc
Martens and Timberland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE INTERNET &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stratospheric Stocks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Internet companies, Yahoo actually makes a small
profit, and that has sent its stock to stratospheric levels. The
tiny company runs the most popular sites on the World Wide Web, and
after reporting higher earnings last week, its market value shot up
to nearly $9 billion _ yes, that's billion. And Amazon.com, the
money-losing online bookstore, is valued at $5.3 billion, more than
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders Group combined.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMIC MEDICINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Russia Wants Another Dose &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Internet can rescue Russia if the IMF cannot.
Russia's economy is plenty sick, and the patient and doctor are
bickering. The Russians say they need $10 billion to $15 billion
from the lenders, and some investment bankers say it really needs
$20 billion. But the IMF is short of cash after gigantic bailouts
of Asian countries. The fund is indicating that it may come up with
only $5.6 billion and is putting pressure on Russia to straighten
out the mess on its own. President Boris Yeltsin has urged
Parliament to adopt an ambitious plan to cut the budget deficit,
but the fund wants much more. It also insists that Russia pass a
new tax code, tighten bank rules and end a system in which wages go
unpaid, tax debts accumulate and companies do business in barter.
In another distressing note, Russia was again unable to find a
buyer for the state oil company, Rosneft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EURO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Slowpokes Zoom Ahead &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As Europe races to adopt a single currency, Spain, Portugal and
Ireland are growing much faster than bigger and wealthier countries
like France and Germany. The smaller economies have become magnets
for foreign money, and jobs are being created. Ireland's economy is
booming, with growth of more than 8 percent this year. It is even
experiencing labor shortages.

TRUTH-TELLER: FROM `UNZIPPED' TO `NAOMI' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
(lh) 
 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sweet'' might not be the first word that comes to mind to
describe Naomi Campbell, the famously petulant celebrity model and
the star of Douglas Keeve's new fashion documentary, ``Naomi
Conquers South Africa,'' to be broadcast on VH-1 next Saturday. But
sweet she is, at least at the instant she is glimpsed in the movie
in her limousine en route to a meeting with President Nelson
Mandela. The meeting is clearly a high point of her trip, which is
a cash-raising mission for Mandela's Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In those few seconds in the car, Ms. Campbell sheds her
customary hauteur. ``We're going to see Granddaddy; I hope
Granddaddy is happy to see me,'' she says blithely of Mandela, who
had named her his honorary granddaughter. But the quaver in her
voice and her restless puffing on a cigarette betray a serious case
of jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Keeve, the director of the 1995 documentary ``Unzipped,'' about
designer Isaac Mizrahi, is enough of a professional to know when
he's mined cinematic gold. ``I love that moment with Naomi,'' he
said. ``She is very nervous and sort of regal at the same time.
There is a little girl in her that kind of squeals, and on top of
that, there is always the classy diva. The way she smokes drives me
crazy. She's like a cat with no self-consciousness at all _ it's
beautiful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four years as a filmmaker, Keeve, a former fashion
photographer, has turned his director's penchant for voyeurism into
a flair for comedic truth-telling. ``Douglas has a way of peering
beneath fashion's skirts _ and that can be very enticing stuff,''
said Gabe Doppelt, the VH-1 producer who commissioned Keeve's
latest project, framed as a romp with distinctly melancholy
undertones.
</P>
<P>
   His films do display a brute honesty that is rare in a business
propped on illusion. And his rogue's gift for glorifying fashion
and simultaneously sending it up has a way of discomfiting even his
staunchest supporters. ``To be quite frank,'' Ms. Doppelt said,
only half in jest, ``I'd never let Douglas near me with a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that Keeve would be just as loath to turn that
camera on himself. Moody, slow-talking and a shade suspicious, the
director, who is 40, is his own most stringent censor. He is
typically tight-lipped, whether he's talking about movies (``I
hated `Boogie Nights' _ do we have to say that?'' he said), or the
four-year hiatus between ``Unzipped'' and his current project.
After the Mizrahi film, which shared the award for the best
documentary at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival, Hollywood came
courting. In no time at all, Keeve said, he found himself working
on a romantic comedy, ``Inconvenient,'' a venture by Trimark Films
that was to star Rob Schneider, Janeane Garofalo and Lisa Kudrow.
It collapsed after Keeve resigned, he said, over creative
differences. A series of subsequent features also faltered or
simply failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were pigeonholing him a little too soon,'' said Michael
Kostigan, the senior vice president of production at Columbia
Pictures. ``They were offering him the obvious kinds of scripts
about the modeling world, but the kinds of things he wanted to do
he wasn't getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeve chalked up his misfortunes to his lack of experience as a
commercial filmmaker. ``I was new to Hollywood and very eager, and
I think I got attached to the wrong projects,'' he said. ``When you
move from one world to another, there are bound to be a few
bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Lured back by Ms. Doppelt to more familiar turf, Keeve leaped at
the chance to follow Ms. Campbell last February to Cape Town, where
she was scheduled to organize a benefit fashion-show tribute to
Gianni Versace. The film is part of a documentary series on VH-1
called ``Fashion Kingdom.'' He brought a renewed zest to the
project, relentlessly tracking his subjects: Ms. Campbell; her
co-stars, Christy Turlington, Kate Moss and Amber Valetta, and an
entourage of some 30 other models, on and off the runway.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming, Keeve thought nothing of invading the
models' privacy, poking his lens around corners, down corridors,
into bedrooms and baths, sometimes encountering a thorny hostility
that was more than he had bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   On one such explosive occasion while filming additional footage
recently in Los Angeles, Keeve pointed his camera at Ms. Campbell
as she came bounding backstage just in time to appear as a guest on
the Magic Johnson television talk show. ``She was extremely late,
and when she saw that I had started shooting, she came rushing up
and smacked the camera,'' Keeve recalled. ``I was shocked, but I
wasn't offended. When Naomi is angry, it pops out. I think that's
how she stays healthy. Most of her feelings are right on the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Bent on penetrating that surface, Keeve hung in, meeting his
subjects' initial resistance with a steely tenacity of his own.
``He's a provocateur,'' said Nina Santisi, Mizrahi's right hand and
a co-producer of ``Unzipped.'' ``He will probe until people reveal
something. And he'll keep the camera going day and night, over the
models' protests.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeve said: ``I'm the director, so when people tell me to do
things, I don't listen. There was a lot of door-slamming on this
project. Sometimes I'd put my foot in the door, and sometimes I
wouldn't be quick enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was swift, however, to pry his way into the hotel spa in Cape
Town, catching Ms. Campbell in the midst of a therapeutic salt
scrub. Stretched flat on her back, clad in nothing but a towel and
a shower cap, she looked utterly vulnerable, submitting to a brisk
massage while she rehearsed the next day's program. ```I have a
dream' _ that's the introduction,'' she was explaining languidly,
when a jet of ice water cut her short, causing her to squeal like a
baby.
</P>
<P>
   He also succeeded in capturing Ms. Campbell's lofty air of
entitlement mixed with incredulity, when Simon, a rich young South
African who had befriended the troupe, presented her in a jewelry
store with an outrageously expensive diamond necklace. Keeve kept
close watch as the otherwise worldly Ms. Campbell wandered dazedly
out of the shop, pleading: ``Let's get an ice cream. I need
something _ I'm in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeve brings to such moments a curious mix of affection and
censoriousness. ``I'm always judgmental, every second,'' he said.
``When you make a documentary, you are never a fly on the wall as
much as you are a hideous predator.'' He was enough of a cynic to
let Ms. Campbell wax on about Mandela's bravery (he subsisted in
prison on a diet of insects) and then to pan to her tapering
fingers as she reached for a large box of chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not he is an unabashed fan, letting his
camera limn his subject's curves or rest on her face to register
the smallest flicker of emotion. In perhaps the film's most
touching scene, Keeve homed in as Ms. Campbell picked up a hankie
and mopped Mandela's brow. A few seconds later, in front of the
crowd that had gathered at the president's mansion, she embraced
her idol as tears ran unchecked down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes of haunting intimacy contrast sharply with the
moment in ``Unzipped'' when the director hovers a little too close
to Cindy Crawford, prompting the model to chide, ``Hellooo, my
pores are not that small.'' These days even his balkiest subjects
eventually submit to his scrutiny. ``People learn to trust him,''
said William DeVizia, who headed the film's production team. ``I'm
amazed that in this genre he has that kind of access.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeve claimed it is his bumbling technique that puts his
subjects at ease. ``I'm an amateur,'' he said. ``I keep things very
folksy and low-tech. I'm not steady with the camera. I'm too busy
making sure that I don't trip over something.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was quick to concede that he is also a canny manipulator,
well versed in the fine art of flattery. ``I told Naomi that if she
did this movie, it would make her a legend,'' he said with a laugh.
``Did she believe it? Not for a minute. But I think she liked
hearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I think at a certain point people just get tired of
lying,'' he continued. ``Naomi is a member of a world whose only
constant is change. And I think she recognized that here was a
chance to do something that transcends all of fashion's ephemeral
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeve hopes his future projects will combine his taste for the
racy and the ridiculous. He describes the feature-length film he
has been writing for the last three years as ``a cautionary tale
about male models, sort of a `Valley of the Dolls' meets `Leaving
Las Vegas.''' Recently, Keeve, said he agreed to work on a
documentary about the pornography industry. ``I'm well suited to
that,'' he said. ``There are similarities between the world of
fashion and the world of porn. Both are small subcultures. Both
have interesting, dynamic kinds of people in them. And both are a
little bit taboo _ I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeve, who thinks of himself first and foremost as an
entertainer, maintained that exploring forbidden worlds sometimes
goes against his grain. ``It's not my nature to follow people round
with a camera and invade their lives, but at the same time, it's so
fascinating,'' he said. ``I'm curious. I don't understand the way
people operate. I'm always baffled by the way they act. But I'm
hoping at some point maybe the camera will figure it out.''

FIGS: LIKE HAVING A BACKYARD MEDITERRANEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
 (bl)  
 By LEE REICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Each year, about the middle of September, I take a trip to the
south of France, and this year I'm planning one for July, too.
 &HT;    These are not real journeys, but imaginary ones, in which I am
carried aloft by the taste of figs I pick from my own trees. The
experience of biting into a store-bought fig, dried or fresh, pales
beside that of savoring the truly ripe fruit, which doesn't travel
well much farther than arm's length. No, I don't garden in
California or the Deep South, but in the Hudson Valley, where
winter temperatures regularly drop to 20 degrees below zero.
 &HT;    The fig, Ficus carica, is native to the sunny, hot summers and
mild winters of the Mediterranean, but it is adaptable, and can be
grown well beyond its native haunts. Although a fig tree can grow
quite large in Mediterranean climates, it is easily coaxed into
becoming a more easily protected bush or small tree. Even the roots
do not mind being pruned or cramped.
 &HT;    The fig's unique fruiting habit also lends itself to northern
growing. Some varieties, such as Flanders, King and Verte, bear
what is known as a breba crop, ripening in summer on the older
parts of the previous year's stems. Other varieties _ Brown Turkey,
Celeste and Magnolia, for example _ bear mostly a ``main crop,'' in
late summer and on into fall, on currently growing shoots. And then
there are Conadria, Petite Negri and Negronne, which bear both ways
and yield two crops each season.
 &HT;    To grow figs in the North, you must protect the branches from
cold and match the variety to the length of the growing season and
the protection offered.
 &HT;    For instance, a short growing season or a desire for summer figs
means growing a variety that yields a heavy breba crop, and making
sure branches do not suffer any winter damage.
 &HT;    Main crop varieties can have their stems cut back as much as a
half by the grower or by winter cold and will still ripen fruit if
the season is sufficiently long. Except in the far North, the
growing season is long enough for at least the beginnings of main
crops to ripen, so depending on protection and variety, you can
plan for summer and/or fall crops.
 &HT;    One way to protect fig stems in winter is to bury them. I
remember a large tree that grew in Wisconsin and each year ripened
hundreds of figs. It had a trunk about six inches in diameter and
grew in a chest-high trench into which it was bent each fall. Old
doors were laid on top of the trench, then leaves piled on high.
Each spring, the tree was uncovered and the trunk hoisted up with
pulleys. With ground temperatures a few feet deep over much of this
country hovering year-round at about 50 degrees, it is easy to see
how such a tree could survive Wisconsin winters.
 &HT;    Fig branches are cold-hardy to about 15 degrees, so a shallow
trench often suffices, or even just laying the stems on top of the
ground before covering them. One trick to make it easier to bend a
fig to the ground is to grow it like a shrub, keeping only young,
supple stems. To do this, in late autumn, cut away any stems that
are two years old (or older, if plants have never been pruned like
this).
 &HT;    Leave them full length for breba crops; shorten them by a third
for main crops. Forcing a spade into the ground near the trunk to
cut the roots on one side of the plant makes it easier to bend the
whole top to the ground in the opposite direction. Once the plant
is down, keep it there with cinder blocks or ropes pegged to the
ground. Then cover it with leaves or straw, and a sheet of plastic
or other waterproof material. Keeping the branches drier lessens
the chance of rot.
 &HT;    A fig can be left upright and protected if it is a main crop
variety or if winter temperatures dip no lower than about zero
degrees. In late autumn, draw the stems together and tie them, then
surround them with a cylinder of chicken wire or fencing. Pack this
cage full of dry leaves or straw and cap it with a bucket or
something else to shed water.
 &HT;    But there's another way. I protect my fig trees by growing them
in large pots that I trundle down to my cool basement early each
winter. Being subtropical rather than tropical plants, figs enjoy
this brief winter rest, ideally between 25 and 45 degrees. An
unheated foyer or garage might also provide the right temperature
range. While resting, the tree is leafless, so it needs no light
and only enough water to keep the soil from going bone dry.
 &HT;    My older fig _ 10 years old, five feet high and in a 10-gallon
container _ is the variety Brown Turkey. Late each autumn, I tip it
out of its pot and shave back the root ball by a couple of inches
so that I can give it fresh potting soil. I also cut back the stems
by about a third to make it easier to maneuver the plant through
doorways to the basement, and to stimulate a modest amount of new
growth for the next year's crop.
 &HT;    My younger fig, the variety Verte, gets similar treatment,
except that I leave a few stems full length. These will bear pale
green fruit, syrupy sweet and strawberry-colored within _ the fuel
for my midsummer ``voyage'' to the Mediterranean.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fig plants are available by mail from Edible Landscaping, P.O.
Box 77, Afton, Va. 22920; (804) 361-9134, and from Raintree
Nursery, 391 Butts Road, Morton, Wash. 98356; (360) 496-6400. Both
offer free catalogs.

 &HT;    THIS WEEK: HELP GRAY PLANTS; CHASE LEAF-EATERS
 &HT;    By PATRICIA JONAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   High rainfall and humidity have taken a toll on gray plants.
Woody subshrubs like lavender and lavender cotton (Santolina
chamaecyparissus) may need reshaping. Doing it now will give new
growth time to harden off. Lamb's ear is especially susceptible to
foliar diseases: remove individual dead or rotting leaves and cut
out rotted sections.
</P>
<P>
   Cut back yarrow and perennial salvia to lateral buds for repeat
flowering. Shear spiderwort to the ground if disheveled and no
longer blooming _ it will produce new foliage within a month. Stop
pinching fall bloomers like chrysanthemum, aster and sedum.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf skeletonizers like Japanese beetles and two-banded Japanese
weevils are feeding. Hand-picking is safer for beneficial insects
and birds than chemical controls. Sweep up large populations with a
hand-held vacuum and dump in soapy water.

CHRYSLER STILL HAS LOCK ON MINIVAN MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-CARAVAN-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If that toy-store chain hadn't already claimed all variations of
the ``'R' Us'' name, Chrysler Corp. could advertise itself as
``Minivans 'R' Us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after reviving the minivan concept begun in the
1950s by the Volkswagen bus Chrysler still owns a virtual lock on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason, too. The company's bread-and-butter
vehicles, which singlehandedly have kept Chrysler in financial
black ink since the mid-80s, come in such a wide variety and price
range that it's hard for any one competitor to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there aren't other good minivans on the
market, and that there aren't some better vans. There are. But no
other manufacturer provides such a choice for consumers, from the
most basic and least-expensive models to the luxurious ones like
this week's test drive _ the 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan ES.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Caravan is a stretch version of the basic Chrysler
minivans (Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager), 13.3 inches longer
than the short ones. Most of that extra length is in the cargo
compartment, which gives families a bit more luggage space for
vacations and hauling the kids' soccer-team gear around town.
</P>
<P>
   Our Grand Caravan ES was about as luxurious as a minivan can get
without leather seats (those are available on the fancier Chrysler
Town &AMP; Country models). New for 1998 were such features as a
pumped-up 3.8-liter V-6 engine ($335 extra) rated at 180 horsepower
and 240 foot-pounds of torque and the optional automatic headlights
and self-dimming driver's side mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler was the first minivan builder to offer dual rear
sliding doors, a great convenience that allows loading and
unloading the kids from the driver's side. This was such a novel
idea that we kept forgetting our test vehicle had the left-side
door, so we mostly used the traditional curbside door for rear
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The ES model is basically the top-of-the-line LE model with a
special package of extras ($1,155) that included body-color
exterior trim, a heavy-load/firm-ride suspension, fog lights and
gold-colored forged-aluminum wheels. Base price is $26,605 plus
$580 transportation, but with all the options ours maxed out at
$29,325, about $10,000 higher than the average sales price for a
Dodge or Plymouth minivan. The price included a built-in $1,190
options discount, which more than paid for the ES package.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic headlights and self-dimming outside mirror were
part of a separate $1,765 package that also included self-dimming
inside mirror, dual front and rear air-conditioning, eight-way
power driver's seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a
windshield-wiper de-icing system.
</P>
<P>
   Although our test car came with the heavy-duty suspension _
designed for a whole vanload of people and cargo _ the ride was
still very sedanlike. The interior is much more quiet than one
would expect in a minivan (the kids provide most of the noise) and
the seats are very comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Ours came with seating for seven passengers, with two buckets up
front, a two-person center bench with two integrated child-safety
seats ($225), and a three-person rear bench. Because of storage
areas on each side of the third seat, there is not as much room as
in the rear seat of some competitors such as the Ford Windstar, so
the seat is better suited to three kids than three adults.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtfulness abounds throughout the Grand Caravan. It's easy
to tell that Chrysler has listened to its customers and designed
these vehicles with the users in mind. Cupholders are the
self-adjusting, ratcheting type that adjust to small juice boxes or
large coffee mugs and there are enough for everybody. They are
mounted so that they remain in place when the middle seats are
lifted to allow passengers into the rear, another thoughtful
feature.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite amenities in the Caravan is the hooks for
plastic grocery bags built into the back of the third seat. This is
a great idea that helps keep groceries from spilling all over the
cargo compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility is outstanding from every seating position thanks to
all the glass. And, even though the interior is as roomy as a big
box, the Caravan's exterior has a smooth, sleek style that carries
a remarkable 0.35 coefficient of drag _ which means it glides
through the air with a minimum of wind resistance. That's quite a
feat for a minivan and it helps keep the fuel economy manageable at
17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Although minivans are a long way from sports cars, the
180-horsepower engine moves the Grand Caravan along at speeds high
enough to attract speed cops and there is more than enough power
for routine passing and freeway merges. This is the most powerful
engine available in a Chrysler minivan; the others are four- and
six-cylinder models ranging from 150 to 158 horsepower (which still
is adequate for most situations).
</P>
<P>
   Trailer-towing is limited to 2,000 pounds without a special
upgrade, which raises the weight limit to 3,500 pounds. These
weight limits apply to all engines but the base four-cylinder,
which can handle only up to a 1,000-pound trailer. But I would
recommend the 3.8-liter engine if you need to pull trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Standard amenities included power windows, power door locks with
remote control, power rack-and-pinion steering, antilock brakes,
rear wiper and washer, air-conditioning stainless-steel exhaust
system, overhead console with trip computer, tilt steering wheel,
cruise control, tachometer, illuminated visor vanity mirrors, and
side-window defoggers.
</P>
<P>
   Other options on our test vehicle included an in-dash 200-watt
AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo, candy-apple-red metallic paint
($200), alarm system ($150), and a roof luggage rack ($175).
</P>
<P>
   The fuel tank holds 20 gallons of gasoline, enough for more than
400 miles between gasoline stops on highway cruises. The kids'
bladders usually won't go that long, though.
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBAN UPDATE: Readers are asking about the pending redesign
of the full-size General Motors sport-utilities, which are due out
next year as 2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   For an idea of how they'll look, just check out the new
full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickups that will go on sale this fall.
As in the past, the Chevy/GMC Suburban and the Chevy Tahoe/GMC
Yukon basically will be identical to the full-size pickups from the
front seat forward.
</P>
<P>
   That means there won't be any radical changes because there is
nothing radical about the new pickups. But,like the pickups, these
vehicles will be more powerful and roomier, and will have better
brakes than the current models or their competitors. Expect to see
them on the market in late August or September 1999.

THE RETURN FRED HARRIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. -- In 1976, he proclaimed with a firm conviction
and an Oklahoma twang that ``The issue is privilege.'' Fred Harris,
the last unabashed populist to run for president, was elected to
the US Senate at 33, then served with folksy energy and enthusiasm
as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. His '76 campaign
was the last one powered by peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he joked, ``the little people'' lacked stools and
stepladders to reach his name on the ballot. He finished fourth in
the New Hampshire primary, fifth in Massachusetts, and his populist
crusade faded away.
</P>
<P>
   At 67, Fred Harris is back in active politics as the new
chairman of the Democratic State Committee of New Mexico, where
he's lived for 20 years. ``I'm still a populist and a
progressive,'' he says. ``I've been working in campaigns but in the
background. I've written a bunch of books, and I've been teaching
and lecturing.''
</P>
<P>
   A professor of political science at the University of New Mexico
in Albuquerque, Harris is resuming a public role because a major
fan, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Martin Chavez, asked him to.
``It's a real coup for the Democratic Party,'' Chavez said. ``When
I'm asked who my heroes are, he's in the top five.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have controlled the governor's office in The
Roundhouse, as the circular state capitol here is known, since
1994, when Governor Gary Johnson benefited from a 10 percent vote
for a Green Party candidate. Democrats suffered defections of 17
and 15 percent to Green Party candidates in special congressional
elections in 1997 and last month. The GOP won both, prompting
Chavez to ask Harris to provide liberal and populist bona fides.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats regard the resurrection of Harris with keen
interest because of the Green Party's threat as a plausible
alternative. ``If that Green Party virus ever catches in
California, I'd be terrified,'' says Bill Carrick, who runs
Democratic campaigns in the nation's largest state. ``We've managed
to keep the minor party candidates from hurting Democrats. The
Libertarian, Reform, and American Independent parties hurt the
Republicans more than the Greens and the Peace and Freedom party
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrick thinks Harris will find it hard to harness working-class
populism with upper-class environmentalism ``because people who
want jobs are always skeptical of people who favor trees over
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if ``the issue is privilege,'' don't most
environmentalists live in a privileged class? ``That's absolutely
true,'' Harris replies, but adds that populists and
environmentalists ``ought to have the same goals. First, cleaning
up the environment makes jobs, as President Clinton and Vice
President Gore have shown. Secondly, it's really working-class and
poor neighborhoods that are the most polluted. I see this as a
progressive issue, although there is a special appeal on
environmental issues to people with higher levels of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Education is the major issue of privilege today, Harris argues.
``It means support for schools, rather than vouchers that take away
money from public schools,'' he says. ``The present governor has
been a Mr. No, vetoing things like computers in the classroom and
all sorts of social programs. Marty Chavez is a person who will say
yes to education.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris describes Chavez, a former mayor of Albuquerque, as
``smart and right on the issues. I think he's going to win.
Republicans who succeed must carry Albuquerque, and we've got a man
who can prevent that.'' Chavez gushes: ``It's like we were playing
a good game and all of a sudden Michael Jordan walks up and was
available. Fred Harris is Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hoop hyperbole, but Harris and Jordan do share some
traits: a big-league work ethic, a sly sense of humor, a few flashy
moves, and an apparent inability to contemplate retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

`ZOOM' RETURNS TO ENTERTAIN A NEW GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as bellbottoms, mood rings, and the Village People are once
again cool, the children's TV show ``Zoom'' returns from the disco
days to entertain a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s children's television series has been revived _ and
revamped _ for a second life. Come January, old ``Zoom'' fans, now
in their 30s, can watch a new generation once again sing the show's
opening theme song (``Come on and Zoom Zoom Zoom-a Zoom ...''),
speak the secret Ubbi Dubbi language, and mail letters to ``Box
three-five-oh, Boston, Mass., oh-two-one-three-four!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thing to be a cultural icon,'' said senior
producer Jonathan Meath. ```Zoom' is a cherished part of kids'
lives who grew up in the '70s. We want it to be a cherished part of
kids who grow up in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH-TV in Boston has resurrected the show for PBS, this time
catering to children whose parents were part of the original
``Zoom'' generation. Thanks to the Internet, ``Zoomworld'' can only
get bigger. Thanks to the deep-sixing of the cast's rugby uniform
shirts, the Zoom kids can only get hipper. But in general, the show
will keep the same content _ a hodgepodge of crafts, science
experiments, games, and skits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the pilot we showed, people feel glad we haven't
taken the heart out of the old `Zoom,''' said executive producer
Kate Taylor, who worked as an editor and segment producer for the
original series. ``We're making the show very un-'90s, in the sense
that it still uses real kids, not Hollywood actor-types.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, ``Zoom'' was and will continue to be television of
the children, by the children, and for the children. Kids write and
host the show, while others across the country send in recipes,
sketches, brain teasers, and game ideas to Box 350 _ or now, to
Zoom(at)wgbh.org. Targeting the 5-11 age group, the program tries
to promote critical thinking, reading, writing, and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   At the show's zenith in the '70s, ``Zoom'' fans mailed 10,000
letters a week to WGBH's ZIP code, 02134. The program ran on
weekday afternoons on PBS from 1972-79, with repeats until 1981,
becoming the first series written and performed by kids. Back then,
the mama's boys and your little brother watched Mr. Rogers. The
cool kids watched ``Zoom.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators of ``Zoom,'' part 2, hope to expand the show into
an interactive multimedia affair. They want children to use the Web
site at www.pbs.org/zoom to pitch ideas, chat with other
``Zoomers'' around the country, and retrieve instructions for games
and experiments. Outreach after-school programs in the 4-H and Boys
and Girls Clubs, where kids can make crafts and play games in
``Zoom'' fashion, will make ``Zoom'' seem nothing short of a kid's
empire. ``We have the chance of creating a much bigger universe
than we did in the past,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The show will have some changes: No more red and blue rugby
shirts that scream '70s; today's cast wears funky plaids, comfy
denims, and bright T-shirts. Forget the staged song-and-dance
sequences to ``Michael, Row Your Boat Ashore.'' Old-school Zoomers
will notice small variations in the theme song; a one-sentence rap,
for instance, has been inserted into the familiar jingle.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800 children tried out for the cast at the November open
auditions in Boston. Producers scoped out fun, energetic, and
interesting personalities, often shying away from youngsters with
acting experience, Taylor said. ``We're looking for the kids'
natural selves,'' she said. ``Some of the kid actors don't always
know how to show that because they're always being directed.''
</P>
<P>
   The exuberant cast of Alisa, David, Jared, Keiko, Lynese, Pablo,
and Zoe are 8- to 13-year-olds who come from various ethnic
backgrounds and neighborhoods in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
Their presence on TV seems to tell kids it's OK to wear braces,
have baby fat, or look like anything other than a Brady kid.
``Zoom'' policy does not disclose the last names of cast members.
``Our kids represent every person,'' Meath said. ``We want kids at
home to feel like they're on a first name basis'' with the cast.
</P>
<P>
   But camera shy, the ``Zoom'' cast are not. Shooting 40 episodes
Monday through Friday this summer, they transform the black WGBH
studio set to a lively summer camp. When MC'ing a relay race, Jared
uses a commanding voice akin to a pro-wrestling announcer. Lynese,
Alisa, and Zoe can do a striking impression of the Spice Girls
between cuts. They all complain about each others' smelly feet when
the directors ask them to shoot a scene barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   When director Bob Comiskey tells them to do a fourth take of the
same segment, the blond and bespectacled Zoe cries, ``Oh, for the
love of Bob!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always cool to see kids from different backgrounds coming
together, emerging as this wonderful community,'' said drama coach
Shea Schatell. ``They celebrate each other's creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ``Zoom'' became less of a TV presence and more
of a nostalgic pop-culture reference. On TV's ``Friends,'' Joey
lied on his resume, claiming to be a ``Zoom'' kid. Rosie O'Donnell
has mentioned the hit on her show. On a ``Saturday Night Live,''
skit, a Senator Edward Kennedy impersonator conversed in Ubbi Dubbi
with the moderator. Since the mid-'80s, curious grown-up fans wrote
to Box 350, asking, ``Whatever happened to `Zoom'?''
</P>
<P>
   That's partly why the creators are releasing a ``Zoom''
nostalgia video and book that compiles snippets of old shows and
``Where are they now?'' profiles on former cast members. While some
of them have gone onto show business, others have become train
engineers, child psychologists, and writers.
</P>
<P>
   Former ``Zoom'' fan Chris Whitbeck, 32, said he was thrilled
when producers called to ask if he would be interested in working
for the show. Whitbeck, science coordinator for Brookline Public
Schools, explains science concepts and experiments to the cast
before showtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so shocked when they called me,'' he said. ``I sang them
that song, `Oh-two-one-three-four!' I said, `Oh, It's `Zoom!' I
know you!'''

EMPLOYERS LEARN TO DEAL WITH DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nearly 30 years ago when Tom Gentry was working at a
local refinery, a co-worker dropped dead on the job.
</P>
<P>
   After his body was removed, the company's attitude was: ``OK,
fellas, get back to work,'' and no one in the company said a word
about what felled the poor guy, said Gentry, president of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers Union Local 4-227.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of insensitivity is still common at many companies
when an employee dies, either on the job or at home. Many times,
employers don't know what to say or do, so they just ignore the
death.
</P>
<P>
   But employeesimagine the most gruesome details _ especially if
the death is violent, like a suicide _ and don't have a chance to
grieve, said the Rev. Diana Dale, president of the Worklife
Institute in Houston. When that happens, employees feel alienated
and direct their anger toward the company.
</P>
<P>
   A few employers have rethought the way they handle death and are
bringing in counselors.
</P>
<P>
   After a suicide, for example, a big counseling session with the
deceased employee's co-workers lets them talk about the guilt they
feel by not recognizing the employee's pain or, if they saw it, not
interceding, said Dale, who is a corporate chaplain and is hired by
companies to counsel employees after a death.
</P>
<P>
   They also typically talk about the anger they feel toward their
deceased co-worker for taking his life and their anger with God for
letting it happen, Dale said. It's good to let people explode in a
supportive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees feel guilt over the way they react to an
employee's death, she said. At one company, a geologist was killed
in an accident and the manager's first reaction was annoyance about
having to find a new geologist, Dale said, and the manager felt
guilty for thinking of his own concerns first.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Dale was brought in to talk to employees
about the pain they felt about losing a co-worker who died at his
desk of cancer. Employees were angry that they had to watch him go
downhill day by day and that he increasingly couldn't carry his
weight in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Dale said she encourages employees to express themselves and
tells each group that the conversation is confidential. She
typically meets with groups of managers separately because they
want to save face and appear to be in control.
</P>
<P>
   Employees also want to know the details of the death, which
makes it important for the company to explain what happened, Dale
said. That way, people aren't brooding over the specifics, and it
keeps the rumor mill quiet.
</P>
<P>
   When a company has a death at work, employees need a ritual to
mark the passing and let employees grieve, said Terrence Deal,
professor of education at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Deal remembers the time when he was a ninth-grade U.S. history
teacher and his 5-year-old son died suddenly. When he returned to
work, Deal said his students sat him down for a ceremony. The
students sang some songs they wrote, spoke about how sorry they
were, presented some food and lined up so each could give him a big
hug.
</P>
<P>
   Deal said the ceremony helped him and the students, who had also
attended the funeral, commemorate the death in their own special
way and get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Deal, who specializes in the study of rituals and ceremony,
suggests to companies they host a lunch or call a special meeting
to reminisce about a deceased employee.
</P>
<P>
   In every company there's always someone employees turn to for
spiritual advice, he said. That person is easily identified _
sometimes it's the receptionist, other times the custodian _ and
Deal suggests the employer let the on-site spiritual leader devise
a ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   When that ritual doesn't take place, there can be real troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Deal said he was doing some consulting work at one company in
which everyone was complaining about an employee who had made
several mistakes _ installing urinals in the women's restrooms and
putting the company logo upside down on company cars.
</P>
<P>
   Deal said that when he found out the employee had been dead for
five years, he told the chief executive that the company should
have some kind of ceremony to put him to rest. Maybe an exorcism,
Deal suggested with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Dale recommended that companies develop a plan to handle an
employee death and have a counselor ready to come at a moment's
notice to talk to employees. It's really important to catch
employees the day the death occurs or otherwise they'll begin to
feel alienated, she said.

DRUG CZAR TO PURSUE INTERNATIONAL ANTI-DRUG DIALOGUE IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barry R. McCaffrey, who heads the White House war
on drugs, takes off Saturday for Europe to see how other officials
are trying to curb narcotics abuse and to promote greater
cooperation in fighting traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes two days after President Clinton launched a $195
million national anti-drug ad campaign aimed at teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, a retired Army general, said Friday he realizes that
he and his European counterparts do not share ``precisely the same
culture or historical context or legal context, but I want to
listen to what they are doing and saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common thread running throughout this visit is that the
problem is the same ... drug consumption and the terrible damage to
humans, to their families, to their (country's) economy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who begins his trip in Stockholm, Sweden, said he
wants to learn how its treatment system works and whether it might
be adapted to help the 4 million chronic addicts in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not yet built the infrastructure required to handle that
problem in a more rational way,'' he said. ``It's one of the major
shortcomings in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that international efforts to combat illegal drugs
are hampered because no worldwide standard exists for monitoring
drug use and prevention. His trip, he said, will allow him to have
``serious and continuing dialogue on data collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-day tour includes visits to Amsterdam, The Hague and
Rotterdam in the Netherlands as well as Vienna, Austria; Zurich,
Switzerland, and Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna he will visit the United Nations Drug Control Center,
where he will meet with Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the
U.N. drug control program, and discuss ways to improve global
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey will also visit the European Monitoring Center for
Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon, where, he said, ``17 of my
colleagues in Europe with the same title of `drug czar' have agreed
to come (to) consult with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he plans to outline drug prevention tactics that
the United States is funding.
</P>
<P>
   European officials, he said, were ``shocked'' to learn that
American drug campaigns stress prevention and asked him to tell
more about them.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he tells foreign drug officials that ``85
percent of all the drug research on the face of the Earth is done
by the U.S. ... it surprises them.''

the globe through the world's hair-trigger stock and currency

moving and less visible force: the markets for basic commodities
like oil, metals and timber. And that helps explain why the ripples
from the Asian financial collapse are continuing to hit hard at
countries as far-flung as Canada, Chile, New Zealand and Mexico,
yet the effect has remained unexpectedly benign in the United
States and Europe. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 By ABBY TANNENBAUM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.

   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

POP GOES THE HANSONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Those ``MMMBoppers'' are finally taking it to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Hanson's breakthrough hit, Ike, Zac and Tay have
embarked on a major world tour. And gals, the towheaded cuties
insist they don't have girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a preteen, you already know their origins _ as a
harmony act, the trio sang at local community events and dances
while soaking up a series of Time-Life '50s and '60s pop
compilations bought by their father, Walker.
</P>
<P>
   At first aping the Jackson 5 and the Beach Boys, the trio
started to pen their own songs. After cutting a few demos, the boys
performed at the annual South by Southwest convention in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When a connected attorney shopped the demo, Mercury Records bit,
and Hanson was placed under the wing of several top producers,
including the Dust Brothers and Steve Lironi.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``MMMBop,'' followed by ``Where's the Love,'' ``I Will
Come to You,'' ``Weird'' and other smasheroos. The band's debut
album, ``Middle of Nowhere,'' sold more than 5 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   That disc was followed by the trio's Christmas album, ``Snowed
In,'' and the recently issued ``3 Car Garage: The Indie Recordings
(1995-96),'' a collection of early material.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson _ guitarist Isaac, 17; keyboardist Taylor, 15; and
drummer Zachary, 12 _ appears tonight at the Hollywood Bowl. We
talked to the young bros from their home in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has life changed since you've become famous?
</P>
<P>
   Tay: It's changed a lot. Walking down the street, we're
recognized _ and that can be insane. But friends, good friends, are
still good friends. But there's people you didn't know before that
now try to become your friend. You know, the second cousin you
didn't know you had.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will your music change in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Ike: How does any band evolve? We'll have new songs, and we'll
be producing more. It's hard to explain exactly. Certain things
will change slightly, but it will always be Hanson and similar to
what you know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there a game plan for success?
</P>
<P>
   Zac: We didn't even think about anything like that. We just
started writing our own songs. We just did it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's been said you helped revitalize the pop industry in
terms of sales and radio airplay. Do you feel any pressure because
of that?
</P>
<P>
   Tay: A band is a band, and we're lucky to have this opportunity.
It's about playing music and having fun doing it. We're lucky to
connect with a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How's finally being on the road?
</P>
<P>
   Ike: It's been excellent. This is something we've wanted to do
for a year. Now that we're on tour, it's amazing. We've been
performing for a long time, but with such large audiences, it's a
very, very cool thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you ever miss home?
</P>
<P>
   Zac: Sometimes you do miss things at home or your friends. It's
not like we're taking our motorcycles with us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been all over the world. What are some favorite
places?
</P>
<P>
   Tay: Sydney, Australia, is just a beautiful city. And all
throughout Europe there are cool places. Italy is cool, London is
great. It depends on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about favorite countries for food?
</P>
<P>
   Tay: Italy wins hands down for that awesome food. That's the
best place to grab something to eat, besides your hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What music do you listen to?
</P>
<P>
   Ike: We listen to everything, from Bob Dylan to Massive Attack.
We're into hard-core rock, r&AMP;b. There's so much different stuff to
be inspired by. Those things may be incorporated in the next record
because the band will be more involved in the production process.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does it mean to be so well-known?
</P>
<P>
   Zac: We get to do more stuff. We're basically the same people,
but we're not at home as much. We live in hotel rooms, but that's
not all bad. Friends treat us the same. They're the ones that think
it's weird. It's not like they treat us different.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Hanson so popular right now?
</P>
<P>
   Tay: Sometimes I think it's being in the right place at the
right time. A lot of different groups and different sounds evolve,
go away and come back. It was a good time to release our music, and
it's been awesome to have people respond to it. Sometimes, you just
slap yourself and try to think how it all happened.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gus Van Sant (``Good Will Hunting,'' ``Drugstore Cowboy'')
directed your latest video, ``Weird.'' How did you choose him?
</P>
<P>
   Ike: He actually called our manager and said he was interested.
We hadn't found anyone we really felt worked, and so we called him.
He was incredibly easy to work with. Gus can be very soft-spoken
and then very firm about what he's thinking. With this video, we
were more involved than any of the earlier ones. It was a great
working environment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think of the Spice Girls?
</P>
<P>
   Zac:They're working their butts off and doing a good job at what
they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do nasty reviews bother you?
</P>
<P>
   Tay: We've gotten both good and bad from the critics. It depends
on where you are and who you're talking to. To be nominated for the
Grammys was like, wow. That was our peers saying it was a good
song. But a fan is a fan, and a critic is just another person. So
we take it as who's out there buying the records.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think of your success?
</P>
<P>
   Ike: It's a very cool experience. It's amazing we've had this
opportunity at all. We were just another band that was playing for
a long time and finally got signed and made a record, and all of a
sudden it took off. It's like I can't believe this is happening.

RACING CIRCUIT VS. THE SALES CIRCUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Sunday the NASCAR faithful will have gathered in great
numbers to worship the idols of the Winston Cup at the shrine in
Loudon, N.H. The chief service of the day is the NASCAR Winston Cup
Jiffy Lube 300, as the name suggests, a 300-lap race named for its
sponsors, a cigarette manufacturer, and a franchiser of quick
oil-change facilities. This is not a gathering of Lutherans or
Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   While the races are named for, and the cars bear the logos of,
any person or enterprise willing to put up some bucks, it is the
auto manufacturers who have the most to win or lose _ or so they
would seem to believe. ``Win on Sunday, sell on Monday'' goes the
shibboleth that justifies this expensive pursuit of bragging
rights, and the likes of Ford and General Motors go head-to-head to
prove to prospective buyers the value of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, for example, is pitting its Taurus against the General's
Monte Carlo (Chevy) and Grand Prix (Pontiac) on the NASCAR circuit
with pretty fair results _ Taurus has been very successful in the
'98 NASCAR campaign, with seven wins in the first 16 races and 50
top-five finishes out of a potential 80. Taurus? A racer?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly _ but then neither is Monte Carlo nor Grand
Prix. These are all front-drive cars in the showrooms, and NASCAR
doesn't race front-drive cars, only front-drive marques. Those
racers are all rear-drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's a Taurus body with a rear-drive race car underneath?
Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR has strict rules on body measurements _ fender height,
deck height, etc. And there are the aero enhancements, the skirts
and air dams and stuff that help move the air around a car and move
the car through the air efficiently. So, the Taurus racer standing
next to the showroom Taurus sedan doesn't look much like its
namesake _ not to mention the patchwork paint job with all the
sponsors' logos. A mouse doesn't resemble a camel much, either,
even though they are both mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Your showroom Taurus is an inch and a half shorter in the
wheelbase and about seven pounds lighter than the racer, powered by
a 200-horsepower, 3.0-liter Duratec V-6 with dual overhead
camshafts in tandem with a 5-speed, automatic transaxle. The
rear-drive racing Taurus has a 4-speed manual gearbox attached to a
700-horsepower (more or less), 5.8-liter V-8.
</P>
<P>
   But why is it necessary to race Taurus, the Ford flagship, to
sell it? It's been a winner from the beginning, with four million
on the road. Perhaps it isn't necessary, but Ford says it's
working, and, with the demise of Thunderbird, the Ford NASCAR barn
had been suddenly empty. Remember, too, that Taurus, the sales
leader from 1992 through 1996, had slipped to third behind Toyota
Camry and Honda Accord in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Taurus sales, Ford says, have gone up with the racing program,
increasing to 154,698 in the first five months of May from the like
'97 period total of 145,963. But is it the racing or is it
something else? Taurus is the only NASCAR label with increased
sales over 1997; Monte Carlo is off a smidgen, and Grand Prix is
down 13,600, according to Ford's figures.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Thunderbird? The 'Bird is the most successful single
marque in NASCAR history, with 284 victories and five championships
_ a rear-drive car on the street that more nearly resembled its
racetrack counterpart _ and yet its lackluster sales led Ford to
discontinue it.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that's not exactly the whole story, either. Thunderbird
sales probably wouldn't have declined any more, might have gained a
little, with some marketing effort. It was a ``lateral'' seller
with a faithful following.
</P>
<P>
   And it's coming back. Maybe Ford just shelved it for a bit to
add some drama to its reincarnation as the Ford ``millennium'' car,
a roadster once more _ or maybe as a family of cars. Or maybe not.
I do know that Thunderbird is returning, and I suspect that the
racing program is a self-fulfilling sales prophecy: If you think it
works, it is working.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll bet that the Taurus dip in popularity in '97 was a
result of radical styling, not a lack of a racing pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   But I hope the manufacturers never discover that racing isn't
the sales tool it's hyped to be; there's a lot of technology under
the hoods of those street cars that was born in racing programs.
Racing may not do as much for the manufacturers as they think, but
it does plenty for the rest of us who cherish reliable,
fun-to-drive cars.

<P>
   GALLUP, N.M. _ On the nearby Navajo Indian Reservation, the
Southwest Indian Foundation blends the determination of the of the
Roman Catholic missionaries who have been active in the region for
decades with the New West chic of stylish catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no regular mail-order retailing operation. In
addition to selling merchandise nationwide, the foundation provides
jobs for as many as 60 people during the peak holiday season and
sponsors social services on the reservation _ an expanse as large
as West Virginia that's known as the Big Rez.
</P>
<P>
   The services include installing new coal-fired stoves in homes
that lack safe heating, providing emergency assistance and food
baskets to needy families and supporting alcoholism treatment
centers, schools and shelters for battered women.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Rez, in fact, is among the poorest communities in the
United States, but it is the 64-page direct-mail catalog, which
sells turquoise and silver Indian jewelry, Navajo rugs, kachina
dolls and clothing, that most of the outside world sees.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed eight times a year, the catalog's circle is growing;
last year, the Christmas edition was sent to four million
households.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation competes with Arizona Highways, Simply Southwest
and Sundance, among others, for home shoppers who are seeking
Southwestern fashions. But when someone buys a $19 turquoise
tie-tack or a $295 squash-blossom necklace from its catalog, 65
percent of the price is a tax-deductible contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The other 35 percent goes to cover costs, including paying the
local artisans who make the products. Customers can add
tax-deductible donations, and about of them do so. The appeal has
transformed the once-obscure Catholic charity into a $10 million a
year operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be able to do the amount of charitable work we do
if it were not for the business,'' said William McCarthy, the
foundation's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The mingling of the commercial and the charitable is among the
most visible tensions in the world of philanthropy. The practice is
almost always controversial, since business operations tend to take
on a life of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has its share of critics. But others say that
activities intended to create jobs _ nurturing artisans, not merely
dispensing handouts _ answer charity's highest call.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation enjoys a sterling reputation on the Big Rez.
``When we're not able to find resources to help our clients and
we've exhausted our services, they help our clients in any way they
can,'' said Lucinda Waseta, a supervisory social worker on the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an appreciation for the business side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a project that's generating jobs and revenues for our
people,'' said Ferdinand Notah, executive director of the Division
of Economic Development for the Navajo Nation. The foundation has
45 full-time employees, most of them tribal members; in the busy
holiday selling season, the staff grows.
</P>
<P>
   It also sponsors ``economic development'' by supporting small
family-run handicraft enterprises, Notah added. ``The families that
are participating with or are employed by the Southwest Indian
Foundation are enjoying a livelihood and are contributing to the
local economy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to come up with reliable economic statistics for the
remote reservation communities that are home to about 175,000
Navajos. According to Notah's office, about 50,000 Navajos are
counted among the active labor force, but about 40 percent are
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The annual per capita income on the reservation is estimated at
less than $7,000. But Notah said that doesn't include the thriving
underground economy _ production of arts and crafts valued at up to
$20 million or people who work in jobs outside the reservation,
including at the Southwest Indian Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, meanwhile, has invested $300,000 in a renovated
railroad station in the center of town, last summer opening a gift
store, a cafe, an art gallery and a crafts museum.
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders, though, have cast a critical eye, questioning
whether the foundation is a legitimate charity or a business hiding
behind its nonprofit status.
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog organization
in Bethesda, Md., gave the foundation a grade of ``F'' in its
latest charity rating guide. Daniel Borochoff, president of the
institute, called the foundation ``a crafty project'' in the
institute's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it an employment project or just clever marketing?'' asked
Borochoff.
</P>
<P>
   He added, the catalog ``paints a glowing picture of the
charity.'' ``However, that glow fades quickly when one tries to
review how the Southwest Indian Foundation is actually spending its
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Borochoff said that the foundation had not responded to repeated
requests for detailed financial statements. The one-page statement
of accountability that the foundation sends to those requesting it
doesn't provide enough information for a good analysis, he said,
and it lists the cost of buying and selling jewelry as an
``employment project'' under ``program expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Borochoff contended that the jewelry expenses should be listed
as ``costs of goods sold'' and be deducted from net revenue, rather
than listed under charitable expenses. And in fact, that is how the
jewelry business is treated in the forms that the foundation must
file with the Internal Revenue Service to report ``unrelated trade
or business income.''
</P>
<P>
   How the jewelry expenses are accounted for, the foundation says,
goes to the heart of its mission: to provide employment for native
artisans. ``This is a philanthropic charity,'' said McCarthy, ``but
at the same time, there is a business element that drives the
energy. ``The amount of money that's being infused into our economy
and the reservation economy in direct cash to artists and artisans
is significant.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In its 1997 financial statement, the foundation reported
spending $5.3 million on ``program services,'' including only $1.8
million for charitable programs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the remaining $3.5 million was attributed to its
employment project, that is, the catalog: $2.3 million for buying
jewelry and crafts from local artisans and $1.2 million for costs
attributed to managing a business that sells some 250,000 pieces a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation spent $3.6 million on ``supporting services'' _
fund-raising, management and overhead. Its payroll last year was $1
million. The foundation says its spending on its catalog has helped
the foundation's revenues grow from $2.2 million in 1987, to $10.4
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the foundation says, its income from jewelry
sales shot up more than tenfold, and its total revenue rose more
than fourfold. Spending on program services has risen threefold,
but spending on charitable programs _ other than the jewelry
employment project _ has increased only 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCarthy said that each year the foundation has had more
money to spend on social services and that its base of donors and
buyers had grown from around 50,000 in 1987, to about 80,000 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of revenues to expenditures is within the guidelines
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, which recommends that a
charity's total fund-raising and administrative costs not exceed 50
percent of total income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything of particular concern,'' said Bennett
Weiner, director of the council's philanthropic advisory services,
which is analyzing the its statements.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts note that customary guidelines don't always assess
the impact of charities like the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of nonprofits are hybrids,'' said Ann Kaplan, research
director of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. ``To
me, this looks like a good organization. They're not making a huge
profit on selling jewelry. They're using that as a way to reach out
to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Indian Foundation occupies an old two-story brick
building in downtown Gallup, a dusty windblown strip of a town,
with service stations, motels and Indian jewelry and curio shops
strung along the old Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members, mostly people from the reservation, work in half
a dozen cramped rooms, taking orders on the telephone, processing
thick bundles of mail orders and contributions, entering customer
information into computer files and sending out merchandise and
thank-you letters.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are stuffed with boxes, bubble packaging and shelves
onwith more than 300 items of jewelry, pottery, clothing, books and
compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was started in 1968 by the Rev. Dunstan
Schmidlin, a Roman Catholic parish priest who raised money to build
bridges and dig wells in remote villages on the Big Rez and to open
shelters in Gallup to keep homeless alcoholics from dying of
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the foundation board hired McCarthy, who switched the
organization to a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   He decided the foundation's mission could appeal to a much wider
audience than a traditional Catholic base.
</P>
<P>
   Like other sophisticated direct-mail operations, the foundation
keeps detailed records of each donor's history of purchases and
contributions. Both the catalog and the fund-raising appeals
feature stories about the people who benefit from the foundation's
work.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation works with a few individual artists, though much
of the merchandise comes from traders and wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our jewelry is mass-produced but it's handmade,'' said Tom
Elefson, the catalog director. ``The artists who make one-of-a-kind
pieces go to Santa Fe. The people we work with are not the great
artists. They are the blue-collar journeymen who desperately need
the money. If they get an order for 300 pieces of jewelry, they're
thrilled. ''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the foundation sold nearly 250,000 items made by
artisans from 16 different tribes.

<P>
   In nearby Milan, 30 Navajo women work in a small factory that
churns out as many as 1,000 kachina dolls _ colorful costumed dance
dolls representing sacred spirits _ a week in peak preholiday
season. A third of those dolls are sold through the foundation's
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Loley, 35 and a mother of four, makes as much as $60 a day
decorating dolls that sell for as much as $169 in the catalog. Most
of what the foundation's employment program _ the money it spends
on jewelry and crafts _ involves this kind of trickle-down
economics.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation works directly with some suppliers, even
providing seed money for start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rehoboth McKinley Christian Hospital in Gallup, 15
alcoholism-rehabilitation patients make pottery for the catalog.
They are paid minimum wage in a program designed to help them learn
work skills and move on to other jobs. The foundation purchased the
kiln and molds to start the operation and buys all the
candleholders, cups and wedding vases the patients make.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's keeping me away from doing nothing and being out of a
job, which might lead me back to drinking,'' said Conrad Thomas.
Thomas, 36, paints geometric designs of his own invention on
traditional Navajo vases, which sell for $69 each in the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He is attending college part-time and works a weekend job as a
nurse assistant, but keeps up his pottery painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, it's just a start,'' said Petra Reed,
coordinator of the ceramic workshop. ``They will go on to school or
find another job or go back to a job after showing their bosses
that they're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reed, 32, was herself living on the streets and in and out
of alcoholism programs before enrolling at Rehoboth McKinley. Now
she has her own home and her children are living with her again.
``Everything,'' she said, ``has changed.''

YES, PCI GRAPHICS CARD WORKS IN A COMPUTER WITH AN AGP SLOT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just bought a new computer, and it came with a graphics
card in the AGP slot. I don't really like the card that's built in,
so I'm thinking about putting the card from my old computer into
this one. I really liked the older card, but it goes into a PCI
slot. Can I still use it in this computer, which uses AGP graphics?
</P>
<P>
   A: AGP stands for Accelerated Graphics Port, and it's yet
another standard for connecting video cards to computer system
boards. There have been several, starting with the original ISA
(Industry Standard Architecture), VLB (VESA Local Bus) and then PCI
(Peripheral Component Interconnect).
</P>
<P>
   Each new type of connection comes along with a new generation of
Intel Corp. processors, it seems. VLB first was used with the 80486
chip. PCI came along with the original Pentium. And AGP was
introduced along with the Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   While VLB now is defunct, both ISA and PCI slots live on in
modern computers. The industry is trying to phase out ISA slots,
though, because they are not fast and don't work very well with the
plug-and-play standard. It's not been easy, though, because there
are lots of cards that still use the ISA standard out there _
ranging from modems to sound cards to network cards.
</P>
<P>
   Most modern video cards are available in PCI format, though some
manufacturers are starting to balk at introducing their newest
cards in anything but AGP. For example, Matrox Graphics has
announced a new card called the Millennium G200 that, initially at
least, will be made only as an AGP card. Company officials aren't
ruling out a PCI model, but one is not promised.
</P>
<P>
   Since most new PCs have both kinds of slots, you can indeed use
a PCI graphics card in a computer with an AGP slot. Just be sure
you remove the AGP card so there are no conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   You also might check with the maker of your favorite graphics
card to see if an AGP version is available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am planning to upgrade my Pentium 166 to a Pentium II 400.
I also am planning to upgrade to Windows 98. Should I change out
the motherboard first, or upgrade to Win 98 and then change the
motherboard? I rather suspect many of your readers will be
considering making the same kinds of changes.
</P>
<P>
   A: This really is a chicken-or-the-egg question, isn't it? Do
you do the major hardware surgery or the major software surgery
first?
</P>
<P>
   Given that replacing the most crucial part of your system _ the
motherboard _ is a more challenging task, I'd start with that
first. Get the new motherboard in place and let the established
operating system handle the task of recognizing everything when you
turn it on for the first time. Once everything settles down,
install the new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   However, you may end up having to do a fresh install of the
operating system if things go horribly wrong. After all, the setup
in the Windows 95 Registry is going to be expecting one kind of
motherboard, hard drive controller, etc., and it will get a
different one once you turn the upgraded PC on. If it craters, that
might be a good time to load Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure you've got a working boot disk that includes your
CD-ROM drivers in case you need to do an installation from scratch.
And, of course, make a full backup of your system before you do
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just bought my first computer, a Macintosh! Yes, I bought a
Mac, can you believe it? Anyway, I'd like to find some places to
get shareware and freeware. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: You've made Steve Jobs very happy. You're just what he's
after _ computer novices to expand the Mac's market share.
</P>
<P>
   You can make yourself very happy at Info-Mac, which is
considered the best source for Macintosh shareware. It's at
www.pht.com/info-mac/.

LAWMAKERS OBJECT TO PLAN TO MOVE AIR FORCE ANTI-TERRORIST SQUAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ An Air Force plan to move an anti-terrorist unit
from Lackland Air Force Base to Georgia has drawn a sharp rebuke
from a bipartisan coalition of Texas lawmakers who say the troops'
welfare is being sacrificed to Pentagon politics.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison wrote a letter Thursday
protesting a Pentagon decision to relocate the 820th Security
Forces Group, pegged to move from Lackland to Moody Air Force Base
in Valdosta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The letter touts the advantages of keeping the unit at the San
Antonio base, and asks Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters
to discuss the issue with the lawmakers before the move occurs.
</P>
<P>
   It also questions moving the group when the Air Force is looking
to save money by consolidating operations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro D. Rodriguez, a Democrat, said Thursday the move
frustrates Texas lawmakers because San Antonio took a big hit when
the Base Closure and Realignment Commission ordered Kelly Air Force
Base, a longtime economic generator, to close by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly is the largest base ever to be closed, so there is no
doubt we have paid our dues,'' said Rodriguez, a member of the
House National Security Committee. ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Forces Group, established last year in a Lackland
ceremony that featured then-Air Force Chief of Staff Ronald
Fogleman, now has about 60 people, but in time will grow to 600.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a worldwide anti-terrorist operation based at
Lackland in the wake of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers
complex in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 Americans and wounded
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, delivered to Peters' office Thursday, was described
by one Senate staffer as the ``opening volley'' in a battle to keep
the 820th at Lackland.
</P>
<P>
   The other lawmakers from Texas who signed Hutchison's letter
were Republican Sen. Phil Gramm; Rodriguez and fellow Democratic
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez; and Republican Reps. Henry Bonilla and
Lamar Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time when the military is moving to consolidate its
forces for greater efficiency, moving the 820th from Lackland ...
makes little sense,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Peters had told him that housing and other
facilities available for the 820th ``were a little cramped'' at
Lackland, so moving the unit made sense.
</P>
<P>
   Peters could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the move say Lackland and San Antonio offer
more amenities and are better suited to serve the needs of the
820th, a combat-ready rapid deployment force created to protect Air
Force installations worldwide against terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Moody is located in Valdosta, a South Georgia city of 47,000.
Moody has been marked for shutdown by the Base Closure and
Realignment Commission three times this decade, but survived.

WOMEN WHO ARE PLASTIC SURGEONS ARE HARD TO FIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
(lh) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Stephanie Hallberg was 16, she decided she
wanted to reduce the size of her breasts. Ten years later and after
visits with doctors _ all men, all of whom recommended she keep her
breasts the way they were _ she found a doctor who sympathized with
her predicament and agreed to perform the surgery, Dr. Michelle
Copeland, who works out of a Fifth Avenue office complete with its
own operating room and all-female staff, down to the
anesthesiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even imagine going to a man for any plastic
surgery,'' Ms. Hallberg, 26, said. ``A man can study the woman's
body forever, but I believe he can never really understand how a
woman is put together, mentally, emotionally, physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallberg is lucky to have found a plastic surgeon who is a
woman, since they are indeed a rarity _ only about 4 percent of all
the board-certified plastic surgeons in the United States,
according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. In
New York, the disparity is even greater: Of approximately 500
board-certified plastic surgeons, only 12 are women, and only about
half of those spend the bulk of their time practicing cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The women's health movement has brought steadily increasing
numbers of women into medicine: women now make up 46 percent of the
classes admitted to medical schools. But it has scarcely touched
the field of cosmetic surgery, which remains overwhelmingly
dominated by men, even though its patient population is
overwhelmingly female _ 89 percent of cosmetic surgery patients are
women, according to the American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   It is men who are lifting the eyebrows, enlarging the breasts
and suctioning away the fat to remake women's faces and bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The almost exclusively one-way relationship suggests to some the
myth of Pygmalion, the king who in Greek legend sculptured a statue
of his ideal woman, which then came gratifyingly to life and became
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane Petro, a professor of plastic surgery at New York
Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y., is one who thinks ``the
Pygmalion angle'' helps explain why many more men than women are
drawn to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' she said. ``Just look at the number of male
plastic surgeons whose second wife was once their patient. It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgery is booming in the United States, driven by the
aging of the baby-boom population and the gradual erosion of a
cultural stigma against surgical self-improvement. Plastic surgeons
performed 686,201 cosmetic procedures in 1996, a 69 percent
increase over the 1992 figure of 406,156, according to the American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   This boom has lofted the average salary of plastic surgeons to
$350,000, one of the highest in medicine, an income largely
unfettered by managed care and other insurance, since the elective
procedures are paid for directly by well-heeled patients.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite these enticements, women are not streaming into
cosmetic surgery, as they are into other medical fields, like
pediatrics, general medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. What
would explain this paradox?
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, medical authorities and cultural observers suggest a
variety of reasons, from the hard-core practical to the
philosophical. Whatever the explanation, however, the imbalance
would seem to have ramifications for the ever-shifting concept of
American feminine beauty. The pervasiveness of the mostly male
surgical elite helps perpetuate ``the svelte, sculpted, Baywatch
woman,'' said Leslie Laurence, the co-author of ``Outrageous
Practices: How Gender Bias Threaten's Women's Health'' (Ballantine
Books, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   ``We measure ourselves against these cultural icons and feel we
fall short,'' she said. ``I believe that women surgeons bring a
different sensibility, just by virtue of understanding what it's
like to be a woman. When you're talking about things like breasts
and hips and bags under the eyes, they know what these things mean
to us and they understand our insecurities and desires a bit
better. A woman surgeon can separate away the cultural ideal from
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the lack of plastic surgeons who are women
that rolled off the tip of nearly every doctor's tongue _ both male
and female _ is that the rigors of plastic surgery training are too
intense, that a woman cannot balance the demands of surgical
training and a family or husband. Plastic surgeons must graduate
from a four-year medical school, then complete a five-year
residency in general surgery, followed by two years of plastic
surgery residency, capped off in most cases with a one-year
fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time you get out, you're 35,'' said Dr. Samantha Kwon,
who has just finished her plastic surgery training eight years
after graduating from medical school and will begin practicing in
Manhattan this fall. ``And a lot of times, a woman has other
priorities; getting married, raising a family,'' she said. ``You
cannot balance a general surgery residency and a family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In medical _ not surgical _ practice, women currently make up 21
percent of the nation's doctors, according to figures supplied by
the American Medical Association. They comprise 33 percent of
family practice and internal physicians, and around 85 percent of
pediatric doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors confirm that surgery has long been a boys' club with a
remarkably hostile environment for women. Dr. Kwon said that her
surgical training was ``military in its hierarchy. Some women feel
it's too stressful. And some programs take only men and one token
woman, although they won't admit that. That makes an uncomfortable
environment for women.''
</P>
<P>
   That macho attitude may drive some women away from surgery in
general. ``No matter how much we can legislate equality, surgery is
still something that women are counseled away from,'' said Dr.
Deborah T. Gold, a medical sociologist at the Duke University
Medical Center. ``It's subtle, and not everyone may realize it, but
it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, plenty of women do become surgeons _ just not
plastic surgeons. In 1994, according to the Association of Women
Surgeons, there were 10,004 obstetric-gynecologic surgeons who are
women, 3,031 general surgeons and 2,026 practicing ophthalmologic
surgery. The number of women populating surgery's ranks has risen
dramatically in the last 30 years: from 2,129 in 1970 to 17,107 in
1994. All the surgical subspecialties have to complete similarly
rigorous surgical training periods. Grueling training alone does
not explain the paucity of women in plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne Carlon, a surgical obstetrician-gynecologist in
Manhattan, said she never thought about plastic surgery in medical
school, and chose her field because, as a woman, she sympathized
with the needs of female patients. She surmised that women chose
careers in medicine motived more by altruism than by monetary
concerns. ``Plastic surgery is something of a money maker,'' she
said, ``and I think that a lot fewer women than men have that as a
major factor in deciding what field they want to go into.''
</P>
<P>
   Some patients say that there are fewer women practicing plastic
surgery because patients tend to _ as backward and sexist as it
sounds _ trust men more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always gone to male doctors, and I always will,''
said one woman in her '60s who spoke on condition of anonymity and
who has visited Dr. Daniel Baker, a celebrated Manhattan surgeon,
for procedures. ``How long have women been doing this, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Building a plastic surgery practice _ unlike, for example, one
in cardiac surgery or gastroenterology _ requires a fair bit of
socializing, and in this regard some women physicians say they're
at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Dr. Sherrell Aston, two of Manhattan's most eminent
sculptors of famous faces, may benefit by having beautiful wives
who circulate with them through the charity-ball circuit and help
to gather wealthy clients with time on their hands and furrows on
their brows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go out to parties and get our picture in Avenue
magazine,'' said Dr. Helen S. Colen, a plastic surgeon who shares a
Manhattan practice with her husband, referring to a New York
magazine known for publishing photographs of socialites at play.
``As a woman you just can't be as famous as Dr. Aston and Dr.
Baker, in your tuxedo with your famous wife. How? They go for three
months and sit in the Hamptons and get their pictures in the
papers.'' She added: ``If I had a wife, well, who knows what I
could do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic surgeons' reputations are made on their results, not
based on their spouse,'' Aston said, when reached between surgical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Some cultural critics think the reason for the scarcity of women
plastic surgeons is based on atavistic fears. Nancy Friday, the
author of ``The Power of Beauty'' (HarperCollins, 1996), believes
that women do not have an interest in making other women more
beautiful or youthful-looking. The upshot, she argues, is that
fewer women go into plastic surgery, and fewer women choose to have
women operate on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all those fairy tales about the wicked stepmother, the
older woman who wants to destroy the beauty of the younger one,''
Ms. Friday said. ``I can't think of a woman who would want to give
me youthful, sexual beauty power. We know in our gut that another
woman really doesn't wish us an extended youthful beautiful period
in our lives. It's all because of the unspoken competition between
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis J. Lynch, the president of the American Society of
Reconstructive and Plastic Surgeons, disagreed. ``That statement is
way off base and doesn't reflect the reality of the women who are
practicing plastic surgery,'' he said. ``Women have long been an
important and trusted part of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   And feminine instinct may have played a trusted, beneficial role
in at least one aspect of plastic surgery: a number of women
cosmetic surgeons said they refused to use silicone breast implants
even before they were removed from the market in 1992, following
lawsuits claiming injuries. (Last week the Dow Corning Corp. agreed
to pay $3.2 billion to settle some of the lawsuits.)
</P>
<P>
   The patients who seek out women for their procedures are for the
most part grateful for the womanly attention. Most said that at its
best it felt like the relationship with a close girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who spoke only on condition that her name not be
used because her husband is a public figure, said that after having
had six children, she visited a male plastic surgeon to discuss a
breast tuck and augmentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took one look at me and _ well, after six kids, you know,
it's deflate, deflate, deflate _ and said, `What's the point?
You're this age now, and just learn to live with it.' I was 39
years old. I thought, `Gee, I guess it's about time to go pick out
my cemetery plot.'''
</P>
<P>
   A friend referred her to Dr. Susan Craig Scott, who practices on
the Upper East Side and who she said treated her with kid gloves,
``like a newborn baby, like a best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she hadn't found Dr. Scott, the absolute worst might have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still be deflated, deflated, deflated,'' she said with
a laugh. ``Now, everything's back where it ought to be.''

<P>
   This is a story about Christy, a 16-year-old from Marquette
County, Mich., who has been in trouble with the law since she was
12. She told us that she had been through counseling from a young
age and it has helped her to understand her situation and see what
she wants to do with her life.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has had a tough home life, which seems to be the
root of a lot of problems among teens, she doesn't blame her
actions on anyone but herself, saying that everyone makes their own
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Christy also says that ``court sucks'' but that if you make bad
decisions, it's your fault that you're there. She is a wise person
who has learned a lot the hard way. Here is her story in her words:
</P>
<P>
   Christy: I don't think I'm a bad kid. I don't think that
anybody's bad kids. I just think that we make bad decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes I've committed are one B&AMP;E (breaking and entering),
an obstruction of justice, domestic violence and a few assorted
misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   At the time I was committing those crimes, getting into trouble,
I was dating one of the head honchos of the gang. Technically I was
not involved in the gang, but the people I hung out with were.
</P>
<P>
   My home life pretty much sucked and still does. My dad's not
around. He lives at the bar. They're divorced, but my mom _ she is
a pretty big alcoholic and she gets really physical when she
drinks. I've gotten misdemeanors because I always run away.
Wouldn't you run away if your mom started beating on you? That's
why I ran away _ with no shoes.
</P>
<P>
   When I get physically abused by my mom when she's drunk, that's
being a victim. But nothing ever happened to her! I'm not blaming
my mom for my problems, 'cause she didn't make the decisions. I
did. But you know, it just kind of drove me to make the bad
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   I've never had money problems at home. I mostly get what I want
and if I don't get what I want I'll go out and get it myself. But I
think that if some kid has less money than another kid, he'll be
kind of envious and jealous and say, ``Well, since he has that and
I don't, then I can go kick his ...''
</P>
<P>
   I have this T-shirt that says ``People are not for hitting.'' No
matter what a person does, they're not meant to be hit or pushed
around. When that's happening I just feel kind of powerless. I want
to help them, or just go in there and say, ``Just back off, because
he didn't do anything.'' That happened today at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   I guess you gotta think about what you're doing before you go
hit somebody. If more people actually thought about what they were
doing instead of just doing it, I think that would control a lot of
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   When I got involved with the court system, I think I was about
12. The first few times you do something, they'll just slap you on
the wrist and say, ``Don't do it again.'' But if you are a habitual
criminal or a repeat offender, then they get a little bit harsh on
you.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm on intensive probation, which means my probation officer
comes up and sees me a couple times a week during school; and right
now if I mess up, if I do something bad, I could get sent away to
lockup for a year.
</P>
<P>
   It does suck, but you know, if we weren't such
bad-decision-making kids we wouldn't be involved in the justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some day I'm pretty sure we'll realize that life's not one big
party. We've gotta wake up and get a job.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think community service is a punishment. It all depends
on what you're assigned to do. Sometimes they have kids out digging
holes in dirt and stuff. My program was great. I've done Bridges.
It's a program where you work with handicapped senior citizens and
you just become their friend for a while. It was pretty cool. It
made me wake up and realize that the senior citizens are not there
to just bug us and say that we're a bunch of nobodies.
</P>
<P>
   If you just try to be good and stay away from the bad influences
and hang tough, then you can get through it. And if you have good
support from friends, family, boyfriend, girlfriend, anybody _ it
really helps.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty much focusing on school right now _ it's about time _
and on getting my family life back together. I haven't had that for
about four years.
</P>
<P>
   I wish for the world to be a better place _ no more pollution
and all that. Another wish would be to have everybody be happy and
love one another so there's no fighting. And the third wish would
be for everybody to have a home and food to eat so there wouldn't
be anymore homeless people or hungry people I'd have to worry
about.

RACING CIRCUIT VS. THE SALES CIRCUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Sunday the NASCAR faithful will have gathered in great
numbers to worship the idols of the Winston Cup at the shrine in
Loudon, N.H. The chief service of the day is the NASCAR Winston Cup
Jiffy Lube 300, as the name suggests, a 300-lap race named for its
sponsors, a cigarette manufacturer, and a franchiser of quick
oil-change facilities. This is not a gathering of Lutherans or
Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   While the races are named for, and the cars bear the logos of,
any person or enterprise willing to put up some bucks, it is the
auto manufacturers who have the most to win or lose _ or so they
would seem to believe. ``Win on Sunday, sell on Monday'' goes the
shibboleth that justifies this expensive pursuit of bragging
rights, and the likes of Ford and General Motors go head-to-head to
prove to prospective buyers the value of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, for example, is pitting its Taurus against the General's
Monte Carlo (Chevy) and Grand Prix (Pontiac) on the NASCAR circuit
with pretty fair results _ Taurus has been very successful in the
'98 NASCAR campaign, with seven wins in the first 16 races and 50
top-five finishes out of a potential 80. Taurus? A racer?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly _ but then neither is Monte Carlo nor Grand
Prix. These are all front-drive cars in the showrooms, and NASCAR
doesn't race front-drive cars, only front-drive marques. Those
racers are all rear-drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's a Taurus body with a rear-drive race car underneath?
Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR has strict rules on body measurements _ fender height,
deck height, etc. And there are the aero enhancements, the skirts
and air dams and stuff that help move the air around a car and move
the car through the air efficiently. So, the Taurus racer standing
next to the showroom Taurus sedan doesn't look much like its
namesake _ not to mention the patchwork paint job with all the
sponsors' logos. A mouse doesn't resemble a camel much, either,
even though they are both mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Your showroom Taurus is an inch and a half shorter in the
wheelbase and about seven pounds lighter than the racer, powered by
a 200-horsepower, 3.0-liter Duratec V-6 with dual overhead
camshafts in tandem with a 5-speed, automatic transaxle. The
rear-drive racing Taurus has a 4-speed manual gearbox attached to a
700-horsepower (more or less), 5.8-liter V-8.
</P>
<P>
   But why is it necessary to race Taurus, the Ford flagship, to
sell it? It's been a winner from the beginning, with four million
on the road. Perhaps it isn't necessary, but Ford says it's
working, and, with the demise of Thunderbird, the Ford NASCAR barn
had been suddenly empty. Remember, too, that Taurus, the sales
leader from 1992 through 1996, had slipped to third behind Toyota
Camry and Honda Accord in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Taurus sales, Ford says, have gone up with the racing program,
increasing to 154,698 in the first five months of May from the like
'97 period total of 145,963. But is it the racing or is it
something else? Taurus is the only NASCAR label with increased
sales over 1997; Monte Carlo is off a smidgen, and Grand Prix is
down 13,600, according to Ford's figures.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Thunderbird? The 'Bird is the most successful single
marque in NASCAR history, with 284 victories and five championships
_ a rear-drive car on the street that more nearly resembled its
racetrack counterpart _ and yet its lackluster sales led Ford to
discontinue it.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that's not exactly the whole story, either. Thunderbird
sales probably wouldn't have declined any more, might have gained a
little, with some marketing effort. It was a ``lateral'' seller
with a faithful following.
</P>
<P>
   And it's coming back. Maybe Ford just shelved it for a bit to
add some drama to its reincarnation as the Ford ``millennium'' car,
a roadster once more _ or maybe as a family of cars. Or maybe not.
I do know that Thunderbird is returning, and I suspect that the
racing program is a self-fulfilling sales prophecy: If you think it
works, it is working.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll bet that the Taurus dip in popularity in '97 was a
result of radical styling, not a lack of a racing pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   But I hope the manufacturers never discover that racing isn't
the sales tool it's hyped to be; there's a lot of technology under
the hoods of those street cars that was born in racing programs.
Racing may not do as much for the manufacturers as they think, but
it does plenty for the rest of us who cherish reliable,
fun-to-drive cars.

WHEN THE NEWS IS BAD, ANALYSTS FEEL THE HEAT

<P>
   Wall Street securities analysts occasionally deliver bad news on
a stock. But it's unusual when they unequivocally call their past
advice to buy it a blunder.
</P>
<P>
   That is what David Snyder, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, did with regard to the shares of the Agco Corp., a
leading maker of farm equipment, whose stock has fallen by a third
since March and is languishing in the $19 to $20 range. Snyder
removed Agco from the firm's ``recommended list'' on May 30, saying
the company had often fallen short of earnings expectations since
1996, when it began an enormous expansion overseas. Given that
history, he wrote in a summary of Donaldson, Lufkin's stock picks,
``investors are not likely to be very patient with any
disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder went further. He wrote that Agco's stock valuation
would likely remain depressed, and that ``we have been terribly
wrong on Agco's stock over the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder subsequently left Donaldson, Lufkin, co-manager of the
underwriting of Agco securities in 1996 and 1997, for Dawson
Samberg Capital Management, a money management firm. Leslie
Thompson, a spokeswoman for Donaldson, Lufkin, called Snyder's
departure and the Agco downgrade coincidental. ``A good analyst is
an honest analyst,'' she said. `` Snyder is a very well respected
person. We have the highest regard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder did not return several telephone calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Czelusniak, vice president of corporate relations at
Agco, said the company, based in Duluth, Ga., had only recently
learned that Snyder had moved on, but she declined to comment on
his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Snyder's downgrade of Agco to ``market performance'' _
considered a euphemism for ``sell'' _ was conspicuous because of
its blunt, self-critical assessment of a perceived mistake. Against
the backdrop of the voracious appetite for stocks in a
seven-year-old bull market, a sell signal like that tends to stand
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He committed the unforgivable,'' said Marvin Roffman, a
securities analyst at Roffman Miller Associates in Philadelphia. In
the ``sell side'' world of stocks, Roffman said, ``even using the
word `sell' is anathema.'' Snyder was not the first to lower his
opinion of Agco. Eric Hunter, an analyst at S&AMP;P Equity Group, said
he downgraded the stock from ``accumulate'' to ``hold'' in January,
largely because the company was trying to maintain prices in Latin
America, one of its most promising markets, while rivals were
cutting theirs. ``How long can you maintain that strategy until you
lose customers?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the stock remains attractive. John Mackin, who
follows Agco for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the decline in
the share price reflected economic pressures in developing
countries that have affected all companies trying to sell costly
machinery abroad. His rating on the stock has been a ``strong buy''
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Downgrades of stocks have become unusual in the last several
years, in part because of a marked change in the role analysts play
in a stock's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   These researchers once worked in relative obscurity to help
determine which stocks clients should buy and sell. Now, firms
compete more aggressively for the lucrative investment banking
business of publicly traded companies, so it is in their interest
to promote the stocks of those companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, critics say, many stock analysts who work for Wall
Street firms have grown too cozy with the companies they cover and
have lost credibility _ effectively becoming cheerleaders instead.
</P>
<P>
   That may help explain why recommendations to buy stocks vastly
outnumber recommendations to hold or sell. The First Call Corp., a
Boston research firm that tracks analysts' opinions on 6,000
stocks, says more than a third are rated ``strong buys,'' slightly
less than a third are ``buys,'' and most of the rest are ``holds.''
Only 1 percent are ``sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill, research director for First Call and a former
securities analyst himself, said there was more fear now among
analysts that they would offend their firm's investment banking
departments or the companies they cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some reluctance to put a sell on a stock,'' Hill
said. ``It's tougher now to be independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are far more indignant about what they regard as a high
level of excessively optimistic analysis, which they say hurts
investors' ability to gauge a stock's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unequivocally, what you'll see is that today, analysts are
like the front guys,'' said Roffman, a former analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott, a Philadelphia investment firm. ``They can't tell
it like it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Roffman speaks from experience: He was dismissed by Janney
Montgomery in 1990 after he refused to retract a negative report
about the financial stability of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino
after Trump had complained and pushed for Roffman's dismissal.
Roffman then started his own research firm, unfettered by possible
conflicts that might arise if he were also trying to generate
investment banking fees. Roffman also sued Trump, contending
defamation, settled the case for an undisclosed sum and was awarded
$750,000 from Janney Montgomery in a New York Stock Exchange
arbitration claim.
</P>
<P>
   Roffman's case was well-known in the industry, but there have
been other, less publicized examples. Wall Street firms sometimes
lose a client company's investment banking business because of a
downgrade, and analysts have been ostracized by a company in
retaliation for a downgrade. Sometimes, a company sharply curtails
analyst access to management if it deems that a rating on its stock
is too low.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Michael L. Mayo, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse
First Boston, was excluded from a Mellon Bank analysts meeting.
When he asked why, he said Mellon executives told him it was
``because of your rating on the stock.'' Mayo rates Mellon as a
``hold.'' Mellon declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Even analysts who do not work for Wall Street firms can find it
difficult to appraise a company's stock critically. Like others,
they try to maintain cordial relations with a company's management
to gain access to information that will help them evaluate growth
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot more leeway than these guys on the Street.
There's not much a company can do if we downgrade its stock,'' said
Hunter of S&AMP;P Equity Group. Still, he said, issuing a downgrade
``is never a comfortable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, a sell signal can make an analyst a hero.
Andrew Shore, an analyst at Paine Webber, downgraded the shares of
the Sunbeam Corp. in early April before the appliance company _
formerly a Wall Street darling _ began a plunge from the mid-$40s
to the $10 level last month. Shore was also the first analyst to
publicly question the capability of Albert Dunlap, Sunbeam's chief
executive, who was dismissed on June 13 amid growing questions
about the company's accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I had made a major sell call like this in my
whole life,'' Shore recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after he downgraded the stock, Shore said, he
received some ``extremely nasty phone messages.'' Weeks later, he
said, some of those same callers phoned to apologize and to thank
him.
</P>
<P>
   Shore said that he felt vindicated but that any analyst who
issued a sell recommendation had better be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more pressure when you say sell,'' he said.
``Everyone who owns it at least listens when you say sell.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For April Oliver, another day of infamy begins at
7:35 a.m. when a long car with soft leather seats arrives to take
the fired CNN producer to be interviewed on the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.'s morning news show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become the poster child for sloppy journalism,'' laments
Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a title she will meekly accept. Newly unemployed and
expecting her second child within weeks, the 36-year-old producer
has stepped out from behind the camera to wage a desperate media
campaign to salvage her career. In the process, she is taking on
the U.S. military establishment and the Time-Warner empire, which
includes CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and senior producer Jack Smith were fired for their story
on CNN's ``NewsStand'' and in Time magazine alleging that a secret
U.S. commando unit went into Laos in 1970 to kill American
defectors from the Vietnam War and that nerve gas was dropped on
enemy forces to enable the commandos to escape.
</P>
<P>
   When current and Vietnam-era military officials attacked its
accuracy, CNN called in attorney Floyd Abrams to examine the report
on ``Operation Tailwind.'' He concluded the main allegations were
not substantiated, and CNN and Time issued effusive retractions and
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by the story,'' Oliver told Canadian TV viewers
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, she repeated her defiant defense countless
times into her dining room phone to a succession of radio talk show
hosts and print reporters. A few blocks away, a similar refrain was
being voiced by her neighbor and former colleague Smith _ a
62-year-old broadcast veteran who was CBS-TV's Washington bureau
chief before going to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're responding, now that a two-week gag imposed by CNN has
been lifted,'' said Smith. ``It's a pity that CNN executives simply
caved in to pressure'' from the Pentagon and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the story to die,'' he said. ``And they hanged us,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a cauldron of emotions continues to boil at CNN. Some
former colleagues question why Oliver and Smith were fired and
executive producer Pamela Hill was pushed to resign, but on-air
correspondent Peter Arnett and higher CNN executives were allowed
to keep their jobs. Throughout the organization, there is
embarrassment and unease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know most of what has transpired here, and it is grief and
sadness and hurt and feelings of betrayal,'' said Steve Haworth,
vice president of public relations for the news network. ``And most
particularly those feelings of betrayal are aimed at Jack and
April.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The CNN termination was _ to say the least _ an unexpected
detour in a lifetime of overachievement for Oliver, a South
Carolina native and the great-great-granddaughter of Confederate
general Wade Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood swimming champion, she entered Princeton University
at 16 and took time off to work on Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign
and at an Afghani refugee camp in Pakistan before graduating cum
laude in 1983. She was a freelance journalist for five years and a
reporter for the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour for another five before
joining CNN in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The media operation to restore her good name is a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   Before the firing, Oliver said, CNN had told her and Smith not
to talk to reporters. Immediately afterward, though, April's
father, Wade Hampton Oliver, bought a fax machine and stayed up
until 2 a.m. sending news organizations copies of a letter his
daughter wrote to CNN President Rick Kaplan complaining of her
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Olivers had come to Washington from their home town
of Columbia, S.C., for a duplicate bridge tournament. April's
mother, Ellen, remained as a informal booking agent after the faxes
inspired scores of interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent that April couldn't get to interviews and
answer the phone,'' she explained. ``And I had to see that she had
proper meals. She is expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Oliver has a Caesarean section scheduled for July 28 and
interrupts her interviews for an afternoon nap. Given three months'
severance pay, she hopes her CNN medical insurance will cover the
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jay Schulkin, is a neuroscientist who has been
supportive and then some, said Oliver. ``He wants to hit
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Their 6-year-old daughter, Danielle, is delighted to have her
mommy home all day. She is less enthusiastic about the constant
phone calls that disrupt play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to preserve the integrity of the story by getting
as many facts out as possible,'' Oliver tells a radio interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to restore her reputation, of course, would be an
independent confirmation of her report. Over and over, she tells
interviewers of her disappointment that other reporters are
pursuing the ``media story'' rather than trying to find out more
about Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver recalls her dismay about a story in The Washington Post
that ``lumped my piece in with all these pieces of fiction'' _
recent journalistic scandals in which Boston Globe columnist
Patricia Smith and New Republic writer Stephen Glass admitted
making up sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, that was a killer,'' said Oliver. ``Those weren't
actors that we had doing on-camera interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot of courage for survivors of Tailwind to come
forward and tell their stories on TV, she said. Comparing the
report to fiction ``is an insult to them and to broadcast
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Oliver smiles at the vases of ``condolence flowers'' on her
dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about about a crisis is that you find
out who your friends are,'' she said. Colleagues from her magazine
unit at CNN gave her a baby shower last week.
</P>
<P>
   She knew the Tailwind story would generate intense criticism,
and prepared a detailed briefing book for her bosses at CNN about
her sourcing and the coming fire storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected controversy, but I didn't expect this much
controversy,'' she admitted. ``I certainly didn't expect to be
without a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues heard she would be leaving before she did. It was
announced at a July 2 conference call involving CNN employees in
Atlanta and Washington that she had been asked to resign _ except
that she hadn't. Shortly thereafter, however, Oliver said she was
given a choice: acknowledge mistakes in the Tailwind report and
``resign with dignity'' or ``be terminated immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking by the story, she chose termination.
</P>
<P>
   Some time after the baby comes, she hopes to begin some
freelance projects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a photographer from Newsweek has arrived for a shoot.
April's mother rushes to tidy up.
</P>
<P>
   It is a comfortable stone house, built in the 1940s, with
hardwood floors and overflowing bookcases and a fireplace with a
mantelpiece filled with family photos. There are stacks of CDs,
mainstream music by Mozart and Roy Orbison and Judy Garland and
Louis Armstrong. There is a trampoline in back yard and a gnawed
tennis ball belonging to a golden retriever named Red and a swing
on a tree limb and a playhouse for Danielle.
</P>
<P>
   There is a double-barreled Rolodex filled with phone numbers of
sources from scores of stories. Before the Operation Tailwind
report, Oliver produced reports for CNN on anorexia and welfare
reform and Colin Powell and Princess Diana and a myriad of other
topics. She traveled around the world for MacNeil/Lehrer, reporting
on the collapse of communism and South African elections and
Nicaraguan politics and other events.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek photographer is focusing near a table piled with
Beanie Babies. Ellen Oliver frets over her daughter's hair. And a
visitor wonders when _ or if _ a very pregnant producer will return
to her more familiar place behind the cameras rather than in front
of them.

on ``Operation Tailwind.'' He concluded the main allegations were
not substantiated, and CNN and Time issued effusive retractions and
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by the story,'' Oliver told Canadian TV viewers
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, she repeated her defiant defense countless
times into her dining room phone to a succession of radio talk show
hosts and print reporters. A few blocks away, a similar refrain was
being voiced by her neighbor and former colleague Smith _ a
62-year-old broadcast veteran who was CBS-TV's Washington bureau
chief before going to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're responding, now that a two-week gag imposed by CNN has
been lifted,'' said Smith. ``It's a pity that CNN executives simply
caved in to pressure'' from the Pentagon and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the story to die,'' he said. ``And they hanged us,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a cauldron of emotions continues to boil at CNN. Some
former colleagues question why Oliver and Smith were fired and
executive producer Pamela Hill was pushed to resign, but on-air
correspondent Peter Arnett and higher CNN executives were allowed
to keep their jobs. Throughout the organization, there is
embarrassment and unease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know most of what has transpired here, and it is grief and
sadness and hurt and feelings of betrayal,'' said Steve Haworth,
vice president of public relations for the news network. ``And most
particularly those feelings of betrayal are aimed at Jack and
April.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The CNN termination was _ to say the least _ an unexpected
detour in a lifetime of overachievement for Oliver, a South
Carolina native and the great-great-granddaughter of Confederate
general Wade Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood swimming champion, she entered Princeton University
at 16 and took time off to work on Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign
and at an Afghani refugee camp in Pakistan before graduating cum
laude in 1983. She was a freelance journalist for five years and a
reporter for the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour for another five before
joining CNN in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The media operation to restore her good name is a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   Before the firing, Oliver said, CNN had told her and Smith not
to talk to reporters. Immediately afterward, though, April's
father, Wade Hampton Oliver, bought a fax machine and stayed up
until 2 a.m. sending news organizations copies of a letter his
daughter wrote to CNN President Rick Kaplan complaining of her
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Olivers had come to Washington from their home town
of Columbia, S.C., for a duplicate bridge tournament. April's
mother, Ellen, remained as a informal booking agent after the faxes
inspired scores of interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent that April couldn't get to interviews and
answer the phone,'' she explained. ``And I had to see that she had
proper meals. She is expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Oliver has a Caesarean section scheduled for July 28 and
interrupts her interviews for an afternoon nap. Given three months'
severance pay, she hopes her CNN medical insurance will cover the
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jay Schulkin, is a neuroscientist who has been
supportive and then some, said Oliver. ``He wants to hit
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Their 6-year-old daughter, Danielle, is delighted to have her
mommy home all day. She is less enthusiastic about the constant
phone calls that disrupt play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to preserve the integrity of the story by getting
as many facts out as possible,'' Oliver tells a radio interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to restore her reputation, of course, would be an
independent confirmation of her report. Over and over, she tells
interviewers of her disappointment that other reporters are
pursuing the ``media story'' rather than trying to find out more
about Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver recalls her dismay about a story in The Washington Post
that ``lumped my piece in with all these pieces of fiction'' _
recent journalistic scandals in which Boston Globe columnist
Patricia Smith and New Republic writer Stephen Glass admitted
making up sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, that was a killer,'' said Oliver. ``Those weren't
actors that we had doing on-camera interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot of courage for survivors of Tailwind to come
forward and tell their stories on TV, she said. Comparing the
report to fiction ``is an insult to them and to broadcast
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Oliver smiles at the vases of ``condolence flowers'' on her
dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about about a crisis is that you find
out who your friends are,'' she said. Colleagues from her magazine
unit at CNN gave her a baby shower last week.
</P>
<P>
   She knew the Tailwind story would generate intense criticism,
and prepared a detailed briefing book for her bosses at CNN about
her sourcing and the coming fire storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected controversy, but I didn't expect this much
controversy,'' she admitted. ``I certainly didn't expect to be
without a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues heard she would be leaving before she did. It was
announced at a July 2 conference call involving CNN employees in
Atlanta and Washington that she had been asked to resign _ except
that she hadn't. Shortly thereafter, however, Oliver said she was
given a choice: acknowledge mistakes in the Tailwind report and
``resign with dignity'' or ``be terminated immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking by the story, she chose termination.
</P>
<P>
   Some time after the baby comes, she hopes to begin some
freelance projects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a photographer from Newsweek has arrived for a shoot.
April's mother rushes to tidy up.
</P>
<P>
   It is a comfortable stone house, built in the 1940s, with
hardwood floors and overflowing bookcases and a fireplace with a
mantelpiece filled with family photos. There are stacks of CDs,
mainstream music by Mozart and Roy Orbison and Judy Garland and
Louis Armstrong. There is a trampoline in back yard and a gnawed
tennis ball belonging to a golden retriever named Red and a swing
on a tree limb and a playhouse for Danielle.
</P>
<P>
   There is a double-barreled Rolodex filled with phone numbers of
sources from scores of stories. Before the Operation Tailwind
report, Oliver produced reports for CNN on anorexia and welfare
reform and Colin Powell and Princess Diana and a myriad of other
topics. She traveled around the world for MacNeil/Lehrer, reporting
on the collapse of communism and South African elections and
Nicaraguan politics and other events.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek photographer is focusing near a table piled with
Beanie Babies. Ellen Oliver frets over her daughter's hair. And a
visitor wonders when _ or if _ a very pregnant producer will return
to her more familiar place behind the cameras rather than in front
of them.

GIVE LAWMAKER CREDIT FOR WHAT TAX RELIEF KANSANS HAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Phill Kline and his fellow tax-relief crusaders
continue to have their view of the world validated by Kansas'
explosive revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Shawnee Republican has made a fair shake for taxpayers the
centerpiece of his political career, but all he's gotten for his
trouble from GOP moderates is a jaundiced eye and a maverick label.
Meantime, many Kansans who have benefited most from Kline's
tax-relief quest probably are unaware of the good he's done them.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say, though, that considerably less tax relief
would have emanated from Topeka in recent years without the House
Taxation Committee chairman's dogged crusade. He was vindicated yet
again last week when the final accounting for fiscal year 1998
showed tax receipts much higher than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   Although revenue estimates for fiscal '98 were revised upward by
$70 million in April, the final tax take topped even those high
expectations by $52 million when the fiscal year ended June 30. All
told, tax collections were up 10.5 percent and individual income
tax receipts rose a whopping 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This probably didn't surprise Kline, who continually insists the
state can afford more tax relief than many want to give. Moderates
usually counsel caution, warning that good economic times can't be
counted on to continue forever. Kline says that's no excuse for the
state not to share more of its bounty with its taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this clash of wills, the argument has focused on
whether state government should make out better than the taxpayers
who provide the revenue. Kline says Topeka gets too much of the
best of things, and the latest revenue figures seem to bear him out
convincingly. How many average Kansas taxpayers, for instance,
enjoyed the same 10-percent-plus income boost that state government
experienced during the past year?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, substantial tax relief was enacted during this
year's session of the Legislature, but tax relief Topeka-style
doesn't do justice to the average taxpayer. It's a scatter-gun
approach that may or may not get the money back into the pockets of
those who make the state's continuing windfalls possible.
</P>
<P>
   What Kansas needs, and what Kline and his allies should pursue,
is a mechanism such as Missouri's Hancock Amendment that mandates
rebates directly to taxpayers when the state's income growth
outpaces that of its taxpaying benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide tax revolt launched 20 years ago last month by
voter approval of California's Proposition 13 has done much to ease
the burden of taxpayers throughout the land. As Policy Review
recently noted, within two years of the initiative's passage, 43
states had moved to provide some form of property tax relief, 15
had lowered income tax rates and 10 indexed income taxes to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers in some states have fared better than others, and
while Kansas has had its moments, it hasn't exactly been in the
tax-relief vanguard. It still taxes food, for example, and until
recently had one of the most onerous property taxes on cars in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, as the economic expansion of the '90s has proceeded
apace, many in Topeka have resisted sharing the state's good
fortune fully with its taxpayers. Given the embarrassment of riches
of fiscal '98, it's obvious that Kansas taxpayers need the same
protection the Hancock Amendment provides for Missourians.

HALLMARK CARDS TO SPEND $310 MILLION TO BUY CREATIVE PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hallmark Cards Inc. said Thursday it is
spending $310 million to buy Creative Publishing plc in the United
Kingdom, the latest move in an international market share slugfest
with rival American Greetings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland-based American Greetings bought two United Kingdom
competitors earlier this year, which boosted its market share to
nearly 20 percent and over Hallmark's 14.5 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's move by Kansas City-based Hallmark would once
again put it back on top in the United Kingdom, home to the most
active card-buying population on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fitting claim because the first known commericially made
card was created in England in 1819. Per capita purchases of
greeting cards in the United Kingdom are 50 to 55 cards a year,
compared with 28 to 30 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest has always been to be the market share leader in
the United Kingdom...because it is such an important market,'' said
Hallmark spokesman Steve Doyal.
</P>
<P>
   When Hallmark completes its buyout of Creative Publishing, it
will own just under 30 percent of the greeting card market in the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Doyal said Creative Publishing is a perfect fit with Hallmark
because there is little overlap between the two. Hallmark is the
United Kingdom leader in everday cards, while Creative Publishing's
strength is in boxed cards. Plus, Doyal said, the two distribute
their products differently.
</P>
<P>
   As a result no layoffs are planned, and Hallmark will be able to
use a production facility owned by Creative Publishing. Hallmark
currently outsources its production in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark had worldwide sales of $3.66 billion last year,
compared with $2.2 billion for American Greetings, whose fiscal
year ended Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting card analyst E. Gray Glass III said the three biggest
greeting card markets in the world are the United States, the
United Kingdom and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday's move, American Greetings was No. 1 in the
United Kingdom and Canada, where it has more than 40 percent of the
market and Hallmark has 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Hallmark is the leader with an estimated
44 percent of the market, compared with about 30 percent for
American Greetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts Hallmark back on top in two of the three most
important markets,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the deal gets done.
</P>
<P>
   There was some supposition Thursday that American Greetings
would make a rival bid for Creative Publishing. American Greetings
spokesman Jim King said the company doesn't comment on speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say we've made two acquisitions in the U.K. this year,
one in March and one in May, that nearly doubled our market
position...and we're quite pleased with the way those have worked
out,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about American Greetings making a rival bid, Doyal said,
``It's hard to tell what they might do.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyal said Hallmark and Creative Publishing will make a formal
filing with the Office of Fair Trade, which will be followed by a
20-day comment period. It is possible, Doyal said, that if American
Greetings were going to make a rival bid, it would do so during
that period.
</P>
<P>
   Just how important is it to be No. 1 in any given market?
</P>
<P>
   In a American Greetings press release dated May 11, when it
acquired the second of two United Kingdom competitors this year, it
boasted of its strengthened market share in the United Kingdom, and
that it is No. 1 in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, King of American Greetings downplayed being No.
1 in a market just for the sake of being No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think us or Hallmark is going to get into a market
share game that doesn't make sense,'' King said. ``We're more
focused on does an acquisition make sense...than we're size X and
they're size Y.''

'80S VOICES ON PARALLEL FASHION TRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday July 12)  
(lh) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the moment that the hapless hero of Jay
McInerney's coming novel, ``Model Behavior,'' slaloms through a
crowd of air-kissing New York fashionistas at the ``party you have
been to 600 times already,'' you are prepared for 176 pages of
haute-runway literature.
</P>
<P>
   The book traces the unraveling relationship of a
fashion-magazine journalist and his size 6 girlfriend, who is
employed as a model in the New York hothouse of fashion, where
appearance is destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The book is one of two titles with themes of fashion and
celebrity that Alfred A. Knopf is preparing to publish in the next
six months. The second, ``Glamorama,'' is by Bret Easton Ellis, the
author of ``Less Than Zero'' and ``American Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   These two are not just any authors, of course. A decade or so
ago, at the outset of their careers, McInerney and Ellis were
regarded as chroniclers in touch with the tenor of the times, their
youthful characters experiencing dissipation against the background
rush of 1980s urban materialism.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, fashion, modeling and personal appearance have
assumed a focal place in popular culture, and McInerney and Ellis,
with uncanny timing, have popped up again as authors attuned to the
Zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion has become so all pervasive _ it reminds me of back in
the '80s when people asked why are you writing about drugs,''
McInerney said, referring to his first novel, ``Bright Lights, Big
City.'' ``To which I answer, How can you not?''
</P>
<P>
   McInerney, whose first wife was a model and who later lived with
another model, Marla Hanson, for four years, insisted that fashion
was only one strand in his novel _ although it is a thick one. In
the book, which is scheduled for publication in September, he makes
some rather stinging observations about the ``howling
mindlessness'' of the profession of modeling. And that state is
precisely what appeals to McInerney.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting about models is precisely nothing except
what we choose to invest in them,'' he said. ``They are empty
vessels, and by definition, they're pure surface. The model's job
used to be to sell clothes. And oddly enough it's become more and
more about selling a notion of glamor and celebrity. What appeals
to me about writing about a model is what it tells us about us.''
</P>
<P>
   McInerney shares a close friendship with Ellis, along with a
common editor and agent. They also write about literary characters
with a similar penchant for dating models.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, they don't share fashion tips, but McInerney does
include a passing reference in ``Model Behavior'' to Ellis, whose
blurb of praise for a short-story collection by one of the literary
characters is greeted with barbed enthusiasm: ``Oh, yeah, terrific.
All the homicidal slackers will skateboard straight to Barnes &AMP;
Noble for a copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Fisketjon, the editor for both authors, described the
titles as ``very, very different books. Jay's book is a highly
comic novel, and Bret's book _ certainly while extraordinarily
funny in the first half or third _ is a much darker, darker book''
(i.e. _ imploding hotels and plunging planes).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fisketjon said that Ellis has been working on his novel for more
than eight years, while McInerney's novel grew out of a short story
called ``Philomena'' that he wrote four years ago for The New
Yorker. McInerney's book also includes a collection of seven short
stories that span his career.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was traveling in London this week to promote a BBC
documentary about himself, and he did not respond to messages. A
paragraph in the publisher's fall catalogue refers to his new novel
of ``a young man in what is recognizably the fashion and celebrity
obsessed New York'' who is drawn into a shadowy mirror of that
society.
</P>
<P>
   But a friend of Ellis', Julie Grau, sketched out the broader
outlines of the novel, which is scheduled for publication in
January. The plot revolves around a sometime model and would-be
actor named Victor, who necessarily dates models and operates a
nightclub with a shadowy impresario. Real celebrities mingle with
Ellis' imaginary characters, and the plot shifts among the fashion
worlds of New York, London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grau, who is an editorial director at Riverhead Books, said
Ellis had conducted a considerable amount of personal research for
his novel, including cruising to Europe aboard the QE2 _ which
figures in his book _ and haunting the fashion shows of Paris. She
said that it was happenstance that two friends and contemporaries
like Ellis and McInerney were both fascinated by fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, both of them travel in this sophisticated New York
world in which the fashion industry winds its way through it,'' she
said. ``And I think it's just a coincidence of these two writers
emerging from this time, and traveling in the same circles and
finding something fascinating, lampoonable and emblematic of our
fixation, as a society, with beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the writers meet at these glittering parties, do they
exchange literary updates? Divvy up the searing anecdotes for their
novels?
</P>
<P>
   McInerney said that he and Ellis avoid the topic of their work.
</P>
<P>
   But, he joked, ``every once in a while he'll ask who made my
suit.''

WEATHER SATELLITE GETS EMERGENCY CALL TO ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Less than a month after completing tests on a
spare weather satellite parked in space high above the Midwest,
forecasters already are calling it to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration activated
the backup bird Thursday when one of the two older satellites that
gives a complete view of North America and surrounding oceans
threatened to go wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applaud our superior planning,'' quipped Gerald Dittberner,
satellite program manager for the agency in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Also applauding are forecasters on the 17th floor of the Bolling
Federal Building in Kansas City, where the Aviation Weather Center
provides crucial information for aircraft from the Philippines to
the Azores.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites also give earthbound folks advance notice of
hurricanes approaching in the Atlantic as well as storm systems
coming in from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Antennae on the federal building receive information from the
satellites that is just 7 minutes old. Losing a satellite would be
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forecasters sitting in downtown Kansas City would suffer
greatly trying to look at a real-time picture and see what's
happening out there,'' said Jim Henderson, deputy director of the
Aviation Weather Center.
</P>
<P>
   The weather center can warn a passenger jet from Japan to avoid
a storm near the International Date Line. It also can see into
valleys of the Sierra Nevada to caution a twin-engine plane about
fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to have a view from space,'' said Peter
Browning of the National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill, Mo. ``We
can see visible imagery during the day, and 24 hours a day we get
the various infrared channels.''
</P>
<P>
   With that information, forecasters can determine the temperature
of the cloud tops to judge the severity of a storm front sweeping
down the plains toward Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The space eyes are called GOES, which stands for geostationary
operational environmental satellite. They are parked 22,300 miles
above the equator where they rotate with the Earth, providing a
constant view below.
</P>
<P>
   One is parked on a longitude roughly in line with Philadephia
and the other on a line roughly with Juneau, Alaska. It is the west
one, GOES-9, that is dying. One of two gyroscopes that keep it
steady failed in June. Now the other one is acting up.
</P>
<P>
   So GOES-10, which was launched by NASA in April 1997 but
certified ``all system go'' only last month, is being pressed into
service. There will be little or no disruption in weather data or
in the familiar video loops seen on television newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   GOES-10 is now parked on a longitude roughly in line with
Denver. It will be moved west to the position of GOES-9, which will
be shoved a few hundred miles farther into space.
</P>
<P>
   This series of four GOES satellites, built by Loral Corp., cost
about $2 billion. Each was supposed to last at least five years.
GOES-9 lasted a little more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern one, GOES-8, has been operating more than four
years. The question now is whether it will keep working until the
next GOES is launched in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone through a single-satellite scenario before and we
didn't enjoy that a lot,'' Browning said. ``There was a lot of
finger-crossing hoping (GOES-9) wouldn't fail before we got a new
one up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dittberner added: ``So far, so good.''

STUDY RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT ANTIBIOTICS FOR ANIMALS CONSUMED BY
HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: To keep them healthy and speed their growth, the
nation's cattle, hogs, poultry and other food animals are fed 19
million pounds of antibiotics each year.
</P>
<P>
   But a new national study raised troubling health concerns
Thursday about the widespread practice.
</P>
<P>
   The routine use of antibiotics on farms has created strains of
disease-causing bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics and
infect more humans every year, according to the National Research
Council's study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Research Council report is a landmark because it
is the first authoritative U.S. report that explicitly acknowledges
that agricultural uses of antibiotics pose a risk to the public
health,'' said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, a health advocacy group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council committee that wrote the report
was led by James Coffman, Kansas State University provost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using antibiotics to control and treat diseases in animals
improves the safety of our food supply by providing healthier
sources of meat, cheese, milk and eggs,'' Coffman said in a
statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there have been a few cases in which resistant bacteria
have been passed to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the committee found that ``there is no doubt'' that
drug-resistant bacteria are passed from animals to humans. It can
occur through direct contact with animals or their manure, through
exposure to food contaminated by the bacteria or person-to-person
contact.
</P>
<P>
   The study said it's uncertain, though, how much the use of
antibiotics in animals has contributed to the recent increase in
resistant strains of bacteria that infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Public and animal health advocates have debated for years
whether the widespread use of low levels of antibiotics in food
animals might harm humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some debate, especially in agribusiness, that
says the use of antibiotics on animals is a separate pool (from the
human pool) and the animal usage can't affect the resistance
problem that people have,'' said Jean Halloran, director of the
Consumer Policy Institute for the Consumer's Union of United States
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee concluded this was not a debate,'' said
Halloran, who also served on the National Research Council
committee. ``It said, `This is not true. The pools overlap.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is the study's key finding, she said, and it should give
consumers another reason to make sure to cook meat thoroughly and
take other precautions, such as washing cutting boards and knives
after chopping chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have to say there is not yet a massive problem of
antibiotic resistant infections, for if it were we would know
that,'' Halloran continued. ``But the problem could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a point now where we can do something. We shouldn't
let this problem get out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Animal Health Institute, a trade
association of animal drug makers, said Thursday that the group has
yet to review the new study but believes questions remain about the
scientific certainty of the link between resistant strains in
animals and humans.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions should be resolved before any regulatory actions
occur, said Lisa Dry, the institute's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The group recently proposed its own plan to address the issue of
antibiotic use in animals. It includes new guidelines for the
prudent use of the drugs in farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the concerns of the human medial community that
overuse of these important medicines can lead to resistance,'' said
Alexander Mathews, president and CEO of the Animal Health
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some public health advocates, such as the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, have called for a government ban on
routine antibiotic use in food animals.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Research Council committee didn't go that far,
saying more research and data collection should be done first. The
committee's recommendations included:
</P>
<P>
   Create a national database on antibiotic use and resistance
trends that would be accessible to farmers, veterinarians, doctors
and other interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Establish a national oversight panel that includes regulators,
animal and human health experts, agriculture and consumer groups to
monitor the new data and to recommend how antibiotics should be
used in humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Improve the research budgets for developing new classes of
antibiotics. That would ensure a future alternative to the current
drugs in use.
</P>
<P>
   Educate the public on the proper use of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, antibiotic-resistant strains of salmonella and
other disease-causing bacteria have grown, raising new concerns
among public health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of human infection related to one type of salmonella, for
example, have remained relatively flat in the United States,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But 34
percent of those salmonella cases in 1996 involved a strain
resistant to five types of antibiotics. In 1980, less than one
percent involved antibiotic-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated
that this type of drug-resistant salmonella, known as DT104, may
now account for up to 340,0000 cases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This same strain has posed even more concern in Britain, where
some public health officials estimate it may account for more
sickness and death than any other type of salmonella. Britain has
banned the use of human antibiotics at low or ``subtherapeutic''
levels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the World Health Organization proposed phasing out the
use of antibiotics, particularly those used to treat humans, at
subtherapeutic levels.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years ago, scientists reported that using low
levels of antibiotics could increase the growth rate of farm
animals. Today, 88 percent of the antibiotic drugs used in
livestock and poultry are given at subtherapeutic levels, the
National Research Council study found.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs keep the animals healthier, especially when many are
confined tightly inside barns. The drugs are fed to the animals in
their feed or water.

CALL IT THE ART OF KILLING DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE THORSON  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The Supreme Court's recent ruling that the National
Endowment for the Arts can apply decency standards in choosing what
art it will fund ostensibly is an attempt to curb the means of
artistic expression. But its real target is the end of much
avant-garde art, namely its liberal social agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The defunding of some art on grounds of indecency and obscenity
is ironic, considering the government-funded obscenities we read
about every day. Think of the behavior of people whose five- and
six-figure salaries taxpayers pay annually. Where to begin? The
Lewinsky scandal? Trent Lott's misinformation campaign against
gays?
</P>
<P>
   What does it say about our society that we have less trouble
giving lots of money to scoundrels and bigots than a measly
one-time grant to a lone artist who chose to smear herself with
chocolate and bean sprouts as a means of self-expression and
feminist social comment?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Finley is not unique among contemporary artists in
devoting a lot of her time to thinking about where this society is
falling short and where it's headed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is she unique in stridently expressing her criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-sixties agit-prop'' is how The Wall Street Journal, in a
recent editorial, referred to art funded by the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   Agit-prop. With or without the artist's consent, art has always
been used as propaganda for something _ from the Christian faith to
Stalinism. And as anyone who has taken the time to experience it
knows, at the heart of most of this so-called ``post-sixties
agit-prop'' art is advocacy of the values most important to
democracy: tolerance for difference, intolerance of discrimination,
the free and open exchange of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Now what could be more worthy of funding than that?
</P>
<P>
   One concern expressed by The Wall Street Journal editorialist
was that ``endowment grants were being used to jump the social
queue, to in a single funding cycle establish as normal ideas and
lifestyles that otherwise might take a generation to enter the
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed. Women and people of color, lesbians and homosexuals
all have reaped the benefits of this agitprop art's leadership role
in making the mainstream respond to their complaints and concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, for instance, over Robert Mapplethorpe's
photographs, which helped to spawn this long-running funding debate
and the so-called ``culture wars,'' did more to focus public
attention on the gay presence in the population and their issues
than any talk show could ever achieve. But if there hadn't been
public funding involved, it might well have taken a generation to
get these issues on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A not unimportant dimension of these public-funded art
controversies is their role as lightning rod for the country's
philistinism, Puritanism, religion-based intolerance and
stultifying ignorance about art's role in shaping culture.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the way contemporary artists go about it is not very
pretty, or downright offensive to some. But the aims of their art
are quite different from those of the great art of the past
commissioned by the church, the monarchy and the nobility, which is
the art that contemporary art-bashers invariably hold up as a
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that much recent art funded by the NEA has been
about holding democracy to its promise. Apparently, a lot of
powerful people have a problem with that.

`HANGING GARDEN' HAS SOME BLOOMING WEIRDNESS IN IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Hanging Garden,'' a romantic drama, is rated R for
language, sexuality and drug use. Running time is 1 hour 31
minutes. Two out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most movies fail because they don't try to be anything. ``The
Hanging Garden,'' at least, fails because it tries to be too much.
</P>
<P>
   This surreal Canadian comedy//drama practically defies
categorization. That it's a homecoming movie and a
dysfunctional-family movie is obvious from the first scene, when
our gay central character returns after a 10-year absence to attend
his sister's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   It's an event to forget. Alcohol-sodden Dad snores through the
ceremony, Granny is in a full-throttle Alzheimer's episode, the
sullen bride is a vision of venom in white, and Mom quietly seethes
at the indignity of it all. To top it off, the new arrival
discovers he has a 10-year-old tomboy sister he never knew existed
and has to endure an amorous pass from the groom.
</P>
<P>
   Then things get weirder.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fitzgerald's writing//directing debut takes its title from
the family's huge garden. The clan is so horticulturally obsessed
that Dad (Peter MacNeill) is known as ``Poppy,'' Mom (Seana
McKenna) is named Iris, Sis (Kerry Fox) is Rosemary, the
unsuspected little sibling (Christine Dunsworth) is Violet. Our
visiting hero is Sweet William (Chris Leavins).
</P>
<P>
   Other characters are called Black-Eyed Susan, Laurel, Basil and
Dusty Miller. There's a dog named Peat.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the wedding, the family falls apart. Dad throws
his weight around and threatens to get violent. After years of
putting up with the garbage, Mom vanishes one night.
</P>
<P>
   Weirder still, Sweet William is haunted by earlier versions of
himself. He keeps stumbling across himself as an abused little boy
(Ian Parsons) and as an obese, miserable gay teen (Troy Veinotte)
who halfway through the film hangs himself from a tree (thus ``The
Hanging Garden'').
</P>
<P>
   Even though much of ``The Hanging Garden'' doesn't work, one can
only admire the efforts of a large and remarkably talented cast who
make these characters seem painfully real and who somehow make
palatable the script's more outlandish notions.

<P>
   Humans won't have to go to subterranean settlements or colonize
another planet to solve it, but overpopulation is a really big
thing. It is mosly caused by lack of birth control and education,
and young marriage, according to Christina Horpeza, the public
information specialist for the Population Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council was founded 30 years ago to address the problem of
overpopulation, to understand the factors that affect it. Horpeza's
group believes education is the key, because they found that the
more educated people are, the fewer children they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of an over-simplification of this situation, but
basically when people are educated, they tend to have fewer
children and they have them spaced apart,'' said Horpeza. ``It
makes for healthier children and it's better for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   She said overpopulation was a very complex situation that you
can't attribute to one cause or another, but Horpeza thinks there
should be a worldwide effort to fund programs to teach people about
birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the women, and it's good for the society. In
many countries, the custom is for children to get married when
they're still teenagers. They start having babies right away. If
you get married when you're 15, you can have 10 children by the
time you're 30. If you get married when you're 20, you have fewer
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there could be laws that say you can't get married
before age 16, 18, whatever. But to have people actually respect
the laws and obey the laws, you need education to tell them why
this is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a point where throughout the world, the largest
number of youth are entering their reproductive ages, 16 through
44.''
</P>
<P>
   The council does a lot of studies and found that it's not
necessarily ``developed versus developing'' countries when looking
at what poses the greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that more and more people are moving into cities
and putting a lot of stress on the environment,'' said Horpeza.
``This happens in developed countries as well as in developing
countries, but a lot of times in developing countries, they don't
have the infrastructure to provide services for the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key component is actually the distribution of food, getting
food from the area where it's grown to where the people are who
need it. You could be a producer of zillions of acres of meat. If
you can't get it to the people, what good is it? That's probably
the bigger problem right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Horpeza said that there are a certain number of births per
couple that the earth needs to replace itself, and that is 2.1,
which would mean that if every couple in the world were to have two
children it would keep the population at the same level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The .1 is to allow for people that die young,'' she said.
``(And) some people will be having three (children), some will have
one.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how she felt about the law in China that says how
many children a couple should have, Horpeza said that she didn't
feel it was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should have laws. It should be voluntary.
That policy is coercive. People try to get around that and they end
up hurting themselves or other people. They have done research and
found that the girl babies are less cared for and sometimes they're
not reported to officials because the Chinese prefer boy babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should be told how many children you're going to have,
but people should be aware of the health implications and knowing
how to have the resources to take care of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if some of the countries that are overpopulated
should shift some of their people to underpopulated countries to
balance things out, Horpeza said that it was already happening and
not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans are trying desperately to come here to make a living.
When they come here, they find conditions aren't fair,'' she said.
``Then we have a whole debate in Congress about whether we should
support them with our welfare system or educate their children. In
Indonesia where their economy is going down, they're trying to
immigrate to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never that simple. There's always one country with a good
economy that everybody wants to go to. All the pressure is on that
country. Hopefully, the more we go along, we educate more people
and we work out equitable economies.''
</P>
<P>
   The best approach, she said again, is for ``children to be in
school. Go to school for as long as possible and learn. Don't start
quitting school to work and have babies.''

A PROPOSAL THAT MAKES SENSE FOR TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tom Birmingham knew he'd struck a chord when he stopped
in his Chelsea Dunkin' Donuts for the coffee he gulps before
heading to his State House office.
</P>
<P>
   The morning paper had splashed the Massachusetts Senate
president's bold suggestion that the state offer a $20,000 signup
bonus for outstanding candidates to become public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur Orloff wants to be one of those teachers,'' declared a
grinning Birmingham of one of the Dunkin' regulars. Later in the
day, the Chicago Tribune, Washington Post and Time Magazine would
ring up seeking details. But Birmingham knew that once you've
cracked the Dunkin' Donuts kaffee klatsch krowd with a
conversation-provoking notion, events take on a life of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time has Birmingham, the most liberal of the
commonwealth's top state-level officeholders, taken an idea and
twisted it into a legislative proposal that challenges
conservatives to put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   You want better school teachers? Then put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for,'' said the Senate president, a labor
lawyer by trade with strong union sympathies. If the best and
brightest college grads want no part of the chore of improving the
public schools, then give them enough of an incentive to make them
swerve out of their other career choices into the educational
trenches.
</P>
<P>
   His idea was spawned in the dismay over the teacher
certification test scores, when more than half the applicants
failed. ``First we had the teacher test results, which were
apalling,'' said Birmingham Thursday. ``Then we had two weeks of
gnashing-of-teeth, recriminations, the predictable blame-tossing,
and so forth. Plus, we had the news of the big increase in the
state (tax yield) surplus. So I saw the convergence, and married
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   His bold scheme caught the ususal bemoaners of public education
flat-footed. Many of our leading lights of the capitalist system
believe fervently in the merits of financial incentives for
corporate bosses, tort lawyers, first basemen and point guards. But
try and implement any such scheme for public servants, and there's
hell to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole slew of reasons why bright college graduates
do not want to become school teachers, but one of them is
financial.''
</P>
<P>
   So he will ask the state Senate to approve, in its financial
definciency budget of the year, which will pass before July 31,
enough money to start a system of $20,000 bonus incentives for the
best and brightest of the college crop.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is roughly parallel to the deal the US military struck
with medical students in past years, when the services had
difficulty retaining doctors. Uncle Sam paid for medical school
tuition, in exchange for a certain number of years' commitment to
serve as a military doc. The Pentagon has launched different
incentive programs to retain highly-trained personnel such as
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching has taken a nosedive in status in recent years, said
Birmingham. ``We used to rely on gender discrimination, when all
those bright professional women who could not look forward to a
career in medicine or the law became school teachers instead.
</P>
<P>
   With only seven GOP senators in the 40-member Senate, Birmingham
is confident he can deliver the votes to put the Senate on record
for his bonus plan. He mocked conservatives who say ``they are
'shocked, shocked,' that we have to pay people more than we do to
be teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses in other states, in the $1,500 range, are nowhere near
high enough to affect the recruitment stream, he reasoned.
``Nobody's going to make a career decision for 1,500 bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is a capitalist system, he argues, and if money is the
huge incentive for mutual fund traders and stock brokers and big
league ballplayers, why don't the same rules apply to essential
professionals like teachers?
</P>
<P>
   But the teacher bonus may come to an abrupt demise in the
Massachusetts House, where Speaker Tom Finneran (D-Dorchester),
elected in the first place by the votes of Republican House
members, has stalled a number of Senate-approved initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's plan to spend $72 million on improvements to or
near Foxboro Stadium for the benefit of New England Patriots ownber
Robert Kraft is going nowhere in the House. And the Senate-approved
hike in the state's minimum wage, to $6.75 in stages, and thence to
be indexed to inflation, is similarly stalled, as are various
measures like a domestic partners' bill.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these Senate-passed bills are being held hostage to
Finneran's conservative philosophic constructs. A pattern has
developed where Birmingham, a product of the Chelsea public
schools, a Catholic high school (Austin Prep), and Harvard and
Oxford, pushes progressive ideas, which come to naught in the
House. That pattern seems not to disturb Acting Gov. Cellucci,
whose re-election strategy seems to consist of trying not to rock
any boat, no matter how small a dinghy, in the scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this session, Birmingham had challenged the business
community, which has been bemoaning the lack of skilled workers in
this Golden Age of an economy.
</P>
<P>
   The business lobby had been agitating for two causes: a
reduction in the unemployment compensation tax, because the flush
times had built up a considerable surplus in the fund that pays
unemployment benefits; and some state financial help to retrain
workers whose skills need upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham offered them a deal: he'd ask the Legislature to
reduce the employer-paid comp tax by $98 million, while at the same
time setting aside $18 million for the state to underwrite the
re-training of existing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you and I _ the taxpayers _ were going to be asked to pay
for retraining, that was the No. 1 priority for Associated
Industries of Massachusetts (the prime business lobby). But when
AIM saw my offer, their reply was `no deal.' They only want
retraining if someone else pays for it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the legislative session due to end July 31, and with little
more than passage of the required $19.4 billion state budget due to
be accomplished, Birmingham seems to be setting out some bold
positions in hopes that next year more might be achieved.

   GM-STRIKE _ It's been nearly three decades since the General
Motors Corp. has faced more pressure to settle labor disputes with
a workforce that has crippled its production and caused
billion-dollar losses. Heading into this weekend, anticpiation is
high that GM and the United Auto Workers can settle two strikes at
plants in Flint, Mich. that started in early June and has idled
162,000 workers. But if Flint accords can't be reached this
weekend, GM losses will start climbing towards $2 billion and the
automaker could suffer permanent losses to its market share. The
automaker also must keep making progress in talks with Local UAW
leaders in Dayton and Indianapolis or risk having a repeat of the
Flint labor unrest later this summer. Everyone from the striking
workers to GM dealers and suppliers continue to feel the economic
crunch of the strike. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

 &HT;    Apple's new widens range of peripherals
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The iMac, Apple Computer Inc.'s ballyhooed economy
computer, represents a big step toward the mainstream of personal
computing for the company that prides itself on making computers
for an elite minority, industry experts said recently at the
Macworld Expo.
</P>
<P>
   That step is the connection for devices such as printers,
scanners and joysticks, which are known as peripherals. In using
just the Universal Serial Bus, the iMac will be able to connect to
a much wider range of peripherals than previous Macintosh models.
</P>
<P>
   By abandoning proprietary connections such as its Apple Desktop
Bus and Macintosh modem and printer ports, and switching to the USB
technology, Apple essentially allows iMac owners to buy
off-the-shelf peripherals that are made for machines from IBM, Dell
Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. The USB, technology is one
of three commonly used connections throughout the much larger
IBM-compatible industry. The others are parallel ports and serial
bus ports. USB also replaces Apple's proprietary connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``USB is an emerging industry standard,'' Apple's interim chief
executive Steve Jobs told an audience of about 3,000 Mac users
Wednesday at Macworld Expo in the Jacob Javits Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of peripherals will be available for the Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that in the future all Macs will accommodate
only the USB technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of software titles available for those PCs, the
peripherals do not readily work on the Macintosh operating system.
The system incompatability and Apple's tiny 4 percent share of the
computer market have drastically limited the choices of software
and hardware available to Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of the switch to USB connections, that hardware
incompatibility vanishes with a relatively simple software change
that allows the equipment and the Mac operating system to talk to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that accommodates a non-specific Mac interconnect is
an improvement for Mac users,'' said Steve Dube of Wasserstein &AMP;
Pirella in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dube also disagreed with a manager from one of Apple's key
peripheral suppliers, who said Thursday that Jobs' has taken a
major gamble by limiting iMac to only one type of connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think USB is not a wild bet for Apple,'' he said. ``That's
probably going to be a standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Apple depends on hardware companies to invest the money
on programming that will let their products work with Macintosh
machines. Mindful of that, Apple brought a dozen or so of them
together Thursday in the Jacob Javits Convention Center to talk
about their products.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few months warning about Apple's plans for USB,
Hewlett-Packard Co. rushed into production a chip-carrying adapter
so iMac customers can use any of five HP 670C- or 690C-series
Deskjet printers when the computer is shipped in the middle of
August.
</P>
<P>
   Those printers cost $199 to $249. The $79 adapter is a cable
connection between the iMac USB port and the printers' serial port,
but HP will put USB connections directly on future printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a transition product,'' said Hugh Amick of HP. ``We plan
to come up with a printer that provides out-of-the-box
connectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more talked about peripheral products at the
semi-annual Macintosh show is the SuperDisk from Imation.
</P>
<P>
   Built for the iMac and selling for $179, SuperDisk is a
floppy-disk drive with a USB connection. Imation, an Oakdale,
Minn., company that was spun off from 3M a few years ago, has high
hopes for the product because Apple's iMac has no floppy disk
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding it cut costs on the iMac, which at $1,299 already is
priced well above sub-$1,000 entry-level products from Compaq, HP
and others. Apple also justified the decision by noting that floppy
discs traditionally have been used to back up files and to transfer
work between computers.

   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ A former neighbor, seeking to enliven my
convalescence from a recent hospital trip, called to ask if I read
romance fiction. I hated to tell her, but love stories usually
embarrass me. It's not that I'm opposed to love. I value it in
people and in dogs _ but seldom in books. I prefer war and murder
and suspense. How do you tell a kind, romantic-minded lady that?

   CLINTON-FIRESPEACH _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ President Clinton
made a brief stop recently in fire-weary Central Florida to thank
firefighters, sympathize with burned-out families and deliver three
messages; one of which was that Florida is ready to welcome
tourists again and needs the economic boost to recover. (McLachlin,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FIREFIGHTERS _ Greg Weston, a sheriff's deputy, has been one of
those firefighters for the past month in Flagler County, Florida,
where deputies, paramedics and even regular citizens were pressed
into service to try to save this small county.He's one of hundreds
of people in Flagler County who have gone above and beyond the call
of duty in the past month in this rural county. (Nesmith, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   SMOOTH-LEGS _ Finally, a sweet solution to shaving your legs.
</P>
<P>
   Sugaring, one of the newest salon methods for removing unwanted
hair, is also one of the oldest. The syruplike recipe _ sugar,
lemon juice and herbs _ has been used by Middle Eastern and
Mediterranean women for centuries, often before their wedding

<P>
   STYLE-STOCKINGS _ The question of which _ if any _ hosiery to
wear in the summertime qualifies as a ``Darned if you do, darned if
you don't'' predicament. Thin though it is, hosiery's still one
extra layer that many women would rather leave home when the
temperature climbs. But many don't have a choice: Due to social or
professional dictates, they simply can't go bare-legged. (Walton,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED 7/8. EMBARGOED UNTIL 7/12.

   AUDIO-CABARET _ This is not Liza Minnelli's ``Cabaret.'' Forget

the '90s, deliciously delivered to disc by Tony Award winners Alan
Cumming and Natasha Richardson. (Janich, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED 7/8.

<P>
   LUCINDAWILLIAMS _ NASHVILLE, Tenn.--The perfect sound can live
in your mind like a landscape you know by heart. When others
finally hear it, they will heap praise upon you for getting it so
right. Until then, you may be dismissed as a ``nutty
perfectionist'' by band mates or even The New York Times. And
instead of talking about your music, every interviewer will want to
chat about being obsessive. Welcome to Lucinda Williams' nightmare.

   VIDEO-GOODWILL _ A superior After School Special for adults
(with oral sex jokes, no less), Good Will Hunting, written by
boyhood pals Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, isn't the masterpiece the
Academy Award voters would have you believe. But what it is _ a
literate, beautifully acted, character-driven movie _ has become so

WHEN LIFE IS A DAY AT THE BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.C., Va., Fla., Hawaii, Mass.)   (bl)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   His full-color business card shows him on the white sands of
Lanakai Beach in Oahu, wearing white shorts and matching knit
shirt, his shadow knifing out into the blue-green waters.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmering above the water in print the color of the sand is the
simple identification ``Dr. Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Stephen Leatherman sounds like something from a
Carl Hiassen novel, from his ``Dr. Beach'' moniker to his place of
employment (fictitious-sounding but mushrooming Florida
International University in Miami), to his role as an academic who
regularly turns up in magazines like Conde Nast Traveler or on
shows like ``Regis and Kathie Lee'' rating the world's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Beach's nice-work-if-you-can-get-it life style seems like an
inspiration, sort of Jimmy Buffett meets Carl Sagan. But rather
than fiction, Leatherman is an example of the way a few media-savvy
academics manage to transform themselves from mere toilers in
arcane academic groves to mini-celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherman is a respected scientist in the field of
environmental coastal science, with 13 books and 147 academic
papers to his credit. But he does more than write on the details of
littoral drift, inlet dynamics, overwash processes and dune
migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became so well-known at the University of Maryland that one
of the vice presidents said, `With you out here, Leatherman, we
don't need other professors for publicity,''' he said of his
previous posting. ``Frankly, it became a problem at my department.
Here I was publishing like crazy, bringing in a million dollars in
research grants, but, boy, were they jealous. They just went
bananas. They tried to put a basket over me, hide my light. They're
glad I left, and I'm glad too, but I can't ask for a better
situation than I have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Beach's rise from beach-obsessed youngster to
beach-and-publicity-obsessed professor began in Charlotte, N.C.,
where his father turned most of his backyard into a sandbox and the
young scholar to be spent hours preparing for his life's work by
building elaborate sand castles.
</P>
<P>
   He attended North Carolina State, where he took part in a
work-study program on beach erosion, spending frigid winter months
driving between Raleigh and the Outer Banks. He got his doctorate
at the University of Virginia, then settled into a life at the
University of Maryland that he figured would amount to a lot of
papers with titles like ``Barrier Island Dynamics: Overwash
Processes and Aeolian Transport'' or ``Lamination Sampling
Techniques for Unconsolidated Sediments.''
</P>
<P>
   His life changed in 1989 when a reporter for Conde Nast Traveler
called looking for a list of his favorite beaches. He came up with
10 off the top of his head, which turned to an instant publicity
bonanza when published in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing if not an astute marketer, Leatherman decided to make
the list an annual event, with each year's winner retired from
competition and the others judged on things like beach width, sand
quality, water color, amount and quality beach development,
frequency of rip currents and presence of seaweed, jellyfish and
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Top 10 and all seven of the retired ``National
Winners'' are in Florida and Hawaii. But East Hampton Beach and
Westhampton Beach on New York's Long Island cracked the Top 20 this
year, as did Coast Guard Beach, Mass., the only other East Coast
beach north of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Released each Memorial Day, the ranking has become the coastal
version of Blackwell's list of the world's worst-dressed women and
turned Dr. Leatherman into enough of a media creature that his
publicity material lists 63 television appearances, from the
``Today'' show to Globo television in Brazil. Last summer he moved
to Florida International, which has grown in its 26 years into a
school with 30,000 students, for which he is director of the
Laboratory of Coastal Research and International Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   He is a critic of much seaside development. But unlike his
fellow high-profile beach expert, Dr. Orrin Pilkey of Duke
University, who is viewed as an unabashedly fierce opponent of
beach development, Leatherman positions himself as an environmental
centrist. He sees a role for beach nourishment programs, rebuilding
eroded beaches with tons of imported sand. But he says the U.S.
Corps of Engineers has turned beach nourishment into a bloated
industry and that the federal government is supporting it by
directing millions of dollars to projects better financed with
local hotel and restaurant taxes.
</P>
<P>
   With water levels rising, beaches eroding and coastal property
potentially at risk in the trillions of dollars, Leatherman can
persuasively argue that his work, as cushy as it may sound, is
important and of the moment as well as fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 100 cities on barrier islands that are on a
collision course with nature,'' he said. ``You can say those
environments are dynamic and shifting and not very suitable for
development, but what are you going to do? Let Atlantic City or
Miami Beach wash away? It's not realistic. In 1979, when Miami's
beach was wasting away, you were looking at the development of a
waterfront slum. Now the beach is back, and it's paid for itself
100 times over.''
</P>
<P>
   It's rough work, but someone has to do it. His most recent opus
is a slick, colorful guidebook called ``America's Best Beaches.''
It shows him, pencil and checklist in hand, hard at work on the
beach, with a written description above, ``Dr. Beach at work.'' He
said he spends about 20-25 percent of his time on the road,
examining the nation's beaches from the ground or the air. Over the
last 10 years he has been to all 650 of them at one time or
another.
</P>
<P>
   And how does he spend vacation with his wife and children,
Stephen Beach and Sandra?
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually go to the beach,'' he said.

HANDKERCHIEFS FOR HANDLING THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID COLMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As anyone who has been in these Yankee parts lately
knows well, the South has no monopoly on stifling heat and
humidity. The question is: Why should Southern gentlemen have a
monopoly on that wonderful summertime accessory, the pocket
handkerchief?
</P>
<P>
   A white linen handkerchief can do more for a man's personal
style and comfort during the summer heat than the lightest-weight
tropical wool suit. It is odd that what was once a simple
utilitarian item has acquired a reputation as a stuffy, antebellum
accessory.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame, said Mimmo Spano, the custom tailor at Bergdorf
Goodman. ``When you're wearing a suit in the summer, and it's hot,
and you have a little sweat, you take out the handkerchief and mop
your brow with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A pocket handkerchief also lends a note of elegance to a jacket
worn without a tie. Since summer is normally a season of casual
dress, the handkerchief becomes something of a wardrobe hero.
``It's a casual look; that's the idea,'' Spano said.
</P>
<P>
   A handkerchief looks best folded square and placed in the
pocket, or stuffed casually in with the forefinger, the points
sticking out. A multi-pointed wonder folded with the thoroughness
of an origami swan defeats the purpose. ``To me that's too
contrived,'' Spano said. ``It looks good when it looks natural.''
</P>
<P>
   The same principle should be followed when buying handkerchiefs.
White linen without a monogram is the simplest and most versatile.
For more adventurous types, there are linen squares made in pastel
colors. Beyond that, one is entering the territory of the pocket
square, which is made of colored silk and often gaudily patterned.
Pocket squares are a bit of a tease, being too expensive, fragile
and unabsorbent for brow-wiping. ``They are more for show,'' Spano
said. Or at least, more for fall.
</P>
<P>
   At Saks Fifth Avenue, a box of three Irish linen handkerchiefs
is $38. Bergdorf's sells linen handkerchiefs for $25 each. At Polo
Ralph Lauren they are $18.75 each. They can sometimes be found even
more cheaply in your father's dresser.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from linen handkerchiefs, plain white cotton handkerchiefs
are also widely available. And for heat-wave emergencies, there is,
of course, the cotton bandanna, which can be bought from any number
of sidewalk vendors all over the city for about $2, in colors from
the traditional red, white and blue to green, orange and azure. If
one is dressed simply enough _ say, in a blue blazer, white shirt
and khakis _ a bandanna makes a colorful, summery flourish.
</P>
<P>
   But if the heat is still too much, the best retreat is somewhere
with good air-conditioning where a tie is optional.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Survival lessons learned in a land of extremes
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCaysville, Ga.--Call it extreme gardening. I knew from the
first pick-clashing-with-rock that gardening in the mountains would
be a whole different experience from what I was used to in Atlanta.
I'm still learning how different.
</P>
<P>
   The hard, red soil that newcomers to Atlanta complain about is a
piece of clay compared to the stony McCaysville hillside that my
young garden calls home. Dig a hole, or rather, hack one out, and
you always get as much rock as dirt. Well, I've hacked out quite a
few in the last several months, and put in a good number of plants,
many brought up from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   I rejoiced at the heavy, frequent downpours in this high rain
forest, as they made watering unnecessary for weeks and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the ex-Atlanta plants go through a second spring
because of cooler temperatures up here, I figured summer would be
comfortable, that they would continue adapting with ease. After
all, it never broils in the cool, cool mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Ha, ha, as Patsy Cline would sing, ain't that a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In my open space near the cabin, my new baby garden panted and
fainted as a merciless June bore down on it from sunup to sundown
and the rain forest morphed into desert. Longtime residents shook
their heads and allowed as how this was unusual, and I watered
furiously, watching the liquid get sucked into the ground, leaving
no trace of dampness after a minute or so _ a disappearance swifter
than the beautiful lizards in skins of intriguing colors and
textures.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing what survives is an education. A cutting from the Atlanta
corkscrew willow remains unfazed, while one from an anise fried and
died. Japanese painted ferns take a baking and keep on stepping.
Alas, several tomatoes did not; one plant did fine until the heat
scorched its stem black. Amazingly, one tomato was hanging on, even
as the stem leaned on a nearby stump to die.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, thistle, a natural mountain lover, always
stands tall. As do several volunteers, including a happy-faced
sunflower. The Japanese maples, tough as any tree, teeter on the
edge of brownout but grow more determined by the week. One
coreopsis thrives, one doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, I'm gardening Darwinian, with more sun and less
watering than even cacti could love. But in some ways, all
gardening is experimental. I just want plants to hold on, knowing
help is on the way; some year soon, the new trees _ pines,
hemlocks, magnolia _ will provide some shade.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, what lives will owe a lot to the nights. They're
much cooler than I expected after such hot days, and extremely
dewy. Every daybreak, the garden looks as if it's been watered.
</P>
<P>
   Dew. Mist. Stars bright. What nights: Extreme is their name.
Darker than any nights I've ever known. And so still that lightning
bugs seem to make a sound as they flash big lights that I still
mistake for airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of mistakes, I brought one to the mountains: a
container dogwood that got damaged when I foolishly allowed water
to stand on the soil's surface rain after rain. I unpotted it and
planted it here, hoping the dry, rocky ground would dry it out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, much of it already water-killed, the tree stands under the
broiling sun and wet nights. And I wait to discover if, in this
place of extremes, it will become a supreme miracle _ or a graphic
reminder against making your move too late.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wenders' great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bette R
</P>
<P>
   Balzac's 1846 novel may have been whittled down, but there's
still much to like about this deliciously tart comedy of
ill-manners and worse morals that slowly ripens into a revenger's
tragicomedy. Jessica Lange stars as the overlooked and
underestimated spinster who devises some elaborate revenge
scenarios for her shallow, wealthy relatives. The artful supporting
cast includes Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins. Rated R for sex and
nudity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13

   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-

   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist Hunter
S. Thompson and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's version of
Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to Vegas has a
brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But Johnny Depp
gives an amazing, uncompromised performance as Thompson. Rated R
for vulgar language, violence and extensive drug use. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B

<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   High Art R
</P>
<P>
   Former Brat Packer Ally Sheedy gives a stunning lesson in the
high art of acting as a once-famous photographer who becomes
involved, both personally and professionally, with an ambitious
young editor (Radha Mitchell) at a chichi Manhattan magazine. In
the film's pivotal role, Sheedy is all wired intensity and wary
irony. Rated R for language, drug use, nudity and sex. 1 hour, 42
minutes. (E.R.)

   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-

<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   I Went Down R
</P>
<P>
   In this blithely shapeless bit of blarney, two mismatched Irish
hoodlums _ one a mere amateur (Peter McDonald), the other more
hard-core (Brendan Gleeson) _ embark on a mission for their boss
that's more road-buddy movie than caper. Director Paddy Breathnach
seems perfectly comfortable with the movie's many detours, as do
his delightful actors, both of whom do a lot to help sustain the
film's laid-back, shaggy-dog style. But a little clipping around
the middle might have helped. Rated R for profanity, brief violence
and a brief sex scene. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Kurt and Courtney NR
</P>
<P>
   A flawed but fascinating documentary about the death of
Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and the transformation of the rocker's widow,
Courtney Love, from grunge queen to satin-swathed movie star. The
trouble is, one can't talk and the other won't. So filmmaker Nick
Broomfield fills in the blanks with assorted misfits, hangers-on,
Courtney-haters and conspiracy theorists (she had Kurt killed). Too
much time is spent in Jerry Springer territory, though the overall
effect is hard to shake. Not rated, but contains vulgar language
and references to drugs and alcohol. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (E.R.)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-'em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
No. 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first hour.
More than ever, the movie is an excuse to give its crack supporting
cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of comic riffs.
Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5 minutes. (S.M.)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious, redheaded orphan living in
a girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to scenes with motor
scooter-riding rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults.
Rated PG for comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological, the other spiritual) body. Rambling
and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that suggests
the early 1970s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still definitely worth
a look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1 hour,
30 minutes. (E.R.) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Suicide Kings R
</P>
<P>
   A retired hood (Christopher Walken) is kidnapped by some rich
kids (led by Henry Thomas and Jay Mohr) who hope his connections
can help them recover Thomas' kidnapped sister. The overly
schematic script begins to circle in on itself, becoming
claustrophobic and predictable. But Walken is terrific, bringing a
wry humor and an intimidating temper to his down-but-hardly-out
mobster. Rated R for language and violent situations. 1 hour, 47
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks the emotional resonance of the
original, it offers an exhilarating look into what it takes to be a
fed. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2 hours, 11 minutes.
(DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade:
B-

 &HT;    Presbyterian aims to reach minorities
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--As students at Columbia Theological Seminary return to
classes this fall, the seminary's president will be on the road or
in the air as the top representative of the 2.6 million-member
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Douglas W. Oldenburg, 63, was elected moderator of the
denomination's General Assembly at its annual meeting last month in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the helm of a denomination that has steadily lost
members over the past quarter-century, but whose losses seem to be
slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Oldenburg has high hopes for a denominational plan to establish
new congregations, especially among African-American, Hispanic,
Asian and other ethnic groups. The assembly heard a report on the
effort, with preliminary projections of starting more than 500
churches by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that our church has to come to terms with
the increasing ethnic diversity in the United States,'' Oldenburg
said. ``I think that concern is shared by the church leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also sees a growing enthusiasm for evangelism in the
denomination. ``It used to be when people moved into a community,
almost all of them visited churches,'' he said. ``That's no longer
the case. We have to be much more intentional than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Oldenburg has a four-point agenda for his year as moderator:
``Lift up'' the denomination and focus on what Presbyterians have
in common; emphasize education; focus on children; and encourage
Presbyterians to examine what they believe about the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will ask each congregation to get involved in a new
ministry to children _ such as a tutoring program, a shelter, a day
care center or parenting classes _ and urge each church to study
how to interpret scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Many divisive denominational debates over the years have been a
result of different ways of using the Bible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oldenburg, known as a theological liberal who grew up in a
conservative family, said he first decided to attend a seminary to
explore scripture in depth.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not expect Bible study to be ``a panacea that
will solve all our problems, but we need to discuss the issues with
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Oldenburg said, he is doing what he can to
recognize the theological diversity in his denomination. He
appointed the Rev. James Mead of Tacoma, Wash., as his vice
moderator. Mead, more theologically conservative than Oldenburg,
finished second in the balloting for moderator.

 &HT;    Long hidden in a tangle of greenery, a slave cemetery speaks to
a church's history _ and its present.
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ga.--Eddie Hawkins likes cutting grass and doing
yardwork. So, when he and his wife and five children joined little
Antioch Baptist Church in Fayette County(Ga.) about four years ago,
it seemed natural that Hawkins would keep up the church cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, 50, had no way of knowing that his volunteer job would
change the church.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up a wooded slope from the neatly laid-out plots of
graves one day, Hawkins noticed what appeared to be a tombstone on
the edge of an overgrown wooded area nearby. With his hedge
clippers and his weed trimmer, he freed the stone of the brambles
and briers that nearly covered it, brushed it off and told the
occupant of the grave below, ``Welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins had exposed the edge of a divide that runs through the
history of the South, splitting people into owner and property,
slave and free, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Recently on a sunny summer Saturday, about two dozen members of
Antioch and Fayetteville's New Hope Baptist Church gathered to
continue Hawkins' work. From the vines and bushes and trees, they
have reclaimed more than 100 graves.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Antioch and New Hope congregations are mainly white.
Most of the people buried in the graves are believed to be slaves
and their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   In the cemetery near the church, the mortal remains of revered
church members lie under carefully maintained marble and granite.
``Asleep in Jesus, Blessed Sleep,'' says the stone of Charity
Whitaker, a mother who died at 60. ``Darling, We Miss Thee,'' the
brokenhearted parents of 13-year-old Clifford Watkins Tombs wrote
in 1911. ``A Beloved Wife,'' V.W. Mills put on the grave of his
Viola when she died at 21.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, most of the newly uncovered graves are merely
sunken rectangles in the rich brown dirt with plain flat broken
rocks at each end. Two are mounds carefully covered in seashells. A
handful have engraved stones.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 150 years after the Southern Baptist Convention was
founded in Augusta, in part to defend the right of its members to
own slaves, the country's largest Protestant denomination issued a
formal apology. ``Whereas, many of our Southern Baptist forebears
defended the `right' to own slaves, and either participated in,
supported or acquiesced in the particularly inhumane nature of
American slavery,'' the resolution says in part, ``be it therefore
resolved, that we ... lament and repudiate historic acts of evil
such as slavery, from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest.
...''
</P>
<P>
   The official statement of Antioch's denomination, passed
overwhelmingly in the air-conditioned hall of the Georgia World
Congress Center, seems remote and institutional from the side of
the graves of the anonymous slaves in the Antioch churchyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Elton Johnson, Antioch's pastor, said the church is not
cleaning up the slave graves because of any denominational
position. ``We're doing it for one reason,'' he said, ``we're
righting a wrong.'' Johnson, 64, is a former missionary to Brazil
and college dean who sells home security systems during the week.
He came to metro Atlanta about five years ago after taking a job in
a firm that went bankrupt. Most Sundays, his congregation numbers
in the 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphors are impossible to miss as Johnson speaks about
``clearing away'' and ``letting the light in.'' When he says, ``I
figure if something is being hidden, it should be uncovered,'' he
seems to be talking about the past as much as the graves
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   `All in gospel order'
</P>
<P>
   The Antioch slaves were not always anonymous. They are listed
alongside their owners as founding members of the church. On March
5, 1829, when 19 people ``all in gospel order'' gathered in a log
schoolhouse to form a congregation that would be part of the Flint
River Baptist Association, 14 were recorded with last names _ Gay,
Powell, Crittendon, Pate, Reeves, Whitaker, Howell and Lee. The
other five were listed by first name only, identified as ``servant
of ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ester belonged to a man named William King, who was not on the
church roll. Milley, Paul, Peter and Jack belonged to the Gays, a
clan that traces its American roots to Henry Gay, who first
appeared in then Nansemond County, Va., in 1663. Fayette County
records show that in the mid-19th century, Thomas B. Gay declared
that he held 35 slaves, worth $13,500, and 2,766 acres of land
valued at $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation gave Brother Davy, a black man who belonged to
Thomas Gay's father, Gilbert, the freedom to be an evangelist to
``his people.'' Brother Davy needed the church's credentials to
pass freely between farms and plantations, avoiding capture by the
patrols that roamed the county looking for escaped slaves. Church
minutes show that the congregation prayed for his work from time to
time in 1830 and 1831.
</P>
<P>
   By 1850, the little band of Baptists was ready to construct a
building. Church records show that it was to be 60 feet by 40 feet,
with a balcony on the west end for ``colored members'' who also
would be allowed to sit on the back row of the lower level. The
pulpit would be on the north side, with the preacher facing south.
</P>
<P>
   The little Antioch congregation added members by letter or
baptism and subtracted them by death or denunciation, black as well
as white, listing their milestones and misdeeds side by side in the
church minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1851, just as the first building was being finished, minutes
of the congregation recorded the deaths of ``our beloved Sister
Sara Stubbs,'' a white woman, and ``Our Sister Mary ... a colored
woman'' who belonged to Gilbert Gay.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, the church heard charges against two members,
one of them John, a ``colored man'' and ``servant'' who took a
second wife after his first wife left him. ``On motion the church
believed there is no disorder in the colored brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jones, a white member, did not fare as well. According to
the minutes, she was expelled from the church for marrying a man
when her former husband was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The white families intermarried. Thomas Gay's daughter Lavicy
married John I. Whitaker, the son of Antioch's original clerk,
Simon Whitaker. In the 1850s, the younger Whitaker, who lived
across the road from the church, deeded property to the
congregation for as long as it remains a Baptist church in good
standing. Some current Antioch members believe the property may
have included the graves of some Whitaker family members and their
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   And so the church plugged along until the Civil War. The Flint
River Baptist Association officially expressed approval of
secession in September 1861. At the time, 25 percent of the members
of churches in the association were black.
</P>
<P>
   In historical documents of the church, the first mention of the
war was a reference to the death of Brother Capt. Jesse Mercer
Spratlin, who died in Richmond in November 1861 ``while in the
service of the Confederate States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While the country warred, church services at Antioch went on.
The church held its annual revival as usual in August 1862,
baptizing 43 people and receiving five by transfer of membership.
Eleven new black members were among them, bringing the church's
total membership to 106 white, 31 ``colored.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1863, the church released its pastor to preach whenever he
could ``to the Confederate soldiers'' and collected $58 to send The
Christian Index, the Georgia Baptist newspaper, to Confederate
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the war, the church held weeknight meetings to pray
``for our country'' _ the Confederate States of America.
</P>
<P>
   The church canceled services in early September 1864, according
to minutes, ``owing to the Yankee army (a portion of it) being in
the neighborhood committing depredations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, black and white members of Antioch met together. Church
logs show slaves continuing to join the church as late as 1865. But
the divisions were clear. Along with cases against members who used
profanity or failed to come to church, the Antioch congregation
charged three of its black members in 1865 with ``absconding from
their owners.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, according to records, white members of Antioch
asked the black members whether they wanted to continue as part of
the same church or start their own congregation. The former slaves
opted to start their own church, and were given the use of a
schoolhouse on the Antioch property. Records show that white
deacons preached to them ``until one of their own could take
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1892, when the church bought more land, part of it was set
aside for burying ``colored people.''
</P>
<P>
   Antioch continued as a white church, holding annual homecomings,
all-day ``singings'' and ``protracted meetings,'' as their revivals
were called, eating homemade Brunswick stew stirred with a limb in
an old iron pot. They planted cotton on the church grounds to help
support the church, chopped wood at home and hauled it to heat the
building, and swept the churchyard with straw brooms.
</P>
<P>
   There were arguments and splits and changes_ in 1888, a group
led by the Rev. Isaac G. Woolsey left to form Harmony Grove Baptist
Church after deciding it was sinful to sing hymns with the
accompaniment of an organ. The new church, now named Woolsey, is
right up the road from Antioch. And Antioch itself now worships in
a red-brick building constructed in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the church's historical material has been gathered by
Carol Heath, 63, who moved to Fayette County from Florida more than
two decades ago and joined Antioch. She has supplemented official
church minutes with oral histories from older members, some now
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Although her name is still on the church roll, Heath no longer
attends Antioch. Her family and some other longtime members left in
what some characterize as a ``power struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The little church just sort of goes up and down, like most
little old country churches do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Heath had heard there was a ``colored cemetery'' on the grounds
of Antioch, she said. ``I couldn't believe the church hadn't
cleaned it up. This goes back to prejudice _ blacks do black stuff
and whites do white stuff. Some of the older members thought blacks
should take care of black things.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath said she approves wholeheartedly of the effort to reclaim
all of the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the doors to God's house should be open to all his
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   `A sobering thought'
</P>
<P>
   On the first work day to clear the old cemetery, members of
Antioch and New Hope gathered outside Antioch to hear a few words
from the preacher. Johnson told them a little of the background,
and suggested that before they began work, each find a sunken spot
and kneel to pray, to ask God to forgive the country for the sin of
slavery and forgive the church for its neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Rubye Maxwell, 69, was there. Her 37-year-old son was buried
nearby when he died of a seizure in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about the difference in how my son was buried and
how these people had been buried,'' she said. ``You couldn't help
but wonder about the circumstances _ who it was, how they were
treated, the life they might have led. It's a sobering thought that
they could be buried there and nobody knows who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of us are starting to feel a burden is being
lifted from us,'' said Emmett Sanders, 72, a retired Ford worker.
Sanders joined Antioch five years ago because he wanted to be part
of a congregation where ``if one of us is out, we are missed.''
</P>
<P>
   As they clean the cemetery, workers are leaving dogwoods and ivy
vines. They have visions of a park with benches and beautiful
blooming trees where people can sit in the shade and reflect on the
graves, each one marked, they plan, by a cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a lingering shadow,'' said Johnson, looking out over
workers chopping trees, digging up weeds and feeding tree limbs
into a wood chipper as graves become more apparent. ``God could not
bless this church as long as what was here was being willfully
perpetuated. We cannot back up 100 years and correct the sins of
the past ... but for today and tomorrow, we can say this will not
be the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Hawkins, who started the whole thing, says the progress is
``like a miracle to me. It's almost like these people didn't exist.
It's kind of like getting them reborn.''

 &HT;    A doctor, a dean and a volunteer
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Haverty's family built its reputation in the furniture
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Haverty built his on blood.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross recently picked Haverty as its top
volunteer in the United States. The 72-year-old Atlanta native and
resident was awarded the Charles Drew Award, an annual honor named
after the man who initiated the first successful effort to
separate, store and ship plasma.
</P>
<P>
   Haverty, an affable conversationalist with a broad Georgia
twang, said he was shocked by the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nominated someone else,'' he said. ``I had no idea I was
going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haverty was picked for his role as a Red Cross advocate in the
medical community. A retired doctor, Haverty has worked with the
Red Cross for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   When AIDS became a national concern, Haverty used his medical
background to help develop a protocol that ensures the safety of
blood products provided by the Red Cross. ``Blood is very important
and it's not easy to get,'' Haverty said. ``It's absolutely
essential for people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Haverty comes from a family of achievers.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, James Haverty, started Haverty Furniture Cos.
Inc., now one of the leading furniture retailers in the South. His
great-grandfather built railroads. He fled Ireland during the
potato famine and became a railroad laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Haverty, married with a son and two daughters, said his family
taught him that service comes with success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Service is the price you pay for the space you occupy,''
Haverty said. ``If I am going to be as fortunate as I am, I ought
to make the lives of others easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Haverty became involved in the Red Cross after leaving his
practice as a pediatrician in 1968. He became the founding dean of
the College of Health and Human Sciences at Georgia State
University, and joined the American Red Cross because he thought
his students should learn about health services firsthand and would
benefit if he had an official relationship with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Haverty learned how much he enjoyed working with
the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good bunch of people,'' Haverty said. ``It's big and it
offers almost anything anyone would want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues invariably describe Haverty as a Southern gentleman
who gets along with people. The nomination letter for the Drew
Award noted that Haverty ``has a knack for listening and then
articulating problems in such a fashion that the solutions proposed
make listeners think, `Of course, why didn't I think of that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Haverty hesitates when asked to talk about himself. ``It's
wonderful when someone tells me how great I am,'' he said. ``It's
not great for me to tell someone how great I am. I don't think it's
proper to toot your horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The Red Cross will handle his ``tooting'' in the
future. After all, he's one of the organization's top volunteers.

FOR VERMONT, A NEW RECOGNITION OF ITS GETTYSBURG ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending, clarifying reenactment was held July 4th weekend.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nearly inconsolable'' after the failure of Union campaigns in
the spring of 1862, President Abraham Lincoln called for 300,000
more men to serve nine months in the Union army. Nearly 5,000
Vermonters answered the call.
</P>
<P>
   Green soldiers from Vermont's Green Hills, they would play a
pivotal role in the most storied battle of the war: the epic July
1-3, 1863, conflict at Gettysburg. After the battle, a New York
Times account concluded that a Vermont brigade ``did more than any
other body of men to gain the triumph which decided the fate of the
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow over time, the Vermonters' story got lost. Books,
films, even tour guides at the Gettysburg battlefield scarcely
mentioned their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now research by historian Howard Coffin of Montpelier is
re-awakening appreciation for the accomplishments of Vermont
soldiers led by Brigadier General G.J. Stannard. Coffin's
interpretation got official sanction the weekend of Jul;y 4-5, when
history buffs, descendants of Civil War veterans, battlefield
enthusiasts, and others converged on Gettysburg to reenact the
momentous battle and Vermont's role in it.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 reenactments have been held since the 1920s at
Gettysburg. But this one, on the 135th anniversary of the battle,
was the largest ever, with 20,000 reenactors and more than 35,000
spectators. The 1863 battle involved 160,000 men from both sides,
with more than 50,000 dead and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time that Stannard's part in the battle has
been recreated,'' said Steve Wakefield, one of the leaders of the
reenactment. He was referring to a wheeling maneuver by Stannard's
men that helped break the Confederate onslaught up Cemetery Ridge
known as Pickett's Charge.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever doubted that soldiers from Vermont fought at
Gettysburg. But exactly what they did, and how important it was, is
not well-known, Wakefield and others said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Maine regiment _ led by Colonel Joshua Chamberlain _ is
the New England unit perhaps most associated with the battle of
Gettysburg. But that hardy unit held the far left of the Union line
at a place called Little Round Top on the battle's second day _
rather than on the third day, when the Vermont brigade played its
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on battlefield tours at Gettysburg and never heard
the word `Vermont,''' said Brad Limoge, another reenactor and
amateur Civil War historian from Morrisville, Vt. ``Until Coffin's
book came out, I don't think anyone understood how Pickett's Charge
actually worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainers may still say their ancestors saved the Union Army. But
historians including James M. McPherson and D. Scott Hartwig have
praised Coffin's ``Nine Months to Gettysburg.'' He draws on old
diagrams of military maneuvers, eyewitness accounts in letters the
soldiers wrote home, and other reports to show conclusively, he
claims, that Vermonters played a decisive role.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 men who joined the Vermont Brigade in 1862 were a
well-educated bunch, many with political ambitions, most in their
early 20s, Coffin says.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran soldiers, who typically enlisted for two or three years,
derided the Vermonters as opportunists, ``nine-month boys'' trying
to get through their service as safely as possible. But other
Yankees supported them enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the unit in October, just after it had formed,
private Ralph Sturtevant wrote: ``Our camp was thronged with
visitors from all parts of (Vermont) of high and low degree,
beautiful women and red-cheeked girls and their anxious faces ...
there to make farewell visit and say good-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing never was large enough or long enough for the Green
Mountain boys. Supplies were inadequate. ``The tents are so short
that those who sleep in them get wet either at one end or the
other,'' Lieutenant Colonel Roswell Farnham wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   When the men reached Gettysburg near the end of their term, they
had hardly fought at all, but disease and the privations of camp
life _ rain and chill or heat exhaustion, crowded conditions,
inconsistent food _ had taken a fierce toll, reducing their ranks
to about 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies collided just north of Gettysburg on July 1.
Union troops fled through the town but managed to hold onto the
high ground along Cemetery Ridge as darkness fell. Fighting resumed
and intensified on July 2 as the Vermonters helped plug a hole in
the Union line, recaptured four cannons, and took about 80
Confederate prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive moment, Coffin claims, came on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   On that day the Union line resembled a giant fish hook,
stretching three miles from Culp's Hill, along to Cemetery Ridge
south to the Round Tops; Confederate soldiers were massed to the
east along Seminary Ridge. Previously, Confederate General Robert
E. Lee had attacked both ends of the Union line; on July 3, he
decided to attack the middle.
</P>
<P>
   His main target was the portion of the Union line near a clump
of trees on Cemetery Ridge. Just to one side, crouching in a
ravine, the Vermonters in three regiments formed the most advanced
part of the line.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., after an earth-shaking, two-hour artillery duel,
an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Confederates started across the mile
of farmland toward the Union line.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Frank Haskell, from Tunbridge, Vt., described the
scene as the enemy advanced: ``Every eye could see his legions, an
overwhelmingly resistless tide of an ocean of armed men sweeping
upon us! Regiment after regiment ... the red flags wave, their
horsemen gallop up and down; the arms of (15,000) men gleam in the
sun, a sloping forest of flashing steel.''
</P>
<P>
   As the massed Confederates neared the portion of the Union line
where soliders in blue crouched behind a stone wall near the copse
of trees, the Vermonters rose up to fire. The Confederates veered
to one side, exposing their right flank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stannard saw the military opportunity of the century,'' Coffin
said in an interview. ``If he could move the men around 90 degrees,
he could fire into the side of the Confederate forces as they moved
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a great door, the Vermonters swung out wide and began
firing,'' Coffin continued. ``Every time they fired, they moved
closer, getting off 8,000 to 10,000 bullets in about 20 minutes.
One soldier said the sound was like `a vast mournful roar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant George Benedict, in his report of the conflict,
recalled: ``Shells whizzed and popped and fluttered on every side;
spherical case shot exploded overhead, and rained showers of iron
bullets; solid shot tore the ground into furrows.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fighting was over, the high water mark of the
Confederacy had been reached, and the battle of Gettysburg had been
won for the Union. The Vermonters had lost 270 men killed, wounded,
and missing, Coffin writes.
</P>
<P>
   Sturtevant, surveying the area where General George Pickett's
charge had been broken, observed: ``If there was any spot on that
great field of battle that approximated more nearly than any other
the maelstrom of destruction, this was the place. They lay one upon
the other clutched in death, side by side. ... Some had on (Union)
blue, but nearly all wore the (Confederate) gray, and for on a few
square rods one could hardly step so thickly lay the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy July 4, the Vermonters helped with the formidable
task of burial. Corporal Mark Day, from Essex, Vt., remembered:
``In the pouring rain, band after band of regimental musicians
gathered, the dead of both armies on every hand (as bands played)
the national airs and hymns, until a great volume of music and
thanksgiving rose from the field.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Civil war buffs who gathereds at Gettysburg tried to recreate
what the battle was like _ while substituting blanks for
ammunition. They slept in blankets on the ground, wadding up
jackets for pillows; ate from tin plates; fired antique weapons, or
reproductions of them; wore heavy wool uniforms made to Army
specifications of the 1860s _ including the long underwear that
kept the scratchy wool off their skins.
</P>
<P>
   But no reenactment can do the battle justice, Coffin says. ``One
man wrote about seeing a soldier shot near the clump of trees. His
lower jaw was torn away, his tongue was flapping in the breeze, he
was struggling just to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were hundreds of stories like that,'' Coffin went on.
``It was carnage, and we'll never really understand it.''

JANET JACKSON: AT THE MERCY OF LUST, YET IN TOTAL CONTROL

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a mistake to underestimate Janet Jackson.
True, she's not the strongest singer around, or the most original
songwriter; she works slowly, with four-year gaps between albums
and tours, and keeps quiet between projects. Yet long after the
other masters of the 1980s pop spectacle have withdrawn _ Madonna
to motherhood, Michael Jackson to fatherhood _ Ms. Jackson has not
just persevered but thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Her current U.S. tour, built around her 1997 album, ``The Velvet
Rope'' (Virgin), began on Thursday night at the MCI Center, and
with her performance, she made clear that she and her collaborators
since the mid-1980s, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, have been one of
the most consistent songwriting teams in pop.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Ms. Jackson also found ways to keep the arena
startling. Between cooing come-ons and aerobic dance routines, she
faced down trauma and healed herself.
</P>
<P>
   The current tour, which arrives in New York's Madison Square
Garden on Oct. 10 and 11 (when it will be televised live by HBO),
reflects an era in which music video, Las Vegas revues and Broadway
have converged.
</P>
<P>
   Every moment is choreographed for Ms. Jackson, nine dancers and
her band. In the more athletic songs, she appears to be
lip-synching, although she does sing live in ballads and parts of
the uptempo songs.
</P>
<P>
   Like most multimillion-selling songwriters, Ms. Jackson has
something for nearly every pop radio format, from lush ballads to
funk to hard-rock riffing to electronic dance music to hip-hop.
Each kind of beat arrives with its own costume. While most of the
show is outfitted in stark black and white, one stretch of cheerful
songs bursts into color, with harlequin costumes like a Disney
production of Cirque de Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   Pop spectacles are about razzle-dazzle, the sight and sound of
someone going all out to entertain. They're about reassurance, too,
invariably winding up with a big optimistic song, preferably a
communal sing-along. But spectacles are also about power: the
ability to deploy large forces, onstage and backstage, to realize a
star's whims.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Ms. Jackson presents herself as the leader of a posse,
sometimes wearing quasi-military uniforms. While most of her songs
are about what goes on between lovers in private, she travels with
reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Rope Burn,'' a song about bondage fantasies that begins
``Tie me up, tie me down,'' Ms. Jackson brought a man up from the
audience and sat him in a chair while she and two female dancers
caressed him and teased him. Although Ms. Jackson sang about
submission as she writhed against a pole, she definitely had the
upper hand. In other songs, the male dancers ended up as
supplicants before attractive women.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ``Control'' in 1986, Ms. Jackson's songs have
wrestled with the question of who's in charge and whether love also
means surrender. With her small, sweet voice, she often portrays
herself as a woman at the mercy of lust, finding satisfaction by
fulfilling male desires. But in another cluster of her songs, she
refuses to be subservient.
</P>
<P>
   While the music often follows the lead of Michael Jackson,
Prince and Diana Ross, Ms. Jackson and her collaborators enhance
every borrowed idea, so that even when the sources are
recognizable, the songs are convincing. They can be sultry and
lovelorn; they can be fiercely cathartic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One song, ``What About,'' starts out as a marriage proposal,
with gentle acoustic guitar, but suddenly gives way to hard-rock
guitar and furious accusations of abuse. Ms. Jackson staged it
unsparingly, with dancers acting out assault and rape; the
stylization didn't soften the violent emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution came with ``Rhythm Nation,'' a call for unity and
good intentions, and ``Special,'' an anthem that declares, ``We
have to deal with our past.'' For an encore, she brought on Colin
Powell _ the tour is contributing to America's Promise, his
organization to promote mentors for children _ and finished with
``Together Again,'' an elegy disguised as an arm-waving, feel-good
song. She honored the pop conventions, but she had made them follow
her commands.
</P>
<P>
   Usher was torn between spectacle and song as he opened the show.
He can draw squeals simply by taking off his shirt, and he did,
repeatedly. He also moonwalked and went through nearly half a dozen
costume changes and dance routines before he showed up in white
pajamas and began crooning, with his best Stevie Wonder melismas,
about undying love, punctuated by hip twitches and slow push-ups.
The squeals only redoubled.

   It seems self-evident to just about anyone who has ever had a
father that a caring, involved dad is good for a child.
</P>
<P>
   But try proving it.
</P>
<P>
   Social science is filled with research that documents the impact
of mothers on their children. Flip through the literature, and you
find studies in which every single gesture between mothers and
babies was videotaped and analyzed. Or ones showing that mothers
who talked to their infants in complex sentences saw a later payoff
in higher reading scores.
</P>
<P>
   Turn to the father's side of the family ledger, however, and two
things become apparent. Little research has occurred. And the
studies that do exist fail to cast much light on why fathers really
matter, something that most researchers concede tells more about
their methodological weaknesses than about the importance of
fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so little out there,'' Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at
the University of Pennsylvania, complained of the lack of
information. ``It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from Vice President Al Gore to Louis Farrakhan to the
master Promise Keeper Bill McCartney cites the importance of
fathers. As researchers clamber to catch up, fatherhood
uncharacteristically has turned into the hottest stop on the social
science circuit in recent years. Yet the lack of intellectual
insight into the nature of fatherhood is striking at a time when
society seems so eager to celebrate it.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, when the academic journal Demography considered
devoting a special edition to ``Men in Families,'' the guest
editor, Suzanna M. Bianchi, said that ``the question we discussed
at some length was whether there was enough high-quality social
demographic work on men to constitute a special issue.'' (There
was, and the issue was published in May.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one has yet figured out what's so special about a
father. Should he try to be family ``leader,'' as some religious
groups argue, or a ``male mom''? Is it more important for him to
play catch with a child or take charge of filling the refrigerator
and organizing play-dates? What is the tradeoff between making
money and spending time with a child? Is what he does important, or
what he says, or merely that he show up?
</P>
<P>
   Understanding why a father matters when he is around would help
explain how to fill the gap when he isn't. Or perhaps it might even
discourage him from leaving in the first place. Most unmarried and
divorced fathers disappear after the first years of their child's
life. Are they jerks, plain and simple? Or are they perhaps shut
out by an angry mother, or embarrassed about not having enough
money to contribute?
</P>
<P>
   Getting answers isn't easy. Because fathers have traditionally
been defined as breadwinners, until recently neither researchers
nor policymakers looked much beyond a father's wallet. Assumptions
about the special mother-child bond as well as the notoriety of the
deadbeat dad didn't do much to change perceptions about a father's
importance. ``Men were marginalized'' by their behavior and the
people who studied that behavior, says Frank Furstenberg, a
sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania. As historian John
Demos said in 1986, ``Fatherhood has a very long history, but
virtually no historians.''

</P>
<P>
   When researchers finally started paying attention, they smacked
up against the methodological problems that all social science
investigations encounter. But with the wrapping barely off
fatherhood studies, there hasn't been enough time to compensate for
these flaws with carefully repeated studies and varied research
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it seems obvious that fathers matter. After all,
children with single mothers tend to have higher dropout rates and
more frequent run-ins with the police. But while an an absent dad
might be the reason, so could poverty, or bad schools, or the lack
of a family backup system, or something else altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the surprising conclusion of one of the newest and most
detailed studies on the impact of fathers on children. After an
exhaustive 11-year study of traditional two-parent families
published in the special issue of Demography, the researchers found
``the influence of fathers is relatively minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even they admit something is missing. ``It runs in the face
of common sense and conventional wisdom,'' says Furstenberg, who
began studying fathers 20 years ago, when it was a largely solitary
activity. ``So the efforts now shift to when and why fathers
matter. That's what we really have to try to understand better.''
</P>
<P>
   Furstenberg explained in an interview that the results might be
a weird byproduct of the research method. By trying to account for
poverty and marital conflict _ two elements known to severely
damage children _ they might unintentionally miss the very things
fathers do that are important.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do large sociological surveys capture the subtle shadings _
the whispered confidences, the middle-of-the-night checks, the
smile of encouragement across a room _ of a father's relationship
with a child. Think of a 10-ton scale weighing a grain of sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own theory is that once you have one good parent in place,
having another parent in place doesn't have a huge effect on
children,'' Furstenberg says. ``It helps, but it's a subtle effect.
Where I think there's a real frontier of research is the issue of
two parents operating in tandem. The presence of two parents
creates the possibility of conflict and division, just as it
creates the possibility of consensus and cohesion. Depending on the
chemistry of how parenting works, you're going to see a positive or
negative effect on children.''
</P>
<P>
   Young unmarried fathers are especially puzzling. ``We assume
that children will be better off if they have a father,
particularly if they're in poverty, because there would be two
earners,'' Ms. Edin says. ``But if we don't know anything about
these fathers, it's difficult to determine which fathers we should
be encouraging to be more involved with their children. How many
are substance abusers, engage in domestic violence or child abuse?
We don't know much about their earning capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common source of information about fathers is mothers.
That's because fathers are so hard to find. Whether rich or poor,
married or unmarried, more than 40 percent of men who don't live
with their children don't even mention they are fathers in national
surveys, said Irwin Garfinkel, a professor at the School of Social
Work at Columbia University. National household and population
surveys _ the main reservoir of information on families _ rarely
include men who don't live at home. Frequently, they even neglect
to study the fathers who do.
</P>
<P>
   Only since 1995, when President Clinton issued an executive
order, has the federal government started giving fathers equal
weight in research and policy initiatives. Now the Department of
Health and Human Services is looking at ways to strengthen poor
fathers' visitation rights, for example, or the role fathers might
play in child education programs. And for the first time, in the
year 2000, men will be included in the National Survey of Family
Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, innovative experiments are under way. Ms. Bianchi, a
sociologist, has been asking college-educated, working parents to
keep weekly diaries of how they spend time with their children.
Michael Lamb, a research psychologist at the National Institute for
Child Health and Development, is videotaping low-income fathers
playing with their children so he can chart their attachment over
time. And in the hopes of gathering that rare firsthand
information, the husband-and-wife team of Garfinkel and Sarah
McLanahan, a sociologist at Princeton University, plan to track
poor families in 20 cities from the maternity ward to the child's
fifth birthday. Fathers, whether home or not, will be included.
</P>
<P>
   As this new wave of research focuses on fatherhood, some
tantalizing details are being served up.
</P>
<P>
   Diary studies, for example, have shown that fathers tend to
spend more time with younger children than older ones, more time
with boys than girls, more time playing than handling basic needs.
Meanwhile, fathers in a lower socioeconomic class tend to spend
more time with their children than other fathers.
</P>
<P>
   To fill in the gaps left by large surveys, Ms. Edin and Jennifer
Culhane, a public health researcher, have started interviewing
poor, unmarried fathers in Philadelphia. In an unexpected twist,
they are finding that children may do more for fathers than the
reverse. ``We asked them what their lives would be like without
their children,'' said Ms. Edin. ``We expected them to say their
lives would be so much easier, but they said, `I'd be dead or in
jail,' even if they're not involved with those children. Children
have tremendous importance for fathers.'' Other research also hints
that children prompt men to get better jobs and work in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   What angered the Philadelphia men most was being expected to
hand over money without having a say in how it's spent or in
raising their child. ``They feel very strongly that their
participation is only elicited when it has do with money, and they
don't have any legal access to their children,'' says Ms. Culhane,
adding that some ``really want a relationship with the kid. But the
relationship is up to the mother, and they're not getting along
because everybody is broke. I think the fathers get a bit of a bum
rap.''
</P>
<P>
   Having control over a child's upbringing is a theme that seems
to resonate across tax brackets. Judith Seltzer, a sociologist at
the University of California, studies joint custody arrangements,
setups more common among higher income and better-educated
families. In her study published in Demography, she found that
having legal responsibility for a child actually causes fathers to
spend more time with them.
</P>
<P>
   Although fathers were once the overlooked guest at the research
table, demographers and sociologists, ethnographers and
psychologists have now welcomed them into the family. Yet what they
will end up concluding about them requires, as they say, further
research.

TEENAGERS AND ALCOHOL: A SADD SITUATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it be drinking late with friends or attending the
funeral of a classmate killed by a drunken driver, alcohol plays a
big role in the lives of teenagers. And although most teens know
the dangers of drinking and then driving, many continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers 21-24 years old had the highest intoxication rate for
fatal crashes in 1996, according to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.4 million Americans between 12-20 were binge drinkers,
meaning they consume five or more drinks in a row on a single
occasion, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse's 1996
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally preventable problem where people, once they
have consumed beverages that makes them unable to function
properly, decide to perform dangerous activities,'' said Meggan(cq)
Ways, a senior at Indianapolis' Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School
and president of the school's Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD)
chapter. The national organization recently changed its name to
Students Against Destructive Decisions to encompass more of the
problems facing teens.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the Indianapolis bureau of Children's Express spoke
with two others seniors, from Park Tudor High School in
Indianapolis, to ascertain what young people are doing in the
battle against drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Although the names are different, chapters at Brebeuf and Park
Tudor are anti-substance abuse organizations that participate in
events such as ``Prom Promise,'' in which teens are asked to take a
vow during prom weekend not to drink or use drugs, and ``Red Ribbon
Week,'' a national anti-drug week.
</P>
<P>
   SADD also promotes a ``Contract for Life,'' in which youth and
parents agree to contact each other if one has been drinking and
cannot responsibly drive home.
</P>
<P>
   Why do teens drink?
</P>
<P>
   Nan Ruby: To have fun. I mean, that's what everybody thinks it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Meggan: If you're in a situation where everybody else is
drinking, it's hard to say, ``Oh no, I'll just have a soda.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy Hebert: It's rebellious. It's something that your parents
wouldn't approve of, and sometimes teenagers like stuff that their
parents don't approve of.
</P>
<P>
   Meggan: If you see someone in a movie get into a car and drive
home drunk and everything is fine, it's going to send an impression
that this is something good and fun to do.
</P>
<P>
   Katy: Drinking isn't a major problem at Park Tudor, because more
people are aware of the other options besides drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Nan: It's not that big of a problem, because kids are usually
spending the night or parents take keys away (when they suspect
there might be drinking).
</P>
<P>
   Meggan: I hear about people drinking and driving, but what I her
is through gossip. People don't seem to take this problem
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Nan: I've taken the keys away from friends before and told them
that they can't drive because I thought that they were too drunk to
drive.
</P>
<P>
   They're obviously not caring for other people, so why should I
be caring for them? Why should I comfort them? I just say, `You're
stupid. Don't do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Katy: Your friend's life is more important than making it home
by your curfew or getting in trouble for leaving the party.
</P>
<P>
   Meggan: If it's a difference between saving someone's life and
saving his or her feelings, you obviously have to go for the life.
</P>
<P>
   The Contract for Life
</P>
<P>
   Katy: It's like a trust contract, that your parents put enough
trust in you to give you the freedom to go out and have fun, but
yet they expect you to be safe and come home safely.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's good that it also says for the parent to agree to
come home safe and sober. If the parent's in danger, they should
have to do exactly what the child has to do. It's not hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   Meggan: I think one main reason that kids drive themselves when
they're drunk is because they're afraid of what their parents will
say if they call them.
</P>
<P>
   Nan: I think parents should have a talk with their kid when
he/she gets the license and say, ``Be responsible. If you're going
to be in this situation, call me and I will understand. You won't
get in trouble at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy: Sometimes it's hard to remember that your parents love
you. If you come home drunk, they will be angry with you, but it is
so much more important for a parent to have their child be safe.

WHAT GIRL POWER REALLY MEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: Children's Express is an independent, non-profit news
service reported by children whose tape-recorded interviews,
roundtables and commentary are edited by teens and adults. The
features are transmitted by The New York Times Service and are

   When the Ms. Foundation talks about girls changing the world,
they don't even call it girl power. They talk about powerful girls.
``At the Ms. Foundation for Women, we'd be talking about the power
that girls feel, particularly before adolescence,'' said Marie
Wilson, president of the foundation. ``The power that they see in
their mothers, a power that girls naturally have and adults can
help sustain.''
</P>
<P>
   Her definition of `girl power' just doesn't fit with the Spice
Girls and Madonna, who exert their sexuality. It's about using your
mind as well as your body in positive ways. Girl power is the power
that girls possess to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   She said that there are other definitions of girl power, like
the Spice Girls use, but it's not real power. It's very different
and it's not the kind most girls need to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of wonderful uninhibited thing, but it's also
exposing girls to risk in ways that are not always responsible,
acting as if the world is already changed for girls so that you can
flaunt certain things that you really can't right now. Sex is
power, but it's not real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power isn't money. It's isn't control. It's influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said real girl power comes from girls' minds and what
they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think of the fact that girls are now looked at as being
more powerful in the world and looked at more for their potential
than for their victimhood,'' she said, ``I think it's (the
popularity of the phrase a) great success. As long as we talk about
girl power in the best sense, it has mothers like (professor) Carol
Gilligan at Harvard and Donna Shalala who's the secretary (of
Health and Human Services) and Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I object to is using it in a product that is really
exploitative of girls. I do believe that advertising and marketing
are exploiting the girls' market right now. If companies are gonna
use girl power to sell products that are kind of neutral, like
T-shirts, I'd rather it be 'girl power' than 'girl sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson mentioned Nike's `If you let me play' campaign, however,
as an example of `exploitation for good' because there are kids
getting more attention.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't always like Nike's business practices when they
exploit workers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Girl power can also mean girls who are using their power as
consumers and to control the media, said Wilson. Go to companies
and say, ``I don't like the way you have just white women. You want
girls like me when you advertise.'' She mentioned new magazines
that girls are writing themselves to express their viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed some things. I think what's important is the new
publications, like Teen Voices and New Moon. Some of the
publications are starting to have influence on magazines like
Seventeen,'' said Wilson. ``Seventeen had a feature not too long
ago, real girls model real clothes, that to me is a more important
use of girl power.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't sit here and be hypocritical and act as if girls
aren't interested in reading about boys, clothes or whatever.
Seventeen and these other magazines wouldn't be in business if
girls weren't interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson repeated that girl power is about influence in lots of
ways. It's also about freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about, can a boy be a nurse and a girl be a doctor? Can
you control your life? Can you have the amount of children you can
support? Do you have the power to influence the world around you?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Farah spends 40 minutes with a guest at lunch before he
even mentions the company he runs, which happens to be one of the
country's oldest retailers. He talks with profound affection about
his children. He comments about his salad. He spins cheerful yarns
about life in Atlanta, where he once lived.
</P>
<P>
   All of this good nature and thoughtful banter are a bit
perplexing, because Farah has the right to be an angry man.
</P>
<P>
   When Farah became chief executive of Woolworth Corp. in 1994,
the company was nearly insolvent. Its inventory systems were so
antiquated that Halloween candy sat melting in a storeroom in the
middle of July. Its stores were not equipped to tally daily sales,
unheard of in modern retailing. Its namesake dime stores were
bleeding cash, as were many of its other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   He was certainly aware of some of this when he signed on. But
the sheer breadth of what needed fixing was not exactly what he had
bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   In a few short years, however, he has reduced the company's
overall debt to $440 million, from $1.2 billion; winnowed its 41
widely disparate divisions down to 21 store formats by unloading
most of the underperforming mall specialty stores; sold its elegant
headquarters building in Manhattan, and, in perhaps his most
dramatic move, closed its fabled dime stores.
</P>
<P>
   Just into his fourth year, he has changed not only the company's
name, to Venator Group, but also its century-old strategy; for all
intents and purposes, Farah is now running a sporting goods holding
company.
</P>
<P>
   Its crown jewels _ Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Kid's Foot
Locker _ are undergoing badly needed renovations. Three smallish
acquisitions _ a pair of sporting goods chains and an athletic
goods catalog _ underscore the new direction. And a proposed big
addition _ the 206-store Sports Authority chain _ is in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, the new Woolworth _ er, Venator _ cannot
command the recognition that would seem appropriate for one of the
largest restructuring attempts in recent corporate history. And
Farah, 45, widely recognized as one of the most savvy and
accomplished retailers in the country for his work at Saks Fifth
Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Federated Department Stores, is now
struggling for a measure of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Farah has done things that badly needed to be done,''
said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a trade
publication that closely follows Venator. ``But the jury is still
out. He hasn't shown results to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, insult has followed injury with depressing regularity
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Venator's stock has fallen 14 percent so far this year, even as
the Standard &AMP; Poor's retail index soared nearly 55 percent. Last
year, the stock was dropped as a component of the Dow Jones
industrial average, and Fidelity Investments has cast off a large
stake, according to the most recent filings. And despite its $6.6
billion in annual revenues, Venator is covered regularly by just a
handful of analysts, two of whom have been relentless in issuing
unusually negative reports.
</P>
<P>
   There is more.
</P>
<P>
   A large shareholder, Greenway Partners, has taken to regularly
complaining that Farah is not moving fast enough, demanding that he
unload more divisions. The proposed acquisition of the Sports
Authority was roundly panned by investors who responded with a
mini-selloff. Even worse, an upstart sporting goods company in
Denver, Gart Sports Co., made its own offer for Sports Authority, a
surprise that has Farah's investment bankers at Morgan Stanley
scrambling for a response.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this sets Farah's hair on fire (an expression he is
fond of using), there is no public face for his rage. ``I don't
think the Street understood how broken this company was, and I
didn't think it was my job to report that to them,'' he said in an
interview in his office in the Woolworth Building, where Venator is
still based. ``The progress here has been dramatically
undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Farah's challenge remains daunting. He is pushing ahead with
a company focused on athletic wear when that business, largely
because of depressed sales of sneakers, is in the dumps. His key
supplier, Nike, has yet to show signs of improving its own battered
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   He is remodeling, expanding and adding fresh goods to his
2,848-store Foot Locker division, but is still playing catch-up
with competitors like Finish Line and Just for Feet.

   Overall, Venator's sales continue to sag, and its profit margins
remain weak. On Tuesday, the company announced that it expected to
lose 5 cents to 10 cents a share for the quarter ending Aug. 1, and
its stock hit a 52-week closing low, at $18.25. It continued to
slip throughout the week, closing at a new 52-week low of $17.4375
on Friday. That wasn't just bad news for investors; it knocked
roughly 18 percent off the value of the company's $570 million
offer for Sports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means Farah is in danger of getting some permanent
bruises unless profits resume growing at Venator, which is Latin
for ``hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played Woolworth my whole 16-year career,'' said
Michael Petersen, a portfolio manager with Security Distributors, a
mutual fund family based in Topeka, Kan. He recently sold his
fund's Venator shares in the face of weakened earnings and margins,
as well as queasiness about the company's commitment to sporting
goods. ``I am a big believer that the numbers tell me everything I
need to know about management,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   These hard knocks present a big change for Farah, who has been
used to much more glamour _ and success _ in business. Starting out
at Saks, he went on to executive positions at Neiman Marcus and
Federated, where he became, at 35, the youngest president ever of
Rich's, a Southern department store chain.
</P>
<P>
   Farah's department store career ended in 1993, when Macy's tried
to lure him away from Federated's merchandise services unit, where
he was chief executive. But Allen Questrom, then Federated's chief
executive, stopped that cold, saying it would violate Farah's
contract. Farah was served legal papers as he boarded a ferry to
Nantucket and, as a result, ended up spending only a few months as
Macy's president.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After all that, few in the industry expected him to roll up his
sleeves and dig into Woolworth, a sclerotic retailer whose most
famous unit was a dusty purveyor of hard candy and Dippity-Do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Farah came in, people were very surprised,'' said Kirk
Palmer, who runs an executive search firm in New York. ``Woolworth
was one of those companies that none of us in the search industry
ever looked at because, frankly, they were viewed as being really
mediocre managers and retailers. But here came this Wunderkind that
everyone loved, and they wondered what in God's name was he doing
going over to Woolworth.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah may be wondering the same thing, but he says he is
optimistic. ``I thought it was a challenge to be taken,'' he said.
``I thought there was value to be created.''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, comparisons to Arthur Martinez are inevitable.
Martinez left Saks Fifth Avenue as chief executive to try a
turnaround at the beleaguered, unglamorous Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. in
1992. He, too, shut down a vaunted but ultimately unprofitable
business, the Sears catalog.
</P>
<P>
   But even Martinez, who is otherwise impressed with Farah, was
surprised when Woolworth stopped being Woolworth to become an
athletic goods business. ``We had a $4 billion catalog business and
a $16 billion store business,'' he said. ``It was central to the
history of the company but smaller to the economic picture. The
Woolworth dime stores may have been too far gone, but those
locations were magic. I think they have punched out the hole of the
doughnut by closing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah acknowledges that he was not quite ready for how hard it
would be to turn around Venator's fortunes. ``In my wildest dreams,
I was not prepared to hear that I could not get daily sales''
reports, he said. ``I have made more tough decisions in the last
three years than in my entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   Many shoppers probably have no idea of Venator's components.
Besides its Foot Locker division, the company owns Champs, a chain
of large athletic shops, and Colorado, which sells outdoor gear
like Patagonia jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The company also runs the giant Kinney footwear chain and the
smaller Footquarter. Then there are 860 stores in the Northern
Reflections group _ mall stores that sell a casual look that favors
items like lavender T-shirts with vine prints and cotton walking
shorts. There are two other mall chains as well: Afterthoughts,
which sells accessories for teen-agers, and San Francisco Music Box
Co. Venator does 37 percent of its business overseas, an unusually
high level for an American retailer.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem? In a word: sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Woolworth was run like a 19th century
family business until Farah came on board, sneakers had
traditionally been good to the company. For years, Foot Locker had
few worries because of its paramount position at the mall,
dominating the market with the latest Nike products.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years, the appetite for Nike basketball
shoes has waned considerably. In their stead have come other
sneaker brands and products, including New Balance, skateboard
shoes and hiking boots, none of which Foot Locker was quick to get
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``During 1996, there was unprecedented momentum in the footwear
business because Nike could do no wrong,'' said Faye Landes, a
retail analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``But what was not really
apparent then was that other concepts coming along would catch on.
And in a mature business, there are competitors who are doing
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Those competitors began opening stores across the mall from Foot
Locker shops _ and typically in bigger spaces. Finish Line, for
example, has 5,400-square-foot stores, compared with a
3,000-square-foot average for Foot Locker.
</P>
<P>
   A larger store means two things: more room for suppliers other
than Nike, and shelf space for marked-down goods, which Foot Locker
was also short on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close-outs are important to moms who are buying shoes for
growing kids,'' said Horan, the newsletter publisher.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems. For years, Woolworth let Foot Locker
more or less run itself and invested little in the upkeep of the
stores, using its cash flow to support other chains.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the tricky issue of the supplier's upper hand. In
90 percent of retailing, the merchants call the shots. They choose
what and how much to buy and put pressure on vendors to pay for
advertising, give special deals for large purchases and buy back
unsold merchandise. The sporting goods business is an exception.
For years, Nike pushed the merchants around, telling them how much
merchandise they would receive and when they would get it, often
even commanding how it would be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Venator's plan to buy Sports Authority is intended
to change that calculus because it would help consolidate the
fragmented sector. Venator already owns 16 percent of the sporting
goods business in the United States. Add Sports Authority _ the
combined company's sales would be about $5 billion _ and it would
have a bigger opportunity to dictate terms to suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands now,'' Horan said, ``Nike can live without Foot
Locker far more than Foot Locker can live without Nike.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how difficult the business is, at least a
half-dozen sporting goods merchants have been shuttered or taken
over by larger companies in the last two years, and many more may
be on that path.
</P>
<P>
   Farah sees trends in athletic shoes as cyclical and says sales
can turn upward on a dime with a few hot new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we had to build around was athletic,'' Farah
said. ``Would I have preferred to be in an up cycle when we were
trying to grow our business? Absolutely. We will primarily rise and
fall on that. But on the flip side, we think it is an opportunity
to consolidate the business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Farah is trying hard to focus on areas of the
business that are not worn on the feet. So far, 130 Woolworth
locations are scheduled for conversion to Champs or Foot Locker,
and the new Foot Lockers have the bells and whistles expected of a
modern sneaker emporium. They are larger and brighter, with giant
displays and huge video screens to lure customers. The new Kid's
Foot Locker stores, including one in Nyack, N.Y., look like giant
cartoonlands, with huge skateboards jetting from the ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   But Farah's background is in apparel, and that is what he is
trying to emphasize. Foot Locker has mostly dabbled in the licensed
apparel business _ team jerseys and the like _ but will add
private-label lines to its mix.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes have not been easy. Large stores with
complicated fixtures and features take much time and money to
build, and they have opened more slowly than the company had hoped.
Venator wanted to have well over 100 big stores by now in the Foot
Locker family; there are just a dozen so far. And some company
executives are upset that footwear may take a back seat to clothes.
</P>
<P>
   So can Farah make this company turn the corner? His fans say
that if anyone can, he's the one.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who know Roger Farah agree on two things: His
merchandising smarts and the almost obsessive way he studies a
problem to find a solution. Call up some of the most respected
names in the business, the kind of people who do not generally
comment publicly about their peers, and be prepared to hear them
bubble over about Farah.
</P>
<P>
   James Zimmerman, chief executive of Federated, calls him ``the
complete deal.'' Myron Ullman III, the no-nonsense chairman of DFS
Group, said that when he was chief executive of Macy's, Farah was
the only man he wanted to hire. Matthew Serra, the chief executive
of Stern's, who oversaw Farah at Saks, still recalls fondly how the
younger man had the foresight to sell knock-offs of Gucci loafers
in 1977, when few stores were willing to try that approach. Farah's
loafers, which sold at half the price of the real thing, flew off
the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a brilliant 22-year-old,'' Serra said. ``He had
tremendous capacity to assimilate knowledge and information. I
couldn't promote him fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Most great merchants are known for their intuitive skills, not
their financial acumen. Farah is said to have both, poring over the
smallest details until he feels he understands a business situation
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Shull, who worked with Farah at Federated and is now
president of Barneys New York, remembered him taking a special trip
to Asia to personally oversee some factories. His subordinates at
Venator say he will tinker with store displays until he thinks they
are right.
</P>
<P>
   But there are downsides to all of this micro-managing. ``Roger
loves to ask questions, to probe, to get into people's heads,''
said a former Venator executive, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``But then it takes a long time to get answers.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to communicating with those merchants and managing
and motivating them, Farah employs some special touches.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Beauchamp, a buyer at Saks under Farah early in her
career, recalled their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been looking at Saks as being very traditional, very
classic,'' she said. ``So Roger calls and asks me to meet him on
the main floor. He walked me through Saint Laurent, Escada, Chanel
and everything out there, giving me an awareness of who the Saks
customer was, instead of asking me, `Where are you going with all
this traditional cashmere?' Here he was showing me feathered
sweaters and sequined bags. It was a nice introduction to Roger's
style.''
</P>
<P>
   There is tougher part to that style, she added. ``Roger ruled
with an iron fist in a velvet glove,'' added Ms. Beauchamp, until
recently the president of men's wear at Donna Karan International.
``Some people can tell you to go to hell, and you'll enjoy the
trip. Roger had that ability.''
</P>
<P>
   But that ability, and all the others he may possess, will add up
to little if sneaker sales don't turn around. ``At the end of the
day,'' said Ms. Landes, the analyst, ``it comes down to the whims
of a 14-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah obviously has a personal interest in the company's
performance. In addition to his $1.5 million in base pay last year
and $780,000 bonus, he received 800,000 stock options and 200,000
shares in restricted stock.
</P>
<P>
   But if Farah is worried, there are no outward signs. After an
interview, he went to meet the car that would take him to the
airport. He was on his way to Oregon to meet with Nike executives.
</P>
<P>
   He looked over the memo his office had given him for the trip:
Portland, often rainy, would be sunny for his visit. With that
news, he went smiling down the hall _ he might even have been
whistling.

that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it

opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and

symbolic.'' Speaking to a Democratic group here on a wide range of
Israeli issues, Gold said the U.N. vote -- which passed ov
overwhelmingly -- represents ``no effective change'' in the PLO

will look at defense and makers of other high-tech equipment such

<P>
   NIH _ WASHINGTON _ In the middle of fights over campaign
finances, tobacco legislation and other bones of contention,
President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Senate
Republican leaders and congressional Democrats all agree on a
fairly major initiative: that the research budget of the National
Institutes of Health should be dramatically increased, even doubled
over the next decade. To officials at Emory University in Atlanta,
which hopes to propel itself into one of the ``top 10'' research
institutions in the country during that time, this is welcome news.
The University of Texas, Eastern Carolina University and other
universitities around the country are also thrilled at the prospect
of easier access to what is already the largest pool of research
money in the world, by a factor of 10. Why is this idea suddenly so
popular? There are several theories, including the fact that
politicians sense that meaningful medical breakthroughs lie just
ahead and the aging of the politically powerful Baby Boomers, who
are now reaching the stage in life where their own health has
replaced earlier concerns. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

POP CDS: MATCHING THE MUSIC TO THE BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In summer, myriad pop-culture offerings surface to suit the free
and overheated mood. There are literary page turners for beach
reading and blockbusters augmenting the allure of movie-house air
conditioning. Pop's hot-weather genres include surf music and Miami
bass, and the hit songs that seem to have been born inside car
radios.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, though, are whole albums singled out for the season. The
qualities that make CDs ideal for summer lazing _ an easygoing mood
that can drift into hothouse torpor, a focus that fades in and out
like a daydream _ aren't usually applauded by critics, who prefer a
certain clarity. That leaves listeners to find their favorites on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few suggestions, keyed to particular summer scenes.
Consider these albums beach reading for the ears.
</P>
<P>
   For a New York City Beach
</P>
<P>
   Hipsters heading to Coney Island will want to equip themselves
with the Beastie Boys' ``Hello Nasty'' (Grand Royal/Capitol), the
latest from this eminent trio of cool hunters. Mixing old-school
hip-hop bragfests with nearly New Age meditations about living
mindfully in a busy world, ``Hello Nasty'' ranges widely enough to
please everybody on the boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The Buddhist-inspired philosophizing is paired with vintage
Europop, ambient electronics and sweet, wide-eyed neo-psychedelia
like that of the Beasties' pal, Sean Lennon. The beat-heavy rants,
accelerated by the frenetic record-scratcher DJ Mixmaster Mike,
feature enough dazzling wordplay to make for many surfside games of
Guess the Reference.
</P>
<P>
   Attentive listeners will notice an unresolved split between the
group's attempts at egoless expression and the consummately
ego-driven boasts essential to its raps. But barbecuing party
people will just enjoy the flow.
</P>
<P>
   For a Tar Beach
</P>
<P>
   The third album from the English collective Massive Attack,
``Mezzanine'' (Virgin Records America), raises the kind of humidity
that can drive apartment dwellers to sleep on the roof. Its songs
hang together like a soundtrack for a midnight movie about one such
night. As their creeping, erotic dub rhythms build and their
synthesized chords swoon, each seems to carry another insomniac
upward, toward the smoggy sky.
</P>
<P>
   As always, guest vocalists flesh out the characters occupying
Massive Attack's mise en scene. Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau
Twins is an angel (or a ghost) floating through the heavy mix. The
reggae legend Horace Andy plays Ms. Fraser's mystical counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Del Naja and Grant Marshall rap in a sneaky, sing-song
style that tips them as the heavies. Sara Jay makes a cameo as a
mysterious seductress. ``Mezzanine'' sets up these characters'
fateful encounters; it's up to the listener to travel up its steps
and fill in the details of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   For a Nude Beach
</P>
<P>
   Like those brave enough to take it all off near the sea, the
second album by the rhythm-and-blues love man Maxwell, ``Embrya''
(Columbia), wears its sensuality proudly. Its rhythms coalesce into
a mellow groove that rarely shifts, causing each song to crash into
the next in a great oceanic wash.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit jazzy, a little bit Caribbean and a little bit
1970s soul, the sound is mostly soothing, the work of an expert
seducer who knows it never pays to push. It's the aural equivalent
of lotion rubbed on one's back by someone interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, the man behind the massage, never lets his croon get
too urgent as he mouths coy phrases like ``Maybe you're more than
just a one-night lady,'' and cosmic ones like ``You are me and we
are you.'' It's all very relaxing, but like so many idealized
bodies, the one Maxwell presents doesn't have a lot going on
inside. That doesn't mean he's not fun to spend an afternoon
sharing a towel with.
</P>
<P>
   For a Rocky Maine Beach
</P>
<P>
   Dana and Karen Kletter included a song about the seaside on
``Dear Enemy'' (Rykodisc), their debut album, and undoubtedly they
were imagining one of their native Southern beaches. But this
delicate collection just as easily evokes a stony coast, where
surprises lurk in the tide pools. The sisters are twins, and their
vocals twine together in that eerie way open only to siblings as
they share intimate, sometimes surreal tales of domesticity and
solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating homespun piano parts, accompanied by friends from
the underground rock scenes around Richmond, Va., the Kletters hit
upon a folkwise sound that would be traditional if it weren't so
quietly quirky.
</P>
<P>
   Their unusual style prompted Joe Boyd, the producer who worked
with the legendary folk rocker Nick Drake, to come out of
retirement and produce ``Dear Enemy.'' Meticulous and strange, with
flashes of mordant humor, it is a rustic journey for the mind.
</P>
<P>
   For a Lakefront Beach
</P>
<P>
   Straying from the minimalist country of the Scud Mountain Boys,
that group's singer and guitarist, Joe Pernice, enlisted his
brother, the guitarist Bob, and several friends for a lush journey
into orchestral pop with the Pernice Brothers' ``Overcome by
Happiness'' (Sub Pop).
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of Big Star's classic third album, ``Overcome'' taps
an all-American yearning that recalls neon-lighted fairgrounds and
lovers' cars parked at the edge of a Great Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the beauty, each song is haunted by bitterness, but its
fatalism is characteristic, too, of a land _ and a season _ in
which dreams can be won or dashed at a sideshow roulette wheel. Joe
Pernice exhibits a tendency to say one thing and sound like its
opposite, which also suits summer, when life's hard edges seem to
melt like the sad verses of his songs.

KEEPING TRACK OF FILES ON DISK 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when a home computer user had a few floppy disks with
several files on them. To find something, users stuck a disk in the
drive, looked through the directory, and if the file wasn't there,
repeated the process with another disk.
</P>
<P>
   Times change. Today's floppy disks hold several times the files
that the old five-and-a-quarter-inch disks did. Moreover,
removable, high-density drives can hold the same amount of
information contained on 70 or more floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   Where did that ``Letter to Auntie Pearl'' file go?
</P>
<P>
   DiskCataloger keeps track of such things. The program (Windows
95; about $40) from Sheridan Software Systems Inc. sets up a
DiskDataloger folder under Windows' Explorer. There, it stores
information on all the disks inserted into the computer (provided
the user clicks on a ``register the disk'' button) whether the disk
is a floppy or one of the newer high-capacity Zip, Jaz, Sparq or
other name-brand removable disks.
</P>
<P>
   It also indexes both commercial CD-ROMs and rewritable CDs.
Indexing a commercial CD, on which the files cannot be changed, may
not seem helpful, but it comes in handy when looking for a piece of
clip art, sound or other small item frequently found on CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now users do not have to constantly print hard-to-use indexes
of each disk or endlessly play disk/CD shuffle to see the contents
of each disk or CD,'' said Sheridan President Bob Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Disks are quickly cataloged by the program. After that process
is finished, the user gives the disk a name or number, then places
the same name or number on the disk so it can be retrieved when
needed by the program.
</P>
<P>
   Users can search for files by using wild cards (typing ``day''
with bring up a list of all files ending in ``day,'' for instance).
It can also be used to find files modified between two dates.
</P>
<P>
   If the disk containing the sought-after file isn't in the drive,
DiskCataloger will prompt the user to insert the disk in the proper
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used files can be dropped on the desktop where
DiskCataloger will create a shortcut for them. Clicking on the
shortcut will call up the file. A prompt will appear telling the
user to insert the appropriate disk in the drive if the file is not
found.
</P>
<P>
   The program also handles files that have been compressed. The
``zipped'' files are stored in a separate folder, and the zipped
file can be quickly expanded to see what other files it contains.
</P>
<P>
   When displaying the disk tree, disk icons show what type of disk
has been cataloged. In addition, users can assign different colors
to the disk icons so that they match the color of the disk being
cataloged or match the color of the label on the disk. It's a small
feature that makes indexing and locating disks easier.
</P>
<P>
   Once a disk is ``registered'' - the program's term for indexing
- the program automatically keeps track of files on the disk that
have been renamed, deleted or added.
</P>
<P>
   When a disk is initially inserted, DiskCataloger will ask if the
disk is to be used on one computer or more than one. The answer
depends on how the program will track the disk. But even if the
disk finds its way into another computer, it can easily be
re-indexed in a future session. The designation can also be changed
so DiskCataloger will automatically re-index a disk used in more
than one computer.
</P>
<P>
   The indexed disks can also be stored under separate category
headings, so several users of the same computer can have the disks
they use indexed under one heading.
</P>
<P>
   A trial copy of the software can be downloaded from the
company's Web site (www.shersoft.com). It will operate for 15 days.
After that time period, users can restore its operation by buying
the product from the company. For information, contact Sheridan
Software toll-free: (800) 823-4732.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stalled low pressure will circulate cool, moist air over
northern New England. Abundant clouds and scattered showers are
expected, mainly away from the coast with brisk winds from the
northwest. It will turn drier and brighter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A cool morning will yield to a pleasant afternoon with very low
humidity from the Great Lakes to the middle Atlantic coast as high
pressure maintains control. Puffy clouds will mix with intervals of
sunshine in the Appalachians. It will be cool again Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strong to severe thunderstorms will ignite from the central
Plains to the western Tennessee valley as a jet-stream disturbance
interacts with a front stalled across the Deep South. Some storms
will produce damaging wind gusts and hail. Farther east, weaker
thunderstorms will erupt near the Atlantic coast. Thundershowers
with downpours will affect parts of Florida, mainly near the west
coast.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous disturbance 18,000 feet over the northern Rockies
will cause potent thunderstorms to erupt near a cold front pressing
east through Montana and Wyoming toward the western High Plains.
Some of these storms will have large hailstones and winds over 58
mph. Elsewhere, the monsoon circulation will sponsor afternoon
thundershowers in the southern Rockies, while a weak disturbance
will prompt a few storms over eastern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a few showers will plague the Northwest coast.
Tranquil weather will embrace the rest of the Pacific states while
portions of the Southwest experience blistering heat.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hot Southern Night
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning, the mercury only fell to 83 degrees in
Texarkana, Ark., after reaching an afternoon high of 102 degrees
the day before. Never before since records began in 1930 did the
city have such a warm night. Typically, record warmth at night is a
byproduct of very high humidity and a persistent wind. During the
night, the ground cools by radiating energy into space. When the
air is in motion, the amount of time it is in contact with the
chilling ground is reduced, resulting in warm nocturnal conditions.
Winds at Texarkana averaged between 5 and 15 mph Wednesday night.

   GIRLPOWER-CEXP (Undated) _ When the Ms. Foundation talks about
girls changing the world, they don't even call it girl power. They
talk about powerful girls. ``At the Ms. Foundation for Women, we'd
be talking about the power that girls feel, particularly before
adolescence,'' said Marie Wilson, president of the foundation.
``The power that they see in their mothers, a power that girls
naturally have and adults can help sustain.''

subterranean settlements or colonize another planet to solve it,
but overpopulation is a serious problem. It is primarily the result
of a lack of birth control and education, and young marriage,
according to Christina Horpeza, the public information specialist

that affect it.

``It's a totally preventable problem where people, once they have
consumed beverages that makes them unable to function properly,
decide to perform dangerous activities,'' said Meggan(cq) Ways, a
senior at Indianapolis' Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School and
president of the school's Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD)
chapter. The national organization recently changed its name to
Students Against Destructive Decisions to encompass more of the
problems facing teens.

life, which seems to be the root of a lot of problems among teens,
she doesn't blame her actions on anyone but herself, saying that
everyone makes their own decisions. Here is her story.

 &HT;    TRANSCRIPT DETAILS TURMOIL WITHIN CNN OVER CONTROVERSIAL REPORT
 &HT;    With APRIL-OLIVER. Moving in (w) Washington and (e)
entertainment categories for release Sunday, July 12.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a July 2 conference
call in which CNN reporters and producers learned of an internal
network investigation that concluded there was insufficient
evidence to support its June 7 story alleging that U.S. forces
dropped sarin nerve gas on American defectors in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Various participants in the conference call confirmed the
accuracy of the transcript, which was obtained by Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The conference call included CNN officials and employees in
Atlanta, Washington and elsewhere. A purpose of the conference call
was to inform reporters and producers about the findings of the
internal CNN investigation, which was prepared by noted attorney
Floyd Abrams and David Kohler, general counsel of CNN News Group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants were:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jim Connor, who is now acting executive producer of the
program called ``NewsStand,'' a collaborative effort between CNN
and Time magazine, which are owned by Time Warner. Connor declined
to discuss the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Producer April Oliver and senior producer Jack Smith, who
played key roles in preparing the broadcast. Neither provided the
transcript to Cox, but both confirmed the accuracy of their
comments.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pamela Hill, who resigned as executive producer of the
program. She could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript offers a glimpse of the internal agony and
conflict over the story, which CNN has publicly retracted and
apologized for airing.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ... ``Washington, here's the deal. There is a fifty-page
report prepared by Floyd Abrams and David Kohler. Fifty-four page
report. That will be released shortly. I'll make sure you get
copies. There is a statement by (Tom Johnson, CNN Chairman and CEO
and president of CNN News Group) which I will fax to you shortly as
soon as I'm allowed to release that. (NewsStand executive producer
Pamela Hill) has resigned and her resignation has been accepted.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``The central findings of the report are that, while a lot of
material was gathered in support of the broadcast, there was
insufficient evidence to support the broadcast, there was
insufficient evidence to support the conclusions, that there were
problems with the two key on-air sources ... (and that another
interviewee was) used in an inappropriate way and that (two others)
who. . .said it was not sarin, were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Kohler and Floyd Abrams spent a lot of time and a lot of
money trying to find somebody who could back us, and they couldn't.
...Rick Kaplan (president of CNN-U.S.) believes in this program, he
believes in all of us. And we're going to go on. We're going to try
and kill this thing, drive a stake through its heart and bury it
(once the internal report and retraction are issued) so it's gone,
and go forward with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Connor, asked if anyone else had been requested to resign, names
senior producer Jack Smith and producer April Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``I'm sitting here and no one has contacted me and I'm
not _ as far as I'm concerned I'm not resigning, they will have to
fire me.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``All right April, let's deal with this separately. I
thought you had been contacted. I had been given the information
that you had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``I have not.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Oliver then takes issue with the conclusions in the Abrams
report and complains that the internal CNN investigation did not
offer her an adequate opportunity to defend her reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``We were not given feedback on that report even though
we were promised feedback on that report. Jack and I both feel that
there were substantial flaws in that report. For instance, to knock
down (retired Navy Adm. Thomas Moorer, now 86, who at the time of
the alleged gassing was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) as a
source they used my very first get-to-know you conversation where
he says 'I'm not confirming anything,' instead of my last
conversation with him where he confirms everything. They just
completely neglected to go to the hardest evidence and I'm not sure
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contention that (mission commander Eugene) McCarley was
ignored is inaccurate. He was in there multiple times defending his
point of view. McCarley said clearly, ``'Whatever was dropped from
the sky, I don't know what it was.' He said, 'it was an accident we
went into that village.' He got the opportunity to present his
point of view multiple times. He was one of the lead figures in the
broadcast. I think it was quite unfair for us to have been promised
an opportunity to comment on the report and then not have that
opportunity at all. In addition, this notion that I have resigned
is false. ...I have not even been contacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``April, I will withdraw what I said and I will make
sure that you are contacted ASAP. ...I want people to understand
one thing here. Jack (Smith) defended this with fire, emotion,
logic and reason for an hour last night. Should you have gotten
more time _ yes. But he was stalwart in his defense of the
reporting, in his defense of the story. I mean, it was the most
honorable act I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Oliver later asks to make another point about the report from
the internal investigation:
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``The producers requested an hour to do this story in
January. We wrote a proposal outlining an hour, knowing full well
that it was a controversial story and that it needed full vetting.
Every time that they hit on us in that report, it's for something
we excluded. When you came to us this past spring, you told us to
do a 14-minute piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``That's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``So, how come we're being fired for not including all
these things that we couldn't possibly fit into a 14-minute
piece?''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``April, you're asking the unanswerable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Smith joins the conference call in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith: ``I hate to be late, as they say, to your own hanging,
but tell me the latest.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``Well, the latest is that Pam's resignation has been
accepted. Pamela's got some things that she wants to say to us.
...Will you go get her ask her to come in?''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Hill, who has just resigned as executive producer of the
program, addresses the group:
</P>
<P>
   Hill: ``I just want to say to you all that this has been as
traumatic for all of you as it has been for those of us most
immediately involved. I believe that the company did the right
thing. I absolutely believe that they did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake. (CNN reporter and commentator) Jeff
Greenfield asked me early on, 'did we add two an two and get five?'
And at the time I did not believe that. I believed that we had
added two and two and had four. The documentary evidence. The
evidence, the briefing book was very persuasive. We were all moving
too fast to get to air and everybody moving very, very, very fast,
but I think that in the end as questions came up here. ...I wanted
Floyd to come in, I was the person who first called Floyd Abrams, I
have a huge regard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good faith on the part of everybody involved. We _ I
think in the end we didn't have all of _ the report takes the view
that we didn't have enough information to go to air and I think
that is fair. Floyd and David Kohler read everything. They spent
two very intense weeks on this and when _ if you don't have it,
then the very best thing is to do what the company did. That is to
take a look at this and say 'OK, we weren't ready. We didn't have
it and we retract.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Smith then provides his account of his meeting earlier in the
day with CNN Chairman and CEO Tom Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Smith: ``Let me tell you so that everybody hears this. Tom
Johnson called me about 10:15 this morning and after we discussed
the report. ...I told him that I strenuously objected to its
conclusion and a great many of its particulars. A great many of its
particulars. Tom Johnson then said, 'I'm here to ask you either to
resign or I'm going to terminate you. If you don't resign, I'll
terminate you.' I said to Johnson that there had been an agreement
with David Kohler last night at one in the morning that April and I
would have an opportunity to comment and criticize the draft report
and that no action would be taken until that was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Johnson then said he would hold in abeyance what he said
to me with respect to resignation or termination until that noon
meeting, that noon call with Kohler and whoever else was supposed
to be on that call, took place. That's my last conversation with
Johnson. I also told him at the time that April and I had not been
interviewed as part this investigation in spite of Mr. Abrams and
Mr. Kohler indicating that would be done. It was not done. We were
misled and we were deceived.
</P>
<P>
   A participant in Atlanta said, ``it raises the question about
the whole credibility of the. (Abrams) report.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith: ``And they should hold off the release of anything until
we have that conversation. Fairness is not being accomplished here.
They should not go forward with any public release until we, the
principals of this story, who've been gagged for the last two
weeks, have an opportunity to speak about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gagged us. They have deceived us and they have
misled us and every reporter in this room should know that. This is
a corporate whitewash. This is a cave to the military
establishment, to the secret army which is one step away from the
secret police. ``

</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``All right April, let's deal with this separately. I
thought you had been contacted. I had been given the information
that you had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``I have not.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Oliver then takes issue with the conclusions in the Abrams
report and complains that the internal CNN investigation did not
offer her an adequate opportunity to defend her reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``We were not given feedback on that report even though
we were promised feedback on that report. Jack and I both feel that
there were substantial flaws in that report. For instance, to knock
down (retired Navy Adm. Thomas Moorer, now 86, who at the time of
the alleged gassing was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) as a
source they used my very first get-to-know you conversation where
he says 'I'm not confirming anything,' instead of my last
conversation with him where he confirms everything. They just
completely neglected to go to the hardest evidence and I'm not sure
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contention that (mission commander Eugene) McCarley was
ignored is inaccurate. He was in there multiple times defending his
point of view. McCarley said clearly, ``'Whatever was dropped from
the sky, I don't know what it was.' He said, 'it was an accident we
went into that village.' He got the opportunity to present his
point of view multiple times. He was one of the lead figures in the
broadcast. I think it was quite unfair for us to have been promised
an opportunity to comment on the report and then not have that
opportunity at all. In addition, this notion that I have resigned
is false. ...I have not even been contacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``April, I will withdraw what I said and I will make
sure that you are contacted ASAP. ...I want people to understand
one thing here. Jack (Smith) defended this with fire, emotion,
logic and reason for an hour last night. Should you have gotten
more time _ yes. But he was stalwart in his defense of the
reporting, in his defense of the story. I mean, it was the most
honorable act I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Oliver later asks to make another point about the report from
the internal investigation:
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``The producers requested an hour to do this story in
January. We wrote a proposal outlining an hour, knowing full well
that it was a controversial story and that it needed full vetting.
Every time that they hit on us in that report, it's for something
we excluded. When you came to us this past spring, you told us to
do a 14-minute piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``That's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver: ``So, how come we're being fired for not including all
these things that we couldn't possibly fit into a 14-minute
piece?''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``April, you're asking the unanswerable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Smith joins the conference call in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith: ``I hate to be late, as they say, to your own hanging,
but tell me the latest.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``Well, the latest is that Pam's resignation has been
accepted. Pamela's got some things that she wants to say to us.
...Will you go get her ask her to come in?''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Hill, who has just resigned as executive producer of the
program, addresses the group:
</P>
<P>
   Hill: ``I just want to say to you all that this has been as
traumatic for all of you as it has been for those of us most
immediately involved. I believe that the company did the right
thing. I absolutely believe that they did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake. (CNN reporter and commentator) Jeff
Greenfield asked me early on, 'did we add two an two and get five?'
And at the time I did not believe that. I believed that we had
added two and two and had four. The documentary evidence. The
evidence, the briefing book was very persuasive. We were all moving
too fast to get to air and everybody moving very, very, very fast,
but I think that in the end as questions came up here. ...I wanted
Floyd to come in, I was the person who first called Floyd Abrams, I
have a huge regard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good faith on the part of everybody involved. We _ I
think in the end we didn't have all of _ the report takes the view
that we didn't have enough information to go to air and I think
that is fair. Floyd and David Kohler read everything. They spent
two very intense weeks on this and when _ if you don't have it,
then the very best thing is to do what the company did. That is to
take a look at this and say 'OK, we weren't ready. We didn't have
it and we retract.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Smith then provides his account of his meeting earlier in the
day with CNN Chairman and CEO Tom Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Smith: ``Let me tell you so that everybody hears this. Tom
Johnson called me about 10:15 this morning and after we discussed
the report. ...I told him that I strenuously objected to its
conclusion and a great many of its particulars. A great many of its
particulars. Tom Johnson then said, 'I'm here to ask you either to
resign or I'm going to terminate you. If you don't resign, I'll
terminate you.' I said to Johnson that there had been an agreement
with David Kohler last night at one in the morning that April and I
would have an opportunity to comment and criticize the draft report
and that no action would be taken until that was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Johnson then said he would hold in abeyance what he said
to me with respect to resignation or termination until that noon
meeting, that noon call with Kohler and whoever else was supposed
to be on that call, took place. That's my last conversation with
Johnson. I also told him at the time that April and I had not been
interviewed as part this investigation in spite of Mr. Abrams and
Mr. Kohler indicating that would be done. It was not done. We were
misled and we were deceived.
</P>
<P>
   A participant in Atlanta said, ``it raises the question about
the whole credibility of the. (Abrams) report.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith: ``And they should hold off the release of anything until
we have that conversation. Fairness is not being accomplished here.
They should not go forward with any public release until we, the
principals of this story, who've been gagged for the last two
weeks, have an opportunity to speak about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gagged us. They have deceived us and they have
misled us and every reporter in this room should know that. This is
a corporate whitewash. This is a cave to the military
establishment, to the secret army which is one step away from the
secret police. ``

   WASHINGTON _ As part of a major shift in its defense strategy,
Britain has announced it will spend an estimated $900 million for
four Boeing C-17s in what would be the first international order
for the new Air Force cargo jet. The purchase, which still must
clear hurdles in the British government, could open the door to
more C-17 sales to Britain and to other NATO allies in Europe,
aerospace industry analysts say. By MICHAEL D. TOWLE. Story will

   Like a beach ball held under water and then released, the dollar
popped up again last week. The dollar index, a measure of the value
of the United States currency against 10 major world currencies,
reached a high Thursday of 102.46, a level unseen since 1989. The
index closed the week at 102.03.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders, concerned that the Treasury might intervene
again on behalf of the Japanese yen and sell dollars, were cautious
about the move. Was it a blip or the start of a long dollar
uptrend?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the birth of a new bull market in the dollar that
won't peak out until 2002,'' said Martin Armstrong, chairman of
Princeton Economics International, a global advisory firm based in
Princeton, N.J., that specializes in global economic issues.

   Armstrong expects the dollar to hit 200 yen a year from now, up
from 141.2 on Friday. He expects the U.S. currency to rally to 2.85
German marks to the dollar, up from 1.82.
</P>
<P>
   A strong dollar has implications for both stock and bond
investors in the United States. Generally, a powerful currency is
negative for stocks because it makes U.S. goods more expensive
overseas. Bonds, meanwhile, are helped by a rising dollar as
investors the world over buy U.S. Treasuries to benefit from the
currency's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, currency traders were waiting to see results of
Sunday's parliamentary elections in Japan. But the elections will
have little impact on the three bases for Armstrong's forecast of a
stronger dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The first is Phase 2 of financial deregulation in Japan, set for
Jan. 1, 1999, which will free Japanese pension funds to invest in
instruments other than Japanese government bonds. Because
confidence in Japan's institutions is so low, and interest rates
are less than 1 percent, the managers will find U.S. Treasuries
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong says that discussions with some of these managers
leads him to expect that 15 percent of the $9 trillion invested
will head for the U.S. bond market. That's more than $1 trillion.
``The Japanese have the potential to be to the U.S. bond market
what the Hunt brothers were to silver,'' he said, referring to the
Texas investors.
</P>
<P>
   This flood of funds will drive long-term U.S. interest rates to
4.75 percent from Sunday's 5.6 percent. Funds will begin flowing in
January; more will come in April, when Japan's fiscal year begins.
</P>
<P>
   The second prod to the dollar relates to the economic meltdown
in Russia. U.S. exposure is relatively small: of the $70 billion in
loans to Russia, 10 percent originated here. Most came from Europe;
$30 billion from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the dollar will benefit from the chaos surrounding the
introduction of the euro, the single European currency, next year.
``Capital is pouring out of Germany,'' said Armstrong. ``They have
figured out that the value of the euro cannot be the value of the
strongest currency in the basket. So they're moving out capital as
a hedge.'' Where is it going? To the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a mighty dollar and a bull move in bonds. As
for stocks, Armstrong thinks European markets, up more than 35
percent this year, are very vulnerable. U.S. markets, concerned
about the dollar's rise and the upheaval in Russia, may decline
later this summer, Armstrong said. But he doesn't expect a
correction greater than 20 percent. ``With U.S. interest rates
coming down,'' he said, ``Equities will recover.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 10 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: IRS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 96-2, to revamp the IRS and expand
the rights of taxpayers. When Clinton signs the measure, it will be
the most significant change in the agency since 1952. Supporters
said the bill will make the IRS more accountable to private
citizens and more customer service oriented. It will also place the
burden of proof on the agency in certain disputes before tax court.
No one rose in opposition. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SANCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 98-0, to lift sanctions on
agricultural exports and medicine to India and Pakistan. Under this
legislation, those countries could buy American farm products.
Supporters said cutting off agricultural sales to countries
involved in nuclear proliferation hurts only American farmers and
ranchers and does not deter nuclear build-up. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 96-1, to pass a higher education bill
that would allow college students to borrow money at lower interest
rates and would increase the maximum federal grant for needy
students by $2,000. Lawmakers will have to resolve differences
between this bill, which they say would make a college education
available to more Americans, and the administration's stance, which
opposes giving lenders subsidies to keep interest rates low. No one
rose in opposition. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

DOUGLAS S. CROCKET, 70; REPORTER, DIRECTOR OF GLOBE SANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas S. Crocket of Yarmouth, Mass., a lifelong newspaperman
and longtime director of Globe Santa whose heart-rending stories
led thousands to dig deep each Christmas and provide presents for
needy youngsters, died of colon cancer Friday in Cape Cod Hospital
in Hyannis. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Crocket wasn't a journalist. He was a reporter. A reporter
of the old school: a tough-talking sweetheart who could converse
cynically about current affairs, then crank out a human interest
story that would make you cry over your cup of coffee the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Somerville, Mass., he got bitten by the newspaper
bug while still a student at the Cambridge High and Latin School,
when he got his first story published in the old Boston Record
American. He became a copy boy at the Record.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school he served in the Navy, where
he got further training as a reporter for the Jacksonville (Fla.)
Navy Base newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Boston University in 1952 and was editor of
the Arlington Advocate for about a year before joining the Globe
staff.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career at the Globe, Mr. Crocket wrote about
everything from local politics to lion trainers. He had a fine eye
for detail: the young defendant who sat in court clutching rosary
beads and religious pictures as her one-year sentence was read, the
cabdriver with the rat-a-tat rap of the pitchman. And he saw it all
with an unblinking eye. ``Agony '' he once wrote, ``is not physical
pain. It is the collapse of a man who has lost his youngest son.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Crocket took a hands-on approach to his profession. At
various times he performed as a circus clown, pumped gas, and drove
a garbage truck for feature stories published in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught journalism at Boston University for many years,
but he is perhaps best remembered for his many years as director of
Globe Santa. He began writing stories and raising funds for the
annual project shortly after the Globe took over the drive from the
Boston Post when it folded in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Though he retired in 1987, he returned to the Globe every
Thanksgiving for the next 10 years to write stories and raise funds
for the monthlong Globe Santa drive. His byline and his craggy
visage looked out from newspaper photos as he accepted checks for
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew V. Storin, editor of the Globe, said: ``Doug was right
out of the `The Front Page.' He was the ultimate street reporter
who could talk to anyone and get anyone to talk to him. When his
reporter's legs gave out, he applied those same skills to making
Globe Santa the great charity it is.''
</P>
<P>
   When informed of his death, William O. Taylor, chairman of the
board of directors of the Globe, said: ``Doug was one of the true
`Globies','' _ as we used to call Globe staffers who made a unique
contribution to the paper. Doug was No. 1 Globe Santa
representative to the community. He developed a loyal following,
year after year, building on friendships for the benefit of young
kids. We will all miss his enthusiasm and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a sister, Joan, of Charlestown, Mass.

JUDGE SUMMONS PARTIES IN TEXAS TOBACCO DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hoping to kick-start stalled negotiations
between feuding sides in the state's multibillion-dollar tobacco
settlement, U.S. District Judge David Folsom has told all parties
in the dispute to appear at the federal courthouse in Texarkana on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The $15.3 billion settlement was reached earlier this year, but
has been bogged down over objections to fees the Texas attorney
general agreed to pay the private lawyers hired to fight the case.
Leading lawmakers say the $2.3 billion in fees for lawyers is too
much for a case that never went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, counties and hospital districts fear that the
landmark settlement will prevent them from getting their share of
the settlement or from suing the tobacco industry to recover costs
of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales, the private attorneys he hired in
the case and representatives from Gov. George W. Bush's office will
attend the closed hearing in the judge's chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Also included will be attorneys for the lawmakers who are
challenging the lawyers' fees and the consortium of counties and
hospital districts angered over the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is very interested in seeing this settlement
finalized,'' said Sonya Sanchez, a spokeswoman for Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said Folsom is expected to act as a ``catalyst'' to help
wrap up negotiations in the dispute so the settlement with the
tobacco industry can become final.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has insisted that he, too, wants an end to the ordeal. He
believes that is possible if Morales will agree to sever the
contentious attorneys' fees issue from the main settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Banning, a spokesman for the group of private attorneys
hired by Morales, said Folsom could insist on assuming a position
of mediator in the complex disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, if he gets them all in a room together, they can
hammer something out,'' Banning said.
</P>
<P>
   A top priority in the hearing will be to address the legal claim
by the group of counties and hospital districts, Sanchez said. The
challenge has the ability to scuttle the entire deal.
</P>
<P>
   The counties and hospital districts have complained that the
deal Morales reached with the tobacco industry cuts them out of any
financial settlement. It also unfairly limits their ability to
recover damages from tobacco companies, the group contends.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom was scheduled to hear the Texas lawsuit against the
tobacco industry in Texarkana, but the parties settled out of court
before the trial began.

STATUE TO HONOR HINDU THEOLOGIAN WHO VISITED U.S. A CENTURY AGO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. _ Swami Vivekananda may not be a name to trip
easily off the tongues of many Americans these days, but its owner
made headlines a century ago, as the man who on a single,
extraordinary day was acclaimed as an ambassador of Hinduism to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   That was Sept. 11, 1893, when Vivekananda, a 30-year-old monk
from Calcutta, took the podium at the World's Parliament of
Religions, an unusual interfaith gathering in Chicago, and declared
that the faith he followed emphasized toleration and accepted all
religions as true.
</P>
<P>
   His handsome face, saffron turban and flowing coat may also have
affected members of the audience, because they greeted his first
words _ ``Sisters and brothers of America'' _ with a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day,'' Vivekananda wrote in a letter, ``all the
papers announced that my speech was the hit of the day, and I
became known to the whole of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 105 years, Vivekananda, whose writings would be
praised by Gandhi and Tolstoy, will be honored with a 10-foot-high
bronze statue, to be unveiled July 12 at the Hindu Temple of
Greater Chicago in the suburban city of Lemont.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was unknown in the United States before the
parliament, Vivekananda arrived in the United States at a
propitious time. His ideas _ that a universal truth lies behind all
faiths and that everyone possesses a divine spark that can be
cultivated through meditation and study _ appealed to many
religious liberals, like those who had organized the parliament,
and are perpetuated today in the movement that he founded, the
Vedanta Societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a touching message for the people to understand, that
we are all one,'' said Swami Chidananda, who heads a Chicago
monastery of the Ramakrishna Order, an international organization
that Vivekananda founded 101 years ago.

   ``Swami Vivekananda, his message to the people in the West was
each soul is potentially divine,'' Swami Chidananda said, as
workmen at the temple prepared a mound, to be called Vivekananda
Hill, where the statue will stand. ``He also said God is one.
People call God by different names, but it is the same. He preached
peace and harmony among the religions.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta in 1863, the son of a
lawyer in Calcutta, then the capital of British India. Biographers
describe the young man as possessing immense philosophical
curiosity, always asking questions about faith and meaning. A
spiritual search led him to Sri Ramakrishna, a mystic and a priest
of the goddess Kali, who taught that all religions lead to God and
who once had a vision of the Madonna and Christ child.
</P>
<P>
   As Ramakrishna's disciple, Datta took the monastic name
Vivekananda and assumed leadership of his teacher's followers after
the older man's death in 1886. He later wandered India as a monk,
carrying a staff, a water pot, a begging bowl and two books: the
Bhagavad Gita, an essential Hindu scripture, and the medieval
devotional classic, ``The Imitation of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned about the Parliament of Religions while in India, but
once in the United States, he was told he could not participate
without credentials from a religious organization. Through somewhat
roundabout circumstances, he secured a place on the program through
the help of a professor of Greek at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Parlato, a member of the Ramakrishna monastery in Chicago,
said the two-ton statue of Vivekananda was cast by the same Indian
company that created one of Ramakrishna, which stands at the
religious order's headquarters at Belur, near Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   Parlato, who was able to answer questions about the swami's life
in considerable detail, said he was researching a new biography of
Vivekananda for Western readers. After the parliament, Vivekananda
lectured widely in the United States. Parlato said the swami taught
the first yoga classes in the United States, without charge, in a
Manhattan apartment on West 33rd Street in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   Vivekananda also made extended visits to New England,
befriending philosopher William James (who called him ``a wonder
for oratorical power'') and lecturing at Harvard. He traveled twice
to Europe, lecturing there, before returning, in 1897, to India to
much acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to the United States in December 1899, for a
six-month stay, before his death at age 39 in 1902. In Los Angeles,
he caught a touring Broadway play inspired by his earlier visit.
Parlato said the production was titled ``My Friend from India'' and
concerned social climbers who dressed their barber as a Hindu sage
so they might break into high society.
</P>
<P>
   What did Vivekananda think of the play? ``I think he said he
never saw anything so funny,'' Parlato said.

WHOLESALE PRICES EASE AFTER THREE-MONTH RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asia's shrinking economies have taken some of the steam out of
US wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices charged by producers of the nation's goods eased in June
for the first time in three months. The government reported Friday
the Producer Price Index declined by 0.1 percent last month as
falling demand for oil by struggling Asian countries pulled down
oil prices, a big component in the index.
</P>
<P>
   Another damper on inflation has been a sharp decline in Asian
currencies, starting with the Thai bhat last year and spreading
recently to the Japanese yen. As the dollar's value has risen
against these currencies, US consumers are paying less for Asian
goods. Lower import prices in turn have forced American companies
to lower their prices to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation is simply not a problem,'' said Nicholas Perna,
chief economist for Fleet Financial Group Inc. ``Right now what is
more of a problem is ... how much damage is the Asia situation
doing to the US economy. We simply don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But a reversal in producer prices _ following an 0.2 percent
rise in each of the two prior months, April and May _ may not be
enough to ease concerns that inflation may flare in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Federal Reserve Board, which can raise rates to
crube inflation, are concerned that the the overheated US economy
and low unemployment are pushing up wages, a force driving
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Fed members voted in a May 19 meeting to keep the federal funds
rate steady at 5.5 percent. Some Fed members said that their vote
was a close call and that they may vote to raise rates at the next
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The producer price report by the Labor Department contained some
evidence of increasing inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The ``core'' PPI in June, which excludes the volatile prices of
food and energy, rose a moderate 0.2 percent last month, matching
increases in two prior month. Economists blamed the June rate on an
unexpected jump in prices of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tiny little red flag but it's still a red flag,'' said
William Dudley, senior US economist for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A more precise measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index,
is scheduled to be released next week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long-running economic boom in this country,
inflation has remained calm for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Producer Price Index for the year-ending with June rose a
slight 0.8 percent, according to Fleet's Perna. But the PPI for the
first six months of 1998, when annualized, increased 1.5 percent.

IMF FUNDING DEBATE PUTS STRESS ON HOUSE GOP LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12)   (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich's support for new U.S.
funding for the International Monetary Fund appears likely to
rekindle a bitter debate over the role of the 182-member
organization that could pit him against other Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The funding debate comes as Russia and the IMF work out the
final details of a bailout loan that is expected to total between
$10 billion and $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the Russian deal goes through, the IMF _ which already has
committed $35 billion in the past year to rescue crisis-stricken
Asian nations _ would be close to going broke.
</P>
<P>
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus says the Russian bailout
would leave the lending institution ``unable to quickly intervene
in any future financial crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing Congress to help the IMF by approving $18 billion in new
U.S. contributions, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned recently
that a deepening of the Asian crisis or the eruption of a new
currency crisis elsewhere could have a ``very substantial impact on
the U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's request for $18 billion won Senate
approval in March but has run into stiff opposition in the House
where IMF critics complain that the institution is too secretive
and that many of the conditions the IMF imposes on borrowing
countries end up hurting their economies rather than helping.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also argue that the IMF encourages banks and investors
to make risky loans because they know the IMF would step in and
protect them if their investments went bad.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had opposed the $18 billion plan until last month. But
under pressure from corporate lobbying groups and agricultural
advocates that have been hurt badly by plummeting Asian economies,
the speaker has become a supporter of more U.S. help.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Congress recessed for the July 4th holiday, he
announced his support and said the House would take up IMF funding
legislation by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the kind of changes you have in Indonesia, in Russia and
in South Korea, and the potential challenges in Japan, we have an
obligation to work with the International Monetary Fund,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's sudden support for the IMF was countered by ardent
opposition from Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and other conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving the IMF more money is not a panacea for all the
troubles that bedevil the Asian economy,'' DeLay said after hearing
of Gingrich's new stance. ``In fact, in many instances, the IMF is
the problem, not the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey continues to argue that the IMF causes more harm than good
by not allowing corrupt and incompetent banking systems to fail
under a free-market system.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and Armey insist that any more U.S. help for the IMF
should be conditioned on the IMF's commitment to adopt new policies
of openness. If the reform measures are not included in the bill or
Gingrich asks for too much money, sources say DeLay and Armey may
work against the speaker on a final floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has not said how much money he will try to secure for
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF funding issue also has become snarled in a campaign by
conservative House Republicans to link anti-abortion provisions to
foreign-policy initiatives, including IMF funding.
</P>
<P>
   These conservatives oppose any legislation approving money for
the United Nations or the IMF unless the measures include separate
provisions barring American aid to overseas family-planning groups
that advocate abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, an anti-abortion provision introduced by Rep.
Chris Smith, R-N.J., effectively killed a bill to make overdue
payments to the United Nations and to provide additional IMF
funding.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gingrich, R-Ga., supported the Smith measure.
</P>
<P>
   So even if the speaker is able to placate DeLay and Armey, he
still faces the threat of Smith attaching an anti-abortion measure
to the IMF funding measure, which Clinton has threatened to veto in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress approves IMF funding but attaches the anti-abortion
provisions to the bill, Clinton would be caught in a tight corner
because he is eager to help the IMF, on the one hand, but is
nervous about offending abortion rights groups, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Wolfe, a spokesman for Smith, said the congressman has not
decided whether to add an anti-abortion provision to any new IMF
funding bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still waiting to see if an IMF funding bill makes it to
the floor, but if it does, we would certainly consider attaching an
abortion measure to it,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials say the fund has only about $10 billion to $15
billion in its coffers that can be used to help member countries
through financial crises. Established in 1945, the IMF primary role
today is to stabilize faltering financial markets around the world.
The fund often accomplishes this by buying large amounts of a
currency that's falling and by providing money to banks that are
near collapse because of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF could tap into an emergency fund of about $24 billion,
but any use of that money requires the approval of the United
States and other rich countries, which IMF officials say would
waste valuable time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To help garner support for the IMF, Gingrich has attempted to
draw attention to falling American exports to Asian countries,
particularly in agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers and ranchers must have the confidence that they will
be able to sell their products on the world market without
restriction in the years ahead,'' Gingrich said in a letter to Rep.
Robert F. Smith, R-Ore., chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee before the recess.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, who introduced an IMF funding bill
last month, said in an interview that many Americans fail to
understand how important exports are to Iowa and other agricultural
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``My state's whole economy is dependent on agriculture, and
agriculture is now an international industry that needs strong
economies in Asia to buy its goods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Iowa's farm income comes from foreign sales,
which have plummeted as many Asian economies continue to
disintegrate. In the past two years, Indonesia's economy has shrunk
by 80 percent, Thailand's by 50 percent, South Korea's by 45
percent, Malaysia's by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By looking out for agricultural interests, Gingrich also may be
keeping his options open for a possible presidential bid in 2000,
when Iowa would be a key battleground for Republican nominating
delegates.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 10 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: IRS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 96-2, to revamp the IRS and expand
the rights of taxpayers. When Clinton signs the measure, it will be
the most significant change in the agency since 1952. Supporters
said the bill will make the IRS more accountable to private
citizens and more customer service oriented. It will also place the
burden of proof on the agency in certain disputes before tax court.
No one rose in opposition. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SANCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 98-0, to lift sanctions on
agricultural exports and medicine to India and Pakistan. Under this
legislation, those countries could buy American farm products.
Supporters said cutting off agricultural sales to countries
involved in nuclear proliferation hurts only American farmers and
ranchers and does not deter nuclear build-up. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 96-1, to pass a higher education bill
that would allow college students to borrow money at lower interest
rates and would increase the maximum federal grant for needy
students by $2,000. Lawmakers will have to resolve differences
between this bill, which they say would make a college education
available to more Americans, and the administration's stance, which
opposes giving lenders subsidies to keep interest rates low. No one
rose in opposition. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Brace yourself. It's time for the Asian aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   When East Asia was hit by its economic earthquake a year ago,
the shock waves quickly reverberated around the globe through the
world's hair-trigger stock and currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the more powerful impact is working through a slower-moving
and less visible force: the markets for basic commodities like oil,
metals and timber. And that helps explain why the ripples from the
Asian financial collapse are continuing to hit hard at countries as
far-flung as Canada, Chile, New Zealand and Mexico while the effect
has remained unexpectedly benign in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For nations that depend heavily on selling raw materials and
basic goods globally to generate growth and to support their
government budgets, the pain has been sharp, contributing to job
cutbacks, lower currency values, shortfalls in government revenues
and ballooning trade deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, commodity prices are down almost 10 percent since
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the weakness in certain commodities
is reverberating in markets around the world,'' said Desmond
Lachman, managing director of emerging markets economic research at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Drops in the prices for copper have hit Zambia and Chile, while
New Zealand has felt the impact of lower timber prices. Australia
is suffering from a decline in wool prices; Canada bears the pain
of lower coal and timber prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and Europe are in significantly different
positions. Even though exports from Europe and America to Asia have
dropped sharply and the United States exports a lot of its own
commodities, it is far less dependent on them. In addition,
generally affluent consumers in the world's two biggest economic
entities have received a big boost _ similar to the effects of a
substantial tax cut _ because of the decline in commodity prices.
This has largely cushioned the Asian fallout so far here and in
much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the impact of lower oil prices, which have fallen from
a high of $22 a barrel in the last year to a low of $11.56 a barrel
last month. While not all of this is a result of the crisis in
Asia, a major portion is because the Asian economic engine has
stopped racing ahead and has gone into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   That has translated into about $14 billion in lost income this
year to major oil producers like Russia, Mexico, Venezuela and the
Middle East and a nearly equivalent bonus for energy consumers. For
the United States, which produced 6.4 million barrels a day in
April but also imported 10.4 million barrels daily, the positive
gain for consumers has far outweighed the negative impact on oil
drillers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision
Economics, is forecasting that lost growth from U.S. exports and
the substitution of cheaper Asian imports for products made here
could cut as much a one full percentage point off the increase in
the gross domestic product this year.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he estimates that the overall decline in
oil prices, by putting more money into the pockets of U.S.
consumers, will add back much, though probably not all, of the
growth lost through worsening foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not the only stimulus from Asia. The flight of
foreign investors from Asia's problems and into the haven of
Treasury bonds has bolstered the dollar and pushed U.S. long-term
interest rates to 30-year lows. The near absence of inflation has
been helped by lower commodity prices and cheaper import prices.
All that has allowed growth to perk along without the inflationary
pressures that would have normally forced the Federal Reserve to
put on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Both low rates and low inflation have helped keep the stock
market rally alive, adding to the ``wealth effect'' from the market
rally that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, among others, believes
has kept the economy strong by stimulating spending.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, Sinai said, ``It is possible that the
positive byproducts could be more than enough to offset the
negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   But for major commodity-producing nations, the cushion has been
less comforting.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, where commodities make up about 40 percent of
exports, the Canadian dollar has been bouncing off record lows,
largely because of the weakness of commodity prices. While the
economy is still forecast to grow around 3 percent this year,
Ottawa has abandoned its policy of raising interest rates to
support the Canadian dollar. That has helped offset some of the
Asian impact, according to Ram Bhagavatula, the chief financial
economist at Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are forecasting that New Zealand's commodity-sensitive
economy could tip into a short recession because of the falloff in
the sales of lumber, fish, fruits, vegetables and the like. And if
Japan _ one of the principal buyers of New Zealand products _
remains mired in recession, prospects could worsen.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, the Aussie dollar plunged to a 12-year low in June
as new forecasts showed that total commodity exports should fall by
1 percent over the next year, after rising more than 7 percent the
previous year. Like Canada, Australia may have enough domestic
demand to keep it out of a recession. But some economists are
scaling back their growth forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The continued low level of commodity prices means that many
countries _ along with their financial markets _ will probably
remain vulnerable to further shocks for some time. Even in Canada
and Australia, where no recession is in sight, the weakened
currencies will mean growing trade deficits and inflationary
pressure as import costs rise.
</P>
<P>
   Money in stock markets around the world can move quickly, often
in anticipation of fundamental economic changes expected in the
future. But a meaningful rebound in commodity prices will probably
wait until the economies of Asia actually turn around and begin to
consume more oil, copper, coal, fish and vegetables.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, two World Bank economists, Guillermo Perry
and Daniel Lederman, discussed the fallout from declining commodity
prices, which they called real effects, and the fallout from
declines in equity and currency markets, which they called
financial effects.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the impact of Asia's downturn on Latin America, they
found that the weakness caused by the real effects from lower
commodity prices ``may produce an increase in the financial
vulnerability of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are other factors that explain some of the drop in
commodity prices: El Nino and a warm winter contributed to the
softness in oil demand, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But the key factor remains Asia. The International Monetary
Fund, in its recent World Economic Outlook, concluded that the drop
in primary commodity prices as a group was ``to a large degree'' a
result of the Asian downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Asia has had this impact, the report said, because the region
had stopped increasing its consumption of oil, copper, rubber,
zinc, nickel, wool and timber. For example, South Korea, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, where the Asian crisis has
hit hard, accounted for about a quarter of the growth of demand for
copper between 1992 and 1996. With that demand now shrinking,
copper prices have dropped almost 35 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The copper fallout has been felt in Zambia, where the metal
accounts for more than 80 percent of export earnings, and in Chile,
where copper accounts for 42 percent of export earnings. A major
share of Chile's exports go to Asia and the government estimates
that it has lost as much as $500 million in forgone Asian sales.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chile's government announced $200 million in new
budget cuts that bring the total for the year to $685 million.
Interest rates have risen and the peso has fallen to record lows,
forcing the central bank to drop policies that limited foreign
investment and to use its dollar reserves to defend the peso.
</P>
<P>
   In New Zealand, timber exports, which are about 10 percent of
the country's total, collapsed with the weakness in the housing
market in Japan, said Mark Benseman, an economist for Merrill Lynch
in Auckland. He estimates that about 34 percent of the country's
exports _ those going to Australia and Asia _ have been affected by
the slump.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the Japanese recession has had a stark impact.
According to the most recent trade statistics, exports to Japan,
measured in Canadian dollars, have fallen 43 percent since April of
1997. The decline has been spread over most commodity groups, led
by softwood lumber. In the first quarter, exports of coal and
related products to Japan fell 84 percent. There also have been
significant declines in commodity exports to South Korea and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the value of agricultural and fishing exports are down
8.5 percent since April of 1997 while energy exports are off 17.5
percent and forestry products are down 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest impact of all has occurred in the oil markets.
Mike Rothman, Merrill Lynch's senior energy analyst, estimates that
consumption of oil this year has been cut by as much 300,000
barrels a day in developing Asia and even more by the recession in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There are 25 countries that count on petroleum revenue for 20
percent or more of their foreign exchange earnings, according to
the International Monetary Fund. There are also five oil exporters
that count on oil revenues for 40 percent or more of their
government budget.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, oil represents only 12 percent of total exports, but
it supports 40 percent of government spending, according to Merrill
Lynch. In Venezuela, oil is a double whammy, accounting for 77
percent of exports and 57 percent of government spending.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Mexican peso has fallen 10 percent this year.
And even though the economy is growing briskly, the government has
just approved a third package of spending cuts, slicing $3.7
billion in all.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, which is a major exporter of commodities from oil to
precious metals, the oil price drop hit in two ways. First, oil
accounts for more than 20 percent of export earnings, but Russia
has had to cut production by 350,000 barrels a day because the cost
to extract and transport the oil is now more than the market price.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, oil prices have foiled, so far, the sale of
Rosneft, the last large state-owned oil company, undermining the
government's effort to raise needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have shot up recently on the hope for significant
cuts in production. But the two leading commodity indexes, the
Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities and the
Goldman Sachs index of 22 commodities, are only slightly above
their recent lows.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan, the key to the revival of the rest of Asia, has yet
to prove it can get its economy or its currency back on track. So a
commodity upturn is still more of a hope than a reality for the
countries that sell them. ``The problem we face,'' said David
Bassanese, senior economist at Bankers Trust in Sydney, Australia,
``is that the export recovery still hasn't arrived.''

ANDY BEY: TALENT FOR A GROWING AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Bey isn't your typically ingratiating jazz
singer-pianist; in performance, his extraordinary talent can seem
protected in a glass museum case, resting on a pillow. And his
sense of pacing asks that you travel at least halfway toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in a trio (Peter Washington on bass and Vito Lesczak
on drums) at Iridium on Tuesday night, he warmed up with a long
instrumental version of ``Just Friends,'' playing a wealth of dryly
articulated scales over the chords, making the music constantly
change colors while his rhythm section chugged along at midtempo.
It wasn't the kind of opening shot that ropes in the attention of a
late-night audience.
</P>
<P>
   But when he started singing the next song, Jerome Kern's
``Yesterday,'' his bass-baritone voice made his piano playing seem
cold excercises by comparison. On the song's short phrases _ ``Sad
am I/Glad am I'' _ he shot up into a falsetto, wringing the
microtones of the blues from them, and he expelled each line with
the power of a snare-drum being socked. He is more forcefully
rhythmic than most jazz singers and, indeed, many jazz musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bey, who is in his mid-50s and has long been a special taste for
aficionados, is slowly entering that inevitable process for
promising jazz players in the 1990s: reaching new audiences. His
repertory based in standards is changing; on Tuesday he introduced
two songs from a forthcoming album that departs from jazz entirely.
</P>
<P>
   One was Nick Drake's ``River Man,'' a magisterially sad and
mysterious song that he performed away from the piano, sitting on a
stool, with Paul Meyers accompanying him on acoustic guitar. The
other was a lullaby in Spanish, ``Drume Negrita,'' a brighter and
harmonically simpler song that let Bey explore the muddy bottoms
and exotic highs of voice. At times the song approached the sort of
music Milton Nascimento made in the early '70s, kaleidoscopic in
mood and breaking free of all genres.

JUMP RHYTHM JAZZ PROJECT: MISMATCHED SONG AND DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Billy Siegenfeld is an Al Pacino look-alike with a
rough purr of a singing voice. He and his collaborator, Jeannie
Hill, move with a speed and expansiveness that suggest that their
feet disdain mere human dance steps. But with one exception, the
program of five pieces that Siegenfeld, Ms. Hill and their Jump
Rhythm Jazz Project presented on Tuesday night at Kaye Playhouse
was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the fault of the company's engaging, immensely
skilled dancers, and, with the exception of a few too-cerebral
riffs, the frequent use of music performed live by the Jump Rhythm
Jazz Trio was a plus. The problem was that Siegenfeld and Ms. Hill
are not the bright, sophisticated song-and-dance duo they attempt
to be. Neither performer is a strong enough singer for the extended
revue suites they presented, and Siegenfeld's New York grittiness
does not mix well with the sweet wholesomeness that Ms. Hill
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the evening was ``Released in Their Own Custody
(Trading Romance for a Good Piece of Fruit),'' choreographed by
Siegenfeld, a professor of dance and music theater at Northwestern
University and a guest teacher at the Broadway Dance Center in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The new dance, which never quite delivers on the subtitle, is a
celebration of the music of Christian McBride, the jazz bassist,
heard here on tape in pop standards and a composition of his own.
Most of all, it suggests that Siegenfeld is on to something with
the Jump Rhythm style, a matter of taut, precise, fast and
far-moving jazz dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the three sections, ``Too Close For Comfort,'' is a
particular pleasure. The dancers (Annie Arnoult, Becky Cooper, Kari
Knudson, Kelly Malone, Matthew Metro and Birgitta Victorson) are
like hard little projectiles hurtling through space.
</P>
<P>
   But each step and gesture is clear, and soon the hurtling
becomes a kind of ground-skimming flight that captures the
exuberant physicality of good dancers when moments of extreme
control and abandon are seamlessly combined.
</P>
<P>
   The fine cast was completed by Justin Jones and Anna Marie
Paulilio.

 &HT;    WIDENING PROBE OF SATELLITE SALES WORRIES INDUSTRY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The congressional investigations into whether
sensitive satellite technology was given to China are expanding to
examine the track record of other satellite manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   And the nation's satellite makers are less than pleased at the
prospect of being brought into an inquiry involving two of their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   With nine congressional committees looking into various aspects
of the nation's export policy, there is a growing concern among
U.S. satellite manufacturers that they are being unfairly dragged
into a election-year partisan showdown on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of concern among the companies that Congress is
rushing headlong into this,'' said Clayton Mowry, director of the
Virginia-based Satellite Industry Association, which represents 16
American satellite companies. ``By being overly aggressive, we are
concerned that they will start to legislate before the facts are
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mowry said the congressional focus should remain on whether
Loral Space and Communications and Hughes Electronics helped the
Chinese figure out why a satellite launch failed in February 1996
in southern China, and if that action posed a national security
threat.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators, defense experts and members of Congress are
seeking to pry information from other satellite manufacturers such
as Lockheed Martin and Motorola, as well as companies that produce
satellite components, to see if technology intended for commercial
use was used for military purposes by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The layer of the onion is just now being pulled away,'' said
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who chairs the House Science
Committee's space and aeronautics subcommittee, which is looking
into the issue. ``In pulling away that layer, we will find other
companies that may be involved at putting American military
personnel at great risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for the satellite industry. An economic
analysis by the Maryland-based Futron Corp. estimates that revenues
from the U.S. commercial satellite market, now valued $5.7 billion,
could climb to six times that amount by 2003. Total sales have
skyrocketed from $3.2 billion in 1991 to a projected $60 billion by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace analysts say that if Congress goes too far in
restricting the satellite launches, it could undermine an industry
on the cusp of a boom. Chiefly, the companies say they are worried
about a push to reverse the 1996 decision by the Clinton
administration to shift the authority to approve foreign launches
of U.S. satellites from the the State Department to the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The business community strongly backed that move, with some
comparing the State Department application process to a ``roach
motel,'' the type of place where you check in, but never check out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real sexy issue for Congress,'' said Marco Caceres,
senior space analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting
firm in Fairfax, Va. ``Whenever you put the question of national
security out there, congressmen and senators love to get on the
bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   But full-scale examination of the practices of the entire
industry risks losing control of the satellite market to the
European satellite makers, Caceres said. American companies have
built 72 percent of the 185 commercial satellites launched over the
last decade. ``The Europeans are probably sitting back grinning,
saying 'here comes Congress,' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is equally concerned about the outcome of the
congressional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential international market for commercial satellites
is enormous, and we don't want to give it away to the Europeans,''
said James Fetig, director of national media relations.
</P>
<P>
   Some may believe that restricting U.S. satellites from being
launched in China will lead to more being launched in the United
States, he said. ``Instead, in the global marketplace, it is
possible that the U.S. will actually lose that satellite business
because our international customers can buy satellites in Europe
that can be launched on foreign launchers, so as a result we may
lose both satellite and launch business.''
</P>
<P>
   But to some, congressional scrutiny has been long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Sokolski, the top Pentagon expert monitoring nuclear
proliferation during the Bush administration, has told several
congressional panels that he believes that American technology has
helped the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep playing footsie with these guys on these
(satellite) transfers, we're going to get burned,'' said Sokolski,
who now runs the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in
Virginia. Congress should address how the American satellite
manufacturers became so dependent on the Chinese launchers in the
first place, he said, and it should delve back to the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting that view is Jeffrey Record, a visiting professor at
the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech. The
difference between technology that can be used solely for military
purposes and technology that can be used for commercial purposes is
narrowing. For example cell phones, computers and satellites can
all be used for military purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to prevent China from getting the
information they want,'' Record said. ``There is a crowd out there
that wants to make China public enemy number one to take the place
of the Soviet Union. But one has to watch that because of the
enormous amount of potential in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., has been one of the most vocal on the
congressional investigation. He is concerned that there is an
attempt by the Democrats to broaden the investigation to ``muddy
the waters and distract attention from the core issues of the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remain focused: Did Loral and Hughes violate U.S. law
by transferring sensitive missile technology to China? Did the
White House grant waivers for exportation of sensitive military
technology?'' Barr said.

DANCES FOR WAVE HILL: A DUET UP CLOSE, WITH ECHOES ACROSS THE
LAWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dances for Wave Hill began its eighth year on
Wednesday afternoon with a new resident mentor, the performance
artist Ann Carlson. But the point of the three-week summer series
seems not to have changed. Dances by two choreographers spilled out
over Wave Hill, the sprawling environmental center in the Bronx,
with two of the three pieces clear responses to the demands of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Creach's ``Par Terre,'' danced to delicately atmospheric
string music composed by Andy Teirstein and performed live,
occurred on a long sweep of lawn. Creach played imaginatively with
space and shapes in the piece, an extended duet that suddenly
emerged from under a faraway tree and traveled closer to the
audience. Four dancers served as counterpoint, tiny figures
cavorting around the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Creach seemed intent on exploring how a pair and a larger group
of dancers can split, merge and echo each other at varying
distances. The distant performers might have been children in a
leafy playground. Ornamental poses and edgy, complex action and
response blended with play for the compelling lead dancers, Paul
Matteson and Richard Patten.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 10 musicians, solemn teen-age violinists dressed in
black, framed the duo and spread out like splashes of black paint
on the green vista. ``Par Terre'' had its aimless moments, but
Creach provided material for the contemplation of performing in
general and dance outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Aimlessness was a greater problem in two pieces by Fausto Matias
that completed the evening's program. ``(En)Counter Gravity'' was
the more substantial of the two, with a few witty points to make
about gravity. Four dancers ran, rolled down and scrambled back up
a steep hill and tackled one another in sometimes
audience-scattering scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   But the points were made early on and left largely undeveloped
in the piece, a structured improvisation full of once-fashionable
ingredients that was performed to sometimes arch comments about
gravity and an electronic score manipulated by the disc jockey
Steven Nardi.
</P>
<P>
   Matias took a coy look at Portuguese-style bullfighting in
``Tourada.'' Esteban Cardenas and Michael Dalby stood out as the
sweetly dopey bull and an impassive waiter in a cast completed by
David Figueroa and Yoko Yamanaka. The program will be repeated at 5
p.m. Sunday at West 249th Street and Independence Avenue in
Riverdale, the Bronx. Ms. Carlson takes over at 6:30 on Wednesday
and at 5 p.m. on July 19.

EX-ARMY GENERAL SENTENCED IN BRIBERY CASE

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Mexican army general convicted of trying to
bribe a top Baja California drug enforcement agent last year has
been sentenced to 20 years in prison, the attorney general's office
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Navarro Lara was convicted of inviting Jose Luis Chavez
Garcia, then a delegate to the attorney general's office, to a posh
hotel and offering him $1 million per month to protect the
smuggling operation of the Arrellano Felix cartel, the agency said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said that Navarro told Chavez that he and his
entire family would be killed if he refused the bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro was arrested in March 1997, about a month after the
arrest of Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo on charges that he took
millions of dollars to protect the cartel from rivals in the
northern Mexican state of Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez was the country's drug czar at the time, and his
arrest rocked Mexico and nearly derailed the U.S. certification of
Mexican drug-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez was sentenced to 13 years in prison on weapons
charges. His trial on drug and abuse-of-authority charges
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro and Gutierrez are being held at a top-security prison
outside Toluca. Navarro has been cleared of conspiracy charges, but
the attorney general's office plans to appeal that acquittal.

BRITAIN SAYS IT MAY BUY FOUR BOEING C-17 CARGO PLANES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of a major shift in its defense strategy,
Britain has announced it will spend an estimated $900 million for
four Boeing C-17s in what would be the first international order
for the new Air Force cargo jet.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, which still must clear hurdles in the British
government, could open the door to more C-17 sales to Britain and
to other NATO allies in Europe, aerospace industry analysts said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop Grumman's plant in Grand Prairie, Texas, is a major
subcontractor to Boeing for the C-17. About 1,500 employees at the
plant in far west Dallas make the tail wings and engine housings
for the giant cargo jet.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is expected to buy 120 C-17s, called the
Globemaster. Boeing, the prime contractor, assembles the plane at
its plant in Long Beach, Calif. More than 40 planes have been
delivered to date.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Secretary George Robertson on Wednesday laid out
a plan for Parliament that explained how Britain would reshape its
military forces to be better able to conduct quick-strike
operations. When he made the plan public, he announced Britain's
desire to buy the Globemaster.
</P>
<P>
   The C-17 was developed for the Air Force to fly troops and
oversized equipment long distances. It also can land on and take
off from short runways, allowing the plane to fly to places that
previously could be reached only by smaller aircraft or by land.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has flown the C-17 into several hot spots,
including Bosnia and the Persian Gulf during the recent Iraqi
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-Cold War world we must be prepared to go to the
crisis rather than have the crisis come to us,'' Robertson said.
``We will declare as potentially available to the United Nations a
much larger proportion of our readily available forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Engle, a spokeswoman for Northrop Grumman, said the
British plans were ``good news'' for the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very hopeful that this will mean the sale of some
additional C-17s above the 120 the Air Force plans to buy,'' she
said. ``This is some great news for a great airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   British officials have not said when they will complete plans
for the C-17 purchase, but industry insiders say a contract could
be signed before the end of the year. Robertson said an
``equivalent'' to the C-17 could still be considered, but analysts
say no such aircraft exists and that an equivalent plane would be
too costly to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you figure in the tremendous research and development
cost to produce something new and the time needed, it is worth
their while to go with the C-17,'' said William Dane, an aerospace
industry analyst with Forecast International, a Newtown, Conn.,
company that analyzes the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Rick Fuller said the company could deliver the
first of the four aircraft two years after the British place an
order.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is confident that an order will be placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to the Brits for several years, providing
them with information,'' Fuller said. ``They have seen the airplane
perform at air shows and have had the opportunity to observe it in
Bosnia and in other operations where they have been involved with
the Air Force. They are well aware of its capabilities. The C-17
fulfills their requirements for the rapid reaction force.''
</P>
<P>
   Dane, who estimates the cost of a single C-17 at $225 million,
predicts that the Royal Air Force ultimately will buy 10 to 12
C-17s and that other European countries could buy at least that
many.
</P>
<P>
   ``This order is a foot in the door,'' Dane said. ``The logical
thing is for the other NATO allies in Europe to go in and buy a
dozen C-17s and have them at their disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan all have
expressed varying degrees of interest in the C-17.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's plan spelled out an effort to make British military
forces more capable of responding with the United States to any
crisis worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was the only member of the NATO alliance that committed
troops, ships and planes alongside U.S. forces in the crisis with
Iraq. British officials also said they were prepared to join U.S.
forces in air operations in the crisis with Yugoslavia over Kosovo,
had it been warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo compartment of the C-17 can accommodate Army wheeled
vehicles in two side-by-side rows. Three Bradley infantry fighting
vehicles comprise one deployment load. Similarly, the Army's newest
main battle tank, the M-1, can be carried along with other
vehicles.

ANGLICAN BISHOPS HOPE FOR UNITY DESPITE DIFFERENCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey won't like it much. But
gay and lesbian issues likely will command great attention at the
upcoming worldwide Lambeth Conference in Canterbury, England.
</P>
<P>
   Carey is the symbolic leader of the 70-million-member Anglican
Communion, which encompasses 32 self-governing provinces, including
the Episcopal Church in the United States. And Carey has said he
hopes the global gathering he will host July 18-Aug. 9 will focus
on prayer, spirituality and unity amid diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity certainly will be at Lambeth, a conference held
once every 10 years and named for Lambeth Palace in London, the
archbishop's official residence. But achieving unity among the 800
bishops attending will take some doing.
</P>
<P>
   Anglicans, like members of some other church families, are
radically divided over the practice of ordaining gays and lesbians
and conducting church ceremonies to bless the unions of same-sex
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Many American bishops have been ordaining gay and lesbian
priests and conducting same-sex-union ceremonies for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Other Episcopal bishops _ including Bishop Jack Iker of Fort
Worth, Bishop James Stanton of Dallas and several bishops from
Africa, Asia and South America _ see that as deplorable. Such
practices, they contend, violate biblical and church laws.
</P>
<P>
   Those bishops opposing gay ordinations and same-sex blessings
will be lobbying for the Lambeth Conference to support a ``Kuala
Lumpur Statement'' issued by some 80 bishops from the Southern
Hemisphere at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The statement called on Anglicans to adopt a clear statement
declaring unacceptable ``the endorsement of the ordination of
non-celibate homosexuals and the blessing of same-sex unions.''
Stanton and Iker helped lead a conference of more than 40 bishops
from around the world in Dallas last September that supported a
similar statement.
</P>
<P>
   No clear pronouncement on homosexuality and the church is likely
to come out of Lambeth this year. But the subject will be
discussed. And some bishops are leaning toward appointing a
commission to study the volatile issues surrounding gays and
lesbians in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very characteristic of Anglicans to avoid an issue by
studying it to death,'' said the Rev. Sam Edwards, executive
director of a Fort Worth-based conservative group, the Episcopal
Synod of America. Edwards will be in England during Lambeth and
will have regular sessions in Canterbury with other traditionalists
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Anglicans do have a history of moderating conflicts through
study. It happened to some degree at the Lambeth 10 years ago, when
the dispute over ordaining women _ particularly female bishops _
was raging throughout the church.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Fort Worth Bishop Clarence Pope, now retired, took a lead
role internationally in the dispute and was the founding president
of the conservative Episcopal Synod of America. He argues that
ordaining women violates biblical and church teachings.
</P>
<P>
   During the Lambeth 10 years ago, the bishops appointed the Eames
Commission, named for its chairman, Bishop Robin Eames of Ireland,
which studied ways in which bishops with differing points of view
on women's ordination could continue to work together.
</P>
<P>
   The study helped quiet the controversy but didn't solve it. Many
opposed to ordaining female priests and bishops now have left the
church.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of female bishops has faded to the back burner,
despite the fact that some bishops _ including Fort Worth's Iker _
still object to female priests and bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Some bishops, including Bishop Noel Jones of the Church of
England, have announced they will boycott some parts of the Lambeth
Conference because for the first time, 11 female bishops _ eight
from the United States _ will attend. Some female bishops will lead
Bible studies and other gatherings. Also, Jones says he won't stand
for the Lambeth's official photograph if female bishops are posing
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Iker, the staunchly conservative Fort Worth bishop, isn't going
that far. He won't boycott any events at Lambeth _ except if he is
asked to take Communion from a woman bishop. He also won't shy away
from having his photo taken with bishops of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have my picture taken with anybody,'' he said.

WORLD CUP FINAL MAY AFFECT VOTER TURNOUT IN ECUADOR 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ When asked who will win Sunday, the day of this
nation's presidential runoff election, many Ecuadoreans say it's no
contest: Brazil in a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with the planet's most popular sport, it
should be explained that Sunday is also the day of the most
important game in soccer: the World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   So many Ecuadoreans will be glued to their televisions for the
live broadcast of the match between Brazil and France that it could
affect voter turnout. According to a recent survey by the Quito
polling firm CEDATOS, 58 percent knew the date of the game being
played in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. But just 32 percent knew
the date of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest soccer fans are going to stay home,'' said Cesar
Parraga, a waiter at a bar in downtown Quito.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking her head in wonder, bookseller Leonor Monge said
Ecuador's election officials ``made a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have moved the election forward a week,'' Monge
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though their national team didn't qualify for the World
Cup, Ecuadoreans have followed every kick of the monthlong
tournament. For dyed-in-the-wool aficionados, the face-off between
presidential candidates Jamil Mahuad and Alvaro Noboa lacks the
drama of epic showdowns like Argentina vs. England or Italy vs.
France.
</P>
<P>
   Quito stores have reported a run on TV sets. Newspapers that
normally have no foreign correspondents have dispatched staffers to
France. Readers are so hungry for gossip about top players that
Vistazo, Ecuador's largest news magazine, published a cover story
about the girlfriend of Ronaldo, Brazil's superstar striker.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are much more concerned about who wins the World Cup
than who wins the presidency,'' said Nancy Cordova, director of
projects for CEDATOS.
</P>
<P>
   Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. Those who don't possess the
small card handed out on election day signifying that they voted
can be fined when they try to cash government checks or use other
state services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 35 percent of Ecuadoreans stayed home during the
May 31 first-round presidential vote. One possible explanation:
There were two World Cup qualifying matches played that day.
</P>
<P>
   Such apathy is partly due to a democratic overdose. The World
Cup comes along just once every four years. But due to a wave of
political instability and the ouster of Ecuador's president, the
country has had five nationwide elections in the past 26 months.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will do it all over again Sunday _ if they're not
watching the game. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   What was Stefanie Powers, the vivacious redhead who starred in
``Hart to Hart'' and ``The Girl from UNCLE,'' doing as host of a
seven-part public-television series on personal finance sponsored
by Merrill Lynch?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the public knows Ms. Powers as either the
strong-willed beauty in the 1979-85 TV show about a wealthy
husband-and-wife amateur detective team, or as the mini-skirted
secret agent April Dancer in the 1960s spy spoof. Whether traipsing
through mansions and five-star hotels in ``Hart to Hart'' or flying
off to a Greek island with a dachshund whose fleas carried an
antidote to an insidious poison in ``The Girl from UNCLE,'' she
oozed glamour and independence, not investment expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Ms. Powers, now 55, on PBS last March, advising
people how to plan their financial futures. And as a director on
the boards of two multibillion-dollar mutual funds, she had some
credentials that helped justify her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If her evolution from globe-trotting adventuress to financial
sophisticate seems a bit odd, consider this: In both roles, she
hangs out with reassuring mentors, picks their brains, listens
attentively to their answers and can draw smart conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, she always managed to get herself out of tight
spots by the end of the episode. In real life, Ms. Powers hasn't
found it so easy to organize her own finances. But over the years,
she has learned that asking many questions, even seemingly dumb
ones, can pay off if she puts them to the right people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jon Lovelace, vice chairman of Capital Research and
Management, the investment manager of the American Funds family of
mutual funds, credits her lack of fear in asking the most obvious
questions with his decision to start two of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Powers was introduced to Lovelace in 1984, through a friend
who worked in Capital Research's Hong Kong office. As she and
Lovelace became friends, she queried him on ways to invest the
assets of the William Holden Wildlife Foundation, established in
memory of the film star who had been her companion; she is the
foundation's chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   She was interested in investing some of the money in stocks, but
didn't want to expose herself to too much risk, recalls Lovelace,
now 71. ``Like many people, she had the following objectives: she
wanted a good level of income, but also growth of income to protect
against inflation, but she wanted to minimize the risk if stock
prices went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovelace has built American Funds into the nation's
third-largest mutual funds family, after Fidelity and Vanguard,
with $250 billion of assets under management. Yet for all his
expertise, he was not put off by Ms. Powers' seemingly simplistic
approach. On the contrary, his instincts told him that many other
investors might be thinking along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember distinctly that I was at a meeting at Stanford
University _ it was about 1986 _ where I was on the advisory board
of the business school,'' he said. ``I was thinking about
Stefanie's objectives for the foundation, and for herself, and the
idea came for a fund that would deliver above-average and growing
income with reduced risk in declining market periods and reasonable
participation in rising markets.''
</P>
<P>
   With those goals in mind, he began the Capital Income Builder
fund in 1987. Six years later, the company started the Capital
World Growth and Income fund. Each has nearly $8 billion in assets.
Though both have trailed Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, they
have outperformed the median returns for funds of their type in the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, concluding that she made a good representative for
ordinary investors, Lovelace asked her to join the board of both
funds. ``A lot of meetings drift into jargon, and Stefanie is a
very good question-asker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Powers said, the prospect of taking on such
responsibilities weighed heavily on her. But she soon overcame her
nervousness and accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to qualify my questions by saying: `Here is this dumb
question,''' Ms. Powers recalled in an interview at her ranch-style
home in Benedict Canyon, a celebrity-filled area of Beverly Hills,
Calif. Dressed casually in green tights and a green sweater, with
her trademark red hair carefully tousled, she added: ``I did not do
it so much to make them feel better but because I was insecure
about myself. Today I am less insecure. I am more able to say,
`Excuse me. I don't understand that, and if I don't, how can the
average investor?'''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of common-sense attitude is likely to resonate with
many people in today's dizzying investment environment of more than
5,000 mutual funds and rampant fears that the seven-year-old bull
market will soon stumble.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, Ms. Powers' ingrained caution should protect her
against disaster. She didn't even tiptoe into the stock market
until the late 1980s, when she put some money for herself, as well
as the foundation, in Capital's mutual funds. Since then, she has
diversified by turning over the management of a large chunk of her
assets to Barbara Tarmy at Warburg Pincus Asset Management, where
the minimum portfolios are about $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she maintains extensive real estate holdings,
including homes in London and Kenya and a part-interest in a horse
farm on Long Island that is about to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Powers didn't specify her net worth, but indicated that it
was in the area of $10 million. She says she earned less than $1
million on a deal she negotiated for a share of the profits of the
later episodes of her best-known project, ``Hart to Hart.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Powers bought her Benedict Canyon home on a half-acre acre
lot in 1970 for $125,000; she estimates that it is now worth about
$1 million. She says the mews house she owns in the upscale Anslow
Gardens section of London is probably worth less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a part-owner of a horse farm in Bridgehampton, N.Y.
_ a result of a longtime passion for horses. That passion later
bloomed into a love affair with polo, a sport she took up as part
of a fund-raising effort for the wildlife foundation.
</P>
<P>
   She and her partners are in the process of selling the farm, but
she continues to maintain four polo ponies in Kenya and five in
England.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Powers won't say how much she has spent on the ponies, but
they don't come cheap. Judith Balaban Quine, co-author with Ms.
Powers of a 1985 exercise-and-health book, said her friend had been
``extremely methodical'' in keeping down the costs of what can be
an exorbitantly expensive hobby. Even so, Ms. Powers described her
love of polo as ``my one folly.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, her financial endeavors have been defined by caution
_ a caution with deep roots, including a rocky first marriage at
age 21 to actor Gary Lockwood. While she was making her name
playing a secret agent, Lockwood, she said, played the
head-of-the-household role that was expected of men in those days.
``He dominated everything and made all the financial decisions,''
she said, and the couple ended up with ``huge debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Their most disastrous move was to buy coastal land that was
subsequently put under a state moratorium for development. They
were forced to sell it at a loss to a state zoning commission, Ms.
Powers said. ``The commission ultimately paved it over with asphalt
and made it into a parking lot,'' she said. ``So much for
ecology.''
</P>
<P>
   They had also bought houses in Malibu, which they planned to
remodel and sell. That investment, too, suffered as a result of the
development moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were divorced, I owed a lot of money,'' Ms. Powers
said. ``I was 28, and I had nowhere to live. Luckily I was young
enough to bounce back. Not everybody does.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal left her determined to achieve financial
independence. As soon as she got her first post-divorce job in
1970, she bought the Benedict Canyon house that she still occupies
and that she has filled with African artifacts and mementos of her
trips around the world with Holden. (Ms. Powers is now married to a
French businessman, Patrick de la Chesnais, who spends the bulk of
his time in France but meets her periodically at one or another of
their homes.)
</P>
<P>
   She remembers to the smallest detail the financial circumstances
of that first big purchase. The house, she said, was rented to
David Steinberg, the comedian-director, and his wife. ``But I put
$25,000 down and took a mortgage for $100,000 in 1979 at 9.5
percent. They were paying $1,500 a month, so the rent covered the
mortgage. I bought it because I had signed contracts to do two
plays, so I knew I had some money coming. So I took the money from
the first job to live on and the second job for the down payment.''
</P>
<P>
   At about that time, her relationship with Holden began. Holden,
who played romantic, manly figures on the screen, won an Oscar in
1953 for his role in ``Stalag 17,'' but was perhaps best known as
Gloria Swanson's ill-fated lover in the 1950 film ``Sunset
Boulevard.'' While Ms. Powers was his frequent companion, she was
always careful to keep her finances separate from his. She also
pursued a doggedly conservative investment course, avoiding stocks
and buying mostly real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a town house on Lantau Island in Hong Kong,'' she said.
``But we did not buy stuff together. He had had an apartment in
Hong Kong and sold it. I had his enthusiasm, but they were my
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   It was shortly after his death in 1981 at the age of 63 that Ms.
Powers met Lovelace, whom she credits with ``bullying'' her into
learning about investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon would say, `You can grasp it,''' Ms. Powers recalled.
``And I would say that I wasn't educated in that way. And he would
say, `You have educated yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   While she began putting some of the William Holden Wildlife
Foundation's funds _ which now total $3.7 million _ as well as some
of her own money into mutual funds in the late 1980s, she waited
until 1990 to open her account with Ms. Tarmy of Warburg. And Ms.
Powers lost no time displaying the same inquisitiveness that had
caught Lovelace's attention. ``Any woman out working for herself
and supporting herself is prone to ask a lot of questions,'' Ms.
Tarmy said. ``But Stefanie respects people's specialties and
listens to the answers.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Tarmy said, Ms. Powers recently proposed buying
stock in Zonagen, a small Texas company that makes a drug to treat
male impotence. Ms. Tarmy pointed out that Ms. Powers already owned
shares of Pfizer, which makes Viagra, the wildly popular
anti-impotence medication, and didn't need to increase her exposure
in that field. ``We did buy some Zonagen, but very little,'' Ms.
Tarmy said. The investment didn't pan out and Ms. Powers quickly
sold it, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Ms. Powers, who speaks seven languages and travels
widely, wanted to put some money in a private placement she had
heard about from a friend; the move would have given her an
interest in a deep-water port in Wuhan, a city in central China.
Ms. Tarmy said no to the idea because such deals can sometimes tie
up an investor's money for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always encouraged Stefanie to be very liquid,'' Ms.
Tarmy said. ``I have seen too many people get involved in deals
where they can't get their money out. In the entertainment
business, which is so unpredictable, being liquid gives you freedom
to make choices. Otherwise she might have to do jobs that are not
good for her reputation or image.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sometimes, Ms. Powers hits a home run. Last September, she
proposed buying stock in Dell Computer, Ms. Tarmy recalled, ``and I
agreed it was well positioned in its marketplace.'' Was it ever:
Since then, Dell's stock has more than doubled, to $100.8125 a
share on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the company of financial professionals like Lovelace and
Ms. Tarmy has undoubtedly bolstered her self-confidence, Ms. Powers
says she has also come to value her own opinions more than she used
to _ in part because she has seen that experts in many arenas don't
necessarily have all the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly was not educated in anything financial,'' said Ms.
Powers, who began studying acting at the age of 15. ``But I learned
that everything develops a mystique'' at big institutions.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``The attitude is, `Oh no, you can't do that. Let us
do it. We are experts. You must not do your own taxes because they
are so complicated.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my life, I have entered into the sanctum sanctorums of so
many different places, but they really didn't know that much,'' Ms.
Powers continued. ``I don't want to blow too many people out of the
water, but some years ago, I did a book for Simon &AMP; Schuster,''
referring to ``Stefanie Powers: Superlife,'' the book she wrote
with Ms. Quine. ``I thought: `Oh, gosh, I am at this great big
publishing house. They know exactly what to do.' I can tell you
they had not a clue about how to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ms. Powers has kept her foot in the acting
door. In 1996, for example, she starred in a revival of the 1970
musical ``Applause, Applause'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse in
Millburn, N.J. And she is now considering starting a line of
fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   But more important to her than any future acting role or other
venture is the realization that she needn't take up anything for
money anymore because she has achieved financial independence. ``I
never wanted to be vulnerable to being the victim of other people's
financial decisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as wealthy,'' she added. ``I am comfortable
as long as my needs are satisfied.''

 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, blue-chip growth stocks have led the market ever
higher, often leaving smaller and cheaper stocks far behind. Does
that worry Larry Puglia, lead manager of the T. Rowe Price Blue
Chip Growth fund?
</P>
<P>
   Not much. ``There's always the risk that all stocks are pretty
fully valued, and we could see a pause or even a correction in the
market,'' Puglia said. ``But we take encouragement from the fact
that we think you can find reasonably valued companies in the
market today.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund does own some stocks with high valuations, including
Microsoft, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of 64.4. But, Puglia
said, ``We think that they're reasonably priced, relative to the
growth that we think they'll be generating.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the $3.1 billion portfolio, which usually has about 150
positions, maintains an average P/E ratio roughly equivalent to the
24.2 forward P/E of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our view is that we've got a portfolio of companies that we
hope will perform better than the market, but we're buying it at
roughly the same price as the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Puglia helped start the fund in 1993, it has had an
average annual return of 25.1 percent, through July 3, according to
Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. That is
better than the 23.3 percent annualized return of the S&AMP;P 500 and
the 19.7 percent of the average large-capitalization blend fund,
which buys big-company stocks but is neither growth- nor
value-oriented in its investing style.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the fund's returns have lagged modestly behind
the S&AMP;P but they are still ahead of those of its peers. This year,
Blue Chip Growth has returned 18.6 percent, through July 3, versus
19 percent for the index and 16.1 percent for the peer group.
</P>
<P>
   Puglia, 37, has been with T. Rowe Price since 1990, but his
penchant for blue chips started at a much earlier age. During his
youth in Waynesburg, Pa., he learned his first investing lessons
from his father, who owned a Buick dealership. ``He would buy good
companies and literally hold them for 15 or 20 years,'' Puglia
said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes true blue chips? He defines them as stocks that
provide ``durable, sustainable earnings-per-share growth.'' A
company that meets the standard, he said, is likely to have a
leading position in its market and seasoned, first-rate management,
and is more likely to stand up well in times of market stress.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying potential winners takes some doing. At T. Rowe
Price, the fund uses proprietary software to screen data bases for
about 15 technical characteristics, like steady earnings growth and
return on equity over one, three and five years.
</P>
<P>
   But quantitative screens are not the only source of Puglia's
ideas. ``We'll look under every stone,'' he said. He scrounges
through news reports and economic data, and meets with companies'
suppliers and competitors. Sometimes he even culls through rivals'
portfolios. ``There are plenty of other managers out there with
excellent track records,'' he said, ``and we're willing to learn
from others where possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Puglia said he calculates what he calls a company's
``self-sustaining growth rate'' with a formula: return on equity,
multiplied by one minus the payout ratio, which is the percentage
of earnings paid out in dividends. If a company has a 25 percent
return on equity and is paying out 20 percent of earnings in
dividends, for example, it has a self-sustaining growth rate of 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If that rate is sustainable over three to five years, it makes
for an attractive stock, Puglia said. ``And if we have good
management that we can trust, shareholder-oriented management that
is essentially a good steward of that capital, we can count on them
to either invest that capital in their highest-returning businesses
or make value-added acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some market skepticism, Puglia's fund is bullish on the
companies involved in recent mega-mergers, like Travelers Group,
which is merging with Citicorp. Travelers, in fact, is the top
stock in the portfolio, at 1.5 percent of its holdings. ``It is a
company with, above all, very strong management that has shown over
a period of time that they can compound earnings at above industry
average rate,'' Puglia said. ``They've generated compound annual
growth of over 20 percent for the past five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Citicorp and Travelers will be ``arguably the premier
financial services company in the world,'' he said, with access to
100 million customers in 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Travelers subsidiaries are already selling Citicorp
credit cards,'' he said. ``And that's just an example of how
they're going to aggressively cross-sell one another's products to
this big customer base that they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Chip Growth bought Travelers for about $12 a share at the
fund's start in 1993, and the stock is now at $69. He predicted
that the combined entity, to be called Citigroup, will hit $90
within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Another major position is Bristol-Myers Squibb. None of the
company's key drug patents will expire over the next few years, he
said, and the company has sold off noncore businesses facing
litigation and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers' most promising products include Pravachol, a
widely used cholesterol-lowering agent, and Avapro, a new product
for treating high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The company has ``a very powerful position in the cardiovascular
area, which of course is a very good area because you tend to have
very high margins on the products,'' Puglia said. ``Bristol-Myers
also has the No. 1 or No. 2 anti-cancer franchise in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's main anti-cancer drug is Taxol, derived from the
Pacific yew tree. ``Taxol continues to receive new indications for
treating various forms of cancer,'' Puglia said.
</P>
<P>
   He first bought Bristol-Myers in July 1997 at about $85 a share,
then bought a lot more in August at between $73 and $77. The stock,
now at $119.5625, is valued at 28 times projected 1999 earnings of
$4.20 a share, Puglia said. ``While the stock's not cheap, it's
still valued very attractively relative to the other drug group
names.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects Bristol-Myers to hit at least $145 within 18
months. ``If they sell some operations and do some different
things,'' he said, ``we think it could actually be a lot bigger
upside than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation helps make USA Waste Services another of Puglia's
favorites. The company is buying Waste Management Inc., the No. 1
garbage-disposal company in the country. After the merger, USA
Waste will have more than 20 percent of the waste market
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And before long, Puglia predicted, the market will take notice.
``People will realize trash disposal is a good business,'' he said.
``It's not affected by what happens in Asia, it's not particularly
discretionary _ people have to have their garbage picked up _ and
this company has got a proprietary position in terms of landfills
and customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger will bring economies of scale and allow the company
to consolidate landfills and shut down unprofitable ones, Puglia
said. ``The management of USA Waste has shown an excellent ability
to control costs and to generate consistent earnings growth and
consistent cash flow growth,'' he said. Moreover, earnings will
probably grow at 18 to 20 percent over the next three years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Puglia bought the stock at less than $35 a share in May 1997.
The stock is now at $52.1875, and he thinks it could hit $65 within
18 months.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging from all the newly issued stocks of computer, software
and Internet-related companies, the current market for initial
public offerings looks hotter than a summer beach party.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, however, that the overall initial-offering
market may be cooling down. To take its pulse, investors might look
at the experiences of two brand-name heavyweights _ Aurora Foods
and Seagram Co. Aurora plunged into the IPO market last month and
has seen its stock almost stand still, while Seagram evidently
decided to pull back.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora's credentials certainly looked strong. The company was
formed less than two years ago, aiming to build itself into a
grocery company with top-brand products; it has already reduced
costs at its acquired businesses by about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora has also restored some sizzle to well-known brands.
Consider Celeste frozen pizzas and Aunt Jemima's frozen breakfasts:
In the year before Aurora acquired them, Celeste's sales dropped
16.8 percent and Aunt Jemima's dropped 8.9 percent. Since then,
Celeste's annual sales have grown 8.6 percent and Aunt Jemima's by
10.5 percent, according to the prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   And more good news may be coming. Even though the food industry
is mature and most products now register only single-digit annual
sales growth, Aurora has been extremely selective about what it has
bought, said Linda Killian, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, an
IPO research firm in Greenwich, Conn. As a result, Ms. Killian said
she thought sales for the company's products were far from peaking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors so far seem to have shoved Aurora's stock into
the icebox. Since the company went public at $21 a share, its
shares have remained in the $21-$22.50 range and closed on Friday
at $22.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in initial offerings said two things might be
suppressing the stock. First, like those of other recent
food-company offerings, shares of Aurora have been sideswiped by
industry speculation that Seagram has grown discouraged with the
IPO market for packaged-food companies, and, as a result, is
seeking private buyers for its Tropicana juice business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, concern has grown that Aurora's offering may have
been a bit too richly priced, given the company's heavy debt load,
a result of six acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Basham, editor of Emerging and Special Situations, a
newsletter published by Standard &AMP; Poor's, said Aurora was typical
of food companies that had sold shares to the public. The stocks
have suffered, he said, on concerns about debt.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing debt was the main reason for Aurora's public offering
in the first place. Basham, however, said Aurora's long-term debt,
even after its offering, still equaled 54 percent of the company's
capital. He said that was far above the debt level of 35 percent to
40 percent that most food companies were carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Debt is also a concern at Seagram. In order to finance its
recent purchase of Polygram NV, the Dutch music giant, Seagram had
planned to sell its Tropicana fruit-juice business to the public in
an offering of $3.5 billion to $4 billion, which would have made it
the largest domestic initial offering ever.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current market weakness for food-company offerings,
however, industry experts said it might make more sense for Seagram
to pursue a private deal, possibly with a company that already has
a strong beverage-distribution network in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seagram isn't getting the value it wants,'' Basham said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a problem across the overall initial-offering
market. John Fitzgibbon Jr., editor of IPO Aftermarket, an industry
newsletter, said data emerged in June that suggested IPO prices
were weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Although June was still a good month for initial offerings
overall, with 57 issues raising $6.82 billion _ the highest monthly
figure so far this year _ Fitzgibbon said that only seven of those
issues were priced above their initial filing ranges. Some 24 were
reduced in size or price, or both.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Fitzgibbon said, of the 200 initial offerings
priced from January to May, 75 were priced above their filing
ranges and only 37 were priced below.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to be commonplace that deals are being slashed in
price in order to get done,'' Fitzgibbon said. ``And we've also
started to see filings trickle, rather than gush in, from perhaps
15 or 20 a week to now just a handful.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said a weak market has potential for good deals.``Even
though the IPO pipeline is very large, we see people pulling back
from the table,'' he said, ``and when supply gets cut, the market
gets stronger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This summer, technology offerings are still scoring highest with
investors, following earlier 1998 stars like Broadcom, Micromuse,
Exodus Communications, Visual Networks and Doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
   June had its share of technology high-fliers. Inktomi Corp., a
company in San Mateo, Calif., that designs and makes software to
ease congestion on the Internet, went public on June 10 at $36 a
share. Its shares have more than doubled in price, to $76.
</P>
<P>
   Two other June standouts were Microstrategy Inc., a software
company, up 135 percent from its $12 offering price; and
Software.net Corp., an online reseller of commercial off-the-shelf
software, up 50 percent from $13.25.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fitzgibbon, of the 13 offerings this year that have
started trading at levels more than double their initial offering
prices, seven are Internet related.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the new Internet stocks are holding up well, but
Ms. Killian offers a note of caution. She points out that compared
with last year's offerings, more Internet-related companies in the
current IPO market have limited operating histories.
</P>
<P>
   Do investors care? Maybe not. Ms. Killian said Internet-related
offerings were raising more money, on average, than they did last
year, perhaps in the range of $10 million to $15 million more for
each.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet offerings may be in danger of getting slammed, as
they were a year ago. A study by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter at the
time found that stocks of Internet-service companies that had gone
public since August 1995 were trading at nearly 75 percent below
their offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fear-and-greed cycle within the IPO market,'' Ms.
Killian said. ``A year ago we were in a fear cycle, and now we're
in a greed cycle.''

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Stephanie Hallberg was 16, she decided she
wanted to reduce the size of her breasts. Ten years later and after
visits with doctors _ all men, all of whom recommended she keep her
breasts the way they were _ she found a doctor who sympathized with
her predicament and agreed to perform the surgery, Dr. Michelle
Copeland, who works out of a Fifth Avenue office complete with its
own operating room and all-female staff, down to the
anesthesiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even imagine going to a man for any plastic
surgery,'' Ms. Hallberg, 26, said. ``A man can study the woman's
body forever, but I believe he can never really understand how a
woman is put together, mentally, emotionally, physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallberg is lucky to have found a plastic surgeon who is a
woman, since they are indeed a rarity _ only about 4 percent of all
the board-certified plastic surgeons in the United States,
according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. In
New York, the disparity is even greater: Of approximately 500
board-certified plastic surgeons, only 12 are women, and only about
half of those spend the bulk of their time practicing cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The women's health movement has brought steadily increasing
numbers of women into medicine: women now make up 46 percent of the
classes admitted to medical schools. But it has scarcely touched
the field of cosmetic surgery, which remains overwhelmingly
dominated by men, even though its patient population is
overwhelmingly female _ 89 percent of cosmetic surgery patients are
women, according to the American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   It is men who are lifting the eyebrows, enlarging the breasts
and suctioning away the fat to remake women's faces and bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The almost exclusively one-way relationship suggests to some the
myth of Pygmalion, the king who in Greek legend sculptured a statue
of his ideal woman, which then came gratifyingly to life and became
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane Petro, a professor of plastic surgery at New York
Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y., is one who thinks ``the
Pygmalion angle'' helps explain why many more men than women are
drawn to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' she said. ``Just look at the number of male
plastic surgeons whose second wife was once their patient. It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgery is booming in the United States, driven by the
aging of the baby-boom population and the gradual erosion of a
cultural stigma against surgical self-improvement. Plastic surgeons
performed 686,201 cosmetic procedures in 1996, a 69 percent
increase over the 1992 figure of 406,156, according to the American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   This boom has lofted the average salary of plastic surgeons to
$350,000, one of the highest in medicine, an income largely
unfettered by managed care and other insurance, since the elective
procedures are paid for directly by well-heeled patients.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite these enticements, women are not streaming into
cosmetic surgery, as they are into other medical fields, like
pediatrics, general medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. What
would explain this paradox?
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, medical authorities and cultural observers suggest a
variety of reasons, from the hard-core practical to the
philosophical. Whatever the explanation, however, the imbalance
would seem to have ramifications for the ever-shifting concept of
American feminine beauty. The pervasiveness of the mostly male
surgical elite helps perpetuate ``the svelte, sculpted, Baywatch
woman,'' said Leslie Laurence, the co-author of ``Outrageous
Practices: How Gender Bias Threaten's Women's Health'' (Ballantine
Books, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   ``We measure ourselves against these cultural icons and feel we
fall short,'' she said. ``I believe that women surgeons bring a
different sensibility, just by virtue of understanding what it's
like to be a woman. When you're talking about things like breasts
and hips and bags under the eyes, they know what these things mean
to us and they understand our insecurities and desires a bit
better. A woman surgeon can separate away the cultural ideal from
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the lack of plastic surgeons who are women
that rolled off the tip of nearly every doctor's tongue _ both male
and female _ is that the rigors of plastic surgery training are too
intense, that a woman cannot balance the demands of surgical
training and a family or husband. Plastic surgeons must graduate
from a four-year medical school, then complete a five-year
residency in general surgery, followed by two years of plastic
surgery residency, capped off in most cases with a one-year
fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time you get out, you're 35,'' said Dr. Samantha Kwon,
who has just finished her plastic surgery training eight years
after graduating from medical school and will begin practicing in
Manhattan this fall. ``And a lot of times, a woman has other
priorities; getting married, raising a family,'' she said. ``You
cannot balance a general surgery residency and a family.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In medical _ not surgical _ practice, women currently make up 21
percent of the nation's doctors, according to figures supplied by
the American Medical Association. They comprise 33 percent of
family practice and internal physicians, and around 85 percent of
pediatric doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors confirm that surgery has long been a boys' club with a
remarkably hostile environment for women. Dr. Kwon said that her
surgical training was ``military in its hierarchy. Some women feel
it's too stressful. And some programs take only men and one token
woman, although they won't admit that. That makes an uncomfortable
environment for women.''
</P>
<P>
   That macho attitude may drive some women away from surgery in
general. ``No matter how much we can legislate equality, surgery is
still something that women are counseled away from,'' said Dr.
Deborah T. Gold, a medical sociologist at the Duke University
Medical Center. ``It's subtle, and not everyone may realize it, but
it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, plenty of women do become surgeons _ just not
plastic surgeons. In 1994, according to the Association of Women
Surgeons, there were 10,004 obstetric-gynecologic surgeons who are
women, 3,031 general surgeons and 2,026 practicing ophthalmologic
surgery. The number of women populating surgery's ranks has risen
dramatically in the last 30 years: from 2,129 in 1970 to 17,107 in
1994. All the surgical subspecialties have to complete similarly
rigorous surgical training periods. Grueling training alone does
not explain the paucity of women in plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne Carlon, a surgical obstetrician-gynecologist in
Manhattan, said she never thought about plastic surgery in medical
school, and chose her field because, as a woman, she sympathized
with the needs of female patients. She surmised that women chose
careers in medicine motived more by altruism than by monetary
concerns. ``Plastic surgery is something of a money maker,'' she
said, ``and I think that a lot fewer women than men have that as a
major factor in deciding what field they want to go into.''
</P>
<P>
   Some patients say that there are fewer women practicing plastic
surgery because patients tend to _ as backward and sexist as it
sounds _ trust men more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always gone to male doctors, and I always will,''
said one woman in her '60s who spoke on condition of anonymity and
who has visited Dr. Daniel Baker, a celebrated Manhattan surgeon,
for procedures. ``How long have women been doing this, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Building a plastic surgery practice _ unlike, for example, one
in cardiac surgery or gastroenterology _ requires a fair bit of
socializing, and in this regard some women physicians say they're
at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Dr. Sherrell Aston, two of Manhattan's most eminent
sculptors of famous faces, may benefit by having beautiful wives
who circulate with them through the charity-ball circuit and help
to gather wealthy clients with time on their hands and furrows on
their brows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go out to parties and get our picture in Avenue
magazine,'' said Dr. Helen S. Colen, a plastic surgeon who shares a
Manhattan practice with her husband, referring to a New York
magazine known for publishing photographs of socialites at play.
``As a woman you just can't be as famous as Dr. Aston and Dr.
Baker, in your tuxedo with your famous wife. How? They go for three
months and sit in the Hamptons and get their pictures in the
papers.'' She added: ``If I had a wife, well, who knows what I
could do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic surgeons' reputations are made on their results, not
based on their spouse,'' Aston said, when reached between surgical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Some cultural critics think the reason for the scarcity of women
plastic surgeons is based on atavistic fears. Nancy Friday, the
author of ``The Power of Beauty'' (HarperCollins, 1996), believes
that women do not have an interest in making other women more
beautiful or youthful-looking. The upshot, she argues, is that
fewer women go into plastic surgery, and fewer women choose to have
women operate on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all those fairy tales about the wicked stepmother, the
older woman who wants to destroy the beauty of the younger one,''
Ms. Friday said. ``I can't think of a woman who would want to give
me youthful, sexual beauty power. We know in our gut that another
woman really doesn't wish us an extended youthful beautiful period
in our lives. It's all because of the unspoken competition between
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis J. Lynch, the president of the American Society of
Reconstructive and Plastic Surgeons, disagreed. ``That statement is
way off base and doesn't reflect the reality of the women who are
practicing plastic surgery,'' he said. ``Women have long been an
important and trusted part of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   And feminine instinct may have played a trusted, beneficial role
in at least one aspect of plastic surgery: a number of women
cosmetic surgeons said they refused to use silicone breast implants
even before they were removed from the market in 1992, following
lawsuits claiming injuries. (Last week the Dow Corning Corp. agreed
to pay $3.2 billion to settle some of the lawsuits.)
</P>
<P>
   The patients who seek out women for their procedures are for the
most part grateful for the womanly attention. Most said that at its
best it felt like the relationship with a close girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who spoke only on condition that her name not be
used because her husband is a public figure, said that after having
had six children, she visited a male plastic surgeon to discuss a
breast tuck and augmentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took one look at me and _ well, after six kids, you know,
it's deflate, deflate, deflate _ and said, `What's the point?
You're this age now, and just learn to live with it.' I was 39
years old. I thought, `Gee, I guess it's about time to go pick out
my cemetery plot.'''
</P>
<P>
   A friend referred her to Dr. Susan Craig Scott, who practices on
the Upper East Side and who she said treated her with kid gloves,
``like a newborn baby, like a best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she hadn't found Dr. Scott, the absolute worst might have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still be deflated, deflated, deflated,'' she said with
a laugh. ``Now, everything's back where it ought to be.''

'98 THE YEAR OF RONALDO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZOIR LA FERRIERE, France _ The Brazilians bid adieu to Stade de
Tres Sapins Friday. The 3,000-seat stadium had been filled with
blue-and-gold-attired spectators and hundreds of journalists every
afternoon since the Brazilian national team arrived 43 days ago for
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Loyer, mayor of Ozoir La Ferriere, said he hopes to
rename the site Stade Claudio Taffarel after the goalkeeper whose
performance clinched Brazil's penalty-kicks win over the
Netherlands in the semifinals. Whether or not Loyer's proposal is
approved, this community, carved out of the fir forest of the
Parisian banlieus, will not soon forget the time the Brazilian
circus came to town.
</P>
<P>
   With Brazil on the verge of a fifth World Cup title, there was a
mad scramble among journalists, lined up along the running track
surrounding the field, for comments concerning Sunday's game
against France. Though there are enormous expectations for this
team, the Selecao seems able to hold itself outside the side-show
atmosphere, exuding calmness and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been counting down the games,'' coach Mario Zagallo
said. ``Four games left, three, two, one. The reason I have done
this is because I have confidence in this team, in the Brazilian
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``France is a very good team; its defense is strong. The fact
that they have gotten to the final tells you this, because it is
very difficult to get to the final of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not in hand for us. It is incredibly hard to win
the World Cup in Europe. But if we don't win it now, when will we
be able to?''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the only team to win the World Cup four times, and the
only team to win outside its hemisphere. Zagallo certainly would
like to succeed this time, since it is doubtless his last chance.
But even if the Brazilians do not win this one, it would be hard to
imagine them failing to win future World Cups, whether the site is
another continent or another planet. The inexhaustible wealth of
talent, the commitment of the country, and the incredible support
all suggest that Brazil will continue to be a major factor in World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, this tournament will be remembered for the
performance of Ronaldinho, the 21-year-old who has come the nearest
to matching the charisma of Pele. Zagallo, the coach who began his
World Cup career playing with Pele in 1958, will move on. Dunga,
the 34-year-old captain whose fighting spirit has lifted Brazil,
will play his last international game.
</P>
<P>
   And Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima will take control, as he did in
carrying the offense against Holland. He scored in the first minute
of the second half, and nearly clinched the victory with a strong
solo effort midway through the half. He has been billed as a sort
of soccer savior, the first to be thrust blatantly onto the global
scene by modern saturation media methods, which attempt to separate
the individual from the team context.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldinho mostly has been well-received, though he drew
criticism from the Vatican after an Italian tire company
superimposed his image on the Cristo Redentor statue overlooking
Rio de Janeiro. Savior, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pele and Argentina's Diego Maradona, whose images evolved
more subtly, through an appreciation of their talents, Ronaldinho's
popularity has been generated by the mass marketing machinations of
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   But even without that campaign, Ronaldinho's phenomenal bursts
of speed and ability to deliver in key situations would be
capturing imaginations of even the world's most destitute spots.
After the game against the Dutch, an Albanian village reported that
15 children born that day were baptized ``Ronaldo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is impossible to separate the down-home, almost naive
nature of Ronaldinho from the enormous money-spinning operation
that surrounds him. He spent Friday's training session mostly
jogging slowly, separated from the scrimmage, resting his legs,
which have been insured for $52 million for this tournament alone.
</P>
<P>
   The previous day, Ronaldinho had been allowed to leave Brazil's
castle-hotel in Lesigny, where the Confederacao Brasileira de
Futbol is paying $1 million for the team to stay. He went to nearby
Pontault Combault, where his mother, Sonia, prepared a home-cooked
meal of fejoada. Sonia has brought the flavor of Rio to France,
along with the family _ Nelio Jr., who is attending school in the
United States; nephews and nieces; Susana ``Ronaldinha'' Werner;
and their dog, Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldinho has been rejuvenated at this home-away-from-home when
the team returned from trips to Marseille and Nantes. He plays his
lucky drums, one autographed by a samba group, the other by James
Brown, which ``give rhythm to the game and life.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, he receives the sustenance that fame and sponsorship money
cannot provide.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazario de Limas' youngest son was born in 1976, two years
after Brazil last failed to repeat as World Cup champions. By then,
Brazilians fully expected their team to succeed every time, an
unrealistic ambition that concluded with a bad-tempered defeat to
the Dutch at Germany '74.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldinho was just another (itals)menino do rua,(unitals) a
street urchin, who might or might not survive the turbulence of the
big city. He demonstrated enough talent to try out for Flamengo,
but not enough for the country's biggest club to pay for his bus
fare.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ronaldo was 17, though, he had found success as a
prolific scorer at Cruzeiro in Minas Gerais. European clubs became
interested, and PSV Eindhoven bought him for $5 million. Ronaldinho
was being regarded as the new Pele, but at USA '94 he remained on
the bench as Brazil won the World Cup for the first time since
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldinho was a young, gap-toothed striker whose personality
was submerged by that veteran, high-profile Brazilian team.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed greatly since. Ronaldinho moved on to
Barcelona in Spain, scored dozens of exciting goals, somewhat
devalued since he has joined Italy's Serie A with Internazionale.
In Italy, he has been revered by everyone except opposing
defenders, who have hacked and double-teamed him to distraction. He
has not had as much of a highlight show career in Serie A, but the
rough tests have helped forge Ronaldinho's character.
</P>
<P>
   He has been subjected to similar attention in the World Cup,
expending abnormal amounts of energy to function on a Brazil team
that is still developing. But when Brazil has needed Ronaldinho, he
has been its most resourceful and threatening offensive weapon.
</P>
<P>
   And, should Brazil win this tournament, there will be no end to
what might be named after Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima.

BULLS _ Former Phoenix fireman Ron Beier still vividly remembers
the big red bull charging and hooking his thigh with a horn when he
was running with the bulls in Pomplona, Spain. But Beier and many
of his friends will be getting their adrenaline rush for the first
time in the United States on Saturday in the Running of the Bulls
in Mesquite, Nev. Between 400 and 600 people have coughed up $50
apiece to run a quarter mile route with a dozen bulls from a Utah
ranch. The run will be held on an Arizona ranch on the Nevada
border because the Nevada Department of Transportation wouldn't
give permission to have it on Mesquite's main street. This event

AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - The two stretch-cab Toyota Tacoma pickup
trucks looked pretty much identical: jacked up, huge tires on
modular wheels and the initials TRD written large on the sides of
their pickup boxes. TRD stands for Toyota Racing Development. Upon
closer inspection, the difference between the two trucks is
glaring. One has a rugged four-wheel-drive system for serious
off-road work, complete with low-range gearing, that gives it the
capabilities of a mountain goat. The other truck doesn't. Called
the PreRunner, it's just a two-wheel-drive, despite its rugged
off-road styling and attitude. But before you write it off as a
mere poser, the two-wheel-drive model does have distinct
attributes. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL;

DOCUMENTARY EXPLORES ALLIES' BERLIN AIRLIFT  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY JULY 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - The first battle of the Cold War was a humanitarian
mission, an air bridge into Berlin from Allied-controlled sectors
of a subdivided Germany.
</P>
<P>
   During the Berlin Airlift, which ran from June 1948 to May 1949,
2.5 million tons of lifesaving supplies were flown into the
devastated German capitol by American and British transport planes.
A total of 277,000 flights were made under always difficult and
often dangerous conditions. Ground crews changed 60,000 sparkplugs
a month to keep the airborne conveyor belt operating.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, PBS celebrates the 50th anniversary of the
airlift with a one-hour documentary, ``The Berlin Airlift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get an airplane in every three minutes,'' said
Earl Kielgass, then an airlift pilot, now a Tempe, Ariz., resident.
``We would've liked to get one in every minute, but couldn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stalin sparked the airlift by blockading all ground
routes into Berlin, which was surrounded by Russia's piece of
Germany. For nearly a year, all of the food and fuel to sustain the
city's more than 2 million residents came in via air corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin had largely been reduced to rubble during World War II,
and was beginning its agonizing recovery from being ``a city of the
dead,'' as it's described by one observer in the PBS special.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin's attempt to starve Berlin was his way of turning its
residents into communists. The airlift foiled his plans, as planes
often flew three round-trip missions a day, stopping only long
enough at each end to load supplies on and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really strenuous flying,'' said Kenneth Herman, now a
Goodyear, Ariz., resident, then a pilot. ``You had to maintain a
precise air speed, a precise altitude and stay in the corridors so
the Russians wouldn't shoot you down.'' While Stalin allowed the
Allied air-relief effort, he didn't want it to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems was navigating up there,'' Kielgass said.
``The Russians could jam your radio beacon, and you'd get
off-course. The Russian aircraft were flying around you, and they
could harass you. In the clouds, you really couldn't see their
airplanes, but their locations were called in to us by radio. All
you could do was grit your teeth and keep going. They were just an
annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   The cargo had to get through. It doesn't sound very dashing or
romantic a half-century removed from the event, but coal was the
chief cargo carried by Herman and Kielgass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally our squadrons carried coal,'' Kielgass said. ``Coal
and flour, mostly. Berliners didn't have any electricity. They had
to have coal to generate power and heat during the winter months.
It was very critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman, who eventually flew 190 airlift missions, was a
transport pilot and training specialist during the war, but many of
the airlift pilots had directly contributed to Germany's
devastation. Kielgass, who flew a fighter bomber over Germany in
the war, said few of his fellow pilots saw any contradiction in the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most moving elements of the PBS special is the story
of Gail Halvorsen, who dropped candy to German kids using
handkerchiefs as parachutes. (The ``Candy Bomber,'' as he came to
be known, also toted along a home-movie camera for many of his
flights. His silent color footage _ as well as the can-do spirit it
captures _ warms the otherwise chilly special, which is built from
black-and-white newsreel and military footage.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Berlin were decimated during World War II,''
Herman said. ``There was very little food. They were literally
starving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying to kill people during the war. We were
trying to stop the oppressive Nazi government. Many, many German
people were against the Nazi government. I was a little prejudiced.
My grandparents had come from Germany, and here I was back in the
land of my forefathers, flying into Berlin several times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman, president of the Berlin Airlift Veterans Association,
has returned to Berlin several times. Particularly since the fall
of Communism, he said, the rebuilt city has proved that the airlift
was well worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is a beautiful city, with open spaces and parks,'' he
said. ``It's fast becoming the cultural and economic and political
center of Europe, if not the entire world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to live anywhere else in the world, rather than Rome
or Paris, I'd pick Berlin.'' &QL;

   PASADENA, Calif. _ The ability to run the gamut from profound to
absurd, often in a heartbeat, is TV's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   And its curse.
</P>
<P>
   This was plainly evident Friday in Pasadena, as The Learning
Channel gave TV critics a taste of ``Vietnam: The Soldiers'
Story,'' a six-hour, first-person documentary, while Animal Planet
announced a new fall series called ``Judge Wapner's Animal Court,''
featuring people and their pets in real disagreements over
``grooming disasters'' and ``paternity disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen a clip of ``Judge Wapner's Animal Court,'' so I
can only judge the idea itself as absurd. But having seen a
five-minute sampling of ``Vietnam: The Soldier's Story,'' I can't
wait to view the remaining five hours and 55 minutes Oct. 11-13.
</P>
<P>
   The special is hosted and narrated by Vietnam veteran Jack
Smith, an ABC News correspondent and the son of TV news pioneer
Howard K. Smith. As a young soldier, Smith was wounded during the
battle of the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Covered in blood, he was
used as a human sandbag by a North Vietnamese machine gunner who
presumed him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Smith was at the Berlin Wall for the fall of
communism in 1989, an event that he says brought his Vietnam
experience ``full circle.'' But he has no doubt that the United
States waged a futile war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't put your sons in harm's way,'' he said, ``unless you
intend to win the war.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Former ``Melrose Place''-holder Brooke Langton stars in
USA Network's serialization of the Sandra Bullock movie, ``The
Net,'' which premieres next Sunday at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a computer expert whose life has been turned upside down
by cyber-terrorists, Langton said she's reasonably comfortable on
the Internet, but far from expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've searched (the Web) for things when my animals have gotten
sick,'' she said, ``or for something really bizarre that no one's
awake at 2 a.m. to talk to you about.''
</P>
<P>
   After its Sunday premiere, ``The Net'' will team with ``Sins of
the City,'' a new detective show set in Miami, as part of USA's
Saturday lineup.
</P>
<P>
   _ So you think Rupert Murdoch has shaken up the L.A. Dodgers?
Just wait till Aug. 15, when Murdoch's Fox empire puts its stamp on
the Family Channel. Only Pat Robertson's ``700 Club'' will survive
from the old lineup when the new Fox Family Channel debuts.
(Robertson, who sold the channel to Fox and Saban Entertainment for
$1.9 billion last year, insisted that his ``700 Club'' stay.)
</P>
<P>
   But no more ``Hawaii Five-O,'' no more ``Home &AMP; Family.''
Instead, look for a lot of recycled children's programming in the
daytime, including ``Pee-wee's Playhouse'' and ``Shining Time
Station,'' along with Fox Kids shows like ``Goosebumps'' and
``Bobby's World.'' In the evening, expect reality shows, more
adult-targeted comedies and movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most TV is not safe for family viewing,'' said president Rich
Cronin, new president of the Fox Family Channel. ``We have an
opportunity to expand on the current audience by creating a network
that the whole family will watch together, a network that
entertains contemporary families with a Fox attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if the Dodgers will be watching.

MOTORISTS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT IN GUBERNATORIAL RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When it comes to campaign issues, Massachusetts
motorists are suddenly in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   First state Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, a Republican
gubernatorial candidate, proposed doing away with the 2.5 percent
excise tax that automobile owners pay each year.
</P>
<P>
   Then US Representative Brian Donnelly weighed in with a plan to
shake up the state's insurance system to give good drivers lower
rates.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, former state Senator Patricia McGovern offered a
plan to eliminate the dreaded Registry of Motor Vehicles, and
instead let car owners register at local town halls.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci quickly hitchhiked a ride on that
proposal, endorsing it as a topnotch idea. Indeed, Cellucci was so
worried about political road rage that for weeks he refused to take
a position on a (now defunct) ballot question to eliminate turnpike
tolls _ even though his own Turnpike Authority needs that revenue
for its Big Dig contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when, say, Frank Sargent, a Republican
governor, nixed plans for an inner belt around Boston. Or when
Michael Dukakis, a Democratic governor, set a civic example by
taking the Green Line to work and campaigned against a third harbor
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   With gasoline barely a buck a gallon, sports-utility vehicles a
second home for Yuppies, and road trips a form of recreation, auto
issues seem to be where the rubber meets the road.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, suggests Democratic political consultant Mary Anne
Marsh, is the prominence those issues played last year in
gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, where drivers pay the nation's highest insurance
rates, Governor Christine Todd Whitman almost lost the election to
an obscure state senator who campaigned principally on insurance
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Virginia election, Republican James S. Gilmore 3rd's
campaign-trail proposal to slash the state's car tax is credited
with helping the GOP sweep the state's three statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   This year, those successes have spawned similar efforts across
the country. In California, for example, Governor Wilson has
proposed cutting the car license fee; in Georgia, Republican
gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner wants to do away with the car
tax; in New York, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Betsy McCaughey
Ross has put forth a plan to slash insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Those campaigns have demonstrated that auto issues are the
pocketbook matters of the late 1990s, says Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take tolls and auto insurance rates and excise taxes,
it all adds up to more money out of people's pockets than is
returned by the tax cuts they are talking about,'' said Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a widespread loathing of Registry lines, and it
helps explain why automobile issues have taken a front seat this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the various plans, Malone's is the most dramatic fiscally;
his auto excise tax cut would save car owners a total of $380
million when fully phased-in after three years. (Under Malone's
plan, the state would replace the revenues lost by cities and town,
who currently get the tax revenue.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep-seated anger about that tax,'' says Malone
spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom. ``You pay a sales tax when you buy the
car, you pay a fuel tax when you gas it up, you pay tolls when you
drive the car, and then on top of that, the government charges you
an excise tax just because the car is sitting in your driveway.
People understand the inherent unfairness of that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern is just as surely banking on the simmering frustration
most every driver has experienced while negotiating Registry lines.
Announcing her plan, she asked: ``How many times have we stood in
line at the Registry and said to ourselves, `There has to be a
better way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But over at the Conservation Law Foundation, transportation
expert Stephen Burrington looks longingly to Portland, Ore., where
voters in 1996 elected Earl Blumenauer to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A former city and county official, Blumenauer pushed many of the
policies -- light rail, ride-sharing, bike paths, bike racks on
buses -- that have given Portland its reputation as a distinctly
livable and different city.
</P>
<P>
   Burrington argues that political candidates elsewhere have
overlooked the power of those quality-of-life issues as they have
courted car owners. Matters like traffic calming and improved mass
transit could find receptive audiences, if only they had candidates
to champion them, Burrington claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a swelling of public interest in the livability
issues,'' Burrington said. ``There are some real sleeper issues
that people running for office would do well to seize on.''

VOTERS `OPTIMISTIC' PRESIDENTIAL WINNER WILL RESTORE STABILITY TO
ECUADOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Few tears will be shed when Ecuador's president
steps down next month. Fabian Alarcon is so despised that a recent
newspaper cartoon depicted hecklers pelting the interim head of
state with garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a dynamic leader after two years of political,
economic and natural disasters, Ecuadoreans will head to the polls
Sunday for a presidential runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   They will choose between Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad, a
Harvard-trained technocrat, and business magnate Alvaro Noboa,
often described as the richest man in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad topped Noboa in a May 31 first-round vote but failed to
receive more than 50 percent of the ballots, forcing Sunday's
runoff. Mahuad had a double-digit lead over Noboa in several recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will begin a four-year term Aug. 10 and attempt to
restore a measure of stability to this battered South American
nation of 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic,'' said Faisel Baki, an investment banker
in Quito, the capital city. ``The new government is going to change
things. Either Mahuad or Noboa will bring new projects forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Any semblance of progress has been stalled during the past two
years due, in part, to the revolving door at the presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
   Abdala Bucaram, an eccentric populist elected in 1996, was
ousted after six months by the Ecuadorean Congress for ``mental
incapacity.'' After a brief power struggle _ at one point, three
politicians claimed to be president _ Bucaram was replaced by
Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
   High hopes for the interim government quickly turned to disgust,
when Alarcon became ensnared in a series of corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   He has been accused of authorizing at least 1,000 no-show jobs
while he was president of the Congress. He also has been linked to
a scam involving the resale of clothes donated to victims of
Pacific coast flooding caused by the El Nino weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the country's economy has gone into a tailspin.
Falling prices for oil _ the pillar of Ecuador's economy _ $1.5
billion in flood damage and capital flight by nervous investors
have led to a fiscal deficit that could reach 5 percent of the
gross domestic product by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   An infusion of foreign cash could have offset some of the
problems, but the erratic policies have discouraged foreign
investment. For example, when the government tried to privatize 35
percent of EMETEL, the state telephone company, it received two
rounds of bids, then scrapped the process with no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador could also be earning more petro-dollars. The
300-mile-long SOTE pipeline is too small to transport daily output
from oil wells in the Amazon jungle to the Pacific coast. Foreign
firms made several offers to upgrade the pipeline, but Alarcon
balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has simply been incompetent,'' Baki said.
``There is no other word for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say a more accurate word is ``corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. firms such as Proctor &AMP; Gamble, United Parcel Service and
Colgate-Palmolive have been brought to court in what many say were
frivolous lawsuits. Other companies say they have been pressured to
pay bribes. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Foreign executives complain that contracts in Ecuador are about
as reliable as ``wet paper,'' said U.S. Ambassador Leslie
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is Ecuador's biggest trading partner. But when
American executives stop by the U.S. Embassy, they often receive
blunt advice: Stay out until the next president is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be open and honest about the risks of operating in
one of the most difficult investment climates in Latin America,''
said a U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, trade between the two nations has dropped by
50 percent, according to Robert Moss, president of the
Ecuadorean-American Chamber of Commerce. One breakthrough, however,
was Ecuador's approval of a bilateral intellectual property rights
treaty designed to protect U.S. firms and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   The next government is expected to negotiate an agreement with
the International Monetary Fund on a reform program. Analysts say
that under either a Mahuad or Noboa government, Ecuadoreans can
expect austerity measures, such as the elimination of subsidies for
cooking gas and a sales tax increase, to help resolve the fiscal
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If responsible measures are adopted, some observers predict, the
economic outlook could improve dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, 48, received a master's degree in public administration
from Harvard University and has been a successful, two-term mayor
of Quito. He has a respected team of economic advisers and is
well-regarded by the nation's business community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahuad would be ideal,'' said Fabian Corral, a corporate
lawyer who represents foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Noboa, 47, is a political neophyte. He has been
hurt by his close ties to the disgraced Bucaram, who lives in
self-imposed exile in Panama and has been accused by Ecuador's
Supreme Court of stealing $88 million during his six months in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa was endorsed by Bucaram's Roldosista Party. From Panama,
the former president has played a high-profile role in the
campaign. Mahuad once claimed that Noboa had ``sold his soul to
Bucaram.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Noboa, who is from the port city of Guayaquil, has wide
support along the Pacific coast, where voters often complain that
they are neglected by Quito-based politicians such as Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   And as one of the heirs to his late father's banana empire,
Noboa has impressed voters with his corporate connections. He
promises to create 1 million jobs, build 200,000 homes and attract
billions of dollars in investment through his ties to Wall Street
bankers and business people.
</P>
<P>
   ``His basic strength is the image that he can bring foreign
investment to the country,'' Baki said.

TEXAS SCHOOL BOARD OBJECTS TO DISNEY MOVIES, DUMPS $43M IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Walt Disney Co. may be home to beloved
children's characters such as Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck,
but the Texas Board of Education decided Friday it isn't a suitable
place to invest money because a subsidiary produces films
containing sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   With eight Republicans voting to divest and four Democrats
voting against, the board ordered $43 million in Disney stock sold
from the $17.7 billion Permanent School Fund. Interest from the
fund helps defray the cost of public education in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The American Family Association of Texas, which is involved in a
national boycott against Disney because the company offers benefits
to domestic partners of employees, praised the move.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, noting that the school fund also has investments
in companies involved in alcohol, gambling and defense contracting,
denounced the vote as hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news,'' said Wyatt Roberts, chairman of the Texas
AFA. ``In my view, I think that Disney is the corporate equivalent
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They do some good things but they also
do some very, very bad things. I think it's time someone held them
accountable, and I think that's what the vote today represents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas AFA sent a videotape to board members that contained
excerpts from such movies as ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Chasing Amy,''
all films made by Miramax, a Disney subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt said state taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize films
that ``corrupt and damaged our children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Rush of the Texas Freedom Network, a nonpartisan
group formed to counter social conservatives on such issues, said
elected officials in Texas shouldn't be bowing ``to the political
pressures of a right-wing special interest group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has chosen to put politics in front of our
children's interests in its divestiture of Disney stock,'' Rush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Peters, a Disney spokeswoman in Orlando, Fla., said the
company did not comment on ``individual investment strategies.''
But she also said the vote would change the film-making decisions
at Miramax.

   ``The Walt Disney Company produces more family entertainment
than any other entertainment company in the world, and any products
are marked with the Disney brand name are suitable for all ages,''
she said, adding that Disney subsidiaries that produce films for
``mature'' audiences are set up under other names and adhere to
ratings system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, Miramax is a highly acclaimed film label that has
received 110 nominations and 30 Academy Awards over the last 10
years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members, supporters and opponents, talked about
the issue before the vote was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues that people could get uptight
about,'' said board member Will Davis, a Democrat from Austin.
``We're going down a very slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and others said the Disney stock had been a good
investment. The school fund's internal portfolio has realized a 108
percent return on the Disney stock that was purchased two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But David Bradley of Beaumont and Richard Neill of Fort Worth,
both Republicans, cited concerns about recent losses in the stock
as a reason for divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Offutt, a Republican board member from San Antonio who
spearheaded the effort to divest, said he had concerns about the
future profitability of Disney stock. But he added he was
responding to complaints about Miramax films.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an elected official, when I hear substantial numbers of my
constituents have concerns, I need to be responsive to those
concerns,'' Offutt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concerns that we have state money invested in things
that citizens of this state object to. If Miramax wants to make
`Pulp Fiction II,' I have no problem with that, they can go for it
and try and make some money. But I don't have to invest taxpayer
dollars in a corporation that may be producing movies that many
citizens find objectionable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But member Alma Allen, a Democrat from Houston, called the vote
to divest ``political hypocrisy'' because the school fund also has
investments in companies involved in alcohol and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be voting to divest,'' Allen said. ``And in fact,
two weeks from today, I will be at Disneyland where my
grandchildren want to go, and I'm going to take all five of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock closed up $1.12 on in trading Friday, to $38.12.

ANDREA DORIA DANGEROUS LURE TO ADVENTURESOME DIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mich.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ Even as his rescuers carried him from the
crippled and dying ship 42 years ago, Vincenzno Torre saw a
terrible truth in the elegant vessel just before it slipped beneath
the waves and into its 235-foot deep grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Andrea Doria,'' said Torre, 65, his voice still fully
flavored with the accent of his native Italy, ``she's beautiful,
but dangerous.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That appellation is as apt today as it was when the the Italian
ocean liner collided with the Swedish-American Stockholm off
Nantucket in July 1956. The tragedy killed 52 people then, and the
majestic liner's wreck is still claiming lives today.
</P>
<P>
   Two have been killed in the past three weeks in accidents that
diving specialists predict will hardly diminish the attraction of
what scuba enthusiasts consider the water world's most alluring
inverted pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call it the Mount Everest of diving for nothing,''
said Douglas J. Costa, 27, of Plymouth, who made four dives on the
Andrea Doria last summer. ``It's a beautiful wreck if you know what
you're doing. The depth is pretty much twice the recreational
limit. The currents can be so strong that you feel like a flag on a
flagpole. But it's so well preserved and so big that you could
drive a truck through some of its rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's all sorts of things that could go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For Richard Roost, 46, of Ann Arbor, Mich., the pull of the
Andrea Doria was irresistible. Friends said Roost had wanted to
descend to the wreck site for some time. He was among a group of
divers who last week chartered The Seeker, a 60-foot commercial
diving boat out of Montauk, Long Island. He jumped into the seas
above the wreck site about noon last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, his diving associates found him dead in the
first-class bar lounge of what four decades ago was a $30 million,
697-foot, 11 story luxury liner that was en route from Genoa to New
York City with more than 1,600 people aboard. It was struck by the
smaller Stockholm 45 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard called Roost's accident ``another tragic example
of the dangers'' of recreational deep-water diving. ``It's not in
our territorial waters, and people are going to take whatever risks
they're going to take,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Steve
Carleton. ``This is a popular wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's increasingly popular said diving authorities, who
call it one of the deepest, murkiest, most risky goals of the sport
diver on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of improved training and equipment and a rekindled
fascination with the sinking of the Titanic _ far out of reach for
SCUBA divers _ the Andrea Doria has become a must-see stop for
those who consider themselves expert guides along the Atlantic
Ocean's adventuresome underwater tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allure of shipwrecks has been there over the millennia,''
said Doug Maier, 47, a high school health teacher, who plans to
make his first dive on the Andrea Doria late this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a huge fascination for these things,'' said Maier,
who has been diving for about 10 years. ``It's like walking back
through a portal of history. It's going to seem huge. It's going to
seem like a sunken city, and it'll extend much further than I'll be
able to see. The enormity of it is going to take my breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip from the docks in Plymouth to the Andrea Doria wreck
site takes 10 hours in good seas, but for careful, experienced
divers, the voyage is at least a five-year journey in which skills
are polished in scores of incrementally more difficult dives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discourage people who don't have at least six years of
experience from doing this,'' said Paul Adler, owner of East Coast
Divers, a retail dive store in Framingham and a member of the
Quincy Underwater Recovery Dive Team. ``They should have between
150 and 200 dives under their belt before they attempt something
like diving on the Andrea Doria, and that's a lot of dives.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin for error is critically slender.
</P>
<P>
   Divers use gallows humor in joking about the number of times
``death'' appears on the release forms charter companies make them
sign before they descend to the wreck _ having paid an average $700
to $1,000 in charter fees. Between the end of June and the middle
of August, as many as 20 to 30 divers at a time may be found swim
ming in the sunken ship and around its debris field that is a
magnet to artifact collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the water, some divers proceed along a nylon rope line
that guides them in and out of the wreck, which lies on its side
and has been described as resembling a husked-out watermelon. The
current can be strong. The water is cold. And the visibility varies
greatly.
</P>
<P>
   At 200 feet, divers have only about 20 minutes before they must
start a time-consuming series of stops as they return to the
surface so they can prevent the bends, the formation of lethal gas
bubbles in their blood. Divers commonly descend and ascend along
the anchor line of the charter boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you run into a difficult situation, it's harder to get out
of it because your judgment and physical coordination may be
impaired,'' said Adler. ``If you get entangled in something, it
would be simple to untangle yourself in 30 or 40 feet, but it might
be very difficult at 200 feet because the oxygen can become toxic
at 217 feet. It's almost like playing Russian Roulette at that
depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even experienced divers like Roost can get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   R. Todd Smith, 37, of Middleborough, a 17-year diving veteran,
said he attended an instructor training program with Roost in Santa
Ana, Calif., in 1988, and considered him a skilled diver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been diving alone, which in my mind is a really
bad idea,'' Smith said. ``Like climbing Mount Everest, you do this
with other people. No matter how good you are, you can't plan for
every contingency.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Divers Alert Network (DAN), a non-profit divers
support organization at Duke University, the number of diving
accidents and fatalities generally has declined in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, there were 483 diving injuries and 85 diving-related
deaths among recreational divers and technical divers in the US and
Canada. In 1995, there were 590 injuries and 104 deaths, according
to the DAN annual report. Preliminary numbers for 1997, a DAN
spokeswoman said, are down again.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous explorer of the Andrea Doria wreckage
was Peter Gimbel, the department store heir whose underwater
pictures, taken the day after the ship sank, were published in Life
magazine, and then in publications around the world. Over the next
three decades, Gimbel made hundreds of dives to the wreckage while
producing two acclaimed documentary films about it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, after investing more than $2 million in his searches,
he brought up a Bank of Italy safe from the wreckage. Gimbel almost
died of oxygen poisoning during his first 1981 dive _ he was
brought up unconscious, but recovered _ and claimed the wreckage
had ``a malevolent spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But that forboding spirit is no discouragement to divers like
Greg Dawe, 38, of Beverly, an advanced scuba diving instructor who
was scheduled to depart for the Andrea Doria wreck site Friday
night and to be diving on it Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my friends are divers,'' he said. ``This is one of the
things that we do every summer. Some people go to Maine for a
camping trip, we go to the Andrea Doria. It's a social experience.
It's a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like a gnat on the back of an elephant when you're
down there. It's so big. It's like diving on the inside of
somebody's mansion.''

SECRET OF THE ETERNALLY YOUNG SLEUTHS

<P>
   After nearly seventy years, Nancy Drew is still going out with
Ned Nickerson, and Joe Hardy is still dating his friend Chet's
sister, Iola. There are certain things about the Nancy Drew and
Hardy Boys series that never change. Yet these wildly popular
teen-age detective novels _ since they began in 1927, about 200
million volumes have been sold _ have nonetheless been seen to
reflect historical changes.
</P>
<P>
   The figure of the eternally competent Nancy has been a magnet
for scholars who read into the Nancy Drew books the trajectory of
American womanhood throughout the course of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, there was a scholarly conference on her, followed by a
book, ``Rediscovering Nancy Drew,'' edited by Carolyn Stewart Dyer
and Nancy Tillman Romalov (University of Iowa Press, 1995). She was
even the subject of a book by novelist Bobbie Ann Mason, ``The Girl
Sleuth'' (University of Georgia Press, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to this scholarly obsession is ``The
Mysterious Case of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys,'' due out in
October. Based partly on newly available papers of the Stratemeyer
Syndicate, the books' original publishers, at the New York Public
Library, Carol Kismaric and Marvin Heiferman have traced the
evolution of both series from the '30s to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to understand why these icons of popular culture
have had such an emotional pull on people,'' said Ms. Kismaric.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Frank and Joe Hardy have attracted less scholarly
notice than Nancy Drew, though they have received avid attention
from collectors.
</P>
<P>
   One California collector, Tony Carpentieri, has scanned every
Hardy Boy book up to the late '70s into a computer. He has counted
the words, and the number of times each character is mentioned. He
has tabulated how often Joe is hit on the head and how many times
the boys' mother says, ``I'm worried about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpentieri published the results of his research in ``Hardy &AMP;
Hardy, Investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books were begun in 1927 by Edward
Stratemeyer, the son of German immigrants who loved the Oliver
Optic boy adventure series. Adolescents had only recently begun to
emerge as a distinct group occupying a place somewhere between
childhood and adulthood. The transcontinental railroad facilitated
the distribution of books, and a new market had emerged for series
books, shipped weekly to teen-agers hungry for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Stratemeyer conceived of a series based on the adventures of two
intrepid boy detectives, Frank and Joe Hardy. The books were
written under Stratemeyer's direction by Leslie McFarlane, who used
the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. Other authors also wrote the
books, but they were always under the Dixon name.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Stratemeyer established rules. No serious
violence: A character could be knocked unconscious only once in
every book. Each chapter must end with a cliffhanger. There were
girls, but no ``mushy stuff,'' as the contemporary editor of the
series at Simon &AMP; Schuster, Anne Greenberg, put it.
</P>
<P>
   The boys grew up in the mythical city of Bayport, drove cars,
flew planes. They embodied ``the ideals of masculinity,'' Heiferman
and Ms. Kismaric write. ``They always solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friend Phil Cohen was a ``diminutive, black-haired Jewish
boy.'' Phil was nerdy and never had a girlfriend. Blacks were
usually characterized as slow-witted or were servants. And the boys
had a ``pale, nervous, tight-lipped'' mother who hovered in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the Hardy Boys came the Nancy Drew books,
originally written by Mildred Wirt Benson under the pseudonym
Carolyn Keene. Nancy was more upper-class than the Hardys, spent
less time outdoors, and encountered less bad weather. She had fewer
ethnic friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy's color was blue. She had blue eyes, drove a blue
roadster, dressed in blue. The color blue, in the eyes of Heiferman
and Ms. Kismaric, is a coded reference to class, Nancy's
blue-bloodedness.
</P>
<P>
   She too had a condescending attitude toward other ethnic groups.
Like most fairy-tale heroines, she lived in a dream world with no
mother to nag her, no homework, no chores. She had her tall, dark,
handsome father, Carson Drew, all to herself. Ms. Kismaric and
Heiferman note that they had a somewhat erotically charged
relationship, with Nancy running her fingers lovingly through her
father's hair.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, Nancy broke stereotypes. She was a reflection
of the women of the modern era, who had got the vote, drank in
public and were beginning to drive. ``The crucial thing was that
she was mobile,'' said Ms. Kismaric. Though Nancy liked Ned
Nickerson, she was always in control. She has a friend George _ a
short-haired tomboy with tailored clothes _ taken by some critics
to have been gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plots of Nancy Drew mysteries are like sonnets, endless
variations on an inflexible form,'' Bobbie Anne Mason wrote in
``The Girl Sleuth.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew lived in Edenic paradises,
surrounded by a body of water, ``ever-changing, yet familiar,'' Ms.
Kismaric and Heiferman write, ``as the plots in each mystery.''
There was no pollution, no racial strife. There was evil, but it
could always be resolved by the virginal Nancy or two boys
unencumbered by sexual longings.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Edward Stratemeyer died in 1930, the year Nancy Drew began, and
Edna and Harriet, his daughters, took over the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Harriet Stratemayer Adams (she had married Russell
Vroom Adams in 1915) assumed full control of the series. She
revised and updated the books, wrote and commissioned new ones,
making Nancy a more ``feminine'' and compliant figure. Gradually,
Adams transformed Nancy, and many readers never forgave her for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to get women out of the jobs they'd had in World War
II and make them consumers again; they had to make her less bossy
and less independent,'' said Carolyn Heilbrun, a retired professor
of English at Columbia University, who has written on Nancy Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy became less assertive, and began to ask permission to do
things. She needed Ned Nickerson's help now when she solved a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't sass cops,'' said Ms. Kismaric of Nancy under
Harriet Adams. ``She is behaving the way society would rather women
behave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the earlier books, when Nancy and the police would do
something together, Nancy would drive her car,'' said Carolyn
Stewart Dyer, a professor of journalism at the University of Iowa
and an editor of ``Rediscovering Nancy Drew.'' ``But in the later
books, she would wait for the police to get her in their car.
Before, she would break and enter to search the house. After 1959,
she wouldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Adams is credited with ridding the books of their
ethnic stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The original publishers of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys was
Grosset &AMP; Dunlap. In 1980, after a lawsuit over rights, Simon &AMP;
Schuster became the publisher of new books in the series. Simon &AMP;
Schuster is also publisher of ``The Mysterious Case of Nancy Drew
and the Hardy Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster began a series for older girls, the ``Nancy
Drew Files.'' ``Simon &AMP; Schuster tarts her up and makes her
sexier,'' said Ms. Kismaric. ``Her romantic life starts heating up.
These were marketing ploys.'' In the ``Files'' books, Nancy began
to moon over Ned and other boys. As feminism advanced, Nancy's own
feminism retreated even more.
</P>
<P>
   Today Nancy drives a van rather than a jalopy. But it is still
blue.
</P>
<P>
   The character of the Hardy Boys has remained much the same, Ms.
Kismaric and Heiferman write, ``locked into a state of eternal,
excitable boyhood,'' except for their toys. Over the years, the old
books have been revised, and new ones have been written. The boys
have gone from jalopies to convertibles to jet travel. They have
traveled on a yacht owned by a supermodel. Their ages were raised
so that it is legal for them to fly a plane.
</P>
<P>
   And the ethnic slurs have ended. Now Phil Cohen, their Jewish
friend, has become an electronics whiz and helps the boys solve
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But mostly it is the nature of evil that changes,'' said
Heiferman. ``In the beginning, the evil is confined to the little
town of Bayport, which is fraught with criminals, people who steal
things. As the books go on, they begin working with the CIA and
Scotland Yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the sense that evil in the books is more nefarious
and more pervasive.''

HOLY CROSS PRESIDENT STEPS DOWN DUE TO BAD HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of the College of the Holy Cross, the Rev. Gerard
Reedy, credited with boosting the academic standing of the
Jesuit-run school in Worcester, has resigned because of poor
health, college officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the physical challenges of the office have become
too burdensome for me and have affected me physically and
emotionally,'' Reedy wrote in a letter to the chairman of the
college's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Reedy, 58, who was appointed president of New England's oldest
Catholic college three years ago, has had a long-time heart
problem, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Reedy was hailed for improving the college's
academic reputation, increasing the number and quality of student
applications and presiding over a major jump in Holy Cross's
endowment.
</P>
<P>
   He endeared himself to students at the liberal arts school when
shortly after his inauguration he moved into a student dormitory.
Reedy, who spent most of his academic career at Fordham College in
New York before coming to Holy Cross, said he wanted students to
have more access to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your tenure as president has seen a continued improvement in
the reputation of the college,'' H.E. Lentz, chairman of the
college's board of trustees said in a letter accepting Reedy's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate news release, Lentz said Reedy's ``countless
friends and supporters can only wish him Godspeed and thank him for
his dedication and sacrifice for Holy Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1843, Holy Cross enrolls about 2,700 undergraduate
students.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Reedy on an interim basis for the next academic year
will be the school's provost, Frank Vellaccio. Holy Cross has
already launched a search for a new Jesuit president.
</P>
<P>
   Reedy will spend the next year living at the Jesuit residence on
campus while he decides what to do next, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board understands that your ceaseless efforts for the
college have taken their toll, and the rigors of the
position...have been at substantial cost to your health,'' Lentz
said in his letter. ``We are saddened by this turn of events and
will miss your wisdom and wit.''

RACE, HEALTH CARE DEFICITS LINKED IN PANEL TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tearful stories of getting second-class health care
because of race and angry demands for more minority health funding
_ those were among the raw emotions evident as more than 300 people
engaged in President Clinton's initiative on race.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its year-long existence, the board
advising Clinton on the initiative heard testimony Friday on how
health care is affected by the nation's difficulty in dealing with
race.
</P>
<P>
   In historic Faneuil Hall, where abolitionists once met, and in
the city where Paul Revere began the nation's first local health
board, blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans spoke
about what health care means to them, and how it has been affected
by race in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Thomas, a Pueblo Laguna Indian from New Mexico, cried
as she related her family's ills, ranging from asthma to hearing
loss, and recalled the recent lingering death of her aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 18 years, my children, my aunt and I have often
had to travel great distances to find health care,'' she said, as
some members of the audience wept along. And while Medicaid,
Medicare, private insurance and the Indian Health Service
theoretically make care available, ``they don't provide my family
with the consistent, quality, accessible and culturally competent
care they need and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Also bringing tears to the audience members' eyes were personal
stories of race and health told by Gay Head Wampanoag Tribal
Council chairwoman Beverly Wright and US Surgeon General David
Satcher.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher, who grew up in the segregated South, said that when he
developed whooping cough at the age of two, his parents could not
bring him to the white-run hospital. Instead, they persuaded the
town's only black physician to come to their house. While the
physician didn't expect Satcher to live beyond the week, Satcher's
mother nursed her son back to health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never take for granted one breath I take, or the
responsibility I have in the Department of Health and Human
Services as surgeon general,'' said Satcher. As part of his
responsibility, Satcher said he is committed to reducing racial
disparities in such key health indicators as infant mortality,
vaccination rates, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and AIDS. He
received the only standing ovation of the three-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of local health officials from a range of ethnic and
racial backgrounds also told the presidential advisory board about
models that work in caring for diverse populations, and about
systemwide barriers that block their ability to provide services.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Freeman, executive director of the Center for Community
Health, Education, Research and Service at Northeastern University,
highlighted his program's training of health care professionals to
meet the special needs of a diverse, urban population.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked by an advisory board member about how the system
helps or hurts his work, Freeman called a ``significant
impediment'' the way the US government pays for graduate medical
education _ by inadequately supporting the community-based training
of social workers, nurses and other health professionals while
reimbursing hospitals for training doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Another exchange over government funding between advisory board
members and a member of the audience was more heated.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Clark, program manager for youth services at Dimock
Community Health Center, demanded the advisory board recommend to
Clinton that cuts in spending for at-risk youths be restored as one
way to improve health in minority communities, but felt
dissatisfied when one board member said he believed local
governments made the cuts, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a joke, a farce,'' Clark said in an interview. He was
accompanied by 16-year-old Theresa Clark, no relation, a Dimock
peer leader who helps educate youth about avoiding risky behavior.
Theresa Clark agreed that she didn't like the advisory board's
answer, adding, ``I don't think they had an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Other meeting participants called for Clinton to support clean
needle exchange to prevent the transmission of the AIDS virus,
drug-abuse treatment on demand, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
for translator services and community health workers and similar
measures to improve access and reduce racial disparity.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory board, as part of its effort to come up with
answers to the difficult question of race, has already recommended
stepped-up civil rights enforcement, increased educational programs
and other social measures. It expects to make its health care
recommendations within the next few weeks, and complete its final
report by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has already incorporated funding for some
of the recommendations in his fiscal 1999 budget, plans to take the
advisory board's report and create a plan to be announced to the
American people by next year.

RIFLE USED TO KILL BORDER AGENTS OWNED BY POLICE, OFFICIAL SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ The assault rifle used to kill two U.S.
Border Patrol agents and wound a deputy sheriff Tuesday is owned by
the Harlingen Police Department and was issued to the killer's
police detective father, authorities confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those tragic things,'' a source involved in
the investigation said. ``You can't get any worse than two Border
Patrol agents killed by the son of a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   The source also said Friday that Ernest L. Moore, a 25-year-old
heavy equipment operator for a San Benito construction company, was
under the influence of alcohol, cocaine and marijuana when he went
on a rampage, killing four people and wounding two others. Moore,
who was fatally wounded by law officers, was buried Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the killings, Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio
insisted that the two assault rifles Moore used came from the Moore
family's private collection and were not police department
property. But on Friday he corrected himself, saying he had since
learned that one of the weapons was owned by the Harlingen Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Moore was carrying a semiautomatic MAK-90, a
Chinese version of an AK-47 assault rifle, when he walked into a
Rio Hondo home before dawn Tuesday to abduct his ex-girlfriend. She
escaped unharmed, but he killed two other women who lived there and
critically wounded a man.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon used was the personal property of Moore's father,
Harlingen Police Detective R.D. Moore. That type of gun has been
banned from importation into this country since 1994, but weapons
already in the United States can legally be bought and sold.
Authorities said they believe Detective Moore bought his gun
legally.
</P>
<P>
   After killing Margarita Flores, 53, and her daughter, Delia
Morin, 31, and wounding Flores' 22-year-old son, Dan Morin, in Rio
Hondo, Ernest Moore sped to his father's home in San Benito. He
took an AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle _ a civilian version of
the military's fully automatic M-16 _ from his father's gun safe
and hid in a nearby cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   That gun had been issued to Detective Moore by the Harlingen
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Moore sprang from the field and ambushed Border Patrol agents
Susan Rodriguez and Ricardo Salinas, shooting before they could
draw their side arms. He also wounded Cameron County sheriff's
deputy Raul Rodriguez, before other deputies shot Moore four times.
</P>
<P>
   A source involved in the investigation said Friday that
Detective Moore was unaware that his son had taken the weapons from
his home. He cooperated with police who came looking for his son,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The source, who asked not to be identified, also confirmed that
preliminary autopsy reports indicate Ernest Moore had alcohol,
cocaine and marijuana in his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he was at a friend's house the night before. They were
drinking, and he left the house at 2:30 or 3 in the morning,'' said
the source. ``We know he was consuming drugs. They admit to him
using drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, Ernest Moore had a spotless police record.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the family described the elder Moore, a senior
detective with more than 25 years of experience, as an honest,
by-the-book officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for years. He's straight and honest,'' said one
Harlingen merchant. ``He'll give you a break if you deserve it, but
if you don't, he'll run you in.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 12, will move Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVIA-REVIEW (La Paz, Bolovia) _ All around Latin America,
book stores are well stocked with new texts about free markets and
global free trade. Such books brim with hope for the future, and
they are beginning to appear even in this backwater capital high in
the Andes. But here, they still have to share shelf space with a
rather depressing best-seller that carries a very different
message. The book, first published in 1937, is Alcides Arguedas'
``A Sick People,'' and it seems at times that every literate
Bolivian has read it. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   CZAR-BURIAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ In writing, ``Uneasy lies the
head that wears a crown,'' Shakespeare couldn't have imagined the
likes of Nicholas II, Russia's last czar, whose remains will be
interred on Friday in St. Petersburg, Russia, along with those of
his family. Nicholas was considered a lightweight, a weak,
unengaged but brutal ruler who preferred family life to affairs of
state, even as the 300-year-old Romanov empire was collapsing
around him. His burial, however, is a potent political symbol for
post-Communist Russia. By Judith Dobrzynski.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-REVIEW (Lagos) _ What the man in the Nigerian street
thinks about recent events. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-DETERRENCE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The potential nuclear
arms race between India and Pakistan is an uneasy and unwelcome
test of how to get along in a world where non-proliferation appears
to have failed. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   SOCCER-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ As soccer reaches its apogee in
Paris with the World Cup final between France and Brazil, the game
remains as mysterious to vast numbers of Americans as it was when
all they saw of it was grainy photographs of Pele leaping in
triumph about something or other. By Kirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ There's a curious new genre that
seems to be emerging in American journalism: the media obituary. In
the hushed, somber tones used for that most solemn of news
accounts, reporters have been busy churning out virtual death
notices for the careers of disgraced colleagues. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME-REWARDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The offering of rewards has
increased in recent years, in part because of successes like the
Ennis Cosby case. But there is little evidence that they do much to
solve most crimes. By Kit R. Roane.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-YORKER-REVIEW (New York) _ Resign? From The New Yorker? In
the past, editors either died or were forced to walk the plank,
their pockets weighted down with bullion. The restless Tina Brown
simply left. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   ABUSIVE-JUDGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Megalomania is an
occupational hazard for judges,'' said Professor Paul Carrington of
the Duke University Law School. He added that a trial judge
inevitably has a great deal of power over everyone in the
courtroom. ``Judges can get awfully full of themselves,'' he said.
``Put it this way: everybody laughs at the judge's jokes.'' By Neil
A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-RELIGION-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the century began,
optimists could easily have convinced themselves that by the time
2000 rolled around there would be nothing left for scientists and
theologians to argue about. Each would have long since agreed on
how to divvy up the intellectual terrain. Science would continue
its inevitable march toward a grand explanation of how the material
world works, leaving to religion the endless arguments over why the
universe came to be and how people ought to behave in it. It hasn't
happened that way. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The United States may not yet resemble
France, which is paralyzed every year or two by a strike, but
suddenly American labor unions have taken to the streets in a way
not seen in decades. Some labor stalwarts who grew up singing
``Solidarity Forever'' are hailing recent developments as signaling
that union militancy, squelched in the Reagan years, is making a
comeback. But other analysts suggest that this month's three-ring
labor circus is a coincidental confluence of events that should be
viewed as exceptions to the long, steady decline of militancy. By
Steven Greenhouse.

LAST WORDS? WE HOPE SO, BUT NOT SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Now comes the Whiny Killer, Arizona's newest
criminal celebrity. On Wednesday, he makes ``The Arizona
Republic's'' front page. Later that day, Douglas Alan Smith calls a
press conference from jail and makes the airwaves anew.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Whiny Killer took the life of a father of
four. Now he takes what else he can _ our valuable time.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, Smith needs some help. He has developed this
burning desire to die. He wants a judge to order the state to lend
a hand with his suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the poor Whiny Killer. Pity him, please. Think of him in
prison, only 34 years old, life a neverending stretch to serve,
with epilepsy and painful seizures to boot. A jury found Smith
guilty of beating a 68-year-old man to death, but prosecutors
didn't seek the death penalty. Unlucky murderer. The irony's
practically killing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has absolutely no meaning,'' he went on for the
cameras. ``I can add this tiny bit of purpose to it by going ahead
with the death penalty rather than slowly deteriorating in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Two words. A rhetorical question.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Let the Whiny Killer plead, let his lawyers grandstand and make
motions galore. Let Smith beg for an IV full of poison, whatever he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   He should live, regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this will cost more than 30 grand a year for a cell on
Death Row. Yes, this will deny us the symmetry of a life for a
life. But Douglas Alan Smith's whims ceased to matter the moment
Samuel Ambrose's heart stopped beating.
</P>
<P>
   Which was the same moment the dead man's family began to matter
most.
</P>
<P>
   They are the ones we should listen to now, the only ones who
deserve our time and the justice system's ear. The old teacher,
Sam, left behind two sons and two daughters, and a wife of 40-some
years. Alice Ambrose is her name.
</P>
<P>
   We owe her and her children. Them, and only them.
</P>
<P>
   The widow answers the question reluctantly. She is not big on
press, not one for the public eye. Not one to whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted life without parole,'' Alice explains. ``The family,
we did not ask for or push for the death penalty. No one in the
family did that. We went along with the (county) attorney's office,
what they decided was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Those few sentences end any debate. Gag the Whiny Killer, and
fast. But leave space for him to breathe. For a good long time.
</P>
<P>
   I say this not to encourage suffering _ his _ but to prevent
more anguish _ theirs. What started three years ago with 60-odd
blows to the skull hasn't come close to ending for Samuel Ambrose's
family. Their troubles deepen with each new request, each court
date, each presumptuous quote like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like I know them,'' says Smith of the Ambroses.
``I sit in bed at night and think about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Ambrose can only laugh at the gall. ``I don't know him. I
never talked to him or anything like that. He's just the person who
killed my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more, nothing less. No one worth heeding.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Whiny Killer has been given enough consideration,
in court and out, by the survivors of the late Navy veteran. The
family has thought of Smith often, says Renee Infantolino,
Ambrose's daughter. Every minute spent considering the killer was a
minute they couldn't spend thinking about Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to the point where we feel it's never going to
end,'' the daughter says. ``That's part of why we never asked for
the death penalty. We didn't want to deal with this 10, 15 years
down the line. All we want to do is get it done, make sure he can't
do it again. That way we've done what our duty is, to make sure the
world is a little safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a practical decision, and just. In the end, it is all
that matters. Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Who deserves our time more? The family who was robbed, or the
killer who robbed them? &QL;

SURFING THE WEB AND SNARING AN OWED PENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
(lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 1,400 Americans are collecting pension benefits because
they found their names on an Internet site created by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency posted the names of about 8,600 people who have not
applied for benefits due to them from plans the agency now
administers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the people entitled to pensions receive
their full pension, but sometimes people move or forget to inform
past employers of their new address,'' said David Strauss,
executive director of the agency. ``The pension search helps us
find workers owed benefits who couldn't be located when their
pension plans are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of more than $4 million in benefits has been paid to
nearly 1,400 people since the agency started its Pension Search
Directory on the Internet 18 months ago, he said. The remaining
7,200 or so are owed nearly $13 million in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The pension beneficiaries who have been located through the
directory live in 40 states; 113 of them are from New York and 309
are from California.
</P>
<P>
   The average value of those recovered benefits, if paid
immediately in a lump sum, was $4,100, though most people will get
monthly annuity checks. Benefits range from a few dollars to more
than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accounts were for closed pension plans in which the
former workers could not be found, Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were participants in pension plans that the agency took
over because they did not have enough assets to pay all promised
benefits. The agency guarantees pensions up to about $34,000
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuously striving to ensure that workers receive
every dollar of their hard-earned pensions,'' said Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman, who is chairwoman of the Pension Benefit Guaranty
board.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet directory lists workers who have pension money
coming to them from terminated defined-benefit pension plans. The
directory address is http://search.pbgc.gov. As of Friday
afternoon, 98,358 name searches had been made, said Judy Welles,
the agency's senior spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The directory contains nearly 1,000 companies owing pension
benefits. They are concentrated in the transportation, machinery,
retail trade, apparel and financial-services industries.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who find their names on the Internet list must
supply additional information to verify their identity, a process
that typically takes four to six weeks, officials said. Monthly
checks start coming about two months later, they added.

WOODWARD DEFENSE FUND DEPLETED, SUPPORTERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY   AND ESTHER LEACH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Louise Woodward defense fund, which once was flush
with more than $450,000, is almost empty and cannot pay for her
defense in the wrongful-death suit pending against her, supporters
say.
</P>
<P>
   Without money for a lawyer, Woodward has not responded to the
suit brought by the parents of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, the
infant who was fatally injured while in her care. Her decision not
to challenge the suit within 20 days of its filing means that,
under court rules, she has waived her right to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quinn, a partner in the Liverpool firm of solicitors Quinn
and Melville, said Friday: ``We have been quoted six-figure sums to
defend the civil case, and the Woodwards are in no position to go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no significant sums of money left in the trust fund,
and we have asked people to stop donating. The purpose of the trust
fund was not to defend a civil case.''
</P>
<P>
   Although EF Au Pair, the agency that brought Woodward to the
United States, paid for her defense in the criminal trial, Woodward
agreed to use the money from the fund to help pay for her appeal.
The fund has also been used to pay expenses the former au pair's
parents incurred flying back and forth from England while she was
in jail here before and during her trial.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward returned to England last month after the state Supreme
Judicial Court upheld her manslaughter conviction sentence of the
279 days she had already served.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' lawyer, Fredric L. Ellis, said that he will ask US
District Judge William G. Young to determine how much Woodward
should pay the Eappens in damages. Ellis said he wants to prevent
Woodward from profiting from Matthew's death by selling her story
in a book or movie deal. But he has admitted it may be difficult to
enforce an award from a US court in England.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have said they will donate any money they receive to
a charitable trust they set up to fight child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Woodwards' closest friends and staunchest supporters,
Sandra McCabe, also said the family does not have the money to
fight another legal battle. ``People think the family have lots of
money, but it has all gone (to America) in legal fees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family are not making any statements,'' she added. ``Their
solicitors have said it all. I have faith that one day the truth
will come out and Louise will be seen to be innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Woodward is considering which university she will
attend and hopes it will be in the London area.

   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ After six days of standoff, a
familiar pattern has developed in the pasture opposite Drumcree
Church here. By day, it is a quiet, bucolic scene. Children run
through the fields and old men tell war stories in tents that dot
the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, however, the old men and the children have
departed. The field unleashes the anger of young men who hurl
insults, rocks, and even bombs across the barbed wire at the police
and British soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as it is, the violence spawned by the confrontation
between Protestants who want to march through a Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown and the security forces on duty to stop
them is not as bad as it was during a similar situation here two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for that difference is the refusal of the two
main Protestant loyalist paramilitary groups to get involved, which
means that violence is sporadic and poorly organized.
</P>
<P>
   There have been nightly rioting, carjackings, and firebombings,
to be sure. Isolated roadblocks have sprung up, but only
temporarily. And despite expectations of mayhem this weekend, when
the marching nears its peak, the disruption is not on the scale of
1996, when Northern Ireland was paralyzed by violence orchestrated
by the loyalist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that prospect two years ago, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary lifted its blockade and let the Orangemen march after
beating Catholic protesters off the Garvaghy Road. That
capitulation touched off the worst rioting in years. Today,
however, the police chief, Ronnie Flanagan, is convinced that his
force can hold the line, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair has
lent more soldiers to that effort.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are more confident this year because the two
main loyalist paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defense Association
and the Ulster Volunteer Force, support the Good Friday agreement,
which stipulates that their members will be released from prison
within the next two years. The two groups are wary of wrecking the
release of their prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, individual members of the Ulster Defense Association and
Ulster Volunteer Force are suspected of involvement in the
accompanying violence around Drumcree. While acknowledging that
individuals have been involved in violence, David Ervine, leader of
the Progressive Unionist Party, the political wing of the Ulster
Volunteer Force, said the violence would be ``far worse'' if the
organizations joined in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Shankill Road in West Belfast, a loyalist
hotbed, has been quiet because of the control exercised by loyalist
leaders, Ervine said. East Belfast, another area under the control
of loyalist paramilitary, has seen violence, but not nearly as much
as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But this is little consolation to the people who live in places
like Collingwood, a middle-class subdivision just a few miles up
the road from Drumcree. About 30 armed men, some with hoods on
their heads, invaded the quiet cul-de-sac at about 1 a.m.
Wednesday, sneaking in through a hole in a fence that had been
erected to ward off such attacks. One of them repeatedly fired a
shotgun into the air and, as happened two years ago, the homes were
pelted with Molotov cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Dowds ran out of his house in his pajamas and picked up a
garden hose to douse flames pouring from the living room of a
neighbor, Michael Lavery. It was only after he and other neighbors
helped the Laverys and their 2-year-old daughter escape the flames
that Dowds looked back and saw his own house was on fire. Dowds
collapsed with chest pains, while neighbors helped his elderly
disabled wife, Joan, out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Being English and Protestant did not save the Dowds from the
wrath of a mob that professes to be loyal to the English monarch
and the Protestant faith.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the Orange Order began its siege here after the
British government refused to let it march down the Catholic
Garvaghy Road. Since then, the terror inflicted on the people in
Collingwood has been repeated dozens of times across Northern
Ireland. It is a form of intimidation to force people from their
homes that occurs around this time each year, when Protestant
groups parade to commemorate Protestant King William of Orange's
1690 victory over Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
   While overall violence has declined, the bitter standoff at
Drumcree has exacerbated this annual ritual of hatred, according to
Glyn Roberts, spokesman for Families Against Intimidation and
Terror. Roberts said that while exact figures are not yet
available, more than 100 people had been intimidated out of their
homes in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The homes in Collingwood were targeted because the owners are
Catholic, as have been most victims of intimidation, said Roberts.
But Protestant police officers and their families have also been
singled out in retaliation for police keeping the peace at Drumcree
and standing up to loyalist thugs elsewhere. An off-duty police
officer and his 11-year-old son were beaten by a loyalist mob in
Londonderry. A Protestant family in Dungannon was burned out
because vigilantes deemed them too friendly with too many
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Brid Rodgers, the newly elected assembly member for the area,
visited the Collingwood residents to promise them 24-hour
protection and fix the hole in the fence where the intruders
entered.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers says thugs who attack innocents under the cover of
darkness are operating with a political agenda. ``These tactics of
intimidation and terror are being used in an orchestrated way by a
small minority to accomplish what they couldn't at the ballot
box,'' she said. ``They are trying to destroy the Good Friday
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people thought that the 71 percent of those who endorsed
the agreement in May voted for a new era of accommodation between
Protestant unionists who want to remain in the United Kingdom and
Catholic nationalists who aspire to unity with the Irish Republic.
But ancient tribal hatreds have cast a dark shadow over what had
been a promising few months.
</P>
<P>
   Orange Order leaders insist their protest is peaceful and that
they cannot be held responsible for the violence carried out by
sympathizers. But Sean Dowds counters that the Orange Order cannot
wash its hands of the terror visited on him and his neighbors. Four
police officers were seriously wounded Friday by a nail bomb thrown
from the Orangemen's camp at Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   While Orange Order leaders agreed to indirect talks Friday in an
effort to avert the crisis, they have refused to have direct
negotiations with the Garvaghy Road residents because a leader of
the residents, Breandan MacCionnaith, is a former member of the
Irish Republican Army who was convicted of taking part in the
bombing of a British army veterans hall here.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this week, the local Orange Order leader, Denis
Watson, was seen having an extended conversation with Kenny
McClinton, who as a loyalist assassin killed two men and served 16
years in prison before having what he calls a spiritual conversion.
Also seen chatting with Orangemen outside Drumcree Church was Mark
``Swinger'' Fulton, the reputed leader of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force, which murdered a Catholic man here in April and has carried
out some of the most notorious murders in Northern Ireland over the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was defensive when asked if he was being hypocritical in
refusing to talk to MacCionnaith, who was convicted of taking part
in a bombing in which no one was hurt, while having no qualms about
talking to McClinton, a double murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said McClinton ``is a repentant terrorist. There is a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence and disruption is expected to peak this weekend, as
thousands of Orangemen and sympathizers converge here and the
marching season climaxes Monday with dozens of parades all over
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In Collingwood, meanwhile, the ``For Sale'' signs have sprung
up. The local councillor, Kieran McGeown, visited Friday, trying to
reassure residents. ``These are professional people, good people,''
McGeown said. ``If people like that go, we're in trouble.''

FEW LEADS IN STABBING OF BOY, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Conn. _ Police said Friday they had few leads in the
savage stabbing death of a 7-year-old boy in his mother's home
Thursday and appealed to the public for help in apprehending two
masked intruders blamed for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators distributed pictures of a man's black, digital
Casio watch, which a family member said was ripped off one of the
men while he struggled with the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor Police Captain Peter McDermott Friday said that three
people had already called investigators to say they recognized the
watch. It did not appear that those calls would develop into any
significant leads.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said neighbors observed a dark-colored sport
utility vehicle in the area at the time of the early morning
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, (the murder) is not going to be solved if it is
just up to the police,'' said McDermott. ``We are going to need the
public and the media. We have come up with a very vague description
of two men based on the mother's account. We have no facial
features. They were wearing masks. I am praying, but I am not
anticipating an arrest soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they didn't believe the attack was random, but added
they didn't yet have a motive for the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, 30-year-old Tammi Cuyler, dialed 911 at 2:30
a.m. Thursday and reported a violent attack in her Lovell Avenue
Home. Jarrell Cuyler, 7, was pronounced dead at the scene. His
throat was slashed.
</P>
<P>
   His 3-year-old sister, Lindsey, received injuries to her neck
and wrists and was taken to a local hospital, where she was in
stable condition. A third child, an 18-month-old nephew, was also
in the room, but was unharmed, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammi Cuyler told relatives she heard a noise in the house and
went to investigate. Two men burst into the home and one pinned
Cuyler to the floor while the other attacked the children, she told
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler struggled with the men while hearing her son ask, ``What
are you doing?'' and her daughter scream. During the struggle she
tore off a watch and glove worn by one of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler is a supervisor at the state Department of Children and
Families. Her husband, Arnold Cuyler, lives in nearby Bristol and
works for Fleet Bank. The couple is separated.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents were interviewed for several hours by police, who
described them as ``cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of 30 investigators from the Windsor and state police
departments followed leads and searched the area in and around the
home Friday. Dr. Henry Lee, the noted forensic specialist who works
out of the state crime lab, was also called in to help with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor is ordinarily a quiet suburb of Hartford, which is five
miles to the south on Interstate 91. Cuyler and her children had
lived in the neighborhood of neat, middle-class homes since last
year.

 &HT;    Apple ventures into real world after Macworld
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Apple Computer Inc. has enjoyed three days of near
euphoria with the Macintosh community at the MacWorld Expo this
week, and now re-enters the real world where market-share size
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The months ahead will reveal how far the momentum created by
fast, new computers and a mold-breaking new product for consumers
will carry the company, Apple watchers agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give Steve Jobs a lot of credit for creating a
lot of buzz and raising the banner of Apple,'' said Steve Dube of
Wasserstein &AMP; Pirella of New York. ``He's slowing the erosion of
Mac customers to Windows and that's very critical. But whether he
can reverse it is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple stock set a 52-week high this week after Jobs, Apple's
co-founder and interim chief executive, told a Macworld audience of
about 3,000 that Apple would report its third profitable quarter in
a row. Shares closed Friday at $32.06 1/4, up 37 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Following strong sales of powerful new computers based on the G3
PowerPC chip, Apple will release the iMac next month.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's fortunes are of interest to Austin's strong Macintosh
community, which ranges from thousands at the University of Texas
to home users to graphics designers to companies that sell products
for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Through weeks of adept marketing and controlled access to the
iMac computer, Jobs and Apple have sparked considerable buzz based
on the $1,299 consumer PC.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Austinite George Cole tried to touch an iMac
that Apple demonstrated in Dallas last month, employees blocked
him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `No, no, no','' Cole quoted them as saying. `` `That's the
iMac Steve Jobs used when he demonstrated it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They're thinking: Smithsonian,'' Cole said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   First, Apple must get in it the Smith's home and the Jones's
home and millions of other homes.
</P>
<P>
   At least one observer says that is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be the most successful product launch in
the history of the industry,'' said David Moser, vice president of
MacCentral, a World Wide Web-based site that closely follows Apple.
</P>
<P>
   While it is several hundred dollars more expensive than entry
level machines from other companies, Mac supporters note iMac
features that competitors' machines don't have.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor and system unit are in one box. Jobs claims, and
cites Byte magazine tests as evidence, that the computer's 233
megahertz PowerPC processor is faster than Intel Corp.'s Pentium II
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for Internet use, the iMac has an ethernet connection
for high-speed data transmission that far surpasses the capacity of
conventional modems and telephone lines. Until buyers have access
to cable modems or special telephone lines, the iMac will be able
to connect at 56.6 klbs. Besides the home, Jobs and Apple hope the
iMac will appeal to schools,as well as families, which would help
slow erosion of Apple's share of the education market to products
made by Dell Computer Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and other PC
companies.
</P>
<P>
   At MacWorld Friday, Heather Hurley came out of a sparsely
attended work session for educators with a renewed sense of
excitement about the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old third-grade teacher in Concord, Mass., has three
Macs in her classroom and just got a PowerMac with one of the new
G3 processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them,'' said Hurley, one of 15 people who sat through a
presentation on using Macs in the classroom. ``They're just really
easy to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Like school districts around the country, the Concord district
has debated whether to stay with Macintosh, Hurley said. Concord's
decision was to stand by the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several parents who don't necessarily agree with the
decision the school district made to go all Macs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and Apple executives agree that Apple's fate hinges to
a large extent on the availability of software for the Mac. Jobs,
in his keynote Wednesday, said more than 170 software titles had
been introduced or planned since he unveiled the iMac in May.
</P>
<P>
   It is a symbol of the how dramatically Apple's world has changed
in the past year that the biggest complaint vendors had was the
show's location.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to move it to New York after 13 years in Boston did
not sit well with several businesses who spent thousands of dollars
_ tens of thousands in some cases _ for floor space in the huge
Jacob Javits Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did us no favor moving here,'' said Dudley Baker, who was
on duty at a small booth rented by National Instruments of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which recently introduced new data-acquisition
boards for scientists and engineers, said the company has many more
customers along Route 128 near Boston than it does in the New York
area.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a large square booth in front of shelves of unsold
software and other Mac products, John Chouinard, manager of
Computer Town, which is a large store in Nashua, N.H., estimated
that his sales fell 20 percent from last summer's show in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of sad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Show organizers declined to disclose the attendance, although
one official told the Boston Globe only that attendance was ``north
of 30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's show in Boston drew between 45,000 and 48,000.

   NEW YORK _ The blue fliers began appearing in the middle of last
month, on university campuses and in hiring halls from Vienna to
Salzburg to Innsbruck. ``If you can read this,'' the brochures
beckoned in English, ``have we got a deal for you!!!''
</P>
<P>
   The advertiser is the New York City Board of Education, and the
``unique chance'' it is offering to Austrians is full-time
employment, for at least a year, as mathematics and science
teachers in high schools in all five boroughs. The starting salary
is $30,000, airfare not included.
</P>
<P>
   In less a month, nearly 300 Austrians have called the Ministry
of Education in Vienna requesting applications, and, with
interviews starting in two weeks, administrators predict that as
many as 50 could end up standing in front of city classrooms when
schools reopen in September.
</P>
<P>
   States with growing student populations, like California and
Texas, routinely recruit in states graduating too many teachers,
like Indiana and Minnesota, but New York's is among the first
large-scale international recruiting missions.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, the nation's largest district, with 1.1 million
students and 65,000 teachers, has struggled in recent years to find
thousands of candidates qualified to teach math and science.
Austria has long fretted over what to do with its surplus of
hundreds of teachers trained in those very subjects who cannot find
work. The disparity exists, in part, because Austrian schools do
not compete with a thriving computer industry that has
cherry-picked so many American students who might otherwise have
considered teaching, and in part because American education majors
rarely specialize in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dr. Alfred Posamentier, a professor of mathematics
education at the City College of New York, who taught education
courses in Austria on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1990. Earlier this
year, he had the brainstorm that Austria and New York City could
help relieve each other's staffing quandaries. By last month, plans
for a pilot program were in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Elke Rogl, 26, who studied mathematics and physics at the
University of Vienna but has been frustrated in her bid to find a
full-time teaching job, says her best chance lies in New York, of
all places.
</P>
<P>
   Once the New York City Board of Education accepts her
credentials, which administrators consider likely, she will need
only to persuade an interviewer at board headquarters in downtown
Brooklyn that she is fluent in English. She will have her
opportunity during a 15-minute video teleconference from Vienna
during the last week in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think math is a universal language,'' said Ms. Rogl, who
like many Austrian children began learning English soon after she
began speaking German. ``They will understand me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she felt daunted by the hardscrabble reputation and
daunting diversity of New York City schools, whose total population
is equal to that of the entire Austrian school system, Ms. Rogl
betrayed no qualms. After all, she said, Austria's schools have
been flooded in recent years by immigrants from the former
Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In seizing on Posamentier's idea, the city school system is
expanding on a nascent trend. While visiting Berlin in the spring,
for example, Posamentier was surprised to encounter teachers from
Houston recruiting German math and science teachers. Houston has
also been scouring Mexico for bilingual teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works,'' said Gary Barton, the deputy director of
human resources for the New York City board, ``I see no reason we
can't expand to other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Kurt Scholz, the president of the Vienna Board of
Education, who asked that he be described to American readers as
``the Rudy Crew of Austria,'' the exchange is about a lot more than
the law of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Scholz says that in helping shepherd the recruiting effort, he
feels he is returning a favor to New York for taking in so many
Austrian refugees during World War II. They included the parents of
a not-yet-conceived Alfred Posamentier, who lost all four of his
grandparents to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York preserved the best of Viennese culture and history
during the war,'' said Scholz, who recently visited Crew in
Brooklyn. ``We're paying back the debt on the one hand. We're also
saying that these two countries got in touch during a dark period
in this century, and thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a project would seem to pose a logistical nightmare,
particularly given the few short weeks that officials have to bring
it together. Board officials, working with the Austrian consul
general in New York, are confident they can secure visas for all
the airlifted teachers, who would be permitted to work under a
special classification as ``research scholars,'' allowing them to
stay up to three years. They will not, therefore, need green cards.
</P>
<P>
   As for the teachers' qualifications, Barton, the board hiring
official, said that the education and training for aspiring
teachers in Austria often outstrips that many of the teachers
already working in New York. Anyone studying to be a teacher in
Austria, for example, must major in two related subjects _ say,
mathematics and biology _ and then spend a full year as an
apprentice teacher.

 &HT;    State Board of Education to sell Disney stock
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Score one for the folks who believe the
marketing wizards who gave America the Mouseketeers have become
conscienceless profiteers.
</P>
<P>
   In a battle over money and morals, the State Board of Education
voted Friday to sell its $43 million stake in the Walt Disney Co.
The entertainment conglomerate, critics said, has become a purveyor
of cinematic sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-4 vote was the end result of an effort initiated by the
American Family Association of Texas, which sent board members
highlights of the films ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Chasing Amy,''
not-for-kid films produced by Disney subsidiary Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Board members who voted for divestiture said it was the right
thing to do for money and moral reasons. Richard Neill, R-Fort
Worth, noted that Disney stock value has dropped 17 percent in the
past two months
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished we would have gotten out two months ago,'' said
Neill, a board member honored last month by the Texas Christian
Coalition. ``We would have saved millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's stock could become less attractive if more people
become concerned about the company's adult-oriented movies, Neill
has said.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate that began Thursday in a committee, board
Chairman Jack Christie, R-Houston, also made it clear that the
decision was aimed at driving home ``a message to Miramax . . .
that the public in general has had enough of exposing children to
the violence and explicitness in these movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more school shootings do you want before we have to
do something to reverse that trend?''
</P>
<P>
   Disney officials took a hands-off approach to the board's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't comment on the stock market or individual investment
strategies,'' said Claudia Peters, the company's director of
corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Disney does comment, however, when critics assail the reputation
the company has cultivated for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Walt Disney Company produces more family entertainment
than any other company in the world,'' said Peters. ``And any
products marked with the Disney brand name are suitable for all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Products from subsidiaries such as Miramax, she acknowledged,
can be more adult-oriented. They are always so labelled, Peters
said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Mary Helen Berlanga, D-Corpus Christi, said it is
parents' responsibility _ not the board's _ to take action to keep
kids away from unsuitable entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not let our children view movies like those where
Arnold Schwarzenegger appears where there is so much violence,''
she said, adding, however, that the board should not mix social
policy with investment decisions. The vote also drew criticism from
the Texas Freedom Network, which said, in effect, that the board
showed it had a small mind, after all. The Austin-based group works
to counter the political efforts of social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that the board has put these narrow
political considerations ahead of the education of the children of
Texas,'' said Richard Levy of Austin, a network board member who
said the board will be hard-pressed to replace the Disney stock
with investments of equal potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not taking a moral position, but a political position
advanced by a right-wing organization and imposing it on the
taxpayers of Texas,'' Levy added.
</P>
<P>
   Board members who opposed the proposal said investment decisions
should be bottom-line oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not make investment decisions on any criteria other
than financial merit,'' said Will Davis, D-Austin. ``If you do, you
are going to make serious mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney stock has performed well for the state's Permanent
School Fund, Davis added, noting it had produced a 108 percent
return over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Constitution, Davis reminded colleagues, requires
state officials to base investment decisions solely on financial
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues people can get uptight about,'' he
said, ``but when you start trying to draw parameters under other
terms . . . then you start making moral judgments, social judgments
and other types of judgments that some of us will support and some
of us will criticize.''
</P>
<P>
   But board member David Bradley, R-Beaumont, said the 15-member
panel has the ultimate authority to decide how to invest the
Permanent School Fund, which now tops $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elected representatives, representing districts and
constituents. They have empowered us to make decisions. That's a
responsibility each of us weighs pretty heavily. The buck does stop
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Alma Allen, D-Houston, voted against divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a vote to divest is political hypocrisy for this
board,'' she said, noting the holdings in alcoholic beverage and
casino companies. Allen also said her vote was driven by a desire
to avoid personal hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be voting to divest. Two weeks from today I will be
at Disneyland,'' she said. ``That's where my grandchildren want to
go, and I'm going to take all five. Last year we went to Disney
World. And we have been there twice. And I just spent $4,000 to go
next week,'' she said. ``So it is hypocrisy for me to cast a vote
to divest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to be pure and clean and void of sins let's
totally divest and get out of the investment business all
together,'' she added. ``If we are in the business of investing,
let's be in the business of investing.''

 &HT;    Lucent workers reject union contract
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Workers in Norcross have voted overwhelmingly to
reject their union's tentative contract with Lucent Technologies,
increasing the chances of another confrontation at the bargaining
table and a possible strike.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the contract is rejected depends on whether a majority
of Lucent workers in the nation vote no, but indications are of
grass-roots resentment _ especially among older workers _ of what
is seen as an anemic pension package.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Communications Workers of America, which
negotiated the agreement, have predicted the contract's
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly surprised,'' said Drew Clark, international
staff representative for the CWA's District 3, which covers the
Southeast. ``A lot of people had given me the impression that they
were dissatisfied, but I didn't talk to anybody who said they would
definitely vote against it.''
</P>
<P>
   CWA's national leadership has expressed satisfaction with the
five-year deal, which includes an 18.75 percent increase in wages,
as well as a freeze in worker costs for prescription drugs and
doctor visits. The agreement also calls for higher pension payments
_ but the increase was insufficient, according to Norcross workers.
</P>
<P>
   An average worker with 30 years of service who retired this year
would be paid $1,042 a month, said Leon Gussick, president of CWA
local 3263, which represents workers in Norcross. The contract
called for an average worker with 30 years of service to be paid
$1,185 per month on retiring in 2003. He said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks feel that as well as the company is doing, they should
have given more at the bargaining table. These are the people who
produce the product and satisfy the customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent last year had net income of $541 million on $26 billion
in revenue. The New Jersey-based company, spun off from AT&AMP;T two
years ago, has about 7,300 employees in metro Atlanta. About 3,620
of those workers are represented by the CWA.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the company forged the contract in the early hours
of May 31, about 90 minutes after the start of a strike. If this
deal is tossed out, union and company would head back to the
bargaining table _ confronting the possibility of another, more
serious strike. Gussick said he is discouraged but will wait to see
how the rest of Lucent workers vote. If the national contract is
rejected, the CWA would seek a better agreement, he said. ``I think
the company would sit down and bargain with us. But how far they'd
go with additional demands is another story.''
</P>
<P>
   The CWA represents 25,000 Lucent workers. About 21,000 Lucent
employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.

WOMAN'S TIP EARNS $34,000 REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; attn.: Kansas)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AMY GRAVES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Her tip made possible the successful end of a
months-long manhunt for a killer. But Mary King isn't talking now.
</P>
<P>
   King, of Boston, was awarded $34,062 this week for tipping off
investigators looking for the man responsible for the murders of
three people in Salina, Kans., in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   King, then living in Quincy, a Boston suburb, called ``America's
Most Wanted'' in November 1996 after seeing a familiar face on the
television show. The man they wanted, she said, was at the St.
Francis homeless shelter in Boston, where she worked as a
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Her call led to the capture of Alan Eugene White, now serving a
life sentence for the beating deaths of Dolores McKim, 80, her
daughter, Carol Abercrombie, 56, and Abercrombie's grandson,
Christopher, 5. They were killed in McKim's home.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings so shocked residents of the city of 50,000 that
they started raising money as a reward for anyone who could lead to
the killer's capture.
</P>
<P>
   Except for $5,000 from a state fund, all the money came from
private sources, Salina Police Chief Jim Hill said Thursday. ``It
ranged from children bringing in change to larger donations from
local corporations'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Several people attempted to claim the reward, including White's
parents, who cooperated with police by providing blood so that DNA
collected at the crime scene could be tested to determine if it
matched. Their claim was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Salina city commissioners voted to give King all but
$10,000 of the $44,062 raised. The rest went to White's prison
cellmate, who aided in the investigation, Hill said. Kansas prison
officials are not releasing the cellmate's name, but Hill said his
reward will be used to pay restitution to victims of the property
crime for which he was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   King was given the money because she was first with the
information, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called immediately, and actually told (investigators) what
bed he was sleeping in,'' he said. Before the show was over that
night, Boston police had White, 28, under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly owe a lot to Mary King for leading us to Alan
White,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   But an end to her role in the case is something King would
probably call a reward in itself, according to her lawyer, Ann
Palmieri of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Palmieri, who learned of the reward Tuesday when called by a
Kansas reporter, said her client has not told her how she plans to
spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   King, 40, has shied away from speaking publicly since the arrest
and no longer works at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always said that she's very afraid for herself and any
repercussions from him,'' Palmieri said.

WORLD CUP BOOTS TOUR DE FRANCE INTO IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people of France are not fools; they realize they can handle
only so much hoopla at one time.
</P>
<P>
   So, to make way for the soccer frenzy that's going on as France
gets ready to face Brazil in Sunday's World Cup final, the Tour de
France is stepping aside. Way aside. In fact, all the way off the
mainland and into Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The 189 riders _ 21 teams of nine cyclists each _ kick off the
three-week race Saturday with a short time trial in downtown
Dublin. Then it's a 112-mile circuit race in Dublin Sunday, and a
125-mile race from Enniscorthy to Cork Monday before the riders
pack their bikes onto an airplane and head to France to continue
the Tour there.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's race, called a prologue, riders will set off
individually at one-minute intervals on the 3.5-mile course to race
against the clock. And even though it's not considered one of the
race's 21 stages, it sets up the almost-2,400-mile race; the
winning rider will wear the yellow jersey at the start of Sunday's
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, is whether he can hang on to it. That's
doubtful, since there is no clear-cut heir apparent to the leader's
jersey that German rider Jan Ullrich took last year.
</P>
<P>
   So over the next three weeks, as the Tour winds its way on a
counterclockwise circuit of France, traveling through the Pyrenees,
Alps, and wine country, it's a safe bet that several riders will
wear the yellow jersey before the race finishes in Paris Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage Ullrich has is that he's just 24; another is that
one of his teammates is Bjarne Riis, the Dane who won the Tour in
1996, when Ullrich finished second. The year before that, five-time
champ Miguel Indurain won the race, but no one since has been such
a dominant force.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich's fitness is in question, though. He gained weight and
was out of shape over the winter, and only recently seemed to be
back in racing form. Team director Walter Goldfroot stood up for
the defending champ, saying critics should compare Ullrich with
former Tour champions Indurain or Greg LeMond, both of whom were
said to battle weight problems.
</P>
<P>
   Others to watch include France's Richard Virenque, who finished
second last year; Italy's Marco Pantani, who won the Tour of Italy
this spring and finished third in the Tour last year; France's
Laurent Jalabert, who won the world title in the time trial last
year; and Spaniard Abraham Olano, who is on Indurain's former team.
</P>
<P>
   While no one on the American-based US Postal Service team is apt
to break the top 10, it was one of only three teams to finish last
year's race with its nine-man roster intact.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team features four Americans, including George
Hincapie, who won the national championship in Philadelphia last
month. His teammates are Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass.;
Frankie Andreu of Deerborn, Mich., a new team member but a Tour
veteran; Marty Jemison of Salt Lake City; Dariusz Baranowski of
Poland; Viatcheslav Ekimov of Russia; Peter Meinert of Denmark; and
Pascal Derame and Jean-Cyril Robin, both from France. Robin
finished 15th overall in the Tour last year.

ADOPTION RULING ANGERS CHILDREN'S RIGHTS ADVOCATES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., Pa) (js) 
By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a ruling that has angered advocates for
children's rights in adoptions, an appeals court in Montgomery
County, Md., has upheld a decision that allows a young boy to be
returned to his mother even though she was previously convicted of
murdering another one of her children.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland Court of Special Appeals said on Thursday that the
trial judge ruled properly in denying another woman's efforts to
adopt the boy, Cornilous, who is now 2, concluding that the
circumstances that caused the mother to kill _ _ postpartum
depression _ no longer posed a threat to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Latrena Pixley of Washington, who is now 26, pleaded
guilty to second-degree murder after suffocating her 6-week-old
daughter, Nakya, and dumping the infant's body in a trash bin. Her
sentence, five to 15 years in prison, was suspended on the
condition that she serve three years of weekends in a halfway
house, followed by probation.
</P>
<P>
   During her probation, Ms. Pixley used stolen Social Security
numbers to obtain credit cards, which she used. She pleaded uilty
to fraud charges and was sentenced to two months in jail and
another month in the halfway house.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after the birth of Cornilous, her fourth child by
four different fathers, Ms. Pixley asked a Montgomery County police
officer, Laura Blankman, to care for him. A year later, Ms.
Blankman tried to adopt the child, arguing that Ms. Pixley was an
unfit mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort was blocked last year by a state court, which
ruled that the child's reunion with his mother was ``in his best
interest on a longer-term basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hall Jr., a lawyer for Ms. Pixley, said on Friday that Ms.
Pixley was ``very pleased'' by the court's ruling, calling it ``one
of the final pieces for getting full-time care and custody of her
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pixley, who must live at least another year in the halfway
house, has two other young sons. One lives with his paternal
grandparents, and the other with a foster family in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Poster, a lawyer for Ms. Blankman, did not return a
telephone call, seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   William Pierce, president of the National Council for Adoption,
a nonprofit group based in Washington that assumed some of Ms.
Blankman's legal costs, called the ruling a concession to the
``misguided panacea of family preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a child who has a safe and good home with an
employed police officer will be torn away and turned over to a
convicted child murderer,'' Pierce said. ``This is quite a
commentary on the state of America's judicial system, and sends a
chilling message to anyone in the country who considers stepping
forward to help a child in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Hochman, a spokesman for the National Adoption Center, a
Philadelphia organization that helps children in minority groups
and those with special needs find adoption, said that any case in
which a child is returned to a biological parent ``would give
pause'' to people seeking adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptive parents should know, she added, that until biological
parents give up a child for adoption or a court rules against them,
a child is always eligible to be removed from foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the three-judge appeals panel, Judge Joseph Murphy
concluded that Judge Michael Mason of the Montgomery County Circuit
Court was correct in calling Ms. Pixley ``a selfish con artist
whose parental rights should have been terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy also ruled that he was more persuaded by Ms. Pixley's
demonstrating that ``she is now free of the mental illness she was
suffering from when she murdered her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he wrote, Ms. Blankman's objections to the decision
to return Cornilous to Ms. Pixley were correctly overcome by the
judge's determination that the boy did not risk abuse or neglect by
his mother _ the only conditions that the law recognizes to prevent
their reunification.

BOMBING INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, SAUDIS INSIST
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Saudi government insisted on Friday that the
investigation of a 1996 terrorist bombing that killed 19 U.S.
airmen in Saudi Arabia had not collapsed, and that Saudi law
enforcement officers were cooperating with their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The assertions made here by Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd, the
youngest son of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and a member of the royal
cabinet, contradicted the account of U.S. officials, who have said
in recent weeks that the investigation has broken down because of
disputes with the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   Out of frustration, the FBI has quietly pulled out the dozens of
investigators who were initially sent to the scene of the bombing,
at the Khobar Towers apartment complex in eastern Saudi Arabia,
leaving behind only a single agent as a liaison to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cooperation in this regard between the two governments is
ongoing and continuing because it is of the utmost importance for
both countries,'' Abdul Aziz said at a news conference called after
he met earlier on Friday with President Clinton in the White House.
``Investigations of this nature tend to be complex and require a
lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   While he said he knew of ``no misunderstanding'' between the two
countries over the investigation, the prince's remarks did seem to
suggest that jurisdictional disputes between the FBI and Saudi law
enforcement officials might be responsible for reports of ill
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to emphasize that the event occurred in Saudi Arabia,
and the investigation is the responsibility of Saudi Arabian law
enforcement,'' he said. ``The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has spared no
effort to apprehend the perpetrators of this crime.''
</P>
<P>
   As the case has languished, families of the U.S. victims of the
bombing have begun to complain openly about the slow pace of the
inquiry. They have asserted that the case is not being pursued
aggressively because of U.S. fears of offending Saudi Arabia, an
important oil supplier.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that the Khobar Towers investigation was not
on the agenda for Friday's 35-minute meeting between the prince and
Clinton, and that the conversation in the White House dealt instead
with the need for continued close ties between the United States
and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The later news conference was unusual if only because the Saudi
Embassy in Washington rarely sponsors gatherings for U.S. news
organizations. Saudi officials rarely comment publicly on delicate
topics like the Khobar Towers investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudi government seemed eager to provide a public
showcase for Abdul Aziz, who is only 24 years old and is making his
first official visit to Washington as a member of the Saudi
Cabinet. He is described as a favorite among King Fahd's many
children.
</P>
<P>
   The prince denied reports that the king, who is in his mid-70s,
is seriously ill. The king suffered a stroke in 1995 and was
hospitalized earlier this year after tests and treatment for what
was reported to be an inflamed gall bladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's health, thank God, is good,'' the prince said.
``In fact, it's excellent. He performs normal duties, although he
has some pain in his knees. He continues his government
responsibilities in a normal manner, everyday.''

AUSTIN SHOOTING FOCUSES ATTENTION ON ARRESTS OF 1,600 CONCEALED GUN
CARRIERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional ending) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 1,600 Texans with permits to carry
concealed handguns have been arrested for state crimes since the
``right-to-carry'' law went into effect in 1996, the Department of
Public Safety said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came with confirmation that an Austin
permit-holder, charged with murder this week after gunning down a
suspected car burglar near the Sixth Street entertainment district,
is the fifth licensee to be accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200,000 Texans are licensed to carry concealed handguns.
Licensees have been arrested a total of 2,203 times, though not all
the crimes involved weapons and many of the charges were dismissed,
the DPS said. Nearly 600 of the arrests were for federal or
out-of-state charges and non-criminal matters such as tax
delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law find the numbers a confirmation of their
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been well over 1,000 individuals who had permits
who have been charged with crimes _ everything from criminal
mischief to disorderly conduct to attempted murder,'' said Travis
County Constable Bruce Elfant, who campaigned against the
concealed-carry law that was passed by the 1995 Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that with as little as 10 hours of training,
we're expecting them to exercise the same level of judgment as
police officers. I don't think that's realistic, and it's not good
public policy,'' said Elfant, a spokesman for Texans Against Gun
Violence.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious charges compiled by the DPS include 97 counts
of aggravated assault, 26 counts of aggravated sexual assault, 24
counts of assault causing bodily injury and nine counts of
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Although one license has been revoked and three suspended by DPS
because of murder allegations, no license-holder has ever actually
been tried for murder _ a fact that gun-rights supporters cite as
proof the Texas law provides for adequate screening and training,
even in use of deadly force.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Houston, a state district judge was cleared by a
grand jury in the shooting death of a mentally ill homeless man who
attacked him. The judge had pursued the man for stealing another
lawyer's briefcase. The case was referred to the grand jury with no
charges.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jerry Patterson, R-Pasadena, the lifetime National
Rifle Association member who authored the concealed-weapon law, on
Friday predicted the Austin shooting would not produce an
indictment nor cause legislative tinkering in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Killed with two .380-caliber gunshot wounds to the back was Eric
Demart Smith, 20. Unarmed and carrying no stolen items, Smith was
slain in a downtown alley about 2 a.m. Wednesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Free in lieu of $100,000 bond after being jailed on a murder
charge is Paul A. Saustrup, 33, a self-employed mechanic with a
permit to carry a concealed handgun.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney said this week that Saustrup was lawfully defending
his girlfriend's property when he shot Smith, whom they caught
breaking into the woman's Chevrolet Suburban. Saustrup used deadly
force after Smith refused to submit to a citizen's arrest and made
verbal death threats and menacing gestures, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Austin police and Travis County prosecutors said Saustrup
acted unreasonably. Citing the fact that Saustrup pursued Smith
three blocks before shooting him in the back, they charged Saustrup
with murder, a crime punishable by up to life in prison.
Prosecutors will ask a grand jury to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   At least three other Texans licensed to carry handguns have been
cleared of wrongdoing after killing someone; disposition of a
fourth case could not immediately be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Saustrup's case likewise should end with a grand jury declining
to indict him, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I have done what this gentleman did? Probably not. But
what he did was lawful,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of lessons here,'' he added. ``The first
one is, don't steal cars. The second lesson is, if you have a
license and you shoot somebody, you will spend some time explaining
it to a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Saustrup faces a first-degree felony charge of ``knowingly and
intentionally'' killing Smith, said Assistant District Attorney
Buddy Meyer. He added that Saustrup invoked his right against
self-incrimination in refusing to talk to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Saustrup attorney Sandra Ritz described her client as ``a normal
guy, a good kid, one of four brothers who pretty much raised
themselves.'' She said 45-50 letters from friends attesting to
Saustrup's ``good character'' showed up at her law office
unsolicited within hours of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On Austin talk-radio shows and Internet chat rooms, Saustrup has
been portrayed both as a vigilante and as a hero. The fact that the
fleeing burglary suspect was shot in the back, blocks away from the
crime scene, caused many to claim the shooting was premeditated and
an unreasonable responsy findings
reportedly indicated the two bullets entered below each shoulder
blade and penetrated the victim's heart.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shooting, near the Austin Convention and Visitors
Center, occurred about three blocks from where Saustrup and his
girlfriend claimed they caught Smith ransacking the woman's
Suburban. As they approached, they noticed its brake lights
illuminated and a window broken, Ritz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul pulled his handgun out and told him to get out of the
car. This guy threatened that there were other `homies' around
there and they were going to kill him,'' Ritz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul made a comment that he was making a citizen's arrest for
burglary of his vehicle and he wanted this person to get out of the
car, lay on the floor and leave his hands where he could see
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the man lifted up his T-shirt, pointed to gang tattoos
and said ``Do you know what these are?'' and ``My homies are going
to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Saustrup then asked his girlfriend to take the cellular phone
out of his back pocket to call police, Ritz continued, adding she
stayed on the phone with 911 dispatchers throughout the ordeal and
was the shooting's only known witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was obviously fearing for his life at that point,'' Ritz
said. ``This person was digging in his belt and crotch area and
made a sudden sharp turn toward Paul, and at that time, Paul shot
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to Saustrup, the man he confronted was a
property-crime and drug offender on probation with two felony and
five misdemeanor convictions in Dallas, all resulting in
probationary terms, police said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ritz said Saustrup's reaction was based on his instincts and
training and was not an overreaction or the work of a
``vigilante.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to prevent vigilante-type situations by educating
people. He was as educated as the handgun law requires. He was
educated, in fact, by a DPS officer,'' Ritz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the law, he was authorized to use deadly force at the
time he saw him burglarizing the vehicle at night time. But he
didn't use deadly force at that time. He called 911 and tried to
get the law over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he was trying to do was keep this criminal from fleeing.''

A TALE OF TWIN TACOMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - The two stretch-cab Toyota Tacoma pickup trucks
looked pretty much identical: jacked up, huge tires on modular
wheels and the initials TRD written large on the sides of their
pickup boxes.
</P>
<P>
   TRD stands for Toyota Racing Development, an impressive name for
an off-road package ``inspired by Toyota's successful Desert Racing
Program,'' the literature says. It provides a stiffer, more
aggressive suspension, greater ground clearance and that brawny
rubber, all designed for close encounters with bad roads.
</P>
<P>
   Upon closer inspection, the difference between the two trucks is
glaring. One has a rugged four-wheel-drive system for serious
off-road work, complete with low-range gearing, that gives it the
capabilities of a mountain goat.
</P>
<P>
   The other truck doesn't. Called the PreRunner, it's just a
two-wheel-drive, despite its rugged off-road styling and attitude.
But before you write it off as a mere poser, the two-wheel-drive
model does have distinct attributes. More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's look at the four-by-four, an impressive piece of
off-road machinery that requires a real commitment on the part of
its owner. That's because a true off-roader is something like a
seal: clumsy and awkward on land but graceful and agile in its
natural environment, the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The four-by-four is awkward and clumsy on the asphalt, with a
hard, jouncy ride, dicey cornering and an overall feeling of
macho-truck overload. But put it into its element, a harsh trail
through the desert, and it becomes graceful and agile.
</P>
<P>
   On a brutal, rock-strewn trail that scales a high ridge and
provides some frightening vistas just south of Black Canyon City,
Ariz., I drove the four-wheel-drive Tacoma quickly like a
racing-development kind of guy over boulders, through deep
crevasses and up steep grades. It just shrugged off everything I
threw at it, playfully scaling the rocks, ditches, climbs and sandy
washes without a murmur of protest.
</P>
<P>
   This was fun. All the more so because the Tacoma was powered by
Toyota's powerful and flexible twin-cam V-6, more than enough
engine for off-road chores and highway driving. It also gives the
pickup the ability to tow 5,000 pounds, which is not bad for a
compact truck.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, though. If you were really a serious off-roader, this
truck would be set up with a five-speed stick shift rather than
automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in the regular world, I found the PreRunner to
be much more hospitable as a daily driver. With the same engine
setup but lighter and less complex, the PreRunner is quicker and
handles better, and the suspension doesn't beat you up nearly as
much.
</P>
<P>
   Although it won't take you through the kind of extremely rugged
terrain of the four-wheeler, it will conquer the washed-out or
corrugated dirt roads encountered on most trips into the
wilderness. This is a more likely scenario for the vast majority of
drivers than the heroic capabilities of the four-by-four.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you get in over your head, the PreRunner comes with
a lockable rear differential for added traction.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a pretty clear choice between two vehicles that look
the same but set forth on two different missions. The
four-wheel-drive Tacoma will take you places that lesser trucks
won't, as well as provide bragging rights for its tough
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The PreRunner will give you the same visual impact and
considerably better behavior on pavement, but forget the serious
off-road stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Getting down to consumer issues, the Tacoma is a hot-selling
pickup for Toyota, with spartan models priced as low as $12,500.
Toyota pickups' reputation for durability is possibly the best in
the business, and they are pretty much the signature vehicles of
the Middle East, Africa, South America and other places where
rugged, inexpensive transportation is premium.
</P>
<P>
   The Xtracab, as Toyota dubs its stretch cab, is especially
effective on this compact vehicle, providing decent space and
stowage. The back seat is strictly for kids, though, and even they
might complain about the cramped conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in cost between the four- and two-wheel-drive TRD
Tacomas is more than $6,000, which might give some buyers pause.
The options are fairly pricey, too, with anti-lock brakes going for
$590 (they should be standard on all vehicles), air-conditioning
for $1,000, TRD package for $800 on the four-by-four and fully
twice as much on the PreRunner, nearly $500 for power windows and
locks, and $300 for a bed liner.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot for a little. On the flip side, these are very
complete trucks that would not require many aftermarket additions.
</P>
<P>
   In its advertising, Toyota has been making much of Ivan
``Ironman'' Stewart's 16th victory in the grueling Baja 500 driving
a race-prepared Toyota pickup. It also touts the fact that Ironman
``pre-runs'' the Baja in a two-wheel-drive pickup, thus the
PreRunner handle.
</P>
<P>
   The TRD package won't turn you into an Ironman, but it's hard to
go wrong with whichever TRD Tacoma you choose, being aware that
each is a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, the PreRunner is probably the more practical
choice. But if you're serious about getting back into wild places,
the four-wheel-drive Tacoma is tough to beat. No matter how hard
you try. &QL;

THREE SOCCER FANS, TEAMS GONE, SING ANYWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ No doubt the Three Tenors would have been even happier
if their teams _ Italy for Luciano Pavarotti, Spain for Placido
Domingo and Jose Carreras _ had not been eliminated from this
year's world soccer championship here. Still, for their third
successive open-air concert before a World Cup final, on Friday
night the three avid soccer fans drew a crowd far larger than the
80,000 people who will watch France play Brazil in the Stade de
France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Performing beneath a specially constructed covered stage on the
Champs de Mars, with a lighted Eiffel Tower as a magnificent
backdrop, they had a paying audience of some 8,000 people seated
before them but also, in the park beyond, a couple of hundred
thousand more people for whom the two-and-a-half-hour concert,
relayed by loudspeakers and giant screens, was entirely free.
</P>
<P>
   The television audience was even larger. Tubor Rudas, the
Hungarian-born impresario who first brought the three singers
together in Rome in 1990 and organized their 1994 concert in Dodger
Stadium before the 1994 World Cup final in Los Angeles, said he
expected a television audience in excess of 1.3 billion. In the
United States, the concert was broadcast by PBS, live on Friday
afternoon and repeated on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the concert of operatic arias and popular songs has
become a feature of the soccer championship, its purpose evidently
goes beyond entertaining those who heard it on Friday. With sales
of the albums for the 1990 and 1994 concerts exceeding 23 million
copies, Atlantic Records and Decca Records have invested heavily in
the latest show, confident of strong television, CD and video
sales. As Rudas put it, he was presenting ``a free concert for a
live recording.''
</P>
<P>
   The Three Tenors, who had promised an entirely new program,
spent several months preparing with James Levine, who conducted the
Orchestre de Paris. The composer Lalo Schifrin in turn arranged the
lively crowd-pleasing medleys that brought the three men together
on stage before intermission and again before the final curtain.
These mixed the solemn and the simple, Schubert's ``Serenade'' and
the Mexican bolero ``Solamente Una Vez.'' The inclusion in the
final medley of ``You'll Never Walk Alone,'' from the Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical ``Carousel,'' offered a preview of the concert
single chosen by the tenors to be issued after the concert.
</P>
<P>
   For all the promised novelties, there were also other well-oiled
favorites, although Pavarotti could spots, Domingo and Carreras were more original.
Domingo remembered his parents _ professional zarzuela singers _ by
singing an excerpt from the Spanish zarzuela ``La del Soto del
Parral,'' and he included ``Memoires de Danton,'' a lushly romantic
aria written by his son, also named Placido. From classical operas,
Domingo sang ``Amor ti vieta'' from Giordano's ``Fedora'' and
``Rachel, quand du seigneur'' from Halevy's opera ``La Juive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carreras, in turn, began the evening with ``Io conosco un
giardino'' from Pietri's ``Maristella'' and included Grieg's song
``T'Estimo.'' For much of the audience on Friday, though, the
performance was as important as the program. And as ever, the three
belted out their songs with good humor and panache, Pavarotti
waving his trademark handkerchief, Domingo singing as if addressing
the most distant listener, Carreras trying not to be upstaged by
his better-known partners.
</P>
<P>
   The response was enthusiastic. With each final note, the seated
audience _ paying no less than $1,100 for the best seats _ roared
with delight. This crowd included prosperous Latin Americans in
town for the World Cup final and that well-known U.S. soccer fan
Henry Kissinger. A couple of hundred yards away in the darkened
park, the applause was equally warm. Here the large crowd could see
the tenors only on projection screens, the sound of their voices
slightly out of sync with their lips, but at least they were
compensated by easy access to popcorn, soda and ice cream. When the
show ended, everyone watched fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The tenors seemed as relaxed as might be expected of a trio that
has performed together before huge crowds on 13 occasions: apart
from their three World Cup shows, they performed in 10 concerts
around the world in 1996 and 1997. And with Pavarotti just 62,
Domingo 57, and Carreras 51, they are not about to retire after
this gig. Not before the year 2002, at least. That is when soccer's
next World Cup will be held in South Korea and Japan.

TRIALS ORDERED FOR 2 MARINE FLIERS IN ITALIAN GONDOLA ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A senior Marine Corps general ordered a court-martial on Friday
on the most serious possible charges for the pilot and the
navigator of an electronic warfare jet that hit a ski lift cable in
Italy in February, killing 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of the Marines in the Atlantic
fleet, also said that he wanted to conduct a hearing personally to
discipline the commander of the squadron, along with the executive
officer, the director of safety and the operations officer, for
dereliction of duty. They could face loss of pay, confinement to
base and official reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has already been the subject of three reports
and seven days of public hearings, has already raised difficult
questions about not only the conduct of the crew but the soundness
of management in the Marine Corps, the U.S. Air Force and the
Defense Mapping Agency and its successor, the National Imagery and
Mapping Agency. Those questions will now be argued in detail at a
court-martial at Camp Lejeune, N.C., probably beginning sometime
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is going to be a a knock-down drag-out,'' said
Frank Spinner, the civilian lawyer for the jet's pilot, Capt.
Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an EA-6B Prowler based temporarily at an air base in
Aviano, Italy, for duty over Bosnia, was on a training flight
through the Italian Alps when it hit the cable near Cavalese. The
incident has strained American relations with Italy, and a Marine
officer who was a member of a Marine Investigation Board that first
looked into the incident hinted that there had been political
pressure from above to come down hard on the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials insisted that the White House and
State Department had not brought pressure on the Marines to seek
tougher penalties against the crewmen as a means of appeasing the
Italian government. ``This call was made by the Marines,'' an
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was sitting in the front cockpit of the jet, at the single
set of flight controls. Next to him in the cockpit, functioning as
mission planner and navigator, was Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 30, of
Westbury, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing officer who conducted seven days of testimony on the
flight recommended earlier this month that only Ashby should face
the most serious charge, involuntary manslaughter, a crime that
involves ``culpable negligence'' and carries a sentence of up to 10
years for each of the 20 counts. He said the navigator, Schweitzer,
should face the lesser charge of negligent homicide, which carries
a maximum penalty of three years for all counts together.
</P>
<P>
   But Gen. Pace ruled that both should face the more serious
charge. He agreed with the hearing officer that they should also
face charges of damage to military property, damage to private
property and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing officer, Lt. Col. Ronald Rodgers, who is a military
judge, said that two officers in the rear cockpit, who did not have
a view out the front and had limited information about the plane's
altitude, should not be court-martialed, and Pace accepted that
recommendation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodgers also said in his report, released July 2, that he
had ``substantial doubt'' that any of the men could be convicted
because of systematic errors by others, a position stressed by the
defendants' lawyers on Friday. Spinner, in a telephone interview,
said, ``by initiating disciplinary action against these
individuals, that suggests that Pace agrees there was systemic
error, which takes the spotlight off Ashby and the crew and says,
`Hey, there are other problems here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   David Beck, a civilian lawyer representing Schweitzer, said:
``We're not applauding that these four individuals face
punishment.'' But he said of his client: ``Joe is encouraged that
they are looking at other factors.''

ANALYSIS: BREAKING THE COST TABOO ON VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health plans cite lots of reasons for denying coverage of
specific drugs and procedures. The procedure can be labeled
cosmetic (breast reconstruction) or medically unnecessary (in-vitro
fertilization). The remedy might be called experimental (bone
marrow transplants) or dangerous (some diet pills). But there is
one reason that health plans never cite: cost.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, David Eddy, an expert on medical technology who advises
many medical organizations including Kaiser Permanente, has coined
the term ``cost taboo'' to express the prevailing notion that costs
should not affect treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, Kaiser, the California-based health plan
that covers more than 9 million people across the country,
shattered the cost taboo when it refused to cover Viagra, the
wildly popular new pill from Pfizer Inc. that treats male
impotence. In doing so, it cited the cost _ and no other factor.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's candor was uncharacteristic for health plans, which
often restrict or exclude treatments because of costs without
saying so.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser conceded that impotence is a medical condition. It
conceded that Viagra is an appropriate medical treatment.
Ordinarily, those stated concessions settle the matter. Cigna,
Oxford and several other plans have decided to cover at least six
of the $10 pills a month.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaiser said no. It estimated that this one drug would drive
up its pharmaceutical bills by about 10 percent, or about $100
million a year _ far more than it spends on all antiviral drugs,
including the expensive ``cocktails'' taken by AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Kaiser is that is has no easy way to distinguish
the few males whose impotence is caused by physical malady and the
large number of males that it expects will demand Viagra to
recapture the sexual frequency of their youth or achieve a
frequency they deem desirable.
</P>
<P>
   After a formal review process involving 40 health-care experts
inside and outside the organization, Kaiser decided that it would
not raise premiums for all its members to pay for treatment of a
nonlethal, noncrippling condition that almost all of its members
could afford to treat on their own. Instead it will offer its
corporate customers an option to buy a policy covering Viagra at a
premium that will compensate for the extra costs. That way other
enrollees are spared a financial hit.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's announcement was blunt and carefully considered. But
was it proper?
</P>
<P>
   Some health care experts think not. Jamie Court, director of
Consumers for Quality Care, a watchdog group in Southern
California, condemned Kaiser's decision by pointing out that Kaiser
was cutting treatment for impotence even as it was increasing its
advertising and marketing budgets. The big threat, other critics
say, is that American health care will move to a two-tier system,
one for those who can afford what they want and a lesser system for
everyone else. California officials are investigating whether a
state law that requires physicians to make decisions without regard
to costs applies to this case.
</P>
<P>
   But other policy experts applaud Kaiser's decision. Arnold
Relman, former editor in chief of the The New England Journal of
Medicine, and Alain Enthoven of Stanford University, a leading
advocate of managed health care markets, welcome Kaiser's assault
on the cost taboo because, they say, in a world of limited
resources, the act of showering money on hugely expensive
treatments of secondary importance denies money for treatments of
primary importance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though they cannot say so publicly, medical directors of health
plans recognize that treatment decisions already reflect costs,
even if the plans invoke code words _ experimental, cosmetic or
risky _ to mask their motives. Several plans, including those of
Prudential Healthcare and Humana Inc., announced that they would
not cover Viagra because of concern for its safety, a reason that
Relman dismisses as ``hypocritical'' because, he said: ``We all
know it is an economic decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Enthoven hopes that Kaiser's frank approach will ``provide
cover'' for health plans to limit costly high-technology treatments
that do some good but also threaten to drive insurance premiums to
unaffordable levels.
</P>
<P>
   David Eddy points to examples that cry out for cost-sensitive
decisions. His research shows that one drug, which would cost
several hundred dollars a year, can decrease the chance that a
typical 55-year-old woman will suffer a hip fracture by about one
in 7,000. One of two liquids that can be used for internal X-rays,
when introduced, cost 15 times the alternative, but cut the risk of
a nonfatal reaction by only about one in 2,000 patients. New types
of pap smears would about double lab charges but, if administered
annually, would increase the life expectancy of women by only about
seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy asked ''whether health plans should pay for these
higher-cost procedures using shared resources, or should patients
who want the costlier tests pay the extra money themselves.'' In
the case of Viagra, Kaiser answered no, deciding that the benefit
of the new drug was not worth the increased costs to its members.
The risk is that some people, especially the poor, will go without
effective treatments of nonlethal problems. The risk in answering
``yes'' to Eddy's question _ covering every innovation that works _
is that insurance premiums will soar. Many employers will drop
coverage and, as recent surveys document, workers will drop offers
of coverage in exchange for higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the pros and cons of Kaiser's decision, it focuses
attention on inescapable trade-offs that do, and will, plague every
health plan. Should plans cover growth hormones only for children
with well-defined genetic miscues or extend treatment to children
who are genetically normal but happen to be extremely short? Should
health plans cover potentially expensive drugs that might come
along to combat memory loss associated with aging?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these tough questions lurks another. Who should make
these coverage decisions? Now, health plans are told to offer
complete coverage at affordable prices and, by the way, ignore
costs when tailoring policies. Little wonder that they resort to
circumlocutions. Another alternative would have government define
the basic benefit package, explictly confronting the trade-off
between generous benefits and steeper costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra decision was made easier by the fact that impotence
threatens no one's life and the remedy, $10 a pill, is within the
financial reach of most Kaiser members. Even still, reactions were
sometimes furious. The cases to come will no doubt grow ever more
difficult.

PELE SEES BRAZILIAN WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Pele predicted Friday that his home country, Brazil,
would win the World Cup for the fifth time when it meets France in
the championship game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has the best attack; France has the best defense,''
Pele said at a news conference to announce a MasterCard-sponsored
All-Star team. ``Both teams will play for the win, but I am sure
France will not play the way they have been playing. They will be
careful. It's normal to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil will win, of course. Only Brazil has won the World Cup
in Europe, in 1958 against the home team, Sweden. Brazil is playing
against the home team in the final again. Everything is going
normally, then.''
</P>
<P>
   Pele, who has been commentating for a Brazilian television
station, criticized conservative tactics and refereeing. Asked
about Italy's performance, Pele said: ``I am from the school of
football where you play forward. Italy was playing not to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He said refereeing ``was the low point of the tournament, the
negative, the weak point. Maybe it is because they tried to change
the laws during the tournament and they got mixed up. There were a
lot of bad calls, but the criteria was very confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pele provided advice for African teams, which finished with a
combined 3-7-8 record. ``I never said that an African team would
win the World Cup by the year 2000,'' Pele said. ``The African
teams were very good. The problem is that people see something in a
team and they come to find that winning the World Cup is not like
they think. One game can spoil everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very tough tournament, one month long. African
people must do two things if they want to fulfill expectations at
that level: have an organized league inside their country, and the
national team must play abroad, get outside the country, to get
experience, and not just put a team together a few weeks before the
World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Last chance
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's Davor Suker has a last chance to challenge for the
World Cup scoring title in Saturday's third-place match between
Croatia and the Netherlands at Parc des Princes. Suker is tied with
Ronaldo (Brazil), Luis Hernandez (Mexico), and Marcelo Salas
(Chile) with four goals, one behind Gabriel Batistuta (Argentina)
and Christian Vieri (Italy).
</P>
<P>
   If Croatia wins, it will be the best finish by a first-time
World Cup finals qualifier since Portugal in 1966, when Eusebio led
the event with nine goals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stars of show
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star team included goalkeepers Fabian Barthez (France)
and Jose Luis Chilavert (Paraguay); defenders Roberto Carlos
(Brazil), Frank De Boer (Netherlands), Marcel Desailly (France),
Lilian Thuram (France), and Carlos Gamarra (Paraguay); midfielders
Edgar Davids (Netherlands), Dunga (Brazil), Michael Laudrup
(Denmark), Rivaldo (Brazil), and Zinedine Zidane (France); and
forwards Dennis Bergkamp (Netherlands), Brian Laudrup (Denmark),
Ronaldo (Brazil), and Suker (Croatia).

STRENGTH AGAINST STRENGTH: BRAZIL'S OFFENSE VS. FRANCE'S DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAIREFONTAINE, France _ For anyone who has followed the career
paths of the defenders on the French World Cup team, it is no
surprise that they have been the finest in the world for the past
month. What is a surprise is that between them, they have managed
to outscore Ronaldo: 5 goals to 4.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo, the Brazilian striker with the muscular thighs and
wicked first step, has no intention of being overshadowed in
Sunday's World Cup final against France, but even at age 21, he has
seen enough tactical systems and hard tackles to know excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that they are very, very solid defensively,'' he
said. ``They have hardly shown any weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be strength against strength in the Stade de France:
Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Bebeto and Brazil's two offensive-minded outside
fullbacks, Cafu and Roberto Carlos, against the French back line
and defensive midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins that struggle probably wins the game, and according
to the French, they do not intend to win it by sticking a single,
bold defender on Ronaldo. They will share the responsibility:
switching, adjusting, double-teaming when necessary and pushing
forward when possible.
</P>
<P>
   Since the knockout round of this World Cup began, all three of
France's goals have been scored by players whose customary role is
to make it difficult for opposing strikers. Central defender
Laurent Blanc scored the first golden goal in World Cup history to
break a scoreless tie against Paraguay in the second round. Right
back Lilian Thuram scored twice against Croatia in the semifinals
after having never scored before in 37 previous international
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Blanc won't play on Sunday _ a major loss _ because he received
a questionable red card against Croatia. But there are plenty of
world-class defenders left in the French half of the field. Seven
men will try to keep Brazil from having a fifth title to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   FABIEN BARTHEZ
</P>
<P>
   POSITION: Goalkeeper. AGE: 27. INTERNATIONAL MATCHES: 19. CLUB:
Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   Barthez won his spot over the veteran goalkeeper Bernard Lama,
who like Barthez, served a several-month suspension after testing
positive for marijuana. Barthez is an imposing presence: excellent
in the air but less adept at distribution. In 1993, he was the
goalkeeper on the Olympique Marseilles team that won France's first
European Champions Cup title. In this tournament, Barthez has given
up only two goals in six games (one on a penalty kick), and his
shaved head has become a French talisman. Blanc has kissed it on
the field before every game, and despite his suspension, Blanc
plans to kiss it again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   BIXENTE LIZARAZU
</P>
<P>
   POSITION: Left back. AGE: 28. INTERNATIONAL MATCHES: 38. CLUB:
Bayern Munich (Germany).
</P>
<P>
   A Basque who played for the quintessential Basque club, Athletic
Bilbao, in Spain before moving to Munich last season, Lizarazu is
short, extremely fast and the most consistently offensive of the
French defenders. The player called Liza was in danger of losing
his spot on the team after missing the early season with an injury,
but Coach Aime Jacquet kept the faith and Lizarazu has done nothing
to make him lose it this summer.
</P>
<P>
   MARCEL DESAILLY
</P>
<P>
   POSITION: Central defender. AGE: 29. INTERNATIONAL MATCHES: 48.
CLUB: AC Milan (Italy).
</P>
<P>
   Desailly has been arguably France's finest player in this World
Cup. He has not lost a duel yet, and though he has yet to score a
goal, he hopes to rectify that against Brazil. He is sensitive,
occasionally abrasive and powerful on land and in the air. Desailly
was born in Ghana and moved to the French mainland at the age of 6
after his mother, a Ghanan, married a Frenchman. Like Barthez, he
was part of the Marseilles club that won France's first European
Champions Cup title in 1993. Desailly won a Champion's League title
with Milan in 1994 playing in midfield. He will be leaving AC Milan
for Chelsea in England next season. Lucky Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   FRANK LEBOEUF
</P>
<P>
   POSITION: central defender. AGE: 30. INTERNATIONAL MATCHES: 15.
CLUB: Chelsea (England).
</P>
<P>
   Desailly's future teammate was relatively unknown when he left
for England two years ago. On the other side of the channel,
Leboeuf has become a star and occasional newspaper columnist. Adept
in the air and at man marking, he also has a way with a free kick,
but he does not have the presence, speed or international
experience of Blanc. Expect the Brazilians to test him often.
</P>
<P>
   LILIAN THURAM
</P>
<P>
   POSITION: right back. AGE: 26. INTERNATIONAL MATCHES: 26. CLUB:
Parma (Italy).
</P>
<P>
   Even before he became a national savior against Croatia, Thuram
was considered France's finest defender. A central defender with
his club, his effectiveness and confidence have increased
substantially since he left Monaco for Italy two years ago. Fast,
agile and likable, he is now giving the three-time Olympic gold
medalist Marie-Jose Perec a run for the title of most popular
athlete from the French island of Guadeloupe. Raised by his mother,
he moved to the Paris suburbs at 9.
</P>
<P>
   DIDIER DESCHAMPS
</P>
<P>
   POSITION: defensive midfielder. AGE: 29. INTERNATIONAL MATCHES:
75. CLUB: Juventus of Turin (Italy).
</P>
<P>
   He is the captain and one of the few links to the French team
that failed to qualify for the last World Cup. Deschamps, a Basque
like Lizarazu, plays with the French playmaker Zinedine Zidane at
Juventus, the club owned by the Agnelli family, which owns Fiat.
Small and smart, Deschamps covers enormous ground and is a fine
tackler and clogger of passing lanes. He quit soccer for six months
as a teen-ager after his older brother died in an airplane crash.
Deschamps is a close friend of Desailly _ he is the godfather of
one of his children _ and a distant cousin of the Wimbledon women's
finalist, Nathalie Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   EMMANUEL PETIT
</P>
<P>
   POSITION: defensive midfielder. AGE: 27. INTERNATIONAL MATCHES:
25. CLUB: Arsenal (England)
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last spring, the swashbuckling Petit was
considered unlikely to make the 22-man French team, but his fine
season at Arsenal under the French Coach Arsene Wenger earned him a
spot in the starting lineup. A phenom as a teen-ager, he later lost
his way after a divorce and, like Deschamps, the death of a
brother, but Petit has learned to think and play positively again. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Strong Capital Management, which recently announced a shake-up
of several funds, is seeking approval from its board to merge the
Strong Small Cap fund into the Strong Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   For investors in the Small-Cap fund, the move is the second big
change in two months. At the end of May, Strong announced that
Scott Sindelar, a portfolio manager from Mid-Continent Capital in
Chicago, would succeed Mary Lisanti as manager of the fund, which
had lagged behind its peers. Ms. Lisanti left Strong to become
chief of equity investing at Northstar Investment Management in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first interest was to appoint a manager to continue to run
the fund for shareholders after Mary's departure,'' said Jody Lowe,
a spokeswoman for Strong. ``After that, we looked carefully at the
fund. Assets have dropped from $230 million to $136 million, and
its relevant track record is such that we believe it would be
difficult to turn the cash flows around.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Strong Small Cap should be aware that although
Strong Growth has an enviable record, it holds stocks of a variety
of market capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what you bought,'' warned Susan Belden, editor of the
No-Load Fund Analyst in Orinda, Calif., referring to the stocks in
the Small Cap fund. ``If you want small-cap exposure, bail out.''
She added, however, that investors should consider the tax
consequences of selling.
</P>
<P>
   Strong also announced three new offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar will run Strong Strategic Growth, a U.S. stock fund
that invests in inexpensive medium- and large-cap growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   David Lui, who took over Strong International Stock from Anthony
Cragg at the end of May, will run Strong Overseas, which will
invest in at least 10 countries outside the United States at all
times. Lui joined Strong from Phoenix Duff &AMP; Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   Strong Foreign Major Markets will use a quantitative,
value-oriented approach to investing in each of the countries in
the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia and Far
East index. It will be managed by Shirish Malekar, who runs
Strong's International Bond, Short-Term Global Bond and Global High
Yield Bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new funds will have a $2,500 minimum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Funds &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Invesco Funds has started Invesco Growth and Income. The lead
manager of the fund is Trent May, also the lead manager of Invesco
Growth and co-manager of Invesco Small Company Growth. Co-manager
of the new fund will be Fritz Meyer, who manages separate accounts.
The minimum investment is $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Transamerica Premier Funds has started a junk bond fund,
Transamerica Premier High Yield Bond, to be managed by Heather
Creeden, who has managed a separate junk bond account since 1991.
The fund's minimum investment is $1,000.

SOME INFLATION PROTECTION FOR U.S. SAVINGS BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12.)  
 (JT)  
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uncles everywhere will sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   The government savings bond, that favorite gift of unimaginative
relatives _ appropriate for birthdays and graduations, for a
confirmation or a bar mitzvah _has been embellished to keep up with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Treasury Department announced that beginning on
Sept. 1 it will sell Series I savings bonds, which will provide
protection against a general rise in consumer prices. The interest
paid will be pegged partly to changes in the Consumer Price Index.
As with the current Series EE savings bonds, holders can defer tax
payments on their earnings until a bond is redeemed. Based on
current interest rates and inflation prospects, the bonds are
expected to earn a real return of about 3 percent after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds will supplement, rather than replace, the Treasury's
offerings of Series EE savings bonds, much as the inflation-indexed
Treasury bonds introduced last year gave investors a new option to
invest in government securities. Both offer a way to hedge against
the erosion of principal from inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the inflation-indexed bonds, which were at best a
moderate success with individual investors, the new securities may
help to revive sales of savings bonds, which in recent years have
been losing popularity to stocks and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Savings bonds have a reputation as a sleepy investment, but they
are one of the country's most widely held securities. Roughly one
in three American households, and 55 million individuals, own
government savings bonds, with most of those investors buying the
bonds through payroll deduction plans, said Daniel Pederson,
president of the Savings Bond Investor, a Detroit-based information
service for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ubiquity of savings bonds, Americans' holdings have
remained about $185 billion since 1995, according to the Flow of
Funds report from the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investors have a more compelling option for the
conservative end of the portfolio, even if they don't believe that
higher inflation looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody will say that they'll give mutual funds
a run for their money,'' Pederson said. ``But they can earn two to
three points better than inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   High-income individuals close to retirement are likely to be
drawn to the new bonds. They are likely to want to protect their
portfolios from inflation without generating more income, which
would require payment of federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings rate of the new savings bond is a combination of a
fixed interest rate, specified at the time of purchase, and an
inflation rate, adjusted semiannually.
</P>
<P>
   The Series I bonds will be sold at face value _ rather than at
50 percent of face, as Series EE bonds are _ in denominations of
$50, $75, $100, $500, $1,000 and $5,000. Beginning in May 1999,
denominations of $200 and $10,000 will be added.

COMMENTARY: OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If someone were to make a movie about the Mideast peace process,
there could be only one appropriate title: ``Groundhog Day'' _
where the same day, the same discussions, just get repeated over
and over. But even Groundhog Day eventually came to an end. And so
will the peace process version. It closes May 4, 1999 _ the day the
Oslo agreement runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Circle May 4 on your calendar, Middle East fans, and think what
it could portend. If Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the
Palestinian chief Yasser Arafat quickly can conclude this
long-delayed second redeployment in the West Bank, learn to work
together and begin serious talks about a final status agreement,
then May 4 will be no problem. Even though Oslo will have run out,
the two sides will have a framework of understandings and a pathway
of negotiations that can sustain the peace beyond the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But if Groundhog Day continues until May 4, 1999 _ with
Netanyahu dragging out the negotiations on issues that are not
fundamental to Israel's security, with Arafat hoping that the
longer things are dragged out the more pressure Bibi will be unrafat, who is not a healthy man, may well
choose to declare a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza to
complete his life's work before he dies.
</P>
<P>
   That Palestinian mini-state could engage in trade, treaties and
other actions without regard to Israel. Netanyahu would then have
only terrible choices: annex those areas that the Palestinians
don't control in the West Bank, set up a blockade of the new
Palestinian state (which would cost Israeli businesses $3 billion
in exports a year) or send Israeli boys to recapture the West Bank
from the self-declared Palestinian state. There is no way that
Egypt or Jordan could continue relations as usual with Israel in
the wake of any of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Shikaki, who heads up polling at the Center for Palestine
Research in Nablus, told me: ``Last year only a small percentage of
Palestinians were in favor of declaring a Palestinian state, no
matter what. Now the number is 57 percent, and it will get to 90
percent by May 1999 if there is no agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a war between Israeli troops and Palestinian
police would be very high. Look what happened last week. Israeli
troops and Palestinian police got into a standoff at a Gaza
intersection over an issue of free passage.
</P>
<P>
   Because communication between Netanyahu and Arafat is
nonexistent, they had to call the U.S. envoy, Dennis Ross, at his
home in Bethesda, Md., to sort it out. That is pathetic. After May
4, every other intersection in the West Bank and Gaza will be a
potential flashpoint. What if Ross' kids are on the phone?
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli President Ezer Weizman took the highly unusual step
of denouncing Netanyahu as a liar who is undermining Oslo, what he
was essentially saying was that Netanyahu seems incapable of
playing the historic role that many, including myself, have hoped
he would: that is to advance the peace process, albeit in his own
more cautious fashion, so as to bring along as much of the Israeli
right as possible but still, at the end of the day, make the tough,
necessary compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman was right to raise that question. Shimon Peres believed
Oslo was a moral imperative. Yitzhak Rabin believed it was a
strategic imperative. Bibi seems to believe neither. He views Oslo
as a political issue that needs to be managed up or down _
whichever way boosts his political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Notes the Middle East expert Stephen Cohen: ``If people thought
Bibi was truly committed to the logic of Oslo _ that the only way
forward is through mutual recognition between the two peoples and
mutual cooperation between the two political leaderships _ they
would believe he is sincere in looking for alternative ways to
achieve its objectives. But what Weizman was saying was that Bibi
has left too many people in doubt. And the hour is getting late.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still not too late, but the breakthrough has to happen now.
If Groundhog Day plays until May 4, the next movie will be
Titanic. &QL;

   US-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had made no secret over the last several
months that they would like to have a summit in the fall. As
Clinton wound down his long trip to China, the word began spreading
that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it
on Monday, the White House can expect a wave of criticism from
opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and
space cooperation. Clinton had been awaiting Russia's Parliament to
ratify the SALT II nuclear arms pact, but his decision to go seems
to be aimed at pressuring the Duma into such a ratification vote.

   IRAN-BACKLASH _ TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's conservatives are fighting
back. A year after the election of the moderate but not powerful
President Mohammed Khatami, concerned fundamentalists have arrested
and impeached key supporters. The political climate seems to swing
daily between reform and backlash. The clash between Iran's two
cultures is as clear as the difference between two of its
provacative publications _ one preserving the past, the other
looking forward. At Shalamche magazine's storefront office, the
walls are covered in burlap, one corner is ringed with sandbags and
artilery shells are used for decoration. The young staff won't meet
with foreign journalists, but their magazine outlines their view
that Islamic values are under attack. Though the Iran-Iraq war is
over, Shalamche has a new target across town: The Jamaeh daily.
Jameah has become a symbol of Iran in transition. The daily, one of
more than 300 new publications since Khatami's election, pokes fun
at political leaders and prints long interviews with dissidents.
Its office is also staffed with young idealists, but it's in a
California-style villa. The wall in Jameah carries a
tongue-in-cheek staff petition asking editors why the swimming pool
is empty. But, Jamaeh has bigger problems than an empty pool.
Attacked in court by three conservative groups, the paper has been
ordered to close. We are moving from traditionalism to modernism,''
says the paper's editor Mashallah hamsolivin. Don't let this
newborn baby, the election, die now.'' (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-IRAN _ TEHRAN, Iran _ These are nervous times in Tehran.
I could sense the difference from my last trip in December, when
reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing their
fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami. Now, reformers are channel surfing between World Cup
soccer games and the trial of a popular mayor, accused of
corruption by a justice system run by religious hardliners. Though
Tehran is full of articulate, informed people with a lot to say,
slightly fewer wanted to be quoted this time. The day after
watching a World Cup match with a group of young Iranians, one
called and asked that I not tell anyone I was with them. These
days, hanging out with foreign journalists can be controversial,
especially if the evening in question included cassettes of Western
dance music. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   NIH _ WASHINGTON _ In the middle of fights over campaign
finances, tobacco legislation and other bones of contention,
President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Senate
Republican leaders and congressional Democrats all agree on a
fairly major initiative: that the research budget of the National
Institutes of Health should be dramatically increased, even doubled
over the next decade. To officials at Emory University in Atlanta,
which hopes to propel itself into one of the top 10 research
institutions in the country during that time, this is welcome news.
The University of Texas, Eastern Carolina University and other
universitities around the country are also thrilled at the prospect
of easier access to what is already the largest pool of research
money in the world, by a factor of 10. Why is this idea suddenly so
popular? There are several theories, including the fact that
politicians sense that meaningful medical breakthroughs lie just
ahead and the aging of the politically powerful Baby Boomers, who
are now reaching the stage in life where their own health has
replaced earlier concerns. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 1250)

movement, which seeks to identify the strengths and weaknesses in a
community and target problem areas for future growth. (Dempsey,

<P>
   Q. I am 87 years old and looking for investment advice _ not tax
avoidance schemes _ specifically for my age group.
</P>
<P>
   _MARTIN FIELD, Laguna Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Hang on while I turn down the gramophone, fill up my fountain
pen and grab a grape Nehi out of the icebox. If you think financial
planners have passed you by in favor of those 60-something
whippersnappers down the block, don't fret. Brokers may soon make
cold calls based on black-market lists of videophiles who've rented
Walter Matthau movies.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The number of Americans who are 85 or older is
rising rapidly: The total jumped 51 percent from 1980 to 1996, and
it is expected to climb an additional 32 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Gerontologists, not to mention marketers, already call this age
group the ``oldest old'' _ an unfortunate moniker that sounds only
slightly better than ``prime of geezerdom.'' Likewise, people in
the 75-to-84 age group have been classified as the ``young old''
(though you'll find that many women still prefer ``of a certain
age,'' especially if you don't want a hatbox in the face).
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, many brokers have guided Generation A away from
owning stocks _ and toward bonds, fixed-income securities and
certificates of deposit. And if we're talking about the money you
need to live on, that is probably sound advice.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from Edward Polisher, a 96-year-old estate planning
lawyer at Cozen &AMP; O'Connor in Philadelphia. ``I wouldn't invest
money in equities at my age,'' Polisher said. ``First of all, my
blood pressure can't take the gyrations of this market and second,
if stocks go down, there's no time to make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Polisher knows about plunging prices _ he was married on Oct.
29, 1929. Nearly 70 years later, he says, he puts his money in
government bonds or tax-free securities and ``invests in people'' _
in worthy causes like underwriting a lecture series at his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
   A case can also be made, however, for taking some financial
risks as you head toward the big double-zero. ``The idea of putting
money you don't need to live on in bonds and fixed-income
securities is ludicrous,'' declared Venita VanCaspelcq, a former
Houston stockbroker, in a feisty, Ann Richards-sounding, ``I love
you but cut the cards'' Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. VanCaspel, the author of six books on investing, argued that
``for one, the bond market, like the stock market, fluctuates, and,
two, you'll never keep pace with inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? ``If you want access to a certain amount of your
cash then use a money market account,'' she said. For the rest, she
advises sticking with stocks. Ms. VanCaspel, herself of a certain
age, said: ``Pick a mutual fund with a lot of large-cap and
blue-chip stocks. Most older people have other interests than the
stock market'' and thus don't have time to track individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   She recommended three funds for the older investor: Investment
Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors, both part of
the American Funds, and Janus Worldwide. If you need monthly
income, she suggests setting up a check-a-month withdrawal program.
</P>
<P>
   She approves of buying individual stocks, as long as you have
the time, training, temperament and money to diversify. ``As we
mature emotionally, we tend to clutch our money a little harder,''
she said, mindful of Jackie Mason's remark: ``I've got enough money
to last the rest of my life, unless I buy something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. VanCaspel advised steering clear of options and commodities
and anything else with a prospectus that weighs more than the last
issue of Modern Maturity magazine. For many people, she says, that
means sticking ``with companies such as Coca-Cola, GE and Wal-Mart
_ makers or providers of things that people use all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Owning high-technology stocks can be OK, too, despite their
volatility, she said. But if you want to trade them, she warned,
``your timing has to be excellent.'' She suggests buying through a
technology mutual fund like Seligman Communications and Information
class A or T. Rowe Price Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Schoenheimer, a New York money manager, has an
89-year-old client who has used a simple, buy-and-hold approach to
market success without reaching for his beta blocker pills. The
client's portfolio consists of one corporate bond and 13 stocks _
mostly in phone, real estate and banking sectors. All 13 had
returns above the market average last year.
</P>
<P>
   James O'Shaughnessy, chairman of O'Shaughnessy Funds in
Greenwich, Conn., and author of ``How to Retire Rich'' (Broadway
Books, $25) offers a different conservative strategy: Go to the
top-ranked stocks in the Value Line Investment Survey and buy the
10 that pay the highest dividends. This will net you mostly utility
companies like Ameren, Allegheny Energy, Laclede Gas and New
England Electric.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. VanCaspel is adamant that when it comes to Europe over
the next two years, no one _ octogenarian or otherwise _ should sit
on the sidelines. ``They're doing all the things we did 10 years
ago _ downsizing, restructuring, and getting more competitive,''
she said of the Europeans. ``The common currency will be
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac, also thinks
it's folly to let dormant dollars gather prune-juice rings. But he
suggests pushing the envelope further, into a hedge fund. Such
funds can take long and short positions, use leverage and invest in
derivatives, thus increasing potential risks and rewards. Hirsch,
who is so coy about his age that I suspect he may know all of
Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign song, ``Happy Days Are Here
Again,'' asks, ``Why not increase your net worth as much as
possible in order to pass it on to your heirs?''
</P>
<P>
   For information, you may want to pick up ``Fundamentals of Hedge
Fund Investing,'' by William J. Crerend (McGraw-Hill, $55), or
subscribe to MAR-Hedge, a monthly newsletter that ranks and tracks
1,300 hedge funds. (800 638-2525, $495 a year).
</P>
<P>
   But before you set your sundial by all this information,
consider a man who has decided to invest in his old age by
investing in old age itself _ by trying to abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine years ago I decided that I felt great and was happy and
wanted to live much longer,'' said Miller Quarles, 83. In the
American do-it-yourself tradition, Quarles, a Houston geophysicist,
started the Geron Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company in Menlo
Park, Calif., whose mission is to develop products for treating
cancer and other age-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a longevity gene in every living thing that
determines the time of death for each species,'' Quarles said. ``Or
how else would you have butterflies which last only two days and
down in the Galapagos Islands, turtles living for 200 years?''
</P>
<P>
   Quarles is clearly aligning himself with the turtles. He has
founded the Curing Old Age Disease Society (713-654-0194) in
addition to offering a $100,000 prize to anyone who finds a cure
for aging by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While the reward waits at Nationsbank, Quarles receives many
letters asking him to first send the prize money and promising the
cure later. No dice. ``I wasn't born yesterday,'' he said.

 PRISTINA, Serbia: thousand fighters.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commander in Smonica, for example, a man in his 40s who goes
by the nom de guerre Besnik, was a senior career officer in the old
Yugoslav army. He had in his command a former army instructor for
antitank weapons. His force of several hundred fighters has
steadily increased the territory under its control, often by moving
forward a few hundred feet or yards each night, moves that have
persuaded the Serbs to retreat each time.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels and Western diplomats say that a number of ethnic
Albanians from Croatia who fought in the 1991 independence struggle
against Belgrade are joining the rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley Clarke, during a
meeting a few days ago in Zagreb, Croatia, with the Croatian
defense minister, expressed his displeasure over the flow of
professional soldiers from Croatia to Kosovo to bolster the rebel
movement, according to Western diplomats in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not sure that Zagreb is organizing this,'' said a
Western diplomat, ``but at the same time it is doing nothing to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an increasingly military feel to rebel-held areas, with
the unkempt civilian soldiers of a month ago being replaced by men
who report on walkie-talkies to commanders and move in columns or
groups of several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   The Western alliance has warned Belgrade that it might carry out
air strikes unless Belgrade removes its special police forces and
military, but the surprising growth and reach of the rebel
movement, which holds about 40 percent of the province, has left
Western diplomats as concerned about the guerrillas as about the
Serbian police and military. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo make up
90 percent of the 2 million population.
</P>
<P>
   At a rebel camp in Smonica, just over the hill from the main
road, the tread of Serbian armor could be heard thundering past.
The several hundred rebels, who had set up a well-equipped field
hospital, had stacks of antitank and rocket-propelled grenades, a
huge recoilless cannon and 12.7-millimeter antiaircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs race past on the road blindly,'' said Besnik. ``They
are scared.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, rebel soldiers have drawn closer to the
strategically important towns of Pec and Djakovica. They have taken
the hilltop villages of Nec and Ramoz north of Djakovica, giving
them positions over the city. They have also taken towns, including
Lodja, south of Pec. Rebel barricades have once again closed the
road to Kijevo, which was opened by the Serbs a week ago. A
three-day government attack to drive rebels from an open-pit coal
mine five miles from Pristina has seen Serb forces enter the town,
but the mine remains closed because of constant rebel sniper fire
on police positions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Belgrade to cordon off areas of combat to the
press, blocking the emotionally charged television shots that
create pressure on Western governments to intervene, as well as to
cut phone lines to areas under attack, has left the fighting, now
often heavy, largely uncovered and unseen by the outside world.

TEXAS EDUCATION BOARD VOTES 8-4 TO SELL DISNEY STOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The State Board of Education voted 8-4 Friday to
stake out a moral high ground and sell off $43 million of Walt
Disney Co. stock in protest over violent and sexually explicit
movies and recordings made by Disney subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The vote followed more than a year of pressure from the
conservative American Family Association to get the board to divest
its Disney stock, initially on the basis of obscene lyrics on
record albums produced by Disney subsidiaries. Later, complaints
were raised over the violence, sex and drug use depicted in some
films produced by Disney-owned Miramax Films.
</P>
<P>
   But the AFA also has been involved in a national boycott of
Disney over its internal policies to grant health benefits to
domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that a vote to divest is political
hypocrisy,'' said board member Alma Allen of Houston, a public
schools administrator and one of four Democrats voting against the
measure. ``We have other (morally questionable) stocks that we've
invested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if we're going to be pure and clean and devoid of sin,''
she added, ``then let's totally divest and get out of the
investment business all together and just go with (certificates of
deposit).''
</P>
<P>
   Other holdings by the $17.6 billion Permanent School Fund are
Harrah's Entertainment Inc., a casino operator, Anheuser-Busch
Companies Inc. and Asahi Breweries Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner Mike Moses, out of town on vacation,
directed investment managers for the school fund to sell the Disney
stock ``as expeditiously as possible,'' said Debbie Graves
Ratcliffe, spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Disney spokeswoman Claudia Peters noted that Texas is the first
state fund to divest its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company has been achieving 20 percent compound annual
growth in earnings per share over the past several years,'' she
said. ``The Walt Disney Company produces more family entertainment
than any other company in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that movies for mature audiences are produced by
subsidiaries that do not carry the Disney name and adhere to the
Motion Picture Association of America rating system.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Shore of Longview, who was appointed to the board last
November by Bush, was one of eight Republicans to vote for dumping
Disney. She said it makes financial sense to sell the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been taught to buy low and sell high,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're going to take the money we make from
selling Disney and throw it in a hole. Maybe it's time to take the
profit and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the measure were Allen and fellow Democrats Joe
Bernal of San Antonio, Will Davis of Austin and Rosie Sorrells of
Dallas. Two other Democrats abstained; Rene Nunez of El Paso and
Mary Helen Berlanga of Corpus Christi both are locked in tough
re-election battles with social conservatives. Republican member
Monte Hasie of Lubbock was absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues that people could get uptight about,
but when you start trying to draw parameters ... then you start
making moral judgments, social judgments, other judgments that some
of us will support and some of us will criticize,'' said Davis, who
had tried to stall the issue in committee earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrells said she was ``totally against singling out Disney''
and that if the board did not want to invest in companies doing
``inappropriate things,'' the board needed to re-examine all its
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Berlanga said that while she thinks parents need to take a stand
against allowing children to view ``movies like those where Arnold
Schwarzenegger appears, where there's so much violence,'' it would
be inappropriate to make investment decisions based on moral
viewpoints. She added that her decision to abstain from voting
would give managers the flexibility to make such decisions at the
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the Republicans who voted in favor of divestiture
had concerns about the impact of their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future will there be any policies or something written
as a guide over issues like this?'' asked GOP member Geraldine
``Tincy'' Miller of Dallas. ``Or are we just going to react as we
go down the road?
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the concern and I'm very sympathetic, but I'm
also listening and hearing a lot of other people say we have a lot
of other companies that are in the entertainment business that do
things that maybe we don't approve of.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``in the future I'm concerned this could be a
domino effect on our investments and what impact that would have on
the return on our investments for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Jack Christie of Houston said he expects the
Texas Legislature next session to provide guidelines on appropriate
investments of tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Others voting in favor of divesting included David Bradley of
Beaumont, Richard Neill of Fort Worth, Robert Offutt of San
Antonio, Randy Stevenson of Bullard and Richard Watson of Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, also a Republican, has said that investment
decisions should be made on the basis of financial return on
investments. On Friday, spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor
stands by his earlier statements that, ``The board members are
independently elected, and it's their decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote represents the first time the board has ordered
investment managers of the public school trust fund to make a
specific sale or buy, said Ratcliffe of the TEA.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, however, the Permanent School Fund has taken its
cue from state leaders who encouraged divestiture of other stocks
for moral reasons. For example, last year a fund manager sold $3.5
million in stock in Seagram Co. one day after Republican state Sen.
Bill Ratliff, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, protested
the ``filth'' on Seagram's MCA record albums.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, investment managers sold off all holdings in tobacco
companies at the urging of Christie and Attorney General Dan
Morales. At issue then was Morales' decision to file suit against
tobacco companies in an effort to recoup money spent by Texas on
tobacco-related illnesses.

LIFE GROUPS MOUNT CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRESCRIBED BIRTH CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right-to-life groups and the Roman Catholic Church
have mounted an assault on legislation that would require health
plans to pay for prescription contraceptives, an issue that was
gaining some momentum in the wake of insurers' initial embrace of
Viagra, the impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the effort oppose any government funding of
abortions, and believe that some forms of contraception amount to
abortion in fact if not in name.
</P>
<P>
   But family-planning advocates say they are alarmed by what
appears to be a new front in the war over a woman's right to
prevent pregnancy: an attack on paying for drugs such as
birth-control pills and Norplant implants, and intrauterine
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we have seen social conservatives in
Congress come out directly against contraceptives and take up the
line of the Catholic Church,'' says Wendy Turnbull, a lobbyist for
the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive issues.
``They are showing their true colors, which is to oppose not just
abortion but any family planning methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the abortion debate has been largely over procedures
and drugs that end a pregnancy. Now, abortion opponents in Congress
are attacking forms of contraception, such as the Pill and IUDs.
And the arguments don't always distinguish between pregnancy
prevention and termination.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican and
one of Congress's most ardent abortion foes, is leading the House
opposition to contraceptive coverage. ``His position is that
chemicals that produce abortions should not be covered by taxpayer
dollars,'' said spokesman Ken Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Activists for women's health admit they have taken advantage of
the huge hype around Viagra _ and the initial rush by insurers to
cover prescriptions for it _ to push to end what they consider an
inequity in reproductive rights. For years, groups like Planned
Parenthood have complained that women are shortchanged because half
of all private insurers don't pay for the Pill or other
prescription contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put a product that enables men to be sexually active and
is covered by health insurance next to products that enable women
to be sexually active without getting pregnant and are not
covered,'' said Carol Weisman, a professor at the University of
Michigan School of Public Health. ``Suddenly people start paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York, had the
first success. The House Appropriations Committee approved the
fiscal 1999 Treasury-Postal spending bill with Lowey's amendment
requiring the government to provide more than 2 million federal
workers with insurance coverage for contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   But when the bill came to the House floor late last month, Smith
and Representative David McIntosh, Republican of Indiana,
circulated a memo urging colleagues to vote down the rule for
debating the spending bill because the Lowey amendment would
encourage abortions. The rule was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee lobbied lawmakers to oppose
Lowey's amendment, as did the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, which asserted in a letter that ``drugs such as Norplant,
Depo-Provera, and the low-estrogen Pill sometimes act not by
preventing ovulation or fertilization, but by preventing the embryo
from implanting in the womb.'' The so-called ``morning after pill''
approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an emergency
contraceptive falls in the same category, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Alvare, a spokesman for the Catholic Conference, says the
issue is ``new, different...and tricky'' because it requires people
to understand that the church defines IUDs and Norplant, which
prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the womb, as
abortion-inducing drugs, not as contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Lowey measure _ which expressly prohibits
insurance coverage for abortions _ say they were blindsided by the
antiabortion opposition. Lowey says her amendment had strong
bipartisan support, the blessing of the House GOP leadership, and
was aimed at finding some rare common ground in Congress on a
family planning issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Americans support contraception. I would
venture that the majority of Americans use contraception,
regardless of their religion,'' Lowey said. ``I don't think
Congress has any business debating whether women should have access
to it, and the fact that we are just shows that the extreme right
wing has taken over the Republican agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowey says she hasn't given up on her measure, but lobbyists for
family- planning groups say the debate has soured the climate and
made lawmakers who fear the abortion issue reluctant to touch her
amendment in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible victim of the abortion fight could be a Senate
bill, co-authored by Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine and Democrat
Harry Reid of Nevada, that would require health insurance plans
that cover prescriptions to also provide benefits for
contraceptives. A hearing on the measure is scheduled for later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, an abortion opponent, said he is sponsoring the bill
because making contraceptive drugs and services more available
would reduce both the number of unintended pregnancies and
abortions. The average annual cost of adding health insurance
coverage for contraceptives would be $21 a year, according to the
Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland recently became the first state to mandate that private
insurers offering prescription coverage pay for all contraceptives,
while six other states require some level of coverage. In
Massachusetts, Senator Dianne Wilkerson has proposed a bill to make
contraceptive coverage mandatory. A spokesman said the senator
expects the measure to pass muster with both the right-to-life and
church groups and emerge soon from committee.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 75
percent of Americans favor such legislation, and 73 percent say
they would support it even if it meant their insurance premiums
would rise. Women spend an estimated 68 percent more than men for
health care each year, a gap explained in part by out-of-pocket
costs for contraceptives, the Guttmacher Institute reported.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry has vowed to fight the
contraceptive-coverage bills in Congress ``regardless of the
merits,'' because mandated benefits drive up costs and hurt
consumers, said Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health
Insurance Association of America, a private group.
</P>
<P>
   ``These providers pay for abortions, vasectomies, and tubal
ligations, so for heaven's sake, why won't they cover
contraceptives?'' Senator Reid asked. ``I say it's wrong to deny
women the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers are also paying for Viagra, though concerns about
its safety and cost _ 2.9 million prescriptions for the $10 pill
since it was introduced in April _ are causing some of the biggest
providers to rethink and even retract their initial decision to
underwrite it. And some states have balked at federal rules
requiring Medicaid, the health-insurance program for low-income
people, to pay for Viagra. Under Medicaid, states must pay for
family-planning services, including contraceptives but excluding
fertility drugs and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Coorsh says the justification for private insurers to cover
Viagra is it can be a ``medical necessity'' to treat impotency
resulting from an illness such as diabetes, while contraceptives
are considered elective, and pregnancy is not regarded as an
illness.

GM'S DEMANDS FOR LABOR PEACE ELSEWHERE SLOW STRIKE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiations to settle a 36-day strike at two
General Motors auto parts factories here slowed to a crawl Friday
as GM stiffened its demand for a guarantee that workers at several
factories elsewhere would not go on strike later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North American
personnel, said the company could not conclude a deal here without
being sure of labor peace at a truck parts factory in Indianapolis,
a car assembly plant here and two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio.
``We want the risk removed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, vice president for GM issues at the United
Automobile Workers union, said that seeking accords in long-running
disputes at the other factories would only delay a settlement in
the strikes here, which have forced GM to close 26 of its 29 North
American assembly plants and temporarily lay off 161,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Even when a deal is reached here, it will take at least two days
for workers to vote on its ratification and return to their jobs.
So the impasse Friday means the end of GM's hope to reopen the
factories here on Monday, when the company's annual two-week summer
shutdown was originally scheduled to end.
</P>
<P>
   Once the parts factories resume production, it will take several
more days for GM to make and ship enough parts to start reopening
its assembly plants. It is losing about $75 million for every
workday that its factories remain closed. With little prospect that
any assembly plants will reopen before the end of next week, GM
faces at least $300 million in losses in addition to the $1.18
billion in strike-related losses before the summer shutdown began.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, fed up with annual factory-level labor disputes
that have cost GM about $1 billion a year in lost after-tax
profits, has been demanding that any agreement assure labor peace
in the coming months. But at the annual UAW convention in Las Vegas
two weeks ago, Shoemaker mentioned that there could be further
strikes in Dayton and Indianapolis if GM did not improve its labor
relations practices.
</P>
<P>
   The factories in both cities supply many GM assembly plants, so
Shoemaker's widely reported remarks alarmed auto analysts and GM
investors, who have put pressure on the company to seek a solution.
A 17-day strike at the Dayton brake factories in 1996 also shut
down 26 of GM's assembly plants, with an after-tax cost of $900
million.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker said that it was a mistake for GM to pay so much
attention to the Dayton and Indianapolis disputes and contended
that GM had many factories with labor problems. Settling grievances
in Dayton and Indianapolis will not eliminate the risk of future
work stoppages elsewhere, he said, adding that the UAW would never
issue a blanket guarantee of labor peace at every factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't remove the threat of further potential strikes, and
they can't get a no-strike guarantee,'' Shoemaker said. ``All they
can really do, unless they step up and settle Dayton and
Indianapolis very quickly, is assure that there's a good chance
that this strike will be of a longer duration than would be
otherwise necessary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shoemaker said that it had not been a mistake for him to mention
Dayton and Indianapolis in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Both Knechtel and Shoemaker were grim about the likelihood of a
quick deal to settle the strikes here. ``Progress is being made,
it's not as fast as we'd like it to be,'' Knechtel said.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to the UAW said that rough compromises had
been reached on many issues at the two Flint factories and that
last-minute talks were focusing on whether workers here would be
paid for some vacation days that they missed while picketing. Local
union officials were quietly reserving auditoriums Friday for
ratification votes by members, possibly as soon as this weekend.
Even workers on the picket lines were told by the union not to talk
to reporters as both sides went out of their way to prevent any
disclosures or public criticisms that might slow an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Shoemaker denied that much had been accomplished, even in
talks at the two factories. ``The progress is very, very, very,
very slow and very disappointing,'' he said. ``There is hardly
anything resolved at either place.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the UAW said the union was trying to drive a
hard bargain with GM, particularly in demanding vacation pay. GM
stock price has been closely tracking the progress of negotiations,
rising several dollars on reports that a deal was near and dropping
when the two sides seemed unable to settle their differences. By
repeatedly issuing gloomy pronouncements on the talks, Shoemaker
has put pressure on GM to settle while also preventing workers from
raising their hopes, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the details of the bargaining here are not clear, the
negotiators have focused on solving local disputes over work rules,
worker safety and investments in the two struck factories here
rather than a national agreement that would address GM's broader
problems, like a work force larger than needed for its shrinking
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have also not addressed the broader question of what
GM will do about Delphi Automotive Systems, its auto parts
subsidiary. GM told the UAW more than a year ago that it would keep
at least 80 percent of Delphi even if it did a partial initial
public offering. Shoemaker said that the UAW had not taken a
position on even a partial offering. &QL;

 &HT;    Upbeat Reeves itching for July 23 to arrive
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Falcons finished their pre-training camp
work Friday with a voluntary passing workout in Suwanee. The next
time the team comes together, it will be for real.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp starts on July 23, and coach Dan Reeves can hardly
wait for players to put on pads and start hitting. It's difficult
to make evaluations when players are in cleats, shorts, jerseys and
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer you get (to training camp), the more excited you
get,'' he said. ``You start getting butterflies in your stomach.
(Third-year cornerback) Juran Bolden has great skills and has
improved, (second-year safety) Chris Bayne has made great progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``(First-round draft choice) Keith Brooking brings an energy
level that I think affects everyone. But I've been at this long
enough to know there are some guys who look good in these kinds of
things who will disappoint you when the pads are on, so we'll wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reeves took some positives from the 14 days of on-field
work. ``It's more teaching than anything ... where we work on
getting timing down, especially between quarterbacks and
receivers,'' he said. ``We work on a few things so that they're
fresher in the players' minds once training camp starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been excited by the program with (speed coach Loren
Seagrave). That was a great idea. I can see improvement, for
example, in (wide receiver) Terance Mathis. This has all been good
for the quarterbacks to see which receivers have an extra gear, and
how they get in and out of cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach has some concerns, too. There is no guarantee that
backup quarterback Steve DeBerg, 44, will make the team, and the
squad is thin on the defensive line, particularly at tackle.
Currently listed as backups are Nathan Davis, who was inactive for
14 of 16 games as a rookie last year, and Mark Campbell, a free
agent who was inactive for every game in Denver in 1995-96, and
played just a handful of games last year for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The team is about $1.6 million under the salary cap, so Falcons
officials will be on the lookout for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our depth on the defensive line is probably my biggest
concern,'' Reeves said. ``We're going to look at everybody, but
teams just don't let many of those guys go (in training camp).''
</P>
<P>
   Two-minute drill
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious Friday's workout was voluntary; about 35 of 80
players were present for the 45-minute practice. About half were
rookies or members of last year's practice squad. There were at
least four starters present, including Mathis, running back Jamal
Anderson, strongside linebacker Henri Crockett and fullback Bob
Christian. ... The only lingering injuries have been tendinitis in
Christian's knee and defensive end Chuck Smith's back strain.
Trainer Ron Medlin expects both players to be fine for the start of
training camp. ... Don't be fooled if you've seen the old black
Falcons logo with a big, red ``A'' covering part of it. The team is
not changing its logo. The new one is a secondary logo, used
chiefly for marketing purposes and NFL Properties. The all-black
bird with white trim is still No. 1. ... There has been no
significant progress on where training camp will be next year if
there is construction in Suwanee. Furman University officials will
soon present to the Falcons a preliminary plan to host camp. ...
Single-game tickets go on sale July 18 at the Georgia Dome and
Ticketmaster.

 &HT;    USDA leader to present his case on Wednesday
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman, who has
acknowledged that his agency has discriminated against black
farmers, will tell his story on Wednesday to the nation's oldest
civil rights organization _ the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of America's 18,000 black farmers also are expected on
the same day to address the national convention, but the lead
plaintiff in a $2.5 billion discrimination suit filed against the
United States Department of Agriculture says he will not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NAACP is being used by Democrats trying to
convince blacks they are doing all they can to settle the suit we
filed, when all Glickman has to do to resolve it is write a check
and sign it,'' said North Carolina farmer Tim Pigford, the lead
plaintiff in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the convention is expected to help give black farmers new
allies in their fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black farmers have appealed to us for help, and it is a just
cause,'' said the Rev. R. L. White, president of the Atlanta branch
of the NAACP. ``That is what the NAACP is all about. We try to call
attention to inequities wherever they are found.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, Glickman is expected to discuss ``Civil
Rights at the USDA _ the Progress We Have Made and the Challenges
We Face,'' according to spokeswoman Laura Trivers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of challenges facing Glickman and the USDA are piling
up:
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers who are suing the USDA are considering a sit-in
strike in Washington to demand Glickman's removal for what they see
as a failure to act on their complaints, lead attorney Alexander
Pires said.
</P>
<P>
   Court-ordered negotiations to settle the $2.5 billion suit
crumbled two weeks ago with no signs of the farmers or the USDA
moving closer to a settlement. At the same time, several black
farmers who have reached partial settlements still have not
received any checks.
</P>
<P>
   A companion lawsuit has been filed by another group of black
farmers from 14 states and the Virgin Islands month. The $500
million discrimination suit, filed on July 7, was on behalf of 129
black farmers whose complaints were made after Feb. 21, 1997, a
period not covered in the existing $2.5 billion discrimination
suit. The House of Representatives on June 24 waived the two-year
statute of limitation barring new complaints in old cases.
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Miller &AMP; Associates, an Atlanta-based consulting firm, also
is suing the USDA. The firm, which was hired by the USDA to
investigate complaints of discrimination by the nation's county
committees, says the USDA owes the firm some $400,000 for a report
it produced on disparity and racial discrimination within the
100,000-employee agency.
</P>
<P>
   John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers Association,
filed a formal complaint charging a USDA official allegedly used a
racial epithet in reference to him. John Sparks, special assistant
to Glickman for civil rights, said the Boyd complaint is hard to
resolve, since the only evidence is Boyd's word against the senior
official at the USDA, who denies making the remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Glickman has done more to right wrongs than anyone
before him,'' said Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have almost 100,000 folks working here who have a long
history of doing business one way, and it is going to take a while
to turn it around. We're talking about 30 years of problems allowed
to fester here and it's a tall order to require in a year they be
solved. All we can do is keep at it and take advantage of the
window of opportunity we have here with Glickman and the support of
President Bill Clinton,'' said Sparks.

 &HT;    Cochran urges NAACP to keep its dreams alive
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The big names are already in town as the NAACP kicks
off its annual convention this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Cochran Jr. gave the keynote address Friday during the
Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Memorial Lecture Luncheon, where he was
honored for his work as a civil rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles lawyer addressed shortcomings of the justice
system and urged the audience to take a more active role in
changing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been a people to give up,'' Cochran said. ``We
always come back.'' Quoting New York University law professor
Derrick Bell, Cochran said, ``Ours is a struggle that doesn't have
room to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 delegates are expected to arrive this weekend
for the 89th annual convention of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. The focus Friday was on the ACT-SO
competition, now in its 20th year. The 850 youth participants
arrived at the Georgia World Convention Center for orientation and
final rehearsals for ACT-SO, which stand for Afro-Academic
Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A showcase of high school students' talents in academics and the
performing arts, the ACT-SO competition's final judging is Monday.
Participants come from NAACP branches across the country, including
Atlanta's, which sponsored 13 students.
</P>
<P>
   While 72 students will walk away with college scholarships,
participant Kevin Richmond, a high school senior from Phoenix, said
the competition offers all young blacks a unique opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You often see athletes are glorified in the media. This is our
chance to show we can do something,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the registration line, Emmitt Carlton, president of
the Virginia NAACP, said he expects to be ``recharged'' when the
convention ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best part about coming to the convention,'' Carlton
said. ``You have the chance to hear something you can take back and
use.''

 &HT;    NBA referees plead guilty to tax fraud
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Two NBA referees, one active and one retired, pleaded
guilty Friday in federal court in Atlanta to tax fraud charges
involving their failure to report income pocketed from downgrading
first-class airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Madden, 60, who lives in Roswell, and Joe Forte, 54, of
Smyrna, face maximum sentences of three years in prison and
$250,000 fines. They will be sentenced Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials stood before U.S. District Judge J. Owen
Forrester while entering their guilty pleas. Madden and Forte are
well-known names to NBA fans. Madden, recognized as one of the best
referees in NBA history, retired in 1994 after having officiated
more than 35 NBA Finals games.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal criminal complaint, Madden and Forte
downgraded their first-class tickets given to them by the league
for coach seats and pocketed the difference and failed to report it
as income.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understood it was income, didn't you?'' Forrester asked
both referees, who admitted that they did. ``It felt like income.
It spent like income. The bottom line is you were getting more
money than it cost you, and you were enjoying the proceeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden and Forte are part of a federal crackdown on tax fraud
abuses by NBA refs. They were charged in Atlanta because they filed
their tax forms here. They bring to nine the number of current or
former referees to be charged nationwide. All but one have pleaded
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were charged with underreporting income on their
1993 returns. Forte reported income of $111,059 but failed to
report $30,019 in excess airfare reimbursements. Madden reported
income of $214,214 for 1993 and failed to report $31,611.
</P>
<P>
   According to their plea agreements, Forte failed to pay at least
$17,738 in taxes owed from 1991-93. Madden failed to pay $22,176 in
taxes over the same period. The two referees agreed to pay the
taxes plus penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Of the referees who have pleaded guilty and been sentenced, all
have received sentences of either probation or some sort of home
detention.
</P>
<P>
   But Forrester is an independent-minded jurist with a reputation
of being one of the toughest sentencing judges on the Atlanta
bench. And he reminded the two men that they should take nothing
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your lawyer might have expressed the hope you might get
probation, some short sentence, some favorable treatment,''
Forrester told the two men. ``But you should have no assurance
that's the way it will turn out.''

JUDGES DEPLORE LAW THAT SHIELDS HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: La., Ga., Miss., S.D., Okla., Mass., Colo., Mo., Ohio, Md.,
Calif., Wash.) (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR     c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal judges around the United States, frustrated
by cases in which patients who are denied medical benefits have no
right to sue, are urging Congress to consider changes in a 1974 law
that protects insurance companies and health-maintenance
organizations against legal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In their decisions, the judges do not offer detailed solutions
of the type being pushed in Congress by Democrats and some
Republicans. But they say their hands are tied by the 1974 law, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act. And they often lament the
results, saying that the law has not kept pace with changes in
health care and the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The law, known as ERISA, was adopted mainly because of
congressional concern that corrupt, incompetent pension managers
were looting or squandering the money entrusted to them.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which also governs health plans covering 125 million
Americans, sets stringent standards of conduct for the people who
run such plans, but severely limits the remedies available to
workers. The law does not allow damages for the improper denial or
processing of claims, which the courts have interpreted as
protecting HMOs even if they improperly deny care to a member.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit challenging the denial of benefits, a person in an
employer-sponsored health plan may recover the benefits in question
and can get an injunction clarifying the right to future benefits.
But judges have repeatedly held that the law does not allow
compensation for lost wages, death or disability, pain and
suffering, emotional distress or other harm that a patient suffers
as a result of the improper denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, reached a
typical conclusion in a lawsuit by a Louisiana woman whose(fetus
died after an insurance company refused to approve her
hospitalization for a high-risk pregnancy. The woman, Florence B.
Corcoran, and her husband sought damages under state law.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the suit, the court said, ``The Corcorans have no
remedy, state or federal, for what may have been a serious
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The court said that the harsh result ``would seem to warrant a
re-evaluation of ERISA so that it can continue to serve its noble
purpose of safeguarding the interests of employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and some Republicans in Congress are pushing
legislation that would make it easier for patients to sue HMOs and
insurance companies. If a doctor makes a wrong decision, he or she
can be sued, said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., but ``HMOs are
shielded from liability for their decisions by ERISA.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in ERISA will not come easily. The Supreme Court has
described it as ``an enormously complex and detailed statute'' that
carefully balances many powerful competing interests. Few members
of Congress understand the intricacies of the law. Insurance
companies, employers and Republican leaders strenuously oppose
changes, saying that any new liability for HMOs would increase the
cost of employee health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said
Friday that he had agreed to schedule floor debate on legislation
to regulate managed care within the next two weeks. Sen. Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader who had been seeking
such a debate, said Lott's commitment could be ``a very
consequential turning point'' if Democrats have a true opportunity
to offer their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the deputy Republican leader,
said, ``Republicans believe that health resources should be used
for patient care, not to pay trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to regulate managed care have become an issue in this
year's elections, and the hottest question of all is whether
patients should be able to sue their HMOs. But the judges' concerns
run deeper than politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusions come not from campaign consultants, but from
years of courtroom experience. Their views, stated with plaintive
candor, are found not in sound bites or campaign commercials, but
in the ponderous prose of judicial opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent case, Judge William Young of U.S. District Court in
Boston said, ``It is deeply troubling that in the health-insurance
context, ERISA has evolved into a shield of immunity which thwarts
the legitimate claims of the very people it was designed to
protect.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was distressed by ``the failure of Congress to
amend a statute that, due to the changing realities of the modern
health-care system, has gone conspicuously awry,'' leaving many
consumers ``without any remedy'' for the wrongful denial of health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over benefits have become common as more employers
provide coverage to workers through HMOs and other types of managed
care, which try to rein in costs by controlling the use of
services.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are some examples of the ways in which judges have
expressed concern:
</P>
<P>
   _ Judge John Porfilio of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in Denver, said he was ``moved by the tragic circumstances'' of a
woman with leukemia who died after her HMO refused approval for a
bone-marrow transplant. But, he said, the 1974 law ``gives us no
choice,'' and the woman's husband, who had sued for damages, is
``left without a remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in St. Louis, said the
law fully pRotected an HMO against a suit by the family of a
Missouri man, Buddy Kuhl, who died after being denied approval for
heart surgery recommended by his doctors. ``Modification of ERISA
in light of questionable modern insurance practices must be the job
of Congress, not the courts,'' said Judge Arlen Beam.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Cincinnati, said
that federal law barred claims !gainst a ``utilization review''
company that refused to approve psychiatric care for a man who
later committed suicide. Because of ERISA, the court said, people
who sue an HMO or an insurer for wrongful death ``may be left
without a meaningful remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton, in Worcester, Mass.,
said that the husband of a woman who died of breast cancer was
``left without any meaningful remedy'' against an HMO that had
refused to authorize treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis, in Baltimore, acknowledged
that a Maryland man may be left ``without an adequate remedy'' for
damages caused by his HMO's refusal to pay for eye surgery and
other necessary treatments. But, Garbis said, whether ERISA should
be ``re-examined and reformed in light of modern health care is an
issue which must be addressed and resolved by the legislature
rather than the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, ruled
last month that an insurance company did not have to surrender the
money it saved by denying care to a Seattle woman, Rhonda Bast, who
later died of breast cancer. ``This case presents a tragic set of
facts,'' Judge David Thompson said. But ``without action by
Congress, there is nothing we can do to help the Basts and others
who may find themselves in this same unfortunate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The denial of health benefits means something very different
today from what it meant in 1974, when ERISA was passed. At that
time, an insured worker would visit the doctor and then, if a claim
was disallowed, haggle with the insurance company over who should
pay. But now, in the era of managed care, treatment itself may be
delayed or denied, and this ``can lead to damages far beyond the
out-of-pocket cost of the treatment at issue,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have been successfully sued. A California lawyer, Mark
Hiepler, won a multimillion jury verdict against an HMO that denied
a bone-marrow transplant to his sister, Nelene Fox, who later died
of breast cancer. But that case was unusual. Mrs. Fox was insured
through a local school district, and such ``governmental plans''
are not generally covered by ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal of ERISA was to protect workers, and to that
end the law established procedures for settling claim disputes. But
the Supreme Court has said the law was also intended to encourage
the formation of employee-benefit plans and to establish
comprehensive uniform federal standards, so multistate employers
would not have to comply with a hodgepodge of conflicting local
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ERISA supersedes any state laws that may ``relate to'' an
employee-benefit plan, regardless of whether the state law
conflicts with the federal law. ERISA does not allow damages for
the improper denial or processing of claims, and judges have held
that the federal law, in effect, nullifies state laws that allow
such damages.

HIGH-TECH FIRMS OPPOSE HOUSE FOREIGN-WORKER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Congress this year seems poised to admit more
foreigners to the United States to work as computer programmers,
nurses and in other skilled jobs. But an attempt by a House panel
to ensure that the foreigners do not displace American workers is
now under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Oracle Corp. and
25 other high-tech firms, in their first joint statement on the
issue, said the House plan could undermine the whole foreign-worker
program.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan is ``unworkable, impractical and burdensome,''
the executives said in a letter to congressional leaders, and could
put companies in such legal jeopardy that they might be forced to
limit their use of foreign labor. ``The effect will be to hurt our
competitiveness, cost American jobs, and aid the foreign companies
with which we compete,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Their letter, dated Thursday, follows a similar complaint signed
by at least six House members about the foreign-worker plan.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a plan to boost the number of foreign workers
admitted to the United States to take skilled jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows 65,000 foreigners into the United States each
year on H-1B visas, which allow them to work for up to six years.
Employers, including Massachusetts companies like EMC Corp. and
Keane Inc., are calling for more visas, saying the strong economy
has left a shortage of computer programmers and other high-tech
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has voted to boost the annual quota to 115,000 visas.
But the House Judiciary Committee, while backing the increase in
visas, has added new rules for employers.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee says that companies using H-1B workers
should certify that they have not laid off an American worker 60
days before or 30 days after hiring the foreigner. The committee
also voted to require companies to certify to the Department of
Labor that they tried to recruit an American before hiring a
foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements, in part, are an attempt to answer critics who
say there is no high-tech labor shortage and no need for more
visas.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and other workers say that employers want the new
visas merely to take advantage of low-cost foreign labor. They say
companies could draw plenty of US high-tech workers if they raised
wages or were more willing to hire the older workers who lost their
jobs as big computer companies downsized in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-tech executives, who are members of a trade group
called Technology Network, say that forcing companies to make
legally binding statements about layoffs and recruitment gives the
government a chance to intrude in their business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the required statements ``will allow any potential
job seeker who is not hired, or any dismissed employee, to file a
complaint blaming his or her situation on the hiring of an H-1B
employee and thereby subject his or her employer to years of
Department of Labor investigation,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders received similar complaints in a June 25 letter
from six House members, led by Representative David MacIntosh,
Republican of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The letters come as House and Senate lawmakers try to hammer out
their differences over the visa plan. Lawmakers have held at least
two meetings to resolve their differences, and Representative Lamar
Smith, a Texas Republican who leads a House immigration panel, has
met several times with industry groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks have produced little progress so far, and the visa
plan remains stalled. More talks are expected when the House
returns from a recess next week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Micrsoft, Oracle and Intel, executives from Sun
Microsystems, 3COM, Rockwell International, Yahoo!, Novell and
other companies signed the Technology Network letter.

INS CHIEF, RENO HONOR FALLEN BORDER PATROL AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NATHALIE TREPANIER,   JOHN MacCORMACK and REGINA MONTAGUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ The brotherhood of green became a sisterhood
as well Friday as U.S. Border Patrol agents from around the nation
honored the agent who died wearing badge number 7097.
</P>
<P>
   In a service attended by nearly 1,000 people at the Queen of
Peace Roman Catholic Church here, Susan Lynn Rodriguez was
remembered as a mother, wife, sister and daughter _ and a model
agent.
</P>
<P>
   And as Doris Meissner, the commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, noted in a tearful eulogy, Rodriguez will
be remembered by history for something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply sorry that Agent Rodriguez is the first woman in
the 77-year history of the Border Patrol to make the ultimate
sacrifice for her country,'' said Meissner, whose agency oversees
the Border Patrol and its green-uniformed officers. ``It makes it
all so ever more difficult to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 28, and rookie agent Ricardo Guillermo Salinas, 24,
were gunned down Tuesday helping local law enforcement agents
investigate a double homicide in nearby San Benito. The suspected
gunman, Ernest Moore, 25, was mortally wounded in a gunfight with
the police and was buried Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno praised Rodriguez as a servant of
the nation and as a woman who led the way for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would say to all women in the Border Patrol,
`Never stop dreaming,''' Reno said. ``She would ask us to leave
here today with dignity, although she would forgive us a few
tears,'' the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the service, Rodriguez's body, in a cherry
coffin draped with an American flag, was carried from the church
between two long lines of green to the waiting hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband Gilbert, an immigration officer, accepted the folded
flag and then an embrace, and the hearse left for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday in San Antonio, Reno praised those who risk their
lives for their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricardo Salinas was a great example of the men and women who
serve,'' she told told a packed San Fernando Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his name let us go forth from here today. To rededicate
ourselves to this nation he served and loved and died for. To what
this nation stands for. And let us strive, as Agent Salinas
strived, to do our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Patrick Flores presided over the hour-long ceremony,
offering words of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great monument that could be built in the memory and honor
of Ricardo would be to say that we are not going to do to others
what was done to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agents from Texas and other states attended the
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brotherhood _ a sisterhood, too, now _ and even if you
don't know them, you come to the funerals,'' said Larry Arthurs, a
Border Patrol agent in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain risk you take when you carry a gun and a
badge, and this is the ultimate price you have to pay. Any agent
will tell you the same thing,'' said Agent Mark Lazarski, also of
Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she left a 2-year-old daughter and a husband,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's father, Steve Williams, is a retired Border Patrol
deputy sector chief.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgriguez was the training officer for Salinas, who had joined
the border force only a few months earlier and was still on
probation at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was buried at the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery in
San Antonio. Rodriguez will be buried Sunday at the Painted Rock
Cemetery in Philadelphia, Tenn.

GM, UNION WORK TO END STRIKE BY MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors and United Auto Workers officials have begun
negotiating virtually around the clock in hopes of ending by Monday
the bitter six-week-old strike that has so far cost the company
$1.2 billion and idled 161,000 workers across the country. But
observers say such huge differences remain on the table that a
weekend settlement is practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a manic process,'' said Greg Gardner, senior
editor of the trade publication Ward's Auto World. ``They talk
until they're exhausted, they crash for awhile and then they go
back at it. But the big issues are still unresolved. They say they
want something before the weekend is over, but I don't see any way
that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers said GM is pressing for union concessions such as a
guarantee that UAW won't strike any of the company's U.S. plants
for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very hard to imagine they're going to relinquish the
right to strike,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   The union likewise has given little ground on company demands
that workers at assembly plants in Flint, Mich., be forced to
produce more and at faster rates.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began June 5, when workers at GM's Flint Metal Center
walked out citing the company's refusal to hire more staff and
replace broken-down equipment. A week later, in keeping with a
union strategy to disrupt the release of a new line of pickups,
employees at a parts factory across town joined the strike. Without
parts to work with, 26 of GM's 29 assembly plants nationwide were
idled.
</P>
<P>
   So far, GM has had to cancel prduction on 227,000 cars and
trucks in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Recovering from the
loss in sales will take months, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   While GM earlier said it intended to hold out for big
concessions, the strike has taken an unusually heavy toll. Analysts
earlier had said the company was willing to lose at least $2
billion to wait out the union. Having already lost $1.2 billion, GM
may not want to wait much longer, observers said. The company has
already taken drastic cash-saving measures like shutting off all
power at plants affected by the strike _ something it has never had
to do before.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of time pressure on GM is the strike's
disruption of a planned new line of pickup trucks, slated for
release in the fall. The line is viewed by the company a key
element in a plan to revamp its public image. The trucks are
expected to be among GM's biggest money makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they start trying to gear up for the new model year is when
they're really going to get hurt,'' said John Stamm, a professor at
Babson College who has followed GM's labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also said GM may be anxious to settle the strike
before second-quarter earnings are released Tuesday. Analysts say
profits will be strong in the period, a fact that could fuel
anti-company sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The union is also feeling the heat, observers said.
Increasingly, striking workers _ paid a fraction of their salary
from the union's $800 million strike fund _ have put pressure on
UAW leaders to resolve the strike before their own money runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Racheting up pressure earlier this week, GM officials said they
have prepared a detailed cost-cutting plan that includes the
unprecedented move of cutting off medical benefits to striking
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is serious posturing,'' Gardner said. ``Whether or not
they actually do that, it puts a lot of pressure on union leaders,
who are already hearing from the rank and file that people are
starting to miss mortgage payments or that they've got to come up
with tuition for the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a quick solution appears unlikely, observers said there
are signs of conciliation. In a taped telephone message, GM vice
president Donald Hackworth said Friday that ``settling the strike
is a top priority, and nothing is more important than getting our
employees back to work.''

FROM DANCING GIRL TO WEALTHY WIDOW TO POSSIBLE MURDER VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., La.)  (bl) 
 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her nickname was Zambi. That's what her fellow
dancers at Radio City called the petite 17-year-old from New
Orleans with big dreams and bigger ambitions. She was tough, she
was flirtatious and she married well enough to leave the arduous
seven-show-a-week life of a music hall ballerina far behind.
</P>
<P>
   But Irene Zambelli Silverman, the wealthy 82-year-old widow who
disappeared last Sunday from her East 65th Street mansion and is
now feared dead, never quite shook off the glitter of her stage
days.
</P>
<P>
   Well into her 70s, she swept into an awards dinner for a friend
accompanied by an escort of 10 well-built young men. On her cue,
they all dutifully applauded and cheered the surprised recipient,
who recalls her mischievously explaining at the time, ``I rented
them for the night.''
</P>
<P>
   She also took up academics at a relatively late age _ and with
the same idiosyncratic approach. After signing up for a few history
courses in the mid-1970s at Columbia University, Mrs. Silverman
delighted classmates by arriving with a wheel of aged Brie cheese
or ordering in catered lunches and afternoon tea for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She decided to write a life and did it by living it _ and she
more or less lived it to the hilt,'' said James Shenton, a Columbia
University history professor. Like others, he has begun to talk of
his friend of 25 years in the past tense since police announced
they are holding Kenneth and Sante Kines, a former tenant and his
mother, who were found with Mrs. Silverman's passport and other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   To hear her friends tell it, the life that Mrs. Silverman
improvised for herself turned out to be as colorful as any young
showgirl's fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an immigrant Greek seamstress and an
Italian-American father whom she once described as ``living on the
edge of respectability'' before he left the family, Mrs. Silverman
told friends that her mother brought her to New York City at the
age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of years of ballet classes in her native New Orleans,
she soon got a job in the ``corps de ballet'' at Radio City Music
Hall. It was a matter of enduring irritation to her that many
people assumed she had been a Rockette and not a ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to make it clear it was more than chorus line; it
had more of a patina of cultivation,'' said Ronald Grele, head of
the oral history research office at Columbia, who was befriended by
Mrs. Silverman about 16 years ago when she became interested in
tape-recording her mother's memories of the millinery trade.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the ballet corps traded time on the Radio City
stage with the Rockettes, performing both excerpts from the
classics and some original numbers. ``Some of it was for the masses
and was a little bit corny, but some of it was magnificent,'' said
Janice Herbert, another Radio City ballet alumnus who joined the
troupe 10 years after Mrs. Silverman had retired. ``It was probably
the hardest job in New York _ every day, 365 days a year, with
rehearsals between shows. Plus, the stage is cement.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1940s, young Zambi apparently had had enough. And
she was being pursued by a persistent young real estate man named
Samuel Silverman who apparently picked her out from the group of
young dancers and fell head over heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the old stage-door Johnny,'' said Stuart Ho, president
of Capital Investment of Hawaii Inc., who first met Mr. Silverman
in 1963 and remained close friends with the couple for many years.
``Irene was one of these Auntie Mame types. She was a little bubbly
and ebullient and yet could be very serious. He was a brilliant
man, with connections at the very highest levels.''
</P>
<P>
   In retelling the story many years later, Mrs. Silverman would
claim that she at first resisted Samuel's entreaties. ``Then,
whatever reservations I had were overcome by the realization he was
going to make me rich,'' she told Shenton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 the two were married in a synagogue around the corner
from Radio City. Mrs. Silverman, a Roman Catholic, once joked to a
friend that, with a Greek mother and an Italian father, ``I decided
I'd better do something about it _ so I anglicized myself by
marrying a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the couple traveled extensively in Europe on
business. According to Ho, Mr. Silverman worked for Empire Trust
Co. of New York, then one of the city's biggest banks, before
striking out on his own as a mortgage broker. He developed
properties in France and later Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days just after statehood in 1959, when financial
institutions on the mainland weren't familiar with Hawaii as an
investment area, it was Sam Silverman who provided the connections
and advice in New York City,'' recalled Ho, whose company is one of
the largest real estate developers in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Silverman also worked with a number of other big developers,
including Los Angeles theater chain owner William Forman, and
worked particularly closely with Columbia University in building
its real-estate portfolio in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Silverman, apparently about 10 years older than his
wife, remains something of a mystery to her friends. Shenton, for
instance, is convinced that Mr. Silverman grew up on the Lower East
Side and was essentially self-taught. Other friends said they had
the impression Mr. Silverman was from the Midwest. Ho said he was
told by Mr. Silverman that he graduated from Columbia University
Law School, although a spokesman for the school could find no
record of his attendance.
</P>
<P>
   While he was alive, the Silvermans were always on the move. They
had an apartment in Honolulu, which Mrs. Silverman donated to
Columbia University after her husband died. They also had a large
apartment on the Place de l'Opera in central Paris that backed up
onto the Comedie Francaise theater. Whenever there was a
performance, the voices of the actors and the audience's applause
could be heard clearly _ and loudly _ in the Silvermans' living
room, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The combined elegance and eccentricity of the place seemed to
suit Mrs. Silverman. ``She always dreamed of living in 18th century
Paris and holding `soirees,''' said Shenton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the Silvermans had purchased the limestone mansion at
20 E. 65th St. Mr. Silverman had resisted at first, but the posh
address, he later admitted, was good for his business. For Mrs.
Silverman, it was the beginning of an enduring love affair and she
began collecting what she called ``scraps of ephemeria'' about the
history of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Her research led her to a descendant of the Sherrill family that
had built the house at the turn of the century. As she recounted
the experience to Christopher Gray, an architectural historian who
wrote about the home for The New York Times, George Gibbs Sherrill
acted as though ``he hated the idea Jews bought the house.''
</P>
<P>
   But in her distinctively peppery fashion, Mrs. Silverman found a
way to avenge the perceived slight to her husband. Some years
later, she wrote in a letter to Gray, she found a locked safe in
the house. She had workmen open it. Inside was a cache of old
military medals, apparently left behind by the Sherrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a little charm bracelet of all the medals. That was my
way of getting back at them,'' she wrote in her characteristically
bold handwriting. ``I did it and I'm not afraid to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman did not deny herself much. Champagne flowed
freely in her house, recalled Robert Jakoubek, a publishing
industry executive who met her when they attended history classes
at Columbia together. A dinner at her house might well be fine
French food or, just as likely, rice and beans or bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwiches. She sometimes also served up merciless
imitations of acquaintances and strangers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had one of the most observant eyes, especially when it
comes to human anatomy. I remember a long digression on the
unfortunate chin of Kenneth Starr,'' said Jakoubek, recalling a
recent conversation with Mrs. Silverman about the special
prosecutor. ``And her observations were never politically
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   After her husband died, Mrs. Silverman consolidated a lifetime's
worth of artwork, antiques, shoes, clothing and memorabilia into a
top floor duplex of her mansion and subdivided the rest into
individual apartments, each one with a different layout and
character. She never gave her friends a clear answer when they
asked why she bothered.
</P>
<P>
   But it must have fulfilled her dream of that Parisian-style
salon, with her at the epicenter of social activity, as she rented
out to strangers and celebrities like conductor Peter Duchin,
singer Chaka Khan and author Andrew Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Renters learned to live with their landlady's restless
redecorating and somewhat eclectic tastes. She hung a painting said
to be a Renoir in a bathroom. The furniture changed on a regular
basis, although not always for aesthetic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a work-in-progress,'' said Henry Sinkel, a
former tenant. ``Something was always being puffed, fluffed,
renovated and changed. You never knew when you walked in if
something wasn't being fine-tuned.'' When she realized Sinkel was
seeing a lot of a particular woman, she surprised him one day by
removing the bed in his apartment and replacing it with a bigger
one.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mrs. Silverman had begun an autobiography,
friends said. She filled sheet after sheet of paper with her large
scrolling writing, often dashing off some of the more amusing
recollections in letters to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   But she was slowing down. She had begun to tire more easily,
complained of aches and pains and had surgery on the tear ducts of
her eyes. Dinner guests would be shooed out of the house before 9
p.m., so she could go upstairs and watch television before dropping
off to sleep. She began to collect the clothes her mother had sewn
for donation to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and set up a
foundation, named the Coby Foundation for her mother, to promote
research into the millinery trade.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends cannot imagine that she simply disappeared. A quiet
exit didn't fit her temperament. ``She had a temper,'' said
Shenton, who believes she must have fought fiercely with any
attacker. ``She once said to me, `Never forget, I grew up in New
Orleans and I know what a fishmonger's wife is.'' &QL;

THINKING RATIONALLY AS THE WEB GOES WILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 12) 
(jt) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a wild week on Wall Street for Internet stocks. But
because many of these fledgling companies may be years away from
actually making money, the sight of their stocks skyrocketing one
day and plummeting the next is enough to make investors wonder if
the Internet is paved with gold or just a high-technology version
of the tulip craze.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much doubt that people who have been riding the
wave this year have done well. The Interactive Week Internet Index,
a group of 50 companies, has risen 46 percent this year. After
hitting a record last Monday, the index retreated but still ended
the week up 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks have been good for managers like Paul Cook, a
former director of information technology at Munder Capital
Management in Birmingham, Mich., who now runs the Munder NetNet
fund, which invests in companies engaged in research, design,
development and manufacturing related to the Internet. specific
holdings described below
</P>
<P>
   Since it began in August 1996, this fund, with a maximum 5.5
percent load, or initial sales charge, and $33 million in assets,
is up more than 57 percent on average per year. So far this year,
it has risen more than 37 percent, excluding the load.
</P>
<P>
   During a business trip last week to the Research Triangle of
North Carolina, Cook took some time to talk about the current
mania.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What has been driving the big moves in these stocks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think a lot of it is driven by speculation about who will
be the next company to get snapped up by a much bigger company from
another medium as a way of buying their way on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I think there has been a bit of a short squeeze on some of
these stocks. And there are momentum players who are involved. I
hear that this is a retail phenomenon, but I don't believe it. If
it is, there are some awfully big retail players out there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Those sorts of conditions have pushed prices for a number of
these stocks to very high levels. What do you say to an investor
who either owns or is contemplating a purchase of a stock like
Yahoo, for instance?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think Yahoo is overvalued and has been overvalued for a
while. But I would not short it. Anyone who did that in the last
couple of months has gotten creamed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You own 50 stocks out of what you see as a universe of 600
companies. Are there really 600 Internet companies out there? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would guess there are only about 25 pure Internet stocks,
companies like Onsale, Inktomi, Doubleclick and Gravity.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund is not a pure Internet fund. What we are looking
for are beneficiaries of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your biggest holding currently?
</P>
<P>
   A. Microsoft. And we also own companies in areas like finance,
where companies like Charles Schwab, E-Trade and Ameritrade are
giving their customers the opportunity to buy and sell stocks over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What other groups do you see as beneficiaries of the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A. Security firms who ward off hackers or insure that a
transaction works. Hardware companies like Sun Microsystems, as
well as anyone else making servers, like Cisco Systems. Content
providers like Cnet. And consulting companies like Forrester
Research, Medigroup and the Gartner Group. Those companies will be
important in helping others construct their best Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   We also like so-called portal stocks like America Online, a
stock that has done extremely well. But we also like Worldcom and
MCI. These stocks are pretty frothy, but I don't think they are
fully valued yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your opinion on Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   A. I own Amazon. I used to be overweight in the stock. Now I am
underweight. But I think they have a real opportunity to leverage
their brand to sell not only books and CD's but cigars and wine, to
become the supermarket of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There are an awful lot of companies that are putting an awful
lot of what they sell in other ways onto the Internet for free.
When they start to charge customers for the information, isn't
there a risk that customers won't pay the freight? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is the risk that people will not buy what Internet
companies are selling. But I think that over the long term, as more
and more companies start building their own Internet presence, you
will get a critical mass of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Much of the growth in the Internet has occurred during
extremely good economic times. What happens when the United States
economy turns down?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the digital economy is decoupling from the regular
economy. The price of entry to get on the Internet is coming down.
In my view, the forces for the digital economy will survive better
than other sectors of the economy in a recession, because it is in
the process of ramping up, with its own evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sorts of things do bother you?
</P>
<P>
   A. The biggest issue I have with these stocks is that next year
there will be 300,000 positions for information technology
professionals, and colleges and universities will generate only
34,000 who are qualified to fill the jobs. That means it will be
hard for the companies to add people as needed, and they will have
to spend money as needed to get good people. That, in turn, will
drive up the price of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What advice would you give investors who are interested in
sinking money into some of these stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. A lot of information about these companies is flying around
out there, and a lot of it is rumor. I would stay clear of rumors.
Try to make informed decisions. At the moment, I don't know how
many investors are doing that. I think a lot of investors are just
chasing these stocks up, and that scares me.
</P>
<P>
   But at this stage it is too hard to pick winners and losers,
which makes it difficult to pick one or two names. You should
either create your own basket of stocks or buy a fund. That is why
we created ours. &QL;

CAL RIPKEN STREAK VIEWED DIFFERENTLY THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ If it makes you feel any better, Cal Ripken missed a
few days of school when he was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't one of those perfect attendance guys,'' he said
before playing in consecutive game No. 2,568 last night.
</P>
<P>
   His streak goes back to 1982 and it helped save baseball in the
dark summer of 1995. In an age of spoiled athletes who take the
money and lie down on the job, Ripken carries the work ethic of the
fans in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, now that the Orioles stink, the streak has become the
embodiment of everything that's wrong in Baltimore. Brooks Robinson
believes the streak is a mistake. Bob Costas says everybody can use
a day off. A Baltimore columnist wrote that the streak has become
more important than winning.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken and the Orioles have become prisoners of the streak.
There are fans and writers in Baltimore who think that Ray Miller
replaced Davey Johnson as manager because Johnson was not afraid to
end the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always amazes me,'' Ripken said before Friday night's game
against the Red Sox. ``At a low point or a frustrating point, I
wonder, `Why do I have to sit here and actually defend the desire
to go out and play?' I think it should be the people that don't
want to play that should have to defend their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the streak the reason why we're losing? Is the streak the
reason why we won last year? The answer to both is no. It kind of
makes me laugh a little bit the way it is brought up. The issue
should be performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller won't admit to any pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time comes for him to sit down, he'll do it himself,
or I'll do it,'' said the manager. ``If I thought he was hurt to
the point where he couldn't help us, I'd sit him down. He was
probably one day away from taking himself out last year with his
back. Probably it'll be an injury or retirement. I wish I had 24
other guys with a two-week streak. We'd be in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, 38 next month, won't answer hypotheticals about how the
streak might end, but it's hard to imagine Miller, or any manager,
putting Ripken on the bench without the star's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak, like everything else, will take care of itself,''
Ripken said. ``If something happens, it happens. It could end with
an injury. It could end in many different ways. When it presents
itself, who knows? How am I supposed to know how it will end?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Palmer says it's not a matter of giving Ripken a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't do anyone much good,'' said the Hall of Fame hurler
who teamed with Ripken to win a World Series in 1983. ``It's more a
matter of looking at your lineup on a given day, and seeing if you
might have a lefthanded-hitting third baseman who has a better
chance against a hard-throwing righty that day. But this team
doesn't really have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's backup is Jeff Reboulet. Reboulet bats right and is
hitting .278 with no homers and three RBIs. Ripken entered Friday
night's game hitting .258 with seven homers and 37 RBIs, numbers
almost identical to those of Boston third baseman, John Valentin
(.263, 11, 37) who is 31 and just signed a four-year contract.
Ripken delivered the game-winning, two-out, two-strike single
against the Red Sox Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to play every day, you have to be worthy,'' said
Ripken. ``If at some point, you're not worthy, it ends. But so far
it hasn't. When I no longer deserve to be the every-day third
baseman, it'll end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strip away everything and it's simple. I'm a baseball player.
I love being a baseball player. You have a small window in the
grand scheme of things to be a baseball player. You can't play
until you're 65. To me, I'm healhty and I want to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the good things that has come out of the streak is that
people relate to it and apply the same approach to what they do.
It's important to them, the same way coming to the ballpark and
being ready to play is important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   True. The hero in every household is the tired parent who hauls
his or her butt out of bed and goes to work ... every ... single
... day. Though Ripken is paid millions to play a kid's game, he
provides America's plumbers, teachers, painters, and factory
workers with a reason to believe in professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles play the Red Sox again Saturday at 1:15. Cal Ripken
is expected to be in the lineup.

YELTSIN URGES WESTERN LEADERS TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (hlw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin went over the head of the
International Monetary Fund on Friday and urged Western leaders to
support a multi-billion-dollar package of financial assistance to
defend the Russian currency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they were now seeking assistance of $20
billion or more, at least $10 billion of which it hopes would come
from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The total is $5 billion to $10 billion more than the government
previously said it needed, and the request to the IMF is about
twice what the fund has spoken of providing.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded request reflects Moscow's anxiety about a rapidly
deteriorating economic situation, which is not only threatening the
stability of the ruble but threatening to shake the foundations of
Russia's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary series of appeals, Yeltsin telephoned
President Clinton, President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany. The Russian president also called Michel Camdessus, the
head of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the Clinton administration expressed support for the
beleaguered Yeltsin government, which has been locked in difficult
negotiations with a tight-fisted IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said that Russia needs to take firm measures to deal
with its financial crisis. But it also indicated that the IMF needs
to provide substantial loans to calm the financial markets and
should make realistic demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States government certainly agrees that Russia
needs an IMF program that works, one that the Russian government is
both capable of implementing and that addresses the country's most
pressing financial and structural problems,'' the White House
spokesman, Mike McCurry, said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's time for these negotiations to come to
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yeltsin government and the IMF are in some agreement about
the overall direction of economic reform but not the pace. The
Russians feel that their financial markets are so shaky right now
that they face an emergency and cannot afford dragged-out
negotiations. Earlier on Friday, the Yeltsin government painted a
bleak picture of the pressures that have forced it to go hat in
hand to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation on financial markets has gotten worse,'' Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko told the upper house of parliament.
``Treasury bill yields are rising. Social tension is also growing.
We are ready to consider any proposal, but we simply cannot fail to
repay treasury bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin spoke in even starker terms of social tensions. He
warned against any ``extremist'' plans to exploit the financial
crisis to dislodge him from power.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, there have been repeated calls for Yeltsin's
resignation, including from coal miners protesting wage arrears. So
far, however, there have not been any dramatic challenges to
Yeltsin's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough force to cut short any extremist plans to seize
power,'' Yeltsin said in an address to senior military officers.
``They will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's focus, however, was not so much on challenges to
Yeltsin's authority as on the economic assistance the Kremlin says
is needed to maintain stability.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The loans that Yeltsin is seeking would be used for two
purposes. The main one is to shore up the reserves of the Central
Bank and prop up the ruble. Another aim is to restructure its
short-term debt, which Russia has been forced to issue at enormous
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Yeltsin government said it needed $10 billion to
$15 billion in new loans. But on Friday, two senior Russian
officials said the financial markets were in such distress that $20
billion or more was now required. A major debate concerns how much
money the IMF should contribute to the overall package. The IMF
recently discussed providing only $5.8 billion in new loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are negotiating to assemble a financial package
from several sources. According to the Russian plan, about $10
billion to $12 billion would come from the IMF. They are wrapping
up negotiations to borrow about a billion dollars from the World
Bank and some $800 million from the Japanese. The Russians also are
in negotiations to to borrow $10 billion from Western commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
   But putting together that package has proved to be very
difficult. For one thing, the IMF has made clear that it would not
disburse new loans unless Russia took bold steps to cut its federal
deficit and win support for tax reform and revenue raising measures
in the Communist-dominated parliament. The parliament has scheduled
a decisive session on Yeltsin's plan last next week.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk with Clinton, Yeltsin sought American pressure on
the fund to speedily complete negotiations so that the Kremlin
could obtain desperately needed funds. The U.S. and the other
countries that Yeltsin called on Friday are the principal backers
and contributors to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing his plight, Yeltsin spoke of the difficulties he
faced in winning support for his deficit-cutting measures and tax
reforms in the Communist-dominated parliament. He also underscored
the steps he was taking to deal with the problem, including trying
to collect taxes from Gazprom, the nation's biggest corporation.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States is supportive, American officials said
Clinton also told the Russian president that he needed to get his
economic program through the parliament or impose new fiscal
measures by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin did not ask for direct American assistance or try to
negotiate over the amount.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin aides have also been looking to the United States
Treasury Department for help. ``The U.S. Treasury Department is
pushing the IMF to get a swift but firm agreement in order to avoid
devaluing the ruble,'' said Anders Aslund, an expert on the Russian
economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``The
Treasury Department understands how dangerous an economic meltdown
in Russia would be.''
</P>
<P>
   John Odling-Smee, a senior IMF official, arrived here for talks
on Friday, stirring expectations that a preliminary deal might be
struck this weekend for the expanded program of assistance Moscow
has been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial round of discussions between Odling-Smee and
Anatoly Chubais, the chief Russian representative in the talks, did
not go entirely smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Odling-Smee reportedly argued that the Yeltsin government's
revenue projections were off by $5 billion, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the difficulties have been with the fund. There have
been problems with commercial banks as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians would like to be able to use the funds they borrow
without restriction. But some Western banks are insisting that the
funds be used to buy back Russian treasury bills the banks are
holding.
</P>
<P>
   The visit this month by Vice President Al Gore and the September
summit meeting here between Clinton and Yeltsin have helped focus
American attention on Russia and its economic travails.
</P>
<P>
   But while Yeltsin was seeking help, his prime minister was
striving to build parliamentary support for the government's
measures to cut the deficit and restructure the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the upper house of parliament, Kiriyenko
painted a disturbing portrait of the nation's economic ills and
warned that the failure to act would plunge the country into
economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house, which has always been more pliant than the
Communist-dominated lower chamber, gave its broad support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must pool our efforts,'' Kiriyenko said. ``Failing that, we
will be responsible for ruining the country.''

COMMENTARY: TINA AND DISNEY ELOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago I went with the last surviving habitue of the
Algonquin Round Table, the artist Al Hirschfeld, to his old
stomping ground in search of the past. The Algonquin Hotel has just
been lovingly refurbished, but the past wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make no attempt to recreate the table exactly,'' said
Hirschfeld, 95, who pointed out the spot in the room where he used
to dine with Dorothy Parker, Charles MacArthur and Robert Benchley.
Not that the unsentimental Hirschfeld minded. ``The round table was
square anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Algonquin Round Table isn't coming back, neither are
Harold Ross, William Shawn or any other patron saint of the
magazine that made the Algonquin its canteen, The New Yorker. But
this week, as Tina Brown made her exit from the editor's chair, New
York's media world was once again consumed with nostalgia about The
New Yorker's history and florid speculation about its future.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ms. Brown's successor make Shawn, often said to be spinning
in his grave, spin even faster than he has been since Lillian Ross
told all about their extramarital affair? Or might there be a
return to the buzz-free days when a New Yorker reader could open
the magazine knowing that the babes in a Peter Arno cartoon would
peacefully coexist with Hannah Arendt?
</P>
<P>
   Consider this column a nostalgia-and-speculation-free zone about
The New Yorker, because the real story of the week isn't where Tina
Brown is leaving but where she is going: Disney. Her arrival in the
Disney empire _ through the auspices of Harvey Weinstein of its
Miramax Films division _ is yet another coup for a corporation
whose vision, invented by Walt Disney and perfected by Michael
Eisner, is as consistent as it is relentless and, at times,
ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Ms. Brown's new venture in a way date back to the
old New Yorker. It was Shawn who in 1965 published Truman Capote's
``In Cold Blood,'' the prototype of the novelistic,
narrative-driven New Journalism that could be spun off as both book
and Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   By creating a new company within Disney-Miramax that can handle
all possible incarnations of today's heirs to ``In Cold Blood'' _
Ms. Brown's operation will publish a magazine and books, and
produce movies and TV _ Disney can seamlessly control and own such
content from the cradle of editorial inception to the graveyard of
syndicated TV reruns. In theory, Disney-Miramax-Brown will cut out
a non-Disney middleman like, say, The New Yorker from the process
and the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will be the guinea pig of synergy,'' said Peter Kaplan,
the editor of The New York Observer, in the most accurate summation
of Ms. Brown's new business paradigm. Disney is betting on her
ability to attract talented writers _ and to keep them happier than
the old studios did the New Yorker writers it lured West (like
Benchley and Parker).
</P>
<P>
   Succeed or fail, Ms. Brown and even Miramax (whose recent track
record includes ``Good Will Hunting'') are but a small part of a
corporation that has in the past few years alone proved it can
absorb everything from a once-intractable neighborhood (42nd
Street) to a network (ABC) as it figures out new synergistic ways
to acquire, slice, dice and merchandise content _ whether ``The
Lion King,'' news or architectural commissions by the likes of
Michael Graves.
</P>
<P>
   It has every medium, from the virtual world of the Web to the
real world of theme parks, at its disposal. Just last month Disney
bought a gateway to the Internet, Infoseek, that will soon be
transformed into a one-stop entry for popular sites as various as
abcnews.com, ESPN Sportszone and Disney Stores. Disney is opening
in Baltimore's Inner Harbor the huge prototype for a national chain
of ESPN-themed dining and entertainment complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's implications for our culture _ whether that culture be
journalism, sports, movies, TV, radio, publishing, Broadway,
cyberspace, zoos, museums or urbanology _ are far too vast and
complex to be categorized simply as ``good'' or ``bad.'' It's the
biggest ongoing cultural story of our time.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Tina maelstrom, incredibly enough, all media eyes
stayed glued to the fate of a magazine with a circulation of
808,000. While they played guessing games, Disney had found yet
another new way to advance its goal of reaching each of the six
billion potential customers on earth. &QL;

DESAILLY IS LAST LINE OF FRENCH DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The brilliance that can come from striker-cum-god
Ronaldo has won admirers the world over, but if the Brazilian star
thinks he's going to make his mark on this World Cup in Sunday's
final, the French suggest he should think again.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one rationale for their confidence, but it's a good
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our anti-Ronaldo plan in place,'' brags Didier
Deschamps, France's captain. ``It's called Marcel Desailly.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can stop the unstoppable, it might be the imposing
defender from Ghana, whose performance at the heart of the French
defense this Cup has been so spectacular, so flawless, that there's
a movement afoot to deny the tournament's MVP award to an attacker,
an unheard-of prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Argues Deschamps, with one man in mind: ``The player of this
World Cup is not necessarily a forward; it can be a defender.''
</P>
<P>
   If any defender warrants such praise, it's Desailly, who has
been among the world's finest defensive players since helping
Olympique Marseille to that tainted European Champions Cup title in
1993. He moved onto AC Milan the following year, won another
Champions Cup there, and has coupled his play as a defensive
midfielder at Milan his preferred position with stirring
exhibitions in the middle of the French defense.
</P>
<P>
   Desailly, 29, who moved to France when he was 4, has been at his
best the past month, as France has surrendered only two goals just
one of them in open play in six matches en route to the title-game
showdown with Brazil at the Stade de France. He can expect to play
the pivotal role on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He'll do so without his usual partner in the back, sweeper
Laurent Blanc, who is suspended for the final. In Blanc's place
will be Franck Leboeuf, a superb passer whose game has been marred
by occasional lapses of judgment. Leboeuf is no Blanc, but
Desailly's experience and presence is expected to raise his
teammate's game considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to play with Franck Leboeuf,'' says Desailly, who
will join Leboeuf at Chelsea following the World Cup. ``I'm happy
for him, but I'm sorry for Laurent Blanc. I like the way Franck
Leboeuf tackles. Tactically, he's very intelligent and that will
help us against Ronaldo and Bebeto.''
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, unassuming man with an incisive sense of humor,
Desailly demonstrated early the power and speed that define his
game. He joined Nantes when he was 12, made his first-team debut a
few years later, and climbed the pinnacle of world soccer by his
mid-twenties. The only thing missing from his resume is a World Cup
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people mention the Platini generation (which won the 1984
European title, France's greatest soccer accomplishment), they
immediately name three players Michel Platini, Alain Giresse and
Jean Tigana,'' Desailly says. ``We want that to happen to us as
well. We want people to remember our names. We want to make
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity arrives Sunday, but it comes with the most
difficult of challenges: stopping Ronaldo, universally considered
the greatest player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played against Ronaldo four times for Milan,'' Desailly
says. ``When I marked him, I think I played a nice game. This is a
different team, a different situation, but big competitions bring
out the best in me. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stop (Ronaldo) from turning with the ball and
accelerating away. Otherwise, you can only stop him by fouling him.
But it's wrong to sum up Brazil as Ronaldo. The danger could come
from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   France has demonstrated that this tournament, with four of its
11 goals and all three in the knockout phase coming from defenders.
Blanc and Bixente Lizarazu have one each, and Lilian Thuram has
two, both in the 2-1 semifinal win over Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   And so the real challenge has been issued. Desailly is expected
to be perfect on defense, but can he carry France to the title with
a goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``All our defense except me has scored,'' he says, a smile
opening on his face. ``So I know what I have to do.''

 &HT;    A bigger Graziani fighting for a job
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For all the fuss in recent days about Falcons
quarterbacks, it seems like Tony Graziani has been forgotten. But
the second-year player is still in Suwanee, bigger and potentially
better than before.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani gained 15 pounds during the offseason after having a
rough rookie year. He became the first rookie quarterback to start
a game for Atlanta since 1993, but when he took over for injured
Chris Chandler last season in the eighth game at Carolina, things
got ugly.
</P>
<P>
   After completing 4-of-18 passes for 24 yards and two
interceptions in the first half, Graziani, a seventh-round pick
from Oregon, took a seat. Billy Joe Tolliver took over. The Falcons
lost 21-12 and dropped to 1-7 for the season. Graziani took just a
few more meaningless snaps all season.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani's youth and slight build and Chandler's tendency to get
hurt _ he missed all or parts of six games _ caused the Falcons to
make backup quarterback a top offseason priority. The team was 7-3
in games Chandler started and finished, and 0-6 in others.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Falcons gave Graziani a choice. ``We left it up
to Tony whether to go to the World League and play, or stay here
and work on getting stronger,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``He decided
to stay, and I think it's been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, 24, thinks so too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to work out,'' he said. ``I needed to get bigger to
be able to take more punishment. I wanted to add strength to my
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   He also needed a stronger arm after struggling to throw certain
passes. The 6-foot-2 Graziani has grown from 195 to about 210
pounds, and thinks he has met both goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm feels stronger, and some receivers and a couple coaches
have said it looks stronger,'' said Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has never said Graziani is the team's quarterback of the
future, and it's uncertain whether he's ready to be the backup of
the present. He's an excellent athlete, but lacks experience. And
more conclusive evidence is needed on his arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   So the team signed 44-year-old Steve DeBerg on Monday after
failing in offseason attempts to get unrestricted free agent Ty
Detmer, who ended up in San Francisco, or restricted free agent
Eric Zeier of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The team did sign free agent Mark Rypien. But when family issues
put Rypien's career on hold last month, the Falcons opted for
DeBerg, who last played in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani said he's not offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to compete with whoever is there,'' he said. ``I
think Steve can help both Chris and I, and (rookie free agent)
Brian (Brennan of Idaho) too.''

 &HT;    Park back in action after recovering from injuries
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ The crutches are gone and only a slight limp
remains. Steve Park is ready to go racing again after spending 13
weeks rehabilitating injuries suffered in the March Primestar 500
at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving here Sunday and flying straight to Indianapolis
to test Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,'' Park said of beginning
preparations for the Brickyard 400 Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got three cars going out there, and five or six motors.
We're taking it pretty seriously. We want to make that comeback
race one that's memorable to all of us, especially myself.''
</P>
<P>
   During his rehabiliation, Park figures he was on crutches the
longest, a month and a half; four weeks off his feet; and three or
four weeks with a cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't walk like an IndyCar driver for the rest of my life, I
hope,'' Park said. ``The majority of the limp I have is because I
work out three days a week with the leg. If I take it easy, from
Thursday to Monday, the limp pretty much diminishes.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the accident goes, Park says he's forgotten it and
placed more emphasis into trying to run the race here. But, there
was neither enough time nor a way to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Green at Indy
</P>
<P>
   David Green, released by Buz McCall last month, has a one-race
deal with team owner Larry Hedrick to test a second car in
preparation for the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
Green's involvement will in no way affect regular driver Steve
Grissom. Green, last year's runnerup for Winston Cup Rookie of the
Year, currently drives full time on the Busch Grand National
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Non-performer
</P>
<P>
   When Todd Bodine was released earlier this week by team owner
Bob Hancher, the reason given was poor performance, not pressure
from the sponsor, Tabasco/McIlhenny Co. ``It's my obligation to
make changes to perform,'' Hancher said. ``And recent changes at
the Mcllhenny company really didn't have to do anything about it.''
Hancher expects to name a permanent driver next week. Ted Musgrave
is a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach hopeful
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach has his fingers crossed that he'll be a member
of Hendrick Motorsports in 1999. And John Hendrick, acting head of
Hendrick Motorsports, acknowledges if a fourth team is formed he'd
like to have a driver like Dallenbach.

ANALYSIS: WHEN SCIENTIFIC CONTROVERSIES LAND IN THE COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Ore., Ala., Texas, Mich., Calif.)  (lh) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 16 years of litigation and more than a dozen major
scientific studies, the longstanding controversy over the safety of
breast implants reached a milestone of sorts Wednesday, when Dow
Corning Corp. agreed to pay $3.2 billion to settle the claims of
tens of thousands of women who said they had become ill from their
implants.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement did not end the conflict over implants;
more chapters may be written in the months ahead as panels of
judicially appointed scientists review what the science inspired by
the lawsuits has wrought. But the long-running battle has
illuminated the issues and forces at work when scientific
controversies land in the courts or legal ones wind up in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, experts say the litigation is providing a laboratory for
judges to decide how to deal with scientific controversy and
questions of what evidence to admit in court.
</P>
<P>
   Women suing the makers of implants have charged that their
implants gave them a variety of illnesses, including
well-established diseases like arthritis, cancer, lupus and
multiple sclerosis, as well as what their attorneys have called
``atypical diseases'' with symptoms including fatigue and muscle
pain.
</P>
<P>
   The implant makers, buttressed by statements from several
medical associations and the governments of Britain, Germany and
Australia, insist that science has not found a link between the
devices and disease, despite years of looking. The settlement, Dow
Corning said, was a business decision. The company has
approximately 19,000 cases pending that could go to court, said
Douglas Schoettinger, a company lawyer, and each case would cost
about $1 million to win.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began on Aug. 1, 1982, when Maria Stern of Boise,
Idaho, sued Dow Corning. Ms. Stern said that she had become
seriously ill after her implants leaked silicone throughout her
body. She won a seven-figure settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, there was virtually no scientific evidence that
silicone implants did _ or did not _ cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of lawsuits followed. In 1992, Dr. David Kessler, who was
then commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, imposed a
moratorium on the sale of silicone breast implants while scientific
studies were conducted. A class-action suit was filed, drawing in
tens of thousands of women. On May 15, 1995, faced with 177,000
breast implant claimants, Dow Corning filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, however, several large studies were failing to
find a link between implants and the illnesses ascribed to them. In
1996, the American College of Rheumatology issued a statement
saying the evidence was ``compelling'' that implants did not cause
systemic disease. That same year, the Council on Scientific Affairs
of the American Medical Association wrote that ``to date, there is
no conclusive or compelling evidence that relates silicone breast
implants to human autoimmune disease.'' In 1997, the American
Academy of Neurology wrote that ``existing research shows no link
between silicone breast implants and neurological disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of The New England Journal
of Medicine and author of a book on breast implants (``Science on
Trial: The Clash of Medical Evidence and the Law in the Breast
Implant Case,'' Norton, 1997), said in an interview that there are
now about 15 well-designed epidemiological studies of implants and
various diseases. ``Not one has found diseases are more common in
women with implants, which leaves us with the high likelihood that
systemic diseases are coincidental,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, who is now dean of Yale University's medical school,
said in an interview that the science shows that ``there were
problems with these devices _ they broke, they leaked at a higher
rate than anyone reported.'' But, he added, although the devices
cause ``local complications'' like scarring and hardening of
tissue, ``there's no evidence that they cause systemic disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who say that the implants cause disease cite evidence of a
different sort. Fenton Communications, a public relations company
hired by lawyers for many of the plaintiffs to communicate the
risks of implants, lists studies in which doctors cite their own
experience seeing women who have had implants and subsequently
contracted various diseases. It also lists studies concluding that
silicone can provoke immune responses and that implants can rupture
and spill silicone throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Ellis, a Boston lawyer who represents women with
implants, said that the latest studies show that silicone can cause
illnesses in animals and that silicone degrades in the body into
silica, a hard, glassy mineral, which can provoke autoimmune
responses. Nonetheless, he said, ``the science is still
developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis explained that lawyers had little choice but to jump into
the litigation before a scientific consensus had time to form. The
problem, he said, is the statute of limitations. The law in most
states says that plaintiffs have three years to file a suit after
``they reasonably should have known'' that implants caused disease,
Ellis explained. In California, he added, they have only one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs are in a bind,'' he said. ``A bunch of tort-reform
advocates say, `Wait until the science is really there.''' But,
Ellis added, ``that's not the standard that applies in law.''

THIRD ISN'T A BAD PLACE
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It's a meaningless game the participants would just as
soon skip, but they can't, and so the two most disappointed sides
in France the Netherlands and Croatia are searching for something
to spark them in tonight's World Cup third-place game at Parc des
Princes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a secret that it is difficult to feel 100 percent for
a match like this one,'' said Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, whose squad
missed its chance to play in Sunday's final by losing on penalty
kicks to Brazil. ``You play as a matter of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The tickets and television rights have been sold, so the game
must go on, although one would be hard-pressed to term it a
``battle.'' Past affairs have been more like friendlies than
competitive matches, and neither Holland nor Croatia can be
expected to give a full effort after suffering shattering semifinal
losses.
</P>
<P>
   They claim otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to ourselves and the fans to play well,'' Dutchman
Aron Winter said. ``We want to show everyone we deserved better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to play in the final, but now we have to
concentrate and try to be third,'' said Croatian forward Davor
Suker, who netted his fifth goal of the tournament in the 2-1 loss
Wednesday to France. ``We will be motivated, and I pray the Dutch
won't be. It will be a difficult game, but it's better to finish
third than fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   The only real drama will be provided by Suker, who needs one
goal to break a tie with Italy's Christian Vieri and Argentina's
Gabriel Batistuta as the World Cup's scoring champion. Bulgaria's
Hristo Stoichkov went into the '94 third-place game at the Rose
Bowl in a similar situation, but his side was thrashed by Sweden,
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats, whose stunning run to the semifinals was one of the
primary storylines of the Cup, may have more desire to prosper.
This was their first World Cup, their first opportunity to
participate since breaking off from Yugoslavia seven years ago, and
their success has alerted the world to their tiny country's
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can be really proud of what we achieved,'' Coach
Miroslav Blazevic said. ``But I still can't get rid of the
impression that we could have done more.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing third, in a small way, would be more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give everything,'' defender Igor Stimac declared, ``to
capture third place.''

TAMOXIFEN AS BREAST CANCER PREVENTER IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two European studies cast doubt on the idea that the drug
tamoxifen prevents breast cancer, as American researchers found in
April.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of cancer specialists said Friday there's still
reason to believe the American findings are solid, and that women
at high risk of breast cancer who take tamoxifen to lower their
risk should not stop doing so on the basis of the new studies, nor
should women at lower risk start. Tamoxifen can raise the risk of
uterine cancer and cause potentially dangerous blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   The American study _ which was about twice as big as the other
two studies combined _ followed women for four years on average,
the Italian study for almost four years and the British study for
almost six years.
</P>
<P>
   After an analysis of all three studies, the American findings
``seem robust,'' wrote Dr. Kathleen I. Pritchard, head of clinical
trials and epidemiology at the University of Toronto, in a
commentary published with the new findings in the current issue of
the British journal Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of the European studies to confirm the American
findings does cast doubt ``on the wisdom of the rush, at least in
some places, to prescribe tamoxifen widely for prevention,'' she
noted.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a team of American researchers led by Dr. Bernard
Fisher of Pittsburgh, head of the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial,
stopped its study of more than 13,000 women at high risk of breast
cancer early because it became obvious that tamoxifen was linked
with a 45 percent reduction in new cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of a finding this dramatic being a statistical fluke
is less than 1 in 10,000, the National Cancer Institute noted
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But even the American study leaves in doubt one key question,
says Dr. Irene Kuter, a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``We know that in women taking tamoxifen for a few years
there is a decreased incidence of breast cancer. The question is,
is that just slowing down the appearance of cancers that are
already there, or is it truly preventing new cancers?''
</P>
<P>
   The new studies, one of 2,471 women in the United Kingdom and
the other of 5,408 women in Italy, ``just don't have the
statistical power'' to reach as firm conclusions, said Fisher in a
telephone interview. The new findings ``don't shake any of our
confidence in the findings of the US study.''
</P>
<P>
   Both European studies found that tamoxifen was not linked to a
statistically significant difference in the number of new breast
cancer cases between women taking the drug and those taking a
placebo, or dummy drug.
</P>
<P>
   But the Italian study involved only women who had had a
hysterectomy, many of whom had not only the uterus but also the
ovaries removed. Women who have had their ovaries removed are
considered at lower risk of breast cancer because without ovaries,
a woman produces drastically reduced levels of the hormone
estrogen, which drives many breast tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Italian study was both smaller than the American study
and involved women at low or average risk of breast cancer, it is
less likely that any protective effect of tamoxifen would show up.
</P>
<P>
   The British study did include women at high risk of breast
cancer by virtue of having a strong family history of the disease,
but did not include women with other risk factors such as early age
at first menstrual period, late age at first childbirth and
biopsies of the breasts for suspicious lumps.
</P>
<P>
   This means that since the American women may have been at higher
overall risk, a protective effective of tamoxifen would be more
likely to show up in the American data, said Dr. Barry Kramer,
deputy director of the division of cancer prevention at the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The American women were also older than the European women, and
because breast cancer risk rises with age, this, too, means that a
protective effect of tamoxifen would be more likely to show up in
the American study.
</P>
<P>
   Another confounding factor was that women in the European
studies were allowed to take hormone replacement therapy _
including estrogen _ even if they were also taking tamixofen, an
estrogen blocker. The American women were not.
</P>
<P>
   In the British study, about 41 percent of the women were taking
hormone replacement therapy and in the Italian study, about 15
percent, said Kramer of NCI. ``So the question is, could you be
blunting the effect of tamoxifen'' with estrogen?
</P>
<P>
   In her commentary, Pritchard of Toronto said that appeared
unlikely. The British study, she noted, turned up no differences in
breast cancer cases between women taking hormone replacement
therapy and those not taking it; in the Italian study, tamoxifen
actually seemed to exert a preventive effect among women taking
hormone replacement therapy.

fleet, also said that he wanted to conduct a hearing personally to
discipline the commander of the squadron, the executive officer,
the director of safety and the operations officer for dereliction
of duty. They could face loss of pay, confinement to base and
official reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif.,
and the navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y.,
face charges of involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has been the subject of three Marine Corps
reports and seven days of public hearings, has raised difficult
questions about not only the conduct of the crew, but the safety
and soundness of management in the Marine Corps, the Air Force and
the Defense Mapping Agency and its successor, the National Imagery
and Mapping Agency. Those questions will now be argued in detail at
a court-martial at Camp Lejeune, N.C., probably beginning this
fall. ``We know this is going to be a knock-down drag-out,'' said
Frank Spinner, the civilian lawyer for Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an EA-6B Prowler based temporarily in Aviano, Italy,
for duty over Bosnia, was on a training flight through the Italian
Alps when it hit the cable near Cavalese. The incident has strained
American relations with Italy, and a Marine Corps officer who was a
member of a Marine Investigation Board that first looked into the
incident hinted that there had been political pressure to come down
hard on the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials insisted that the White
House and State Department had not brought pressure on the Marine
Corps to seek tougher penalties as a means of appeasing the Italian
government. ``This call was made by the Marines,'' an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was sitting in the front cockpit, at the single set of
flight controls. Next to him, functioning as mission planner and
navigator, was Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing officer recommended this month that only Ashby face
the most serious charge, involuntary manslaughter, a crime that
involves ``culpable negligence'' and carries a sentence of up to 10
years for each of the 20 counts. He said Schweitzer should face the
lesser charge of negligent homicide, which carries a maximum
penalty of three years for all counts together.
</P>
<P>
   But Gen. Pace ruled that both should face the more serious
charge. He agreed with the hearing officer that they should also
face charges of damage to military property, damage to private
property and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing officer, Lt. Col. Ronald Rodgers, said that two
officers in the rear cockpit, who did not have a view out the front
and had limited information about the plane's altitude, should not
be court-martialed, and Pace accepted that recommendation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodgers also said in his report, released July 2, that he
had ``substantial doubt'' that any of the men could be convicted
because of errors by others, a position stressed by the defendants'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner, referring to the disciplinary hearing for the other
four officers in the squadron, said, ``By initiating disciplinary
action against these individuals, that suggests that Gen. Pace
agrees there was systemic error, which takes the spotlight off
Ashby and the crew and says, `Hey, there are other problems
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Beck, a civilian lawyer representing Schweitzer, said,
``We're not applauding that these four individuals face
punishment.'' But he said of his client, ``Joe is encouraged that
they are looking at other factors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prominent among those factors was very poor communications
between the Air Force, which has a permanent presence in Aviano,
and the Marine Corps electronic warfare squadrons, which rotated
through every six months. Rodgers said in his report that at one
point, an Air Force officer at Aviano telephoned the Marine Corps
aviators to say that they should empty their mailbox, into which
the Air Force was depositing safety documents, and the Marine
squadron was unaware that such a mailbox existed.
</P>
<P>
   A document in the hands of the Air Force, a copy of which was
later discovered at the room where the Marines' prepared for
flight, showed that minimum altitude on the route that the Prowler
flew that day was 2,000 feet. But nearly everyone in the squadron
believed it was 1,000 feet, investigators found. And there was no
system for updating old flight information and making sure that
everyone had read it, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to be at least part of the basis for the
dereliction of duty charge against the squadron's commanding
officer, Lt. Col. Richard Muegge, and three other officers in the
squadron at the time of the accident, Lt. Col. John Koran III, then
the executive officer, or second in command; Maj. Kirk Shawhan,
then the operations officer, who drew up flight schedules, among
other duties, and Maj. Max Caramanian, then director of
standardization and safety.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Gen. Pace, Lt. Col. Ellen Haddock, said that
the names of officers facing discipline below the level of
court-martial were generally not made public, but that they were in
this case because of the high level of interest and seriousness of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Under military rules, the four could refuse administrative
punishment and face the possibility of court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued in preliminary hearings that the four members
of the Prowler crew were reckless and negligent, and Rodgers agreed
that the performance of the pilot and navigator were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers said there were other factors, including a
map prepared by the Defense Mapping Agency and used by the crew to
plan the mission. Although the ski lift was more than 30 years old,
it did not appear on the map. In fact, very few Italian ski lifts
do.
</P>
<P>
   The mapping agency said shortly after the accident that it only
listed ski lifts with towers that rose 100 feet. On this ski lift,
to Mount Cermis, the towers are much lower, although the cables
rise nearly 400 feet above the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers said in his report that the mapping agency had copied
some of its data from the wrong Italian map. Beck, the lawyer for
Schweitzer, said Friday that the ski lift is still not on the map,
nor on an updated document published monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Beck said, ``There is no criminal problem for doing what is the
norm in the community, for doing it with the dad-gum information
that the superiors provide.''

GALLIC SMILES HAVE ERASED GALLIC GLOOM, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>

 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Until just recently, the French motto seemed to be, ``I
could have been a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Now France, for the first time, is a contender in a ``dream
match'' against Brazil in the World Cup soccer championship final
here on Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of delirious French fans
celebrated the victory over Croatia Wednesday that got them into
the finals by taking to the Champs-Elysees, demonstrating joie de
vivre rather than the more usual griping they call ``la grogne.''
</P>
<P>
   How long the new mood will last is a good question in a country
where people say, ``The more things change, the more they stay the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment France is back, after a long period of
querulous gloom, introspection and self-doubt. And many people give
the Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin credit
for the change.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin has had an extraordinary run, after having had the good
luck to replace his conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, a little
over a year ago just as the French economy unexpectedly took a turn
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Paris stock prices have climbed 40 percent this year and the
economy is expected to grow this year by 3 percent, the best in
years. Unemployment, a dismal 12 percent during Juppe's term, is
now easing. More people are going to the movies than at any time in
the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not usually an optimist, but everybody feels we've finally
found something that works,'' said Emmanuel Roumagere, a postal
worker in Paris. ``We're beginning to believe what they're telling
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's poll ratings are now the highest they have been since
he was elected. Polls published this week showed that between 63
and 70 percent of the voters say he is doing a good job. And while
Juppe's unpopularity dragged his fellow conservative, President
Jacques Chirac, into the doghouse with him, Jospin's boom has
pulled the president to new heights, with an approval rating of 58
to 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of France can say today that things are going
better,'' Jospin said the other day as the French anticipated the
start of their annual five-week vacations and the climax of the
World Cup. ``A year and a half ago, our fellow citizens were
disoriented, fed up with politics and with what the leaders of the
time were planning for them. They did not see the relationship
between what they had been told during the presidential election
campaign and the policy that was followed. At least today it can be
said that there is a connection between what has been said and what
is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Barbey, now a management consultant in Rheims after long
unemployment, said: ``I would not say it was all Jospin's doing,
but things do look better now than they did a couple of years ago.
The only thing I can complain about is that I do not have enough
time to get on the phone to drum up more work.''

   INVEST-ISRAEL-NYT (Tel Aviv, Israel) _ At a time when Israel is
having some success as an incubator of high-tech start-ups, the Tel
Aviv Stock Exchange is struggling even to get Israeli companies to
dual-list, never mind exclusive listings. Does the exchange have a
future? By Jessica Steinberg.

<P>
   MUTFUND-LATIN-NYT (Undated) _ Investors have punished Latin
American stocks this year, but many market analysts say the
downturn is strictly a case of guilt by association with Asia. By
Mickey Meece.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-LIFE-STYLE-NYT (Undated) _ When mutual fund companies
started pushing so-called life-style and life-cycle funds, they
seemed like sure-fire hits: single funds that were meant to
simplify the decision-making process for befuddled investors.
Essentially, these funds would plunk an investor into a portfolio
with a mix of stocks, bonds and cash tailor-made to his investing
time horizon, eliminating the need to concern himself with
complicated issues like risk or asset allocation. The problem is
that investors, by and large, haven't warmed up to the idea. By
Abby Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BONDS-NYT (Undated) _ Concerns about Asia's fractured
economic machine have caused investors _ especially those overseas
_ to pull money out of certain stock and bond markets and pour it
into United States Treasury bonds. So prices have risen and yields
_ which move in the opposite direction of prices _ have sunk to
30-year lows. By Sana Siwolop.

for many a mutual fund manager, but it was a very sweet season for
others. How did some managers land at the top of the fund
performance lists? By Carole Gould.

   MUTFUND-CLOSED-END-NYT (Undated) _ With closed-end funds
developing a reputation as a dysfunctional branch of the fund
family tree, shareholder activists have grown restive. That doesn't
bother some analysts, who feel that many such funds look like
bargains as of late. By Rick Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BENCHMARKS-NYT (Undated) _ So, how's your portfolio
doing? Good question. The fact is that you won't have a clue if you
measure your mutual fund's performance against the wrong benchmark.
Doing so can lead to Godzilla-size mistakes, like holding onto
losers or selling winners. By Noelle Knox.

   MUTFUND-VANGUARD-NYT (Undated _ To hear John J. Brennan tell it,
there's really nothing much afoot at the Vanguard Group, the giant
fund company he heads. Vanguard, for example, definitely does not
intend to join the rush to build a financial services conglomerate,
he said. By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-DOMESTIC-NYT (Undated) _ With the stock market as hot as
a firecracker, pushing the Standard &AMP; Poors 500 index to a record
high, why aren't mutual fund holders cheering? Because it is no fun
to incur losses in your fund holdings while the indexes race ever
higher. By Gretchen Morgenson.

<P>
   MUTFUND-IAI-BALANCED-NYT (Undated) _ The IAI Balanced fund has
proven to be the best performer in the quarter of all stocks funds
trcked by the New York Times and the best domestic hybrid fund over
all. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-PORTFOLIOS-NYT (Undated) _ It has been one wild ride.
Only an unrepentant bull could have scooped up every dollar from
the red-hot stock market during the last five years as the Dow
Jones industrial average flirted with the 9,000 mark from the
mid-3,000s. Put simply, this time the theory of diversifying
investments did not work. Carefully balancing big stocks with
smaller ones, or American issues with international issues, was a
waste of time. Investors would have been better off sweeping their
money into Vanguard's S&AMP;P 500-stock index fund and going to the
beach. By Carole Gould.

POLICE ARREST NINE IN LONDON BOMB PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a coordinated sweep, the police in Ireland and
England arrested nine people Friday and said they had foiled a plot
to bomb central London, with only moments to spare.
</P>
<P>
   John Grieve, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch,
said three of the men had been caught with ``explosive devices'' in
their possession, apparently in bags and backpacks. One was seized
as he tried to enter University College London, a possible target.
``We believe these terrorist devices were intended to be used in
London within minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the suspects, who were not immediately
identified, were members of the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, a
dissident hard-line Roman Catholic group opposed to the peace
settlement in Northern Ireland, and to support for the settlement
by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The name envisions the six counties of Ulster united with the 26
counties of the Irish Republic. The group's best-known member is
Bernadette Sands McKevitt, the sister of Bobby Sands, a famous
martyr to the Irish republican cause who died in May 1981 in a
hunger strike defying British treatment of Irish prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday afternoon's raids, the Irish police arrested a man and
a woman in Dublin and another man in Dundalk on the border with
Northern Ireland. The English police and members of the MI5
security force seized a woman on Oxford Street, London's main
shopping area; a man and a woman outside the new British Library
near St. Pancras train station; the man entering the university
language-study building on Gower Street; and two men across
Blackfriars Bridge on a street outside a supermarket in the South
London borough of Southwark.
</P>
<P>
   The London suspects were described as looking like college
students, carrying backpacks and dressed in jeans and sneakers.
Witnesses gave dramatic descriptions of the police leaping from
their patrol cars with guns drawn and of their own surprised
reactions to the sudden disruption in the normal hum of activity on
downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   John Watkins, 30, a shopkeeper, said he had been looking out the
window of his secondhand furniture showroom on London Road in
Southwark when he saw two cars swerve to the corner and stop
abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``About eight blokes got out, obviously the old Bill with caps
and flak-jackets,'' he said. ``They went for a guy with a rucksack,
wearing jeans and a little denim jacket. They just told him, `Get
on the floor.' There were 10 guns pointing at his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth McAteer, 71, saw the scene and said: ``I thought they
were making a film. There was a man lying on the floor face down
with a bag by him. There was a whole lot of police with guns. There
was a lot of shouting going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Wholey, out walking with her 14-year-old granddaughter,
said: ``There were police everywhere. It was a mad sight. Two
police cars raced down the road outside my house and one crashed
into a barrier, they were in such a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The police wrapped the hands of the men they captured there in
plastic _ presumably to allow forensic tests later _ before
bundling them into a car and driving away at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests in London appeared to have been set off by
information gathered by the Irish police in Dundalk earlier in the
day. The splinter groups that have not gone along with the
cease-fires adopted by the main paramilitary groups in Northern
Ireland have had little success in carrying off promised violent
operations as the police have repeatedly seized bombs, explosive
chemicals and mortar launchers before they could be used.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, who is deputy assistant commissioner of Scotland Yard,
said, ``This evening's arrests are the result of prolonged
investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican terrorist
groups, and a successful surveillance operation carried out by the
Metropolitan Police and MI5 which had thwarted an imminent planned
terrorist attack in London.''
</P>
<P>
   The coordinated action drew praise from the prime ministers of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Tony Blair said, ``This has clearly been a very
important and successful operation and further reflects the close
cooperation that exists between the security forces in the United
Kingdom and Ireland, as together we defeat terrorism wherever it
may exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, Bertie Ahern paid tribute to the ``extremely
effective cooperation'' the joint operation demonstrated, and said
the two governments would ``tackle the terrorist threat from
whatever source.''

DISNEY STOCK GAINS AFTER 3-FOR-1 SPLIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stock of The Walt Disney Co., which had declined
15 percent in the past two months, posted a respectable 3 percent
gain Friday after the company executed its previously announced
3-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the entertainment giant rose $1.12 1/2 to $38.12 1/2
as its stock split, which was announced in April with the goal of
making the shares more affordable, went into effect. Volume
totalled more than 15.6 million shares, which would have been 5.2
million had the shares not been split, and nearly triple its
average over the last three months. Disney was the second most
actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Thursday at $111, rising $2.68 3/4 on a pair of
analyst upgrades. It opened Friday at $37 as the 680 million
outstanding shares became 2.04 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Companies often split their stock when it consistently trades
over certain benchmarks, like $50 or $100, in order to make the
shares more attractive to smaller investors. If an investor has
only $1,000, for example, a stock trading at $20 or $40 seems like
a better buy than one trading over $100.
</P>
<P>
   Although such moves actually don't change the value of the
investment _ a single share of Disney stock Thursday was worth
exactly the same as the three new Disney shares Friday _ the
reality is that splits usually drive up share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Disney shares hit an all-time high of $42.37 1/2 ($127.12 1/2
pre-split) on May 4, then fell to $35.01 1/2 ($105.06 1/4
pre-split) on June 30 on a spectacular one-day loss of 7 percent as
seven Wall Street analysts cut earnings estimates on concerns about
summer films, ABC television ratings, the cost of pro football
telecasts, theme-park attendance and weak economies in Asia and
Europe. Strong performance by the film ``Mulan'' has helped lift
the stock this week.
</P>
<P>
   The split is the seventh in Disney's history as a public company
and the first since May 1992, when the shares were split 4 for 1. &QL;

ULSTER PARADE TALKS PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Protestant and Roman Catholic
officials agreed Friday to begin negotiations on Saturday to end
the rising Protestant violence over a disputed Protestant parade
through a Catholic neighborhood west of here.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were proposed by Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday
afternoon in London. He was acting to try to end the violence that
has ripped Ulster since Sunday, when his government blocked an
Orange Order parade from passing through Garvaghy Road in a
Catholic area of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Before the agreement to hold talks, there were fears that the
violence would increase this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two sides have refused to meet face to face, they
will be in separate rooms for the talks, with ``facilitators''
shuttling back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and security officials fear that if there is no
resolution to the dispute by Saturday night, thousands of Orangemen
from all over the province will march on the area and clash with
the hundreds of police officers and British troops there.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, protesters have attacked the police with more than
500 gasoline bombs, hijacked and burned dozens of cars, and blocked
main roads. &QL;

JUDGE ORDERS FEC TO INVESTIGATE BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS AGAINST RON
BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has ordered the Federal Election
Commission to investigate whether the late commerce secretary, Ron
Brown, sold seats on foreign trade missions in exchange for
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stanley Sporkin of U.S. District Court in Washington
issued the order this week, overturning the commission's decision
not to pursue bribery allegations that had been made by Judicial
Watch, a conservative organization. At the time, commission
officials decided that the Judicial Watch complaint did not have
enough merit for the commission to expend its limited resources on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin's ruling did not address whether the Judicial Watch
complaint had merit. Instead, he said that the commission, with
three Democrats and two Republicans, erred when it voted 5-0 to
dismiss the complaint because it felt the group lacked legal
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FEC had before it serious allegations backed up with
documentation and sworn testimony,'' Sporkin wrote in a decision
that was issued on Monday. ``At the very least, the FEC should have
given the plaintiff's complaint careful consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, said he was buoyed by
Sporkin's decision. ``It was a very strong decision that holds the
government's feet to the fire and says it has to do its job,'' he
said. ``It's another example of how the courts are really the only
branch of government doing its job to make sure that corruption in
government is being addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said Friday they have not decided whether
to appeal Sporkin's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the commission successfully fights the ruling, the
decision is a clear victory for Judicial Watch, a public interest
law firm that has relentlessly pursued allegations of wrongdoing by
Brown. Even so, it is unclear whether the decision, if appealed and
upheld, will lead to anything.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican-controlled congressional committees have looked
into allegations that the Commerce Department under Brown
guaranteed spots to particular businesses on trade missions in
exchange for donations of $100,000 to the Democratic National
Committee. So far, neither of the committees have turned up any
solid proof of the veracity of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Klayman's complaint is concerned, the DNC feels it's
completely baseless,'' said Rick Harris, a spokesman for the
Democratic National Committee. ``If the FEC decides to appeal Judge
Sporkin's decision, we expect it will be overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Klayman said the congressional
committees have turn up so little because many of the companies
that allegedly bought seats on trade missions have also donated to
Republicans. ``Republicans don't want to enmesh their own donors in
an investigation, so it has been effectively covered up by both
parties,'' Klayman said.

 &HT;    Craven finds Loudon's still his lucky track
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Three months ago Ricky Craven didn't know if he'd
ever run another lap on the Winston Cup circuit. Friday, he showed
he could in most dramatic fashion, winning the pole for Sunday's
Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Craven, in his familiar No. 50 red Monte Carlo, was the last
driver out and blew away the competition with a lap of 128.394 mph.
It was his first appearance on a NASCAR track since being diagnosed
with post-concussion syndrome, brought on by crashing into the wall
at Texas Motor Speedway a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everybody I was going to come back and have fun, and
this is my idea of fun,'' said the 32-year-old Craven, who grew up
in nearby Newburgh, Maine. ``I wanted to run well, I wanted to have
a good strong performance. I knew as the thing unfolded I had a
shot at the pole, and we got it.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning the pole, his career third but first since 1996, also
at Loudon, Craven denied his teammate Jeff Gordon his sixth pole of
he year.
</P>
<P>
   This day's run for the pole had more twists than a pretzel. A
damp track played havoc early with the first wave of qualifiers,
leaving them miserably damp and bunched from positions 26 through
44.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew what was going to happen out there,'' Gordon said.
``I'm glad we drew a later number. Sometimes it goes your way and
sometimes it doesn't. It certainly worked in our favor today.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody was so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same for everybody, at least in the beginning,''
said Jeremy Mayfield, who failed to qualify at 26th. ``When you get
rain drops hitting your windshield, that kind of knocks your
confidence down a little. But, I'm sure we'll get back up front
Sunday sooner or later. It was just one of those days where some
people got lucky and others didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, it didn't cost him any money. Team owner Andy Petree
was fined $2,000 and the qualifying time of his driver, Ken
Schrader, was disallowed. Added weight fell from the car during his
qualifying run.

 PARIS: more work.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Juppe, Chirac and many other leaders, Jospin is a graduate
of the elite National School of Administration. But his intense,
ebullient style and his way of preparing for major decisions with
extensive debates inside and outside the government contrast with
his predecessor's more autocratic methods. Jospin brings to mind
the tousle-headed schoolboy he looked like when he leapt to his
feet to cheer the French goals Wednesday; Juppe, by contrast, was
compared to a dour tax inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, who turns 61 on Sunday, was elected on promises to end
years of painful budget cuts intended to get France ready for the
euro, the common European currency, which will kick off next year.
</P>
<P>
   But after coming into office, Jospin dutifully helped make the
euro a success by reining in spending, just like his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The task was made easier by the unexpected tax revenues brought
in by the economic recovery, so Jospin did not have to cut into
generous pension benefits or raise taxes, as Juppe tried to do
during a recession, proposals that were greeted with endless
protests.
</P>
<P>
   But where Juppe infuriated doctors, normally staunch
conservative supporters, by threatening to tax their fees if they
did not help the state health insurance system keep costs down,
Jospin's government said this month that it would look to the
powerful pharmaceutical industry to cut drug prices, or pay
billions of francs in fines, if health care costs continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the time Chirac defeated Jospin for the presidency
in 1995, he was highly unpopular. Now the president is riding high
again. ``Politicians don't normally have much to do with soccer,
but they like to benefit from it,'' said Bruno Moerman, who is in
the travel business in Paris. ``The fans are certainly full of
spirit, and it's having side-effects in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac and Jospin share power in what the French call
``cohabitation.'' It may have been an unintended consequence of the
Fifth Republic's 1958 Constitution, which splits executive power
between a strong presidency and a government that depends on a
separately elected majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Unintended or not, the French seem to like this particular
cohabitation. According to a poll this week in the weekly
L'Express, 70 percent want it to continue until the end of Chirac's
term, in 2002. Even 64 percent of those who support the right
thought cohabitation was working fine.
</P>
<P>
   American officials here were also very pleased with the results
of Jospin's maiden voyage as Prime Minister to Washington last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's visit made headlines here when he praised the creation
of millions of jobs in the United States, the first time a French
leader had acknowledged publicly that the jobs were not all, as
some Gallic economists snidely suggested, dishwashing positions at
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jospin is doing his best to persuade skeptics that the most
controversial measure his government has passed, a law requiring
all companies to go from a 39-hour week to a 35-hour one by 2002,
will actually create jobs rather than endanger them, as Chirac
keeps warning.
</P>
<P>
   The law rewards companies that reach agreements with their
employees on reorganization by giving the companies small subsidies
for a few years for the jobs they create.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier conservative program did the same, permitting
companies like Cofinaga, a financial services subsidiary of the
Galeries Lafayette department stores, to create 182 new jobs this
year while reducing the average work week to 35 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Cofinaga executives say, they saved more than the $8.3
million cost of the new employes by agreeing with employees on
flexible work schedules that allow the company to stay open longer
on weekends and later at night. Some employees may work more hours
some weeks and fewer in others, but such work schedules, which
French unions have often been reluctant to accept, increased
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   But many French executives fear that the change in working hours
that Jospin pushed through may make it difficult to get more
concessions on productivity from unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no tradition of spontaneous negotiations between
employers and employees in France,'' Jospin said. ``The state has
to play the role of catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac warned the cabinet last winter against ``rash
experiments,'' prompting Jospin to observe caustically that he owed
his job to Chirac's own rash experiment in calling elections.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Jospin pointed out, the threat of a 35-hour week did not
discourage the Toyota Motor Corp. from picking France for a $666
million assembly plant that will create 2,000 jobs in northern
France over the next three years. Within the government, Jospin
claims that he leads with a more collegial style than Juppe did,
partly out of necessity as head of a leftist coalition that
includes Communists and environmentalists who do not always agree
with the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   If Juppe clearly outshone his cabinet intellectually, Jospin
filled his with some of the Socialist Party's brightest lights,
powerful political figures like Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine,
Economics Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Labor Minister
Martine Aubry.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was bound by the terms of the coalition's electoral
commitment to oppose the privatization of France Telecom, Air
France and major French military industries, after the election
Jospin proceeded nonetheless to make these enterprises more
competitive by what he calls ``opening'' their capital to private
investment. ``I'm less interested in who owns an enterprise than in
how it contributes to the prosperity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With everything going so swimmingly, some fear the new mood may
not last, particularly if France loses to Brazil on Sunday. If the
Asian economic crisis takes the wind out of Europe's sails later
this year and the boom collapses, the French could revert to their
usual snappishness when they come back from their vacations at the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're enjoying it as long as it lasts,'' one presidential aide
said.

HONG KONG'S LATEST LETDOWN: AIRPORT'S NOSEDIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ It could not have had a more auspicious beginning,
with inaugural flights by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
President Clinton, both of whom said they were duly impressed. But
then, world leaders don't have to line up at check-in counters,
claim their bags or sprint to far-flung gates.
</P>
<P>
   For everybody else who traveled through Hong Kong's lavish new
airport this week, the experience was less impressive than
bewildering. Planes were delayed, gates were mixed up, baggage was
lost, toilets backed up, flight information boards went dark and
crates of seafood rotted on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Hong Kong International Airport has had a turbulent
takeoff does not capture the bizarre string of mishaps that have
afflicted this $20 billion project since it opened Monday. Nor does
it evoke the outrage and embarrassment that people here feel about
what was supposed to be the pride of Hong Kong _ and has instead
become a colossal public-relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was complete chaos,'' said Peter Cleary, an American lawyer
who has lived in Hong Kong for 14 years and takes pride in its
reputation for brisk efficiency. Monday Cleary landed at the
airport at 10 p.m., was stuck on his plane for nearly two hours
while the pilot tried to find a gate, and finally collected his
bags at 4:30 a.m., after wandering the terminal for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was incredibly shoddy, and I'm not a grouch by
nature,'' Cleary said. ``To call this teething problems is
farcical.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, under intense public pressure, Hong Kong's chief
executive, Tung Chee-hwa, said he would appoint an independent
panel to investigate the problems and determine who was
responsible. In the meantime, Hong Kong's top civil servant, Anson
Chan, pleaded with the public not to be too harsh on the airport
managers, as they labored to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the managers had the extreme misfortune of stumbling the
week after Hong Kong's first democratically elected legislature
since the handover took office. Grabbing a ripe opportunity for
political theater, the lawmakers on Thursday hauled in the chief
executive of the Airport Authority, Hank Townsend, for a 90-minute
inquisition, during which he was repeatedly urged to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was meant to be a first-class project, but it has turned
into a ninth-class airport and a disgrace,'' said Lau Kong-wah, a
member of Hong Kong's main pro-Beijing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our airport has become the laughingstock of the world,'' Lau
said, shooting a baleful glance at Townsend, a 65-year-old American
executive who came from Bechtel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend did not return telephone calls, but a spokesman for the
airport, Clinton Leeks, apologized for the foul-ups. He added that
the problems in the passenger terminal were abating.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, people here are not in a generous mood. Hong
Kong's economy is sliding into its worst recession since World War
II, with soaring unemployment, a swooning stock market and a
crashing property market. Aside from a brief burst of enthusiasm
during the visits of Jiang and Clinton, Hong Kong has had a
listless year since it reverted to China last July.
</P>
<P>
   The government clearly hoped the new airport would be a tonic
for the city and a symbol of its brighter future. Certainly, the
project has an only-in-Hong-Kong feeling to it: Engineers chopped
the tops off two small islands, filled in the water between them,
and put a massive airport on top. They also built a web of bridges,
tunnels, and highways to transport people 21 miles into town.
</P>
<P>
   The government even turned the transition from the old airport
to the new one into a sideshow _ with a vast overnight move of
equipment through Kowloon that officials delighted in comparing to
D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government built up public expectations so much before the
event that people were expecting perfection,'' said Ian Perkin, the
chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a whiff of hubris. Malaysia opened a new airport
two weeks ago in Kuala Lumpur _ with state-of-the-art technology
similar to that in Hong Kong _ and suffered major problems. Yet
Hong Kong plowed ahead with its plan to open its airport
immediately after the first anniversary of the handover.
</P>
<P>
   Perkin said the airport fiasco will hurt more than Hong Kong's
image. The airport's largest cargo handler said Thursday that it
was imposing an eight-day embargo on all imports and exports,
except food, medical supplies and newspapers. Perkin estimated that
the embargo would cost Hong Kong nearly $800 million in lost
exports.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when people here believe Hong Kong must fight to
retain its status as a special city within China, they say it can
ill afford such a loss. The prospect of companies bypassing Hong
Kong because it does not have convenient transportation facilities
is particularly galling to business executives here.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel it is shameful for Hong Kong to have spent so much
money and so many years on that project,'' said Peter Lam, the
co-host of ``Teacup in the Storm,'' a popular radio call-in program
in Hong Kong. Lam said he was deluged by calls from listeners eager
to fix blame for the troubles. ``Callers feel that the Airport
Authority has been arrogant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hand-wringing in Hong Kong, outsiders have been more
understanding about the airport's woes. Neil Sogo, a 37-year-old
Japanese businessman who arrived here Wednesday on a flight from
Tokyo, said he waited more than an hour for his bags, which he
found only after reading a handwritten sign. Still, he said, ``I'll
give it six months, and come back and try it again later.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Sogo added, the line at Immigration was short. ``Nobody
is coming to Hong Kong,'' he said with an apologetic smile.

 &HT;    Judge calls meeting with tobacco lawyers
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lawyers on all sides of the pending $15.3
billion Texas tobacco settlement have been called to meet Monday
with the federal judge supervising the litigation in what appears
to be the judge's push to finish negotiations in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the people called to Texarkana said U.S. District
Judge David Folsom had told them to bring their suitcases. Folsom
chuckled Friday at the suggestion he may lock the lawyers and two
state legislators in a room to work out agreements on sticking
points that are holding up a finished deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge would not say why he called the status conference
in his chambers Monday morning instead of arranging a conference
call. ``I always try to get the parties to work out their
differences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two legal challenges have waylaid the settlement, one objecting
to the possibility of $2.3 billion in legal fees Folsom awarded to
private lawyers who sued tobacco companies for the state and the
other seeking a share of the settlement for certain Texas counties
and public hospital districts.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales said he was planning to be in
Texarkana on Monday and Tuesday and was prepared to leave his
assistants there longer while he met out-of-state Wednesday in
another stage of negotiations with cigarette makers to enhance the
Texas settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Morales announced in mid-January the Texas settlement _ the
largest among states that have settled lawsuits against the tobacco
industry for spending public money to treat poor people for
smoking-related diseases. By early February, Gov. George W. Bush
and seven legislators sued to intervene, protesting the 15 percent
of Texas' recovery that the private lawyers would get, which was
the percentage Morales had agreed with them to pay. Before Bush
intervened, Republican attorney general candidate John Cornyn sued
in state court to challenge Morales' authority to hire five law
firms to handle the case on contingency fee contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Texas counties and hospital districts also sued to
intervene, contending the tobacco settlement should pay expenses
for treating poor people not covered by the Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom called together Morales, Bush's lawyers and attorneys
representing the seven legislators and counties and hospital
districts. The judge also summoned state Sen. Bill Ratliff and
state Rep. Rob Junell, the chairmen of budget-writing committees in
the Legislature, who have been involved with negotiations on the
county issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, leads the Senate Finance Committee
and Junell, D-San Angelo, heads the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider this a very helpful development,'' Morales said.
``I think that we've now reached the point and we are now
sufficiently close on all the outstanding issues that the court's
active interaction in terms of pushing us that final yard or two
across the goal line will be very beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales said he was hopeful that negotiations through the
weekend may result in a united position before the Monday
conference. The counties and hospital districts that have asked to
intervene, all of them large, have been working for a formula that
would distribute tobacco settlement money to all 254 Texas
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller counties have pushed for reimbursement on a population
basis. The larger counties have wanted payment on a pro rata
method, to reflect their larger share of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks, attorneys for Morales, Bush and the
legislators have said they were close to resolving the dispute over
attorney's fees. That pending deal reportedly would leave an
arbitrators' decision on how much the tobacco makers pay the
private lawyers _ a process set out in the settlement _ immune to
attack. In return, Morales would agree to drop motions to fine
Bush, the seven legislators and their attorneys as much as $25
million for interfering with the tobacco negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the legislators would be able to challenge the
difference, if any, between the amount the arbitrators order
tobacco to pay and the 15 percent the judge granted to the private
lawyers. Both Bush and the legislators argue that Texas would be
liable, from the settlement proceeds, for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is the attorney fee issues are essentially resolved,''
Morales said. ``There's an understanding among all parties that the
real hangup is the county issue. That is what is preventing
finality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does us no good to resolve the attorney fee interventions
and . . . other issues if we still have counties unresolved. That
is the one issue that the industry insists be put to bed before
they will give us finality.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales' Wednesday trip will continue discussions with the
cigarette makers that could boost the $15.3 billion Texas deal by
$2 billion, based on the later settlement by Minnesota. The Texas
agreement allows it to renegotiate better terms won by other states
in later negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Forty states and Puerto Rico have sued the tobacco companies.

FOR BRAZIL, ONLY VICTORY IS ACCEPTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 12) 
(jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France _ After Brazil lost a soccer match to
the lowly United States last February, the entire nation fell into
a panic. Brazil is, after all, so consumed with soccer that it
would later show the team's departure for the World Cup on live
television and close the stock exchange in Sao Paulo for its
opening match against Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In May, as Brazil continued slouching toward soccer's
quadrennial world championship tournament, losing unacceptably at
home to Argentina, 66-year-old Coach Mario Zagallo was viciously
attacked by the country's sports media. Lance, a daily sports
newspaper in Rio de Janiero, called the coach ``incoherent'' and
said the only way to cure Brazil's impotent play was to ``give them
Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now that Brazil has again made its way into the World
Cup championship match, there is hardly an empty seat on the
bandwagon. Criticism has faded into frenzied expectancy. Sunday
night, in the northern Paris suburb of St.-Denis, Brazil will face
France in the championship game. If most of the 80,000 fans at
Stade de France will favor the home team, history will be on
Brazil's side. Already it owns an unprecedented four World Cup
titles, and it is favored to claim a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   As Brazil has advanced through the monthlong tournament, 3,000
fans have shown up here daily for practice at Stade de
Trois-Sapins, willingly paying $7 for parking, banging their drums,
blowing bugles, sounding air horns, chanting ``Ro-nal-do,
Ro-nal-do'' for the star forward and screaming at their heroes like
teeny-boppers greeting the Beatles. Entry for spectators is free of
charge, but capacity is limited, and fans said tickets for
practices this week were being scalped for $17.
</P>
<P>
   Practices have been telecast back to Brazil, and as many as
1,500 reporters have crowded around the tiny stadium, penned like
cattle, photographers using stepladders and radio reporters
conducting live interviews on their cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the defending champion so fascinating is that victory
is the only acceptable outcome against France. Adulation will
quickly turn to disgust and despair with a loss. Brazil's 160
million citizens also consider themselves to be coaches; years ago,
Brazil's national team was actually coached briefly by a
sportswriter. The tension between expectation of victory and
intolerance of defeat is as indelibly part of this team as the
samba rhythm to which it plays.
</P>
<P>
   That strain was visible on Zagallo's weathered face after a taut
victory on penalty kicks over the Netherlands in Tuesday's
semifinal. Zagallo was so overcome that he left the field in tears.
He said he had begun taking tranquilizers to calm his nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, I don't expect them to build a statue for me,''
Dunga, the team's irritable captain, said of Brazil's rabid fans.
``But if we lose, they'll kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tournament began, the knock on Brazil was that it had
great players but not a great team. But that is also what makes the
squad so endearing. Sure, Brazil is inevitably glamorous, but it
has reached the championship game having endured evident flaws and
disquieting struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has one superstar in Ronaldo, who is considered the
world's greatest player and who churns toward the goal with a
middleweight's power and a halfback's speed. And there are young
magicians like Rivaldo, who necessarily straddles selfishness and
unselfishness, and Denilson, who seems to have the ball tethered to
his feet like a yo-yo. But the foundation of the team has been
built on the overlooked and the underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has reached this point, not with the splendid dominance
of previous World Cups, but with many players who were thought to
be too old and slow or too inexperienced and unprepared. It has
overcome internal bickering and incessant external criticism. And
it has survived the loss of Romario, the most valuable player in
the 1994 World Cup, who was sent home with a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brazil has relied on players like Bebeto, the
34-year-old forward taken out of mothballs to score three goals,
only one fewer than Ronaldo. It has relied on its balding
goalkeeper, Taffarel, who, sensitive to criticism, quit the team
temporarily in 1995 and briefly played on a church team. It has
relied on Ze Carlos, a defender who was selling watermelons a year
ago to supplement his soccer income and who had never started a
match until the crucible of the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's least celebrated starter, the midfielder Cesar Sampaio,
was ignored in 1994 and appeared to have steered his career into an
international dead end in Japan's professional league three years
ago. But he has become one of the team's most reliable scorers.
While every day seems like Carnival with this raucous sideshow of a
team, Sampaio prefers the quietly religious life, leading Bible
study sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The captain is the crusty 34-year-old Dunga, a midfielder who
runs this team with his long passes and his short temper. Brazilian
fans said he is nicknamed for one of Snow White's seven dwarfs _
Grumpy, no doubt _ and he nearly came to blows with Bebeto in the
middle of a first-round match against Morocco. But his sheer will
is the adhesive that holds this team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like players who bring confidence to a team,'' said Pele,
the greatest Brazilian World Cup star of them all. ``They shout at
players, fight with players, bring them to the game.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zagallo has been involved in all four of Brazil's World Cup
titles _ as a player in 1958 and 1962, as head coach in 1970 and as
an assistant to Carlos Alberto Parreira in 1994. Curiously, though,
Zagallo's success has never brought great trust from Brazil's fans.
</P>
<P>
   He is second-guessed constantly by Pele and other former Brazil
stars. After the loss to the United States, Zagallo was called
``second rate'' by Carlos Alberto, captain of the 1970 championship
team. Earlier this week, Pele lamented that Brazil's players
``don't exactly know what to do when they get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, they are a very good team,'' Pele said Friday.
``But Zagallo didn't have enough time to train the team. Parreira
had six months in 1994. Zagallo had 20 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, criticism is nothing new for a Brazilian coach.
Parreira's own mother criticized him for not playing Ronaldo, who
was then 17, during the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   With four goals in this World Cup, Ronaldo has not threatened
the tournament record of 13, set in 1958 by Just Fontaine of
France. But neither at age 21 has he crumbled under the burden of
expectation, this son of a mother who worked in an ice-cream parlor
and a father who struggled with alcohol, this megastar whose first
efforts at the junior level were thwarted in the Rio suburbs
because he could not afford bus fare. He has demonstrated the
footwork of a tango dancer, precise, unselfish passing and a
relentless charge toward the goal that the Netherlands could not
stop even by grabbing his jersey and the waistband of his shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has conceded seven goals in this tournament, compared
with three in 1994. But that team surrendered much of its flair for
the vise-grip pragmatism of defense. Zagallo has liberated this
team from its marionette strings and allowed it to entertain as
well as to win.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been great balance _ Ronaldo has four goals,
Bebeto, Rivaldo and Sampaio have three apiece _ a more organized
midfield and mesmerizing freelance work. Against the Netherlands,
the 20-year-old prodigy, Denilson, stepped over the ball four times
in one exquisite sequence, dancing an elusive jig as he sought a
detour around a defensive roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo remains supremely confident about his place in history,
despite the public battering he has absorbed and the apparent toll
it has taken on his nerves. Defiantly, he has guaranteed victory
over France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Cup is safe in our hands, with our faith and our
courage,'' Zagallo said. ``When you open the pages of a history
book after I'm far from here, there will be living pages. There
will be the name of a man called Zagallo.'' &QL;

RUMORS GROW: RUBIN WILL LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>

(bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Wall Street, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is
probably the only member of the Clinton administration described in
consistently admiring terms.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no wonder that every time a rumor surges through the
markets that Rubin, who grew up on the Street, is thinking of
stepping down, traders tremble at their terminals. And there have
been plenty of such rumors over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, the rumors are emanating not from the
trading floors but from some of the secretary's Cabinet colleagues.
Right or wrong, it is accepted wisdom among them that he is
planning to leave Washington by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week after the midterm elections,'' predicted one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to go months ago,'' insisted another, ``but he
couldn't resign while Asia was coming unhinged.''
</P>
<P>
   A third said it was widely assumed that Rubin would leave,
although no one had heard that from him directly.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Treasury, midlevel officials are already handicapping
the chances of prospective successors, particularly those of
Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, the onetime Harvard economist who
is clearly tempering his quick tongue and toning up his sometimes
haphazard attire to appear more, well, Rubinesque.
</P>
<P>
   Summers does not have a lock on the job. Some give an edge to
James Johnson, the longtime Washington power broker and departing
head of Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home mortgage
association. There is also lingering talk of Franklin Raines, who
recently resigned as director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget to succeed Johnson. Raines was reportedly
eager to leave the administration but might find Treasury
irresistible if President Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin hates travel, and some view his recent journey surveying
the economic devastation in Asia and a weeklong trip to Africa that
begins Saturday as farewell tours.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary himself is not exactly clarifying the situation.
Talking to him about his future is a bit like trying to extract
from him an inkling of when the United States might next intervene
in the currency markets. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   He will tell you what his wife, Judy, thinks: Her dislike of
Washington and its pretensions is legendary, and she has voted with
her feet for the last five and a half years, remaining in New York.
( Rubin travels frequently between the two cities, by either
shuttle or executive jet.)
</P>
<P>
   He might also muse, but briefly, about the merits of staying or
going, about his continuing fascination with this moment of
bewildering global market instability and about the personal toll
of what he terms a difficult life style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of important and interesting issues I'd like
to be involved in going forward,'' he said. ``On the other hand,
there are countervailing considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, borrowing terminology from the deliberate obfuscation he
employed last week in talking about when to prop up the Japanese
yen, he added, ``I'll do what seems to be appropriate and not do
what doesn't seem appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   His closest confidants say Rubin will decide in the next few
months, perhaps while fly-fishing this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the administration believe that he can be persuaded to
remain with some combination of presidential arm-twisting and fears
that his departure could further unnerve edgy markets. In fact, his
aides try to dissuade reporters from writing about the rumors of
his departure at all, for fear that the articles alone could uncork
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rubin has become the market,'' one top Japanese diplomat
complained the other day during a visit to Washington, arguing that
the secretary's thumbs up or thumbs down on Japan's latest economic
contortions was the only signal investors were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   All this argues in favor of Summers' candidacy. He has long
played the role of Rubin's alter ego and debating partner, and has
become an increasingly fervent believer in the Rubin world view
that the power of markets must be respected by governments. Indeed,
it is Rubin's brand of market-driven economic conservatism that has
become the orthodoxy of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers' relationship over the years with Vice President Al
Gore has reportedly been rocky, and Gore will presumably have a
major voice in who sets economic policy during his run for the
presidency. Further, Summers angered many in Congress during the
bailout of Mexico with his lectures about America's
responsibilities as the guardian of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the deputy secretary has become a much more
careful political animal. He also got a major boost recently when
Rubin talked to The New Yorker about what a fine Treasury secretary
he would make someday, comments that added fuel to the latest round
of Rubin rumors.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason Rubin might go: Much of the time, the
Treasury secretary's job is not much fun these days.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last two months, federal judges have rejected the
Treasury's effort to create a ``protective function privilege'' for
the Secret Service that would have kept Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr from questioning agents who guard Clinton
about what they might have seen occur between the president and
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely comfortable with our position on this,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the embarrassment of the hearings on the IRS that
resulted in legislation forcing the Treasury to share authority
over the IRS with an outside board. Rubin and Summers made clear
their distaste for the bill last fall, then did a complete
turnabout when the inevitability of its adoption became clear.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's biggest frustration has been the unwillingness of
Congress to increase the U.S. contribution to the International
Monetary Fund, the international agency battling the global
economic contagion sweeping from Asia to Russia to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``His patience with the Hill is a lot thinner than it was,'' one
aide noted recently.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as another administration official who works with Rubin
often points out, reading his mind is like forecasting the markets,
and just as risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves his job,'' this official said. ``He remains
fascinated by what he does and shows no sign of any intellectual
apathy. You can't say that about many people in Washington.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: THE WORLD CUP FROM 1 to 10  
(For release Sunday, July 12) 
(jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ One of the great traditions of soccer is rating the
players (and the officials) after each game. This is serious
business. When he was playing for Napoli, the addled Diego Armando
Maradona once threatened to kneecap an Italian reporter who had
assigned him a 3 in the scale of 1 to 10 (but in which 8's are
extremely rare).
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of La Gazetta dello Sport and L'Equipe and other
journals, I now deliver my highly personal ratings on the World
Cup, which holds its championship game tonight.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL _ The Brazilians are the core of their sport, the way the
Montreal Canadiens and Boston Celtics and Notre Dame used to be in
theirs. Nobody resents the presence of Brazilian players or fans,
who turn every city, every World Cup, into Carnaval. Brazil will
win its fifth World Cup, on sheer talent and institutional history.
Muito obrigado. Thanks, so much.7.5.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE, THE TEAM _ They came into this World Cup with a
reputation for being faint-hearted fold artists, but they have been
charismatic and professional. It cannot all be attributed to being
the home team. I think the loss of Laurent Blanc for the needless
red card will hurt Les Bleus. 7.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE, ITSELF _ It is perhaps the most compactly complete and
beautiful country in the world. Paris is more beautiful than ever,
Lyon and Nantes and Aix-en-Provence were delightful, and, in this
jet-and-television-and-Internet era, the people are far more
flexible about visitors' ghastly French. Even with their smoking
habits: 7.5.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN SOCCER ESTABLISHMENT _ Having praised U.S. officials
for retaining Steve Sampson last year, I say we must call it a
collective national failure. The United States is just not there.
Sampson thought he had somehow become a genius. The older players
overrated themselves, and set a bad example. The younger players
did not have the heart of the older players. And the leadership let
it happen. Don't hold your breath for qualification in 2002. For
this year: 3.5.
</P>
<P>
   THE SKILL PLAYERS _ When I was a dreadful fullback in high
school a thousand years ago, I thought scorers were instruments of
the devil for the way they dribbled around me. In my mature years,
I have come to appreciate every goal they can conjure up. For touch
and instinct, I give thanks for Zinedine Zidane, Youri Djorkaeff,
Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Roberto Baggio, Patrick Kluivert, the Laudrup
brothers, the Nigerian brothers, and most of all Michael Owen,
whose quick feet and brash opportunism turned on the crowds. In the
informal way of saying thank you around Owen's native Chester, on
the border of Wales: Ta. 8.
</P>
<P>
   THE HACKERS _ There were kickers, shirt-grabbers, back-passers,
and coaches who feared losing so much that they plotted defensive
formations. I could have sworn I saw a team in red, white and blue
using three defenders, six midfielders and one lone striker. For
negative soccer: 3.
</P>
<P>
   THE REFEREES _ They were all over the place with their calls,
reacting to daily revisions and complaints and orders and updates
from FIFA central, soccer being invented on the run in the middle
of a World Cup. I give the refs a 4. No, make that a 6. Maybe a 3.
Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   BEST DOUBLE DIP _ Exiled Iranian fans who wore T-shirts
protesting the current regime, and then cheered the 2-1 victory
over the hapless Yanks. 7.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH RAILROADS _ Watching the beautiful countryside floating
by at 100 miles an hour or more, I wanted to never get in an
airplane again. I love the train stations, with their bars and
newspaper kiosks, in the hearts of the old cities. Bon voyage. 8.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GAME I SAW _ Nigeria 3, Spain 2 on a chilly, rainy
afternoon in Nantes. Those two teams went at the goal for 90
minutes, nonstop. 7.
</P>
<P>
   BEST HALF I SAW _ England 2, Argentina 2 on a hot night in
St-Etienne. Then the idiotic foul by David (Red Card Spice) Beckham
turned the game into a defensive trudge. 7.5, followed by a 4.
</P>
<P>
   THE PEOPLE _ The Portuguese concierge in our building, the
African cabbies, the Vietnamese man who runs the Saigon restaurant
in Aix, the immigrants who work hard and make this country run. The
French street cleaner who found my World Cup credential and called
the New York Times bureau to return it. The people who cooked the
excellent $10 plats-du-jour in the cafe right below our apartment.
The old ladies who would stop and offer directions. Je vous
remercie. 9.
</P>
<P>
   THE VOLUNTEERS _ At the Press Centers, they all spoke three or
four languages. They knew how to get information. They were worldly
and adult. I wish they had been in Atlanta in 1996. Another 9.
</P>
<P>
   THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE _ For the modern technology, the good
signs, the thoughtful juice and water on hot nights, a definite
7.5.
</P>
<P>
   THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE _ For allowing journalists to smoke
incessantly in every press center I saw, including cramped offices
where we had to grovel for tickets. I'm sending you my dry-cleaning
bills, and if I come down with emphysema or asthma or worse, you'll
be hearing from my lawyer. 0.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA _ For making it difficult for a soccer-loving columnist to
cover my fifth World Cup, not making sure we all have seats for
games and access to interviews after games, for not providing news
conferences or reliable information on practices, for falling even
further behind the press-information skills of all major leagues in
North America: 2.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD CUP _ Having expanded the tournament from 24 to 32
teams, FIFA now recognizes it is too long at 33 days. However,
there has been a laudable attempt to include African, Asian and
North American teams, even if they are bumped out early, plus a
noticeable recruitment of talented third-world officials. FIFA has
set up serious problems by splitting the 2002 World Cup between
Japan and South Korea. Despite the bumbling and the arrogance, this
is still the greatest sports event in the world. 7.

 &HT;    Austin plant to make new Siemens phones
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Siemens, the big German telecommunications
manufacturer, has tapped its 500-employee Austin plant to
manufacture a new line of cordless phones it hopes will broaden the
market for such phones beyond families and into home offices and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin factory, at 2205 Grand Avenue Parkway, now makes
telephone handsets for private branch exchanges (PBXs) used by
businesses to handle telephone traffic, but that production is
being shipped to Leipzig, Germany, said Kristine Ryan, a
spokeswoman for Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   Production will begin on the new cordless phones in early
September and sales are expected to begin in the last quarter of
the year, in time for Christmas, Siemens officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The market for the phones is potentially a huge one: Siemens
estimates the small office and home office market has about 9
million potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The phones' base desk station can handle two phone lines and has
built-in features like Caller ID, an answering machine and a fax
machine connection and one cordless phone. However, the system can
handle up to eight cordless phones, and those can be used as an
intercom. The talking range within a building is about 200 feet.
Suggested retail price is about $400, and additional cordless
handsets will be $129. To get beyond the household and into the
office the phone was designed with two significant improvements
over similar systems to meet the higher demands of business: sound
quality as good as wired phones and security to avoid
eavesdroppers, said Marina Jarvis, a senior product manager for
Siemens who helped develop the product.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences, Jarvis said, come in part from using a higher
frequency _ 2.4 gigahertz. Other cordless systems, she said,
operate at 900 megahertz. The higher frequency is less subject to
electronic interference.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the new phone will use a voice-encoding technology to
block unwanted lurkers from listening in on conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hodges, a telecommunications consultant who works with
Austin-based Technology Futures Inc., a consulting firm that
specializes in studying trends in technology development, said the
new Siemens cordless phone sounds more evolutionary than
revolutionary, but nevertheless is a significant step ``toward an
untethered future.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are getting ever more accustomed to using phones
without being limited by connecting wires, Hodges said. That's true
both of cordless phones, which have a very limited range, and
wireless telephones, like cellular and PCS systems, which have
enormous range.
</P>
<P>
   For small businesses and home offices, Hodges said, Siemens'
cordless phone systems will offer a significant cost savings in not
having to wire an office or rewire it when someone moves a desk or
to a different room.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the cordless phone system would be sold through
specialty catalogs aimed at small business and high-end residential
users, retailers such as office stores and telephone companies.

   The New York Times News Service has moved the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, July 12,

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORY  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POP-MUSIC (Tokyo) _ For the past two decades, Japan has
been home to the world's largest music industry next to America,
but only recently _ in the face of economic crisis and sweeping
social changes _ has it reached the diversity and originality
necessary to propel its musicians in the West. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DRAWING-SCHOOL (New York) _ When the drawing marathon at the New
York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture on a Monday
morning in mid-June, 97 artists, students, architects, Sunday
painters, art critics and teachers from Australia, Mexico,
Switzerland, England, Israel, the Philippines, California, Alabama,
Massachusetts, Washington, stood ready at their easels to draw for
eight hours a day, five days a week, in seven separate studios.
This biannual event, dreamed up 10 years ago by Graham Nickson, an
enigmatic, soft-spoken British painter who is the dean of the
school, seemed to be far better known outside New York than inside.
Few had come from close by. Many had traveled thousands of miles
for it. By Sarah Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GREAT-CITIES (Undated) _ Here is an urban theme and five
variations. D.W. Winnicott, the great British child psychoanalyst,
believed that artists are driven by the conflict between the desire
to communicate and the even stronger desire to hide. Flip this idea
around, and you arrive at a useful theory for interpreting the
contemporary city: Great cities are driven by the conflict between
the desire to expose and the even stronger desire to overlook. By
Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NOVELTIES-DANCE (New York) _ It was Sol Hurok, an impresario
with a keen eye on the box office, who grasped the ballet public's
hunger for what he called ``novelties.'' These were new
productions, mainly premieres but also revivals of works so rarely
seen that they took on the aura of a premiere. A prime example was
Hurok's historic presentation of a full-length ``Sleeping Beauty''
when the Sadler's Wells Ballet made its New York debut in 1949.
During their recent seasons, American Ballet Theater and New York
City Ballet each offered the same two kinds of ``novelties.'' Both
commissioned a new work and presented an unusual revival,
transferred from another company. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LAFURA-DELSBAUS-THEATER (Barcelona) _ La Fura Del Baus is as
unusual a name in Catalan as it is in English: The Ferret from the
Baus. But there was method to the fantasy of the five young street
performers who chose the name of their new experimental theater
company in Barcelona in 1979. Today, La Fura dels Baus is
synonymous with an unorthodox multidisciplinary form of theater
that uses loud music, violent movement, bizarre machinery and
almost no words to create a near-apocalyptic atmosphere. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   IRVING-CIDERHOUSE-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ When John Irving began
work on ``The Cider House Rules,'' his sprawling 1985 novel about
eight decades in the life of a rural Maine orphanage, he says he
had no intention of writing a wrenching polemic on abortion or, it
seems safe to say, a work that would be the basis for a 2-part,
6-hour marathon play with 22 actors portraying 120 characters in
150 scenes. But 13 years after the book's publication and 6 years
after a trio of theater professionals conceived the notion of
dramatizing it, ``The Cider House Rules'' has become all that and
more in a production of the same name that opened July 11 at the
Mark Taper Forum here and runs through Sept. 27. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER-BRAIN (New York) _ ``A New Brain,'' William Finn's
latest chamber opera, is the composer-lyricist's attempt to deal
with what was obviously a doomy, seriously traumatic experience:
the preliminary diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumor, which he
received in 1992 just two weeks after winning Tonys for his book
and score for ``Falsettos.'' By Vincent Canby.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-PRETEENS (Undated) _ Placing the pre- or early-adolescent
point of view in the thick of sophisticated conflict has a
venerable cinematic past, of course _ think of Truffaut's ``400
Blows'' and Spielberg's ``E.T.'' And its practical esthetic appeal
is a compelling one that's not so difficult to decipher: the pre-or
early adolescent is old enough to be both perceptive witness and
provocative participant yet young enough not to have retreated
fully behind the blinkers of self-contemplation and social
convention. By Will Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   ROMERO-HORROR-MOVIES (Undated) _ Released in 1985, ``Day of the
Dead'' is one of four Romero titles just reissued on video by
Anchor Bay. Included is his first feature film and zombie original,
``Night of the Living Dead'' (1968), shot in black and white in
Pittsburgh for $114,000. ``It would be fun to dismiss this as
undoubtedly the best movie ever made in Pittsburgh,'' the critic
Pauline Kael wrote, ``but it also happens to be one of the most
gruesomely terrifying movies ever made.'' By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   SADNESS-SEX-MOVIE (Undated) _ In late 1994 a film was made that
centered on me and my dark whimsies about romance and heartbreak:
``The Sadness of Sex,'' from my book of the same name. Here's my
sorry tale of how this odd independent movie was brought briefly to
the screen _ and then to the shelf, where it now sits, maybe for
good. The story is my two cents toward the updating of ``Candide''
that famously takes place when a neophyte like me gets involved in
the mad, bad world of glamour-grabbing and economic hardball that
is the film business. By Barry Yourgrau.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PACIFIC-PARADISE-TV (Undated) _ It happens at night in the
summertime when the moon is full and the tides are just right. The
coral reefs of Palau go into a spasm of reproductive surrender,
sowing warm currents with trillions of eggs and sperm that swirl
and dance and ultimately merge to form new life. The orgy is so
wild that in some places, eggs rise through the sea like
snowflakes, blizzards of them. Even sea cucumbers get into the
mood. In the moonlight they suddenly rise up and dance in hypnotic
rhythms, swaying back and forth to seed a new generation. These are
some of the remarkable sights of ``Palau: Paradise of the
Pacific,'' to be shown on Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. on the PBS series
``The Living Edens.'' By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   OZ-TV-NEWSEASON (Undated) _ Don't look for Dorothy or Toto.
That's the other place. This is Oz, short for Oswald Maximum
Security Penitentiary. Emerald City, the high-tech experimental
prison-within-a-prison _ referred to as Em City _ stresses
rehabilitation. It's run by Tim McManus (Terry Kinney), a 1960s
throwback who believes even the most hardened criminal can change.
Ernie Hudson plays his boss, the warden, a forceful authority
figure who knows better. The critically acclaimed HBO drama series
begins its second eight-episode season July 13 at 10 p.m. By Paula
Schwartz.

pages of haute-runway literature. You would, however, be mistaken,
insisted McInerney, who said that fashion is simply one strand of
his new novel, ``Model Behavior,'' which chronicles the unraveling
relationship of a fashion magazine journalist and his size 6
girlfriend who is gainfully employed as a model in the New York
hothouse of fashion, where appearance is destiny and ``breathless

doctor who, she said, understood her predicament and agreed to
perform the surgery: Dr. Michelle Copeland, who works out of a
Fifth Avenue office complete with its own operating room and
all-female staff, down to the anesthesiologist. ``Now I couldn't
even imagine going to a man for any plastic surgery,'' Ms.
Hallberg, 26, said. ``A man can study the woman's body forever, but
I believe he can never really understand how a woman is put

it is adaptable, and can be grown well beyond its native haunts.
Although a fig tree can grow quite large in Mediterranean climates,
it is easily coaxed into becoming a more easily protected bush or
small tree. Even the roots do not mind being pruned or cramped. The
fig's unique fruiting habit also lends itself to northern growing. &QL;

   HANDKERCHIEF-CHIC (Undated) _ A white linen handkerchief can do
more for a man's personal style and comfort during the summer heat
than the lightest-weight tropical wool suit. It is odd that what
was once a simple utilitarian item has acquired a reputation as a
stuffy, ante-bellum accessory. By David Colman.

   BOLIVIA-REVIEW (La Paz, Bolovia) _ All around Latin America,
book stores are well stocked with new texts about free markets and
global free trade. Such books brim with hope for the future, and
they are beginning to appear even in this backwater capital high in
the Andes. But here, they still have to share shelf space with a
rather depressing best-seller that carries a very different
message. The book, first published in 1937, is Alcides Arguedas'
``A Sick People,'' and it seems at times that every literate
Bolivian has read it. By Clifford Krauss.

   CZAR-BURIAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ In writing, ``Uneasy lies the
head that wears a crown,'' Shakespeare couldn't have imagined the
likes of Nicholas II, Russia's last czar, whose remains will be
interred on Friday in St. Petersburg, Russia, along with those of
his family. Nicholas was considered a lightweight, a weak,
unengaged but brutal ruler who preferred family life to affairs of
state, even as the 300-year-old Romanov empire was collapsing
around him. His burial, however, is a potent political symbol for
post-Communist Russia. By Judith Dobrzynski.

   JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ There's a curious new genre that

   SCIENCE-RELIGION-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the century began,
optimists could easily have convinced themselves that by the time
2000 rolled around there would be nothing left for scientists and

how to divvy up the intellectual terrain. Science would continue
its inevitable march toward a grand explanation of how the material

   LABOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The United States may not yet resemble
France, which is paralyzed every year or two by a strike, but
suddenly American labor unions have taken to the streets in a way
not seen in decades. Some labor stalwarts who grew up singing
``Solidarity Forever'' are hailing recent developments as signaling
that union militancy, squelched in the Reagan years, is making a
comeback. But other analysts suggest that this month's three-ring
labor circus is a coincidental confluence of events that should be
viewed as exceptions to the long, steady decline of militancy. By
Steven Greenhouse.

   OPTIMISM ON EARNINGS BOLSTERS STOCK MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about earnings prospects returned to the stock market,
driving the major market measures higher. Investors were
particularly upbeat about the outlooks for banks and other
financial companies and for consumer goods companies.
</P>
<P>
   After falling on Thursday on DuPont's warning about
second-quarter earnings, the Dow Jones industrial average gained
15.96 points in a seesaw session, closing at 9,105.74. American
Express, Procter &AMP; Gamble and J.P. Morgan led the advance. For the
week, the Dow was up 80.48 points. The Nasdaq set its third

<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin urged Western leaders to support
a multibillion-dollar package of financial assistance to defend the
ruble. Russian officials said they were now seeking assistance of
$20 billion or more, at least $10 billion of which it hopes would
come from the International Monetary Fund. The request reflects

</P>
<P>
   Boeing increased the base prices of its multimillion-dollar

   PRODUCER PRICES FELL IN JUNE
</P>
<P>
   Producer prices fell in June for the first time in three months

IRS REPORT CITES ABUSES IN SEIZURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day after Congress gave final approval to
legislation overhauling the Internal Revenue Service, the tax
collection agency released an internal report Friday that found
widespread problems in the way it seized property from delinquent
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate internal review also released Friday, the IRS
reiterated earlier findings that the agency had put meeting
statistical enforcement goals ahead of ensuring that taxpayers were
treated fairly during audits. The reports were the latest in a
series done by the IRS following Senate Finance Committee hearings
last year in which the agency was accused of harassing and
intimidating taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance
Committee, said Friday's reports were a ``stunning confession of
the sins of the IRS'' and validated contentions in Congress' that
the agency needed a top-to-bottom overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the fact that I heard about problems in the
committee's hearings and in thousands of letters from taxpayers,
these reports are still astonishing in the scope of the taxpayer
abuse they confirm and in the fact that the reports are from the
agency itself,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 96-2 Thursday to approve a bill that creates a
host of new protections for taxpayers who get into disputes with
the IRS and establishes an outside board with broad authority over
the tax agency's operations. President Clinton said he would sign
the bill, which was approved overwhelmingly by the House last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Keith, a spokesman for the IRS, said the timing of the
release was a coincidence. He said the agency had completed the
report earlier this week, and released it Friday after spending
several days removing any references that might identify particular
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of 467 cases in which the IRS seized cars, homes,
cash and other assets from taxpayers, the report found that agents
had failed to follow proper procedures 130 times.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, the report said, included failing to pursue
alternatives to seizures, failing to notify taxpayers before
seizures, taking assets worth little more than the costs of seizing
them and ignoring mitigating circumstances that created hardships
for the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   In one case documented by the report the IRS seized a 1986 truck
from a taxpayer without the required in-person warning. The truck
was then sold by the IRS for $425, netting the government $7 after
accounting for the $418 expenses involved in seizing the truck.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another case involved a contractor who had suffered a heart
attack two years earlier, and was suffering from high blood
pressure and bleeding ulcers. The taxpayer's file showed he had
been cooperative in attempting to pay his overdue tax bill,
providing all requested information and even charging his credit
cards to their maximum to get cash for the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Although the IRS recommended at one point that the tax debt be
classified as uncollectible _ the equivalent of dropping the case _
the recommendation was never processed. Ignoring notification
requirements and procedures governing potential taxpayer hardship
and the likelihood that a seizure will bring in little money, the
collections division seized the man's car, and released it only
after the man agreed to an installment payment plan that will last
more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases cited in the report involved collection actions
against taxpayers who were disabled by cancer, a seizure action
against grandparents who were raising two grandchildren and paying
major medical expenses, and a revenue agent who seized $500 worth
of goods from a grocery store owned by a taxpayer whose wife had
fallen ill and could no longer work.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the report, the IRS said it was taking a number
of steps, including developing a comprehensive check sheet
identifying all legal and procedural requirements for seizures and
sales of property and improving training materials. The agency said
it would also incorporate ``reasonable alternative collection
methods'' into its procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's review of the use of statistics by audit managers
found widespread violations of IRS regulations intended to avert
the establishment of production quotas or goals that would lead
auditors to inflate tax liabilities or pressure taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The examination division's management philosophy ``focused
primarily on enforcement statistics, which fostered improper use of
enforcement statistics,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the IRS said it had already stopped ranking the
performance of regional and district offices to reduce pressure to
compete internally to post the best revenue-collection numbers.
Starting this year, management evaluations will not include
enforcement results. &QL;

A CALL FOR RENEWAL OF THE LEFT WITHOUT RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (bl) 
 By PETER STEINFELS    
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Religious ideas, leaders, organizations and appeals have been an
integral part of American reform politics. Turn-of-the-century
progressives and even many socialists were imbued by liberal
Christianity and influenced by the Social Gospel movement. The
labor movement and the welfare state drew heavily on Jewish and
Roman Catholic communal traditions. Black churches were the
birthplaces and command centers of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Now an eminent philosopher, whose maternal grandfather, Walter
Rauschenbusch, was the theological genius of the Social Gospel, has
issued a vigorous plea for the reconstitution of a broad, pragmatic
and reformist left in the United States. And one of the most
interesting things about this plea is the place it makes _ or does
not make _ for religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Achieving Our Country'' (Harvard University Press, 1998) is
the plea, and its author is Richard Rorty, a scholar often called
the leading gadfly of contemporary philosophy. This may be an
understatement, like calling the lethal iceberg the leading gadfly
of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of ``Achieving Our Country'' is Rorty's critique of
the ``cultural left.'' Barricaded in the university, this left has
isolated itself, he asserts, from the bread-and-butter issues of
economic equality and security and the practical political
struggles that once occupied the American reform tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Rorty, who is leaving the University of Virginia to become
professor of comparative literature at Stanford, sees leftist
intellectuals as launching increasingly abstruse and theoretical
assaults on the original sins of Western society, from capitalism
to heterosexism.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, controversies are seeded like land mines in every
paragraph of this short book. Conservatives have already fumed over
Rorty's nearly total silence about conservative ideas, as though it
were beyond the thinkable that grappling with them might have
anything to do with reconstituting a vital left.
</P>
<P>
   An even more intriguing absence in Rorty's vision of a renewed
left is religion. One might say that while ``Achieving Our
Country'' never rules out a place for religious forces in a
reformist coalition, it simply does not allude to them. But the
truth is still more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's first chapter, the author expounds a concept of
legitimate national pride that he hopes could reanimate a reformist
left. This national pride springs from a vision of America that
Rorty ascribes to Walt Whitman and John Dewey, a utopian vision in
which a nation free of caste and class would ``replace God as the
unconditional object of desire.'' For the poet and the philosopher,
America and democracy meant ``a new conception of what it is to be
human _ a conception which has no room for obedience to a nonhuman
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   It requires no complex reasoning to recognize why such an
animating vision would create problems for religious believers.
Indeed, for Jews, Christians and Muslims, some of this language
seems to meet the technical definition of idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   Rorty is not at all unaware of the power of religion as a moral
force in the United States. In a recent telephone conversation, he
acknowledged that ``in the foreseeable future the churches are as
likely to be on the right side as the wrong side'' in political
struggles. But that cannot alter his conviction, he said, that ``in
the final stages of democracy we won't need religion anymore.'' He
added that such a conviction may be ``off-putting, but I deeply
believe it _ I find the idea inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   This conviction is, of course, consistent with Rorty's
longstanding position, argued in books and essays that even his
critics find dazzling, that all efforts to seek rational grounding
for moral claims, whether in some objective facts ``out
there,''some common human nature or some universal principles, are
futile hangovers from immature longings for religious certitude.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that religion does appear in ``Achieving
Our Country'' after all _ as a term of condemnation. Whenever Rorty
wants to chastise the ``cultural left,'' he accuses it of
abandoning secularism, getting religion or turning metaphysical.
</P>
<P>
   What is most interesting about all this is the tone. Despite
protestations of pragmatism, there is no sense that Rorty has
assessed the realistic prospects of making ``Whitmanesque
hypersecularism'' the centerpiece for building a broad reformist
coalition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, on the other hand, is there any sense that the author has
coolly decided to rally academic leftists at the cost of alienating
religious ones, who might understandably resist enlisting in a
battalion that has already emblazoned religion's epitaph on its
banners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the anti-religious sentiments of ``Achieving Our
Country'' are matter-of-fact, unself-conscious, presented in the
untroubled tone that people often use in criticizing a group they
cannot imagine is even in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the reality? Does religion _ except in a negative sense
_ simply fall outside the horizons of discussions about the
intellectual left and its future?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not too much should be concluded from a one-of-a-kind
thinker like Richard Rorty. It is interesting, however, that when
asked whether anyone else had raised questions about his book's
treatment of religion, Rorty said no.

GREG RAY TO REPLACE INJURED BILLY BOAT FOR A.J. FOYT'S TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Greg Ray is resuming his Indy Racing League
career today as ``hired gun'' driver for team owner A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, of Plano, will replace the recuperating Billy Boat in
Foyt's car beginning with the Pep Boys 400K at Dover (Del.) Downs
International Speedway on July 19. Ray also is scheduled to drive
Foyt's No. 11 Conseco Dallara/Aurora under the lights at Charlotte
Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., on July 25, as the IRL reels off
two races within six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming in as a hired gun while Billy is away,'' Ray said
yesterday, before heading to A.J. Foyt Enterprises in Houston for
the weekend. ``I'm very excited and want to drive A.J.'s car. It's
a pretty big honor. But by no means am I after Billy's seat. I'm
just doing the best I can to further my career. And I wish Billy a
speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat, winner of the True Value 500K at Texas Motor Speedway here
June 6, sustained a broken left leg and fractured pelvis in a crash
during the most recent Pep Boys IRL race at New Hampshire
International Speedway on June 28. Boat's doctors have listed his
recovery timetable at eight weeks. But Boat, pole sitter for the
Indianapolis 500 in May, said yesterday that he plans to keep his
downtime to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back for Pikes Peak for sure,'' said Boat, referring
to the season's eighth race at Pikes Pike International Raceway in
Fountain, Colo., on Aug. 16. ``That's definite. Anything sooner
will be a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the fortunes of Boat and Ray have been linked at two
of the season's biggest events. Despite sponsorship problems, Ray
qualified second to Boat at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. And
Boat's victory at TMS came at the expense of Ray, who finished
0.928 seconds ahead of the No. 97 Dallara/Aurora owned by Thomas
Knapp.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts impressed Foyt, first four-time winner of the Indy
500, whose team also includes Kenny Brack of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg had some fine runs this year at Indy and Texas,'' Foyt
said. ``We had to work hard to beat him at both places. It was a
logical choice to have him drive for us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he, Foyt and team manager Tommy LaMance had been
negotiating for 10 days. A lack of sponsorship prompted Ray and
Knapp to skip the race in Loudon, N.H. Ray and Knapp were planning
to return to the series at CMS and also run at Atlanta Motor
Speedway (Aug. 29), the second race at TMS (Sept. 20) and the
season finale at Las Vegas Motor Speedway (Oct. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a full sponsorship for the Charlotte race, so
it would have been hard on us,'' said Ray, who had his seat flown
from Knapp's shop in Indy to Foyt's in Houston to be fitted into
the No. 11 car. ``Now I can focus on doing a good job for A.J. and
go back to my car with Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said Knapp, who also serves as his engineer, is not included
in the deal with Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do a good job at Dover and Charlotte and Billy's still
not in full health, maybe I would do Pikes Peak for them,'' said
Ray, whose nine IRL starts have been highlighted by the 18 laps he
led at Indy on May 24. ``Billy's recuperating pretty quickly, so it
depends on his health and well-being.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The corporate parks framed by oak trees and bike

   The worldwide security services company, which provides security

complex, property owner The Johnston Group of Calabasas announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-September, Pinkerton's will be moving into one building
and part of another facility at the Westlake Spectrum, taking over
68,000 square feet. The Johnston Group is spending more than
$1million to renovate the two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton's currently occupies a high-rise building on Ventura
Boulevard in Encino, a Los Angeles suburb located 16 miles
northwest of downtown, with the Pinkerton's name across the top.
The building will be subleased since the company's lease doesn't
end for a few more years, according to property owner TrizecHahn, a
Toronto-based real estate firm.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million move will transfer more than 200 jobs out of Los
Angeles to Westlake Village, located 35 miles northwest of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton's officials said the company had outgrown its Encino
offices when they announced this spring the search for a new
headquarters. Pinkerton's officials were unavaible for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Johnston, chairman of The Johnston Group, said he believes
the business-friendly attitude of city leaders in Westlake Village
drew Pinkerton's to the upscale community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They considered a number of facilities along the (Ventura
Freeway) corridor,'' he said. ``In some of the other communities,
some members of the (city) council have not been as responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Westlake Village's City Council _ which is
currently building a new City Hall, library and community center at
the Spectrum Complex _ agreed that it would let tenants share its
60 parking spaces during business hours.
</P>
<P>
   The city will reclaim the spaces in the evenings and weekends
for council hearings and community events. In return, the corporate
tenants also will share their parking spaces during special events
that draw big crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also charges more taxes and fees than many cities in
the region. However, a spokesman for Mayor Riordan's L.A.'s
Business Team said the city is studying ways to cut its taxes to be
more desirable to companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton's move will enhance Westlake Village's reputation as a
center of corporate headquarters, said Tom Parker, president of The
Emerald Group, an international security management and
investigations firm. Food manufacturer Dole is already in Westlake
Village and footwear maker K-Swiss Inc. will soon move from the
L.A. suburb of Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Westlake Village is a very pleasant place for one's corporate
headquarters,'' Parker said. ``There's no smog or congestion.''
</P>
<P>
   The town is big enough for the two security firms, he said,
because their businesses are in different niches: The Emerald Group
focuses on executive theft or fraud within companies, while
Pinkerton's provides security personnel and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1850, Pinkerton's employs more than 47,000 people and
has 250 offices worldwide. Annual revenues exceed $1billion. The
company counts more than 80percent of the Fortune 1000 companies as
its clients. &QL;

BOARDMAN DISTRACTED BUT DETERMINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ This whole year has been a roller-coaster
ride, physically and mentally, for Chris Boardman, and now, as his
biggest moment in the bicycle-racing season arrives, he is heading
down, down, down.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tour de France starting Saturday, Boardman
characterized his state of mind in one word, ``depression.''
Although he would not elaborate, it was a surprising admission by
the rider who has won the short opening prologue twice in the last
four years and who should be the overwhelming favorite to win the
prologue again when the 85th Tour begins with a 3.5-mile spin
through the heart of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the world prologue championship,'' said Boardman, a
30-year-old Englishman. ``You've got to push.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my form is not there,'' he continued. ``Last year I came
to the start, and I thought: `If all goes well, I should win. I
might lose, but I should win.''' He did. ``This year I'll probably
be in the first five, and I might win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not being negative,'' he said, ``just realistic. That's
the way it is this year. You don't always have the form that you
want when you want it. This year, for various reasons, it's like
that for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boardman, the leader of the Gan team based in France, was
troubled earlier this season by what were described as gastric
upsets. Partly in compensation for lost time, partly because he is
addicted to training, he continued to work when many felt he should
be slacking off a bit. The result was that he became overtrained
and stale.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he began to overthink. By the time of the Prutour in
England late in May, he had not yet won a race. ``I'm riding below
par and as to why, I just do not know,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite scary, but you get used to failure,'' Boardman
said. ``You realize that you may very well be on a plateau or even
on the descent, but that's one of those things you don't want to
talk about. You don't know where the top is until you're looking
back at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boardman won the prologue in the Prutour and the first daily
stage after that, finishing second overall when the weeklong race
reached London. Two weeks later, he won both the prologue and the
long time trial in the Dauphine Libere race in France. The Tour of
Catalonia at the end of June went just as well, as he again won the
prologue and long time trial. Finally Boardman seemed to be on
track.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, however, he has begun to lose his power
to recover, which is essential for a rider in a three-week race
like the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   While Boardman has never coped well with the race's high
mountains, he normally would be expected to be a major factor in
the first long time trial, scheduled July 18 before the race enters
the Pyrenees. The course covers 36 miles, a bit longer than the
distance he traveled when he set the world record for the hour's
ride against the clock in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now his chances seem uncertain, considering his pessimism about
the prologue, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Boardman said he felt no special affinity for the Tour's start
in Dublin, where people drive on the left, the food is, at best,
hearty and the weather is cool, rainy and overcast _ all like home
in Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different,'' he said, ``the Tour de France is the Tour
de France, wherever it may start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel under tremendous pressure, because I feel the
responsibility that I have with the team. But when things haven't
gone well in the buildup, the security isn't there and it's not a
very pleasant time in the waiting game, waiting for it to happen.''

CHURCH AGREES TO PAY VICTIMS OF SEX ABUSE BY PRIEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In what is thought to be the largest such settlement
ever, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas agreed on Friday to pay
$23.4 million to eight former altar boys and the family of a ninth,
who were victimized by a priest in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, the diocese promised to bring in
professionals to examine its practices and to make recommended
changes to prevent such abuse in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settles the last complaints against Rudolph
``Rudy'' Kos, a former priest now serving a life sentence for
abusing boys in three churches in or near Dallas. One of the nine
plaintiffs to receive Friday's settlement is the family of a young
man who committed suicide. The diocese had agreed to pay three
other Kos victims $7.5 million in April.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements came after a Dallas jury last summer awarded a
record $119.6 million, plus interest, to 11 plaintiffs, a record in
a sexual-abuse case against a church. A 12th victim filed suit
after that award and was included in Friday's deal.
</P>
<P>
   Windle Turley, an attorney for the plaintiffs covered by
Friday's settlement, said his clients agreed to take so much less
than the jury awarded because they knew the diocese could not
afford the larger amount. ``It has never been the intention of
these individuals to destroy the diocese,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop of the diocese, Charles Grahmann, issued an apology
in announcing the payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the victims and their families, I once again want to
apologize on behalf of the diocese,'' he said in a written
statement. ``Based on what we know now, the decisions made
concerning Rudy Kos were errors in human judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret very much what happened, and I am deeply sorry for
your pain,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs had pointed out that Kos had served a year in a
juvenile detention center for molesting a neighbor and that his
ex-wife, in a deposition, said she informed a diocese
marriage-tribunal official of her former husband's sexual interest
in boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hierarchy of the Dallas diocese ignored the problem _ with
Kos and some other priests,'' said Pat Lemberger, whose son, Jay, a
former altar boy, committed suicide at age 21. ``They knew
something was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not jumping for joy,'' he said of the settlement. ``No
matter what they do _ how much money they give me _ it's not going
to bring my son back.''
</P>
<P>
   Another plaintiff, now a 32-year-old businessman in Dallas, said
he was first abused by Kos when he was in elementary school.
Finally having the church recognize what happened was better
therapy than the years he has spent with professionals, said the
plaintiff, James Sibert. ``That's the last step in my journey.''
</P>
<P>
   The diocese will have to borrow money and sell property to make
up the settlement portion not covered by its insurance, according
to Grahmann.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that the diocese _ which covers 64 churches
and seven missions in nine North Central Texas counties _ had
already set up a conduct review board with psychologists, a
law-enforcement officer, an attorney and a priest to handle
allegations of misconduct.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kos case was not the only sexual-abuse lawsuit the diocese
has had to contend with recently. In February it settled suits
involving two other former priests and five plaintiffs, agreeing to
pay $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual-abuse claims have become common in Roman Catholic
dioceses, according to Thomas Economus, a priest who is president
and co-founder of The Linkup, a group formed to help victims of
sexual abuse by clergy, based in Chicago. Because of this,
insurance companies have begun refusing coverage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church has responded to the problem by
choosing to hide it, deny it or litigate rather than rushing to the
aid of victims, Economus said. But Bill Ryan, spokesman for the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is not closing ranks,'' he said. ``The church is
dealing with this in an open manner and is making every effort to
root out this kind of problem and address it.''

BOEING RAISES BASE PRICES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to improve its long-term financial performance, Boeing
Co. said Friday that it had increased the base prices of its
multimillion-dollar passenger jets by 5 percent, the first such
increase since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and airlines immediately questioned the impact of
the move since nearly all of Boeing's customers pay steep discounts
on the company's list prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boeing was hoping to impress Wall Street, I, for one, am
hardly impressed,'' said Byron Callan, an aerospace analyst with
Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said that it had recently begun telling customers that
orders negotiated after July 1 would reflect the new prices. Those
prices previously ranged from $30.5 million for the 100-seat 717
jetliner to $176.5 million for the largest 747 jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Any new revenue Boeing would receive would not be booked until
after 2000 because of the long lead time between ordering and
delivering airplanes, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which is the world's largest aerospace company and the
country's single largest exporter, has been struggling since last
fall to overcome production problems that last year resulted in its
first annual loss in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors and analysts have criticized the commercial
airplane division for cutting its prices too deeply to avoid losing
orders to its rival Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.
Friday's news appears to contradict Boeing's previous contention
that the way to improve its profits was to cut costs, not raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are raising prices, what does that say about your
efforts to reduce costs?'' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Hayes, a Boeing spokeswoman, said the increases simply
brought Boeing's base prices more in line with those of Airbus,
which she said were 2 to 6 percent higher than Boeing's.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also changed the formula it uses to adjust its prices for
inflation between the time an airline places its original order and
when the aircraft is delivered, a period that can be several years
with large orders.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Hayes acknowledged that Boeing regularly gave its
customers discounts, she said the new base prices would raise the
starting point of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United Airlines, which is
about to place an order for short-haul jets, was skeptical. ``If
they start the negotiation from a higher point, that is their
prerogative,'' he said. ``We will see how it competes against
Airbus.'' &QL;

CONVICTIONS UPHELD IN MURDERS IN ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Butts County circuit judge Friday denied a request
that he overturn the 16-year-old murder convictions of Wayne
Williams, the Atlanta man sentenced to life in prison in 1982 in
the murders of two adults and blamed but never indicted in the
series of child killings here in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Williams have argued for years that prosecutors
withheld evidence in the state's case against him, including
wiretaps that implicated others, a claim that they had hoped would
result in the dismissal of his conviction and a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Judge Hal Craig ruled that Williams' conviction would
stand. The judge sided with state prosecutors who have insisted
that such claims are irrelevant when weighed against other,
substantial evidence of Williams' guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Whatley, one of Williams' lawyers, said he would ask the
judge to reconsider his decision. If the judge does not, Whatley
said he would appeal the ruling to the Georgia Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   If Craig had dismissed Williams' convictions, he would probably
have been tried again in Fulton County, where police used the
arrest and conviction of Williams, then 23, to close the case on
the child killings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was found guilty of killing two adults, Jimmy Ray Payne
and Nathaniel Carter, but investigators also linked him to 10 other
killings in the child murders investigation. Atlanta police would
blame him for 24 killings in all.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' lawyers have argued that the Ku Klux Klan was linked
to at least one death, and that statements by witnesses were kept
from the jury.
</P>
<P>
   But in court papers, state prosecutors argued that hundreds of
witnesses and items of evidence created an overwhelming case
against Williams, and that any information not known by the defense
would not have altered the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, in his ruling, noted that ``nothing has weakened the
testimony about the scratches down petitioner's arms, consistent
with defensive marks left by strangling victims.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that other evidence linked Williams to the two murdered
men, including fibers pulled from Williams' home and automobiles
that matched those found on the victims' bodies, ``the strongest
scientific link in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that inconsistencies in Williams' testimony, blood
evidence linking him to the crimes and other evidence had not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigators in the case said recently they did not believe
that Williams was guilty. DeKalb County Sheriff Sidney Dorsey and
Fulton County Police Chief Louis Graham, who were homicide
investigators in Atlanta at the time of the killings, told
``Dateline NBC'' that they believed Williams was innocent of the
crimes he was charged with, and those he was only suspected of. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bobbing and weaving between the Rangers and Mike Richter
more or less continued Friday, with Richter contemplating the
Rangers' latest contract offer, made last Wednesday, for a
three-year deal worth between $5 million and $5.4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the team nor Richter, who is an unrestricted free
agent, reported any significant progress in the negotiations.
Meanwhile, there was speculation in Vancouver on Friday suggesting
that the Canucks might make an offer to the free-agent goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, a Ranger for nine seasons, was offered a five-year
contract worth $27 million by New York before the free-agent
signing period began on July 1. Richter turned down the deal,
hoping he could attract more money and get a no-trade clause,
either from the Rangers or the Philadelphia Flyers. But the Flyers
opted to sign John Vanbiesbrouck earlier this week, thus limiting
Richter's options.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver has Mark Messier, Richter's old teammate, and Mike
Keenan, Richter's old coach. They could be a magnet to lure
Richter. &QL;

BRAVE HEARTS READY TO RUN WITH THE BULLS _ 1ST TIME IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Nev. _ Ron Beier recalls as the greatest adrenaline
rush of his life a fleeting moment a decade ago as he ran the
narrow streets of Pamplona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A huge, 1,500-pound red bull with sharp horns drew a bead on
Beier, a former Phoenix-area firefighter, and charged from 40 feet.
As Beier did a feint, the bull's horn swiped him across the thigh.
He said he was so pumped that he never felt the blood streaming
down his leg.
</P>
<P>
   So, Beier was one of the first to send in his $50 entry fee when
he heard that the running of the bulls was coming to this country
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 participants will gather today in this gambling mecca
on the Arizona border to test their meddle against a dozen rodeo
bulls from a Utah ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that summer temperatures here are straight out of
Death Valley. Or that Nevada transportation officials refused to
let it be run on Mesquite's casino row because of public safety
concerns. Or that no one really knows if these ranch bulls of
Brahman and Angus bloodlines have enough of a mean streak to make
the event entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   That's the fun of it all, says promoter Phil Immordino of
Phoenix, who timed the event to coincide with the famed running of
the bulls in Pampolona during the Fiesta of San Fermin. At least 13
people have been killed at that event, made famous in Ernest
Hemingway's novel ``The Sun Also Rises,'' over the past 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of rolling the dice here the first time
around,'' said Immordino, who also had pitched the idea of a bull
run to city officials in Phoenix and Long Beach, Calif., before
deciding that ``I had to go through too many hoops.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea was embraced by Mesquite Chamber of Commerce types,
eager to attract visitors during the caldron of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Immordino isn't leaving much to chance in the bull
run, which will be held on a quarter-mile stretch of dirt road on
the Oasis Resort Ranch on the Arizona side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Movie-set props have been brought in to make the 40-foot-wide
course look like a town. Six-foot high barriers line the parameters
of the run area, with exits every 100 yards for runners who feel
the bulls are too close for comfort. Rodeo clowns will act as
diversions for the bulls should the animals get too cantankerous.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday afternoon, he said about 500 people had signed
up. Immordino said he was considering two separate runs of 300
people each if there are another 100 or so late entries.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event earlier had predicted that up to 25,000
people would watch the running of the bulls but Immordino said,
``I'll be content if 5,000 people show up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided on a 10 a.m. start because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Mesquite's isolation and the warm temperatures also have acted
as a deterrent to animal-rights groups like People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, who had sought to boycott the event through
numerous postings on the Internet. One boycott organizer said
Friday that she had received fewer than only 10 responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people also picket dog shows. They are nuts,'' Immordino
said. ``They are afraid to find out the facts. It's people in peril
here, not animals.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is just fine with Beier, the veteran bull runner,
who also has run in similar events in Mexico. He said he plans to
use the traditional clothes of Pamplona in his Mesquite run _ white
pants, red shirt and sash and maroon beret.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always a little nervous because you don't know if the
bulls will move in a pack or individually or whether other runners
will knock you down,'' Beier said. ``But let's give it a whirl and
see what happens.'' &QL;

BRAVE HEARTS READY TO RUN WITH THE BULLS _ 1ST TIME IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Nev. _ Ron Beier recalls as the greatest adrenaline
rush of his life a fleeting moment a decade ago as he ran the
narrow streets of Pamplona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A huge, 1,500-pound red bull with sharp horns drew a bead on
Beier, a former Phoenix-area firefighter, and charged from 40 feet.
As Beier did a feint, the bull's horn swiped him across the thigh.
He said he was so pumped that he never felt the blood streaming
down his leg.
</P>
<P>
   So, Beier was one of the first to send in his $50 entry fee when
he heard that the running of the bulls was coming to this country
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 participants will gather today in this gambling mecca
on the Arizona border to test their meddle against a dozen rodeo
bulls from a Utah ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that summer temperatures here are straight out of
Death Valley. Or that Nevada transportation officials refused to
let it be run on Mesquite's casino row because of public safety
concerns. Or that no one really knows if these ranch bulls of
Brahman and Angus bloodlines have enough of a mean streak to make
the event entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   That's the fun of it all, says promoter Phil Immordino of
Phoenix, who timed the event to coincide with the famed running of
the bulls in Pampolona during the Fiesta of San Fermin. At least 13
people have been killed at that event, made famous in Ernest
Hemingway's novel ``The Sun Also Rises,'' over the past 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of rolling the dice here the first time
around,'' said Immordino, who also had pitched the idea of a bull
run to city officials in Phoenix and Long Beach, Calif., before
deciding that ``I had to go through too many hoops.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea was embraced by Mesquite Chamber of Commerce types,
eager to attract visitors during the caldron of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Immordino isn't leaving much to chance in the bull
run, which will be held on a quarter-mile stretch of dirt road on
the Oasis Resort Ranch on the Arizona side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Movie-set props have been brought in to make the 40-foot-wide
course look like a town. Six-foot high barriers line the parameters
of the run area, with exits every 100 yards for runners who feel
the bulls are too close for comfort. Rodeo clowns will act as
diversions for the bulls should the animals get too cantankerous.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday afternoon, he said about 500 people had signed
up. Immordino said he was considering two separate runs of 300
people each if there are another 100 or so late entries.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event earlier had predicted that up to 25,000
people would watch the running of the bulls but Immordino said,
``I'll be content if 5,000 people show up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided on a 10 a.m. start because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Mesquite's isolation and the warm temperatures also have acted
as a deterrent to animal-rights groups like People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, who had sought to boycott the event through
numerous postings on the Internet. One boycott organizer said
Friday that she had received fewer than only 10 responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people also picket dog shows. They are nuts,'' Immordino
said. ``They are afraid to find out the facts. It's people in peril
here, not animals.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is just fine with Beier, the veteran bull runner,
who also has run in similar events in Mexico. He said he plans to
use the traditional clothes of Pamplona in his Mesquite run _ white
pants, red shirt and sash and maroon beret.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always a little nervous because you don't know if the
bulls will move in a pack or individually or whether other runners
will knock you down,'' Beier said. ``But let's give it a whirl and
see what happens.'' &QL;

 &HT;    No lead's too big to Cox
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Opening the night with a season-high 13 1/2-game lead in
the NL East, Braves manager Bobby Cox has already gone to some
lengths to reach an understanding with the clubhouse over what such
a huge lead means. And what it means, at least in the manager's
office, is zilch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either go all out,'' said Cox, ``or you don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves haven't led the division by this much since the last
day of the 1995 season, when they finished 21 games ahead of New
York and Philadelphia. Before he got very far into the second half,
Cox used a team meeting to downplay the franchise's best start
ever. Cox might know better, too. When managing in Toronto, he led
the Blue Jays to an early 10-game lead in 1985 and wound up winning
the division by two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play every game like you're one ahead of
everybody,'' Cox said. ``I told them that last night. We mentioned
all that to them. We haven't won anything. A 30-game lead is
nothing. There won't be any half-ass playing. ...That's exactly
what I told them. You think you got a big lead? You got nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been in first place since April 20 and have
maintained at least a six-game cushion since June 1, but did not
take a double-digit lead until July 3. A three-game sweep of the
Mets pumped the advantage to 12 1/2 games at the All-Star break. Of
the six previous years Atlanta had ever led a division at the
midway point, the biggest bulge was just 6 1/2 games, that one
coming just last year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps such strong wording is surprising coming from Cox, given
his run of six division titles in seven years. but he also knows
that the club is carrying 15 players that weren't in the clubhouse
for the team's 1996 World Series. It was almost a warning for the
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason you don't give this thing intensity every
night,'' the manager said, ``absolutely no reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko on the mend
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko was greatly improved during batting practice Friday
and as long as he feels comfortable sprinting, the left fielder
could be back in the lineup tonight. He took some early sessions in
the cage and swung nothing like the tentative hacks he took
Thursday. ``If I can't run well, like if I can't run down a fly
ball, I'm not going to jeopardize the team just to get back out
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Step by step
</P>
<P>
   Now that John Smoltz has put together three 100-pitch games
without elbow trouble _ a first this season _ and was able to throw
his hardest yet in Thursday's 6-4 win, the right-hander has a new
goal: a string of 10 starts without complications. Thursdaymarked
his fourth start since coming off the DL (2-1, 3.33 ERA) and his
first since cortisone injections for his back July 2. After missing
the first two weeks of the season, Smoltz went just eight games
before going on the DL again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to pitch 10 games in a row and get on a roll that
way,'' he said. ``(Thursday) the ball was coming out easy. I
surprised myself. (Ten starts) is my goal. We're still on a plan to
be somewhat cautious and not go overboard with pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones was back in center field and Cox considers
Thursday's tardy return (along with rookie Randall Simon) to the
club to be old business. ``They made a mistake,'' said Cox. ``Not
going to hold it against them.'' ... Reserve outfielder Curtis
Pride has had the four remaining stitches removed from his left
index finger and is eligible to come off the DL Monday, which is an
off-day. ``Maybe we'll send him to one Triple-A game,'' said Cox.
``I don't know. Wouldn't hurt.''

 &HT;    On deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (12-2, 1.54; 7-1,
2.07 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. RHP Ryan Dempster (1-3, 6.43; 0-0,
3.00 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Maddux is churning out pitching lines almost by rote. He
has pitched complete games in five of his last seven starts, has
three shut-outs in his last six games and has given up 41 hits
while striking out 53 in his last 58 innings. Maddux hasn't been
beaten since falling 7-6 to Colorado on April 26. He is 10-0 in his
subsequent 13 starts. He leads the NL in ERA (1.54), winning
percentage (.857), shutouts (4), is tied with Tom Glavine for most
wins (12) and is second in complete games (6). The league is
hitting .209 against him. He is on pace to set career marks in
victories (he has won 20 games twice) and complete games (he has
posted 10 twice) and has already tied his career-high for shutouts.
He beat the Marlins 6-2 on June 17 and could have had a shutout in
that game too, but a Tony Graffanino error in the fourth led to a
pair of earned runs. Watch his at-bats against Edgar Renteria. The
Marlins shortstop has a career .385 average (5-for-13) against
Maddux. Dempster, another Marlins rookie making his eighth major
league start, faced the Braves on June 18 but drew no decision in
Florida's 3-2 victory. He has allowed just two earned runs in his
last two outings, beating Boston on June 28 for his first victory
and then lasting just 3 1/3 innings against Montreal on July 4.

CHASM BETWEEN RICH AND POOR GROWING IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought the Grand Canyon referred only to Arizona's most
famous natural wonder, you'd be wrong. There's also a wide _ and
growing _ chasm between the state's richest and poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   That's one highlight from a new study that gives the state
generally low grades overall for economic success and especially
poor marks on measures of affluency.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona received two C's and a D on the latest report card from
the Corporation for Enterprise Development in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That's down from two C's and a B last year.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing the study had to say about Arizona was that the
state's highway bridges are in better shape than those anywhere
else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most glaring weakness was in equity measures that reflect
the poverty rate and the income gap between rich and poor
households, which is already big and increasing,'' said Daphne
Clones, a senior policy analyst for the non-profit
economic-development group.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona earned the dubious distinction of having the nation's
largest increase in the gulf between rich and poor over a multiyear
study period. The Corporation for Enterprise Development also
ranked the state's poverty rate as fourth-worst and its urban-rural
income gap as fourth-widest.
</P>
<P>
   Those results come as no surprise to Christie Van Wormer, who
struggles to make ends meet by working two part-time jobs totaling
about 55 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know works two jobs,'' said the 32-year-old Phoenix
woman, who earns $6.60 an hour at her main job as a retail clerk,
with no benefits. She supplements that by working two or three
nights a week as a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   Van Wormer is struggling to stay out of debt and recently turned
to Consumer Credit Counseling Services Southwest for help. She
hopes eventually to return to school to improve her standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have an education or a specialized skill, then
waiting tables is the best you can do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Corporation for Enterprise Development found that two-thirds
of all states experienced a widening gap between haves and
have-nots, yet Arizona suffered the worst change in this regard.
The group compared income data from 1994-1996 against results from
1991-1993.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing also doesn't surprise Tom Rex, research manager
at the Center for Business Research at Arizona State University. He
said he believes the state's wider-than-normal income gap has been
masked by strong overall job growth during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much does (increasing employment) help the economy if you
import a person from another state to fill it, or if you're
creating jobs that pay $6 an hour?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Colorado and Washington led the nation with straight
A's. Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Utah were next with two
A's and one B.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia brought up the rear with straight F's. Arkansas,
Hawaii and Mississippi were only slightly better with two F's
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Among regional neighbors, Arizona fared worse than California,
Nevada and Utah but better than New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   All states received a grade from the Corporation for Enterprise
Development in each of the following three categories: economic
performance, business vitality and development capacity.
</P>
<P>
   After three years with a C grade for economic performance,
Arizona slipped to a D in the most recent evaluation. The widening
rich-poor gap and high poverty rate hurt the state, as did low
marks in various social measures such as infant mortality, crime,
teen pregnancy and infectious diseases. Among positive factors, the
study noted that Arizona's employment is high and the state posted
the 11th-best increase in average pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Personal) earnings have been average or below average in
Arizona, yet they're likely trending upward,'' Clones said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona maintained its C grade in business vitality, which
measures competitiveness, industrial diversity, new-business
formation and more. The study identified entrepreneurs as a
strength for the state, which logged the nation's third-highest
growth rate of new companies.
</P>
<P>
   For development capacity, Arizona dropped from a B grade to a C.
This wide category measures educational achievement, technology
resources and banking activity, and a variety of
infrastructure/amenity factors from bridges and mass transit to
housing costs. Bad marks for the state included poor results for
high school graduation, college attainment and
commercial/industrial lending.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the study revealed the state's technology sector as
vibrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona had solid ranks across all technology indicators,
including the 15th-highest rate of federal research-and-development
dollars,'' according to the Corporation for Enterprise Development.
</P>
<P>
   The group also gave each state a positive, negative or average
mark for tax and fiscal policies, reflecting tax fairness, fiscal
stability and other measures. Arizona earned the top score here on
the three-point scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Corporation for Enterprise Development is a private,
non-profit organization that works with state and local
governments, companies, foundations and others to improve economic
competitiveness and expand opportunities in various communities. &QL;

RUFFIANS ARE BEHAVING ENTERING THE DWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Coronado's Quest, the Triple Crown dropout whose
talent and pedigree were undermined by his violent manner, will run
as a presumably reformed rogue against four other 3-year-old colts
in the 81st Dwyer Stakes Sunday at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   His chief rival is expected to be Scatmandu, another horse with
a world-class pedigree and a history of bad behavior that includes
bumping and even biting other horses. He was also reported to have
calmed down this summer, so a well-mannered duel between two
talented colts is expected to be run at a mile and one-sixteenth
for a purse of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coronado's Quest had a frightful experience the first time he
ran in Florida,'' said Shug McGaughey, who trains the colt, ``and
it just carried on all winter. Maybe he's matured, or maybe just
his familiarity with Belmont helped. But this will be the first
time I've run him where everything between races has gone exactly
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest, a chestnut son of Forty Niner, won four of
five starts in New York before he went to Florida last winter and
began to throw riders.
</P>
<P>
   He ran second in the Hutcheson and second in the Fountain of
Youth, and both times balked and kicked, even when allowed to be
saddled away from the other horses.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ran fifth in the Florida Derby and first in the Wood
Memorial back in New York, but bowed out of the Kentucky Derby
because he seemed too uncontrollable. But McGaughey decided to
enter him in the Riva Ridge on June 6, the day of the Belmont
Stakes, and he won. Better yet, the trainer reported, ``Everything
has gone perfect from the Riva Ridge until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scatmandu was purchased last year for $1.2 million by Robert
Waxman and arrived with a bad disposition. He was fractious in the
starting gate, and he bumped other horses in the homestretch. He
even tried to bite them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never really frustrated with him,'' said Johm Kimmel,
his trainer, ``because I knew he had the talent, and it was just a
matter of giving him time. The sons of Storm Cat are very
high-energy horses. It's just been maturing, time and more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other horses were entered Friday in the Dwyer: Ian's
Thunder, trained by Todd Pletcher; Rock and Roll, trained by Bill
Mott with Jerry Bailey riding, and Undaunted Mettle, trained by
Gary Contessa. Coronado's Quest will carry high weight of 124
pounds with Scatmandu next at 122.
</P>
<P>
   ISELIN CHANGES LURE SKIP AWAY
</P>
<P>
   It is official: Monmouth Park changed the distance of the Iselin
Handicap on Aug. 30 from a mile and one-sixteenth to a mile and
one-eighth and raised the purse from $250,000 to $500,000, and now
here comes Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   The track on the Jersey Shore confirmed Friday that it had
tailored the race to the desires of Sonny Hine, who trains the
champion for his wife, Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away will enter the Iselin with a seven-race winning streak
and a bankroll of $8.9 million, about $1 million short of Cigar's
earnings record. Hine said he would be forced to miss the Whitney
at Saratoga on Aug. 8, but would put his superstar in the Woodward
and the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   CHIEF BEARHART TO RUN SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bearhart, the turf champion of last year, will be the
solid favorite to win Saturday's Bowling Green Handicap at Belmont
in a short field that includes Chorwon and Mystic Knight. They will
run one and three-eighths miles for a purse of $150,000. Chief
Bearhart has won 10 of his 19 starts.

BIG MOVIE STUDIO COMPLEX IS PLANNED IN LOWER MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to an intense demand for technologically
advanced studios in a city whose broadcast facilities were largely
designed in the radio age, a newly formed development company said
Friday that it would build a complex of five large sound stages on
the border of Greenwich Village and Soho, at Houston and West
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The project, coming at a time when film production has emerged
as one of the city's fastest-growing industries, is the first of
several studio proposals to attract necessary financing and city
approval.
</P>
<P>
   To be known as Hudson River Studios and scheduled for completion
by January 2000, the project also reflects the challenges of
finding large enough pieces of real estate in Manhattan that meet
the unusual demands of the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Budgeted at $120 million, the project is to be built on top of
the St. John's Center, a four-story, 60-year-old building
originally designed as a rail freight handling facility but now
used for data processing by Merrill Lynch and other large
companies.
</P>
<P>
   While leaving that structure intact, the studio's developers
said they had designed a rooftop addition that would be larger than
the original building, including some of the city's largest sound
stages equipped to transmit a new generation of high-definition
television. An important advantage of the rooftop setting, they
said, is that their entertainment industry tenants would be sealed
away from fans and curiosity seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is an important catalyst, but it by no means
provides the number of new stages we need,'' said Patricia Reed
Scott, the commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and
Broadcasting, which has seen a sharp rise in productions and money
spent by the television and movie industry in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the studios we have now are from another era,'' she
said. ``In a vertical city with some of the highest real estate
costs in the country, it is hard to find large enough spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Benowitz, president of Hudson Rivers Studios, said the
company had already signed 15-year leases for two of the five sound
stages with the producers of ``Guiding Light'' and ``As the World
Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Both shows have been produced in Manhattan for more than 40
years and sponsored since their inception by the Procter &AMP; Gamble
Co. of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Benowitz said he expected to reach final agreement within months
with a production company that would lease another of the sound
stages, but he would not say what type of production would be
involved. The two other stages in the complex, including its
largest, which would be suitable for large-scale movie productions,
have not yet been claimed, he said, and may be operated on
short-term agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think of this as a hotel with five huge rooms,'' he
said, reflecting a business strategy being advanced by others who
have proposed major new production facilities in the city. Unlike
most Hollywood studios, dedicated entirely to their own
productions, the New York City approach is to provide studios,
editing rooms, offices and even sets and costumes, with a variety
of producers coming and going on a pay-as-you-go basis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other film industry projects being planned or
discussed in the city are expansion of the Kaufman Astoria Studios,
which has operated for decades in Astoria, Queens; a television
production component to Donald Trump's huge Riverside South project
on the Upper West Side, and conversion of the city-owned Hudson
River piers at 54th Street to studios.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott said Friday that several production companies and
developers had approached the city about the 54th Street piers and
that details of a plan for that site might be announced within
months. Two Brooklyn entrepreneurs who have proposed a studio in
the Brooklyn Navy Yard have been promised a long-term lease by the
yard's city-controlled authority but must obtain $190 million in
private financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of wannabes out there, and so far we are the
only ones to put our ducks in a row,'' Benowitz said. Financing for
the whole Hudson River Studio project, which is to include an
unusual long-term lease on the air rights over the St. John's
Center, has been committed by United Labor Life Insurance Co., a
pension fund for construction trade unions across the nation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Guiliani said
the studio could be built without any change in zoning.

BERTELSMANN WANTS TO MOVE RANDOM HOUSE TO TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ German media giant Bertelsmann AG is negotiating to
move Random House to a new office tower in Times Square, which has
increasingly become a crossroads of media, entertainment and
finance.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal can be struck, Bertelsmann, which recently acquired
the publishing house, would move Random House and its Bantam
Doubleday Dell group into a new building on the east side of
Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets, according to real estate
executives who have been told of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   The potential building site is steeped in Times Square's
theatrical history, and it also sits across the street from
Bertelsmann's 44-story American headquarters. The plans currently
under discussion by Bertelsmann and the landowner, Charles Moss,
call for a tower of about 600,000 square feet to be built atop the
existing building, which houses the Roundabout Theater, a movie
theater and several stores, all of them facing eviction. Moss is
talking with several retailers that might replace the theater
company, which is close to signing a lease for the Selwyn Theater
on 42nd Street, and the other tenants.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executives, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Bertelsmann would either buy or lease the tower, while
Moss would continue to own and operate the retail space below,
which is festooned with a double row of billboards. Moss and
Bertelsmann are also negotiating over use of the billboards, which
are a source of millions of dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   With the rising demand for space in Times Square, Moss' building
has become valuable and is one of the last low-slung structures in
what is becoming a canyon of skyscrapers. ``If Random House, a
conservative, well-established publisher, is willing to go to Times
Square, there's no question it's the place to be,'' said Ira
Schuman, a real estate broker with Julien J. Studley Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives cautioned that a deal had not been
signed. ``We're at a critical juncture,'' said one person involved
in the negotiations who insisted on anonymity. ``I think it'll
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who lives in Aspen, Colo., and whose family has operated
vaudeville theaters, nickelodeons and movie palaces in Times Square
for three generations, did not return calls requesting comment, nor
did Bertelsmann chief operating officer Robert Sorrentino.
</P>
<P>
   Random House is now based at 825 Third Ave., near 50th Street,
but its lease expires in about two years.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of another tower in Times Square did not bring joy
to the Municipal Art Society, which has long been critical of the
proliferation of tall buildings. The society has opposed a proposal
being debated by the City Council to change the zoning in Times
Square in such a way to allow even taller towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light and air is being diminished as the low sites get
developed,'' said Philip K. Howard, chairman of the Municipal Art
Society. ``The broader issue here is the overall density permitted
not only in Times Square but in many neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, many New Yorkers regarded Times Square as
a place to be avoided. But now Disney, Madame Tussaud's and others
are crowding in. Douglas Durst, a developer, is completing a 1.6
million square foot tower on the east side of Broadway, between
42nd and 43rd Streets, that will house Conde Nast Publications and
the law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, on the west side of Seventh Avenue, between
42nd and 43rd Streets, demolition will begin soon for a 30-story
headquarters for the Reuters news agency. Mortimer Zuckerman's
Boston Properties recently bought two nearby sites where the
developer hopes to build two more office towers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, Moss' property, which comprises an acre
of land, has been home to Oscar Hammerstein's Olympia Theater
complex, Bond's clothing store, the International Casino and his
father's Criterion Theater. Last year, Moss, who bought the site 21
years ago for $4 million, notified his tenants that he was
terminating the leases. He has been debating what to do with the
property ever since.

NAVY AWARDS $9 MILLION NAPALM CONTRACT TO HOUSTON-AREA COMPANY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
(see optional trim, optional ending) 
 
By RUTH RENDON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston-area company Friday was awarded the contract
to recycle millions of gallons of Vietnam-era napalm, clearing the
way for the first shipment to arrive next week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to let the GNI Group Inc. recycle the firebombs
didn't surprise many people in Deer Park, an industrial city of
30,000 that is home to dozens of petrochemical plants about 10
miles east of downtown Houston. But some area residents expressed
worry and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders and U.S. Navy officials said, however, that most
people have reacted positively to the prospect of a local company
getting the $9 million contract. They said they believe much of the
opposition stems not from public-safety concerns, but from memories
of napalm's use in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   About 22,000 gallons of the jellied gasoline, the first of many
shipments, is to be brought next week to GNI's facility in Deer
Park's Industrial District, said Robin Yocum, a spokesman for the
Battelle Memorial Institute, the Navy's prime contractor for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Yocum said the shipment will be brought by rail from California
to a Pearland railyard, then travel about 22 miles by truck to the
recycling facility. The project is expected to take about two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Two other companies _ Chemical Waste Management, near Port
Arthur, and Waste Control Specialists, in the El Paso area _ also
contended for the contract and are still negotiating for the
position as a backup site to GNI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sad, dark day when our own United States government
can use the same weapons that were designed and produced to kill
people in a war now to incinerate them in our communities, which
will kill us when we breathe the toxic ash,'' said LaNell Anderson,
a real estate agent in nearby Channelview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do to stop this, is there?'' asked
Teresa Vickery of Deer Park.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery, who has a 3-year-old son, said she may put her house up
for sale because of the napalm contract.
</P>
<P>
   About 34,000 bombs, or 3.4 million gallons, of napalm have been
stockpiled at the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Support Facility near San
Diego. The Navy has unsuccessfully tried to dispose of the
substance for years, including earlier this year when a
12,000-gallon shipment headed to an Indiana contractor was turned
back because of public pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Public outcry has been scarce, however, in Deer Park. City
leaders said they have received about a dozen calls about the
napalm and only two were negative.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people, many from outside the city, attended a public
meeting Wednesday to hear about the project.
</P>
<P>
   The napalm will be carried from California to Texas by
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very apparent that Texas industries have done such a
good job of creating an area surrounding the Houston Ship Channel
that is so totally polluted that now the entire world believes that
the Houston region is the dumping ground for our nation,'' said
Anderson, 54.
</P>
<P>
   She said Channelview residents get the brunt of the toxic
emissions from Deer Park's chemical facilities because of
prevailing winds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The operation at Fallbrook entails removing the napalm from its
aluminum canisters and placing it in 6,000-gallon isotankers _
double-sided, stainless steel containers. The containers are
commonly used to transport flammable liquids and wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Napalm is 21 percent benzene, 33 percent gasoline and 46 percent
polystyrene. It has a honey-like consistency and is flammable, but
not explosive because the detonators have been removed from the
canisters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hazardous-waste experts say that, with the detonators removed,
napalm is more stable than gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.5 million pounds of canisters are to be shredded and
placed in 55-gallon drums.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Fallbrook facility is operating, about two isotankers
per day will be shipped to Deer Park, Yocum said.
</P>
<P>
   GNI is to be paid $8 million to recycle the napalm and $1
million for the aluminum, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that napalm is involved has drawn heavy attention to
this project, said Carl V. Rush Jr., president and chief executive
officer of GNI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are accustomed to handling materials of this nature,'' he
said. ``We do it safely and responsibly and that's how we will
handle this project.''
</P>
<P>
   GNI plans to process the napalm so that it can be recycled for
use as an alternative fuel, a company spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, who helped organize
Wednesday's meeting, said he will work closely with federal and
state regulatory agencies to make sure the napalm is transported
and disposed of safely.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Park City Manager Ron Crabtree said he, too, will monitor
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery, the Deer Park mother who expressed safety concerns,
said she attended Wednesday's meeting but has not been reassured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much to have to deal with. Ever since this has been
going on I've been having nightmares,'' said Vickery, 36, a senior
medical secretary at Texas Children's Hospital. ``I have separation
anxiety because I leave my child here and I go to work. Anytime
they have an explosion they close down (Texas) 225. (The napalm
project) is just another thing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Priscilla Baird said recycling the leftover napalm is
the most responsible and efficient action the Navy can take. She
said the Navy could not dispose of it by detonating the canisters
in an open range because ``they are not bombs. These are just
chemical products.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy began storing napalm canisters at Fallbrook in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 25 years of storage, the canisters are beginning to
degrade and leak, which could contaminate the environment,'' Navy
officials said in a prepared statement.

   GOP in Georgia Has Race On Its Mind
</P>
<P>
   State and national Republican leaders usually shy away from
taking sides in primary contests. But Speaker Newt Gingrich figures
the July 21 race in Georgia's 2nd Congressional District is a
different case. Ditto for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.; the former Republican national chairman, Haley Barbour;
the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell; the
Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1996, Jack Kemp, and other
party luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd District, covering Georgia's rural southwest corner, has
been represented in Washington for the past six years by a
Democrat, Sanford Bishop Jr. He is black, but in each of the past
three elections he readily demonstrated that he could win white
votes, most notably in the 1996 election after redistricting that
reduced the district's black population to about 40 percent from
nearly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans think Bishop is vulnerable this fall, given
the electoral momentum the party has gained in the South over the
past few years. But which Republican to send up against him?
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates are on the ballot: Joe McCormick, a 35-year-old
Albany businessman, and Dylan Glenn, 29, a former Capitol Hill and
Bush White House aide from Cusseta.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick is white. Glenn is black.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Republican Party has relatively few black
members in the country as a whole, with the shortage most acute in
the Deep South, Glenn faces a particularly tough first round. But
his supporters argue that he deserves to be nominated because if a
black Democrat can win the Georgia 2nd, so can a black Republican.
Moreover, Glenn supporters contend that if Republicans get behind
him, whether he wins or loses the party stands to gain needed
stature with black voters around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, Rusty Paul, has
urged party leaders to remain neutral in the primary, especially
national leaders. But taking a longer political view, Gingrich, who
hails from Georgia, and a dozen or more other major party figures
like Barbour and Kemp have nevertheless spoken out on Glenn's
behalf, with some attending rallies and holding fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a head coach, you need to make sure the best people get to
play,'' the speaker said at a Glenn fund-raiser in Atlanta on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Gingrich aide, Mike Shields, honed that point a bit finer. He
called Glenn ``a bright young star'' who would help the Republican
Party ``reach out to minorities and get our message out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Democrats Spur Their Candidate
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Democrats in Illinois are worried that Rep. Glenn
Poshard's campaign for governor is flagging, and they have begun
urging him to pick up the pace and sharpen his attack.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, State Rep. Carol Ronen of Chicago, a member of
the Democratic State Central Committee, sent Poshard a letter in
which she warned that many liberal voters in the Chicago area,
often the key to Democratic success in statewide races in Illinois,
``might fail to support your candidacy without some assurance that
you are interested in their votes and open to their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   She urged Poshard, a social moderate from rural southeastern
Illinois, to ``reassure voters that you are in the mainstream, not
on the fringe,'' by forcefully speaking out for family planning,
early childhood education and health care, ``reasonable'' gun
controls and strong anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, a number of the state's top Democratic
campaign consultants and union representatives, along with some
aides from various state legislative offices, sent Poshard a
similar message. They warned that if he did not move more
aggressively there was no chance he could overtake the Republican
nominee, Secretary of State George Ryan, and end 22 years of
Republican occupation of the Illinois executive mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a mainstream Republican, is much better financed than
Poshard, who refuses _ to the despair of some supporters _ to take
money from political action committees. Further, Ryan faced no
serious primary opposition, while Poshard struggled through a
divisive primary against tough black and staunchly liberal
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to his critics a few days ago, Poshard said he was
trying to ``build back bridges'' after the primary and had begun to
buy advertising time on television and radio. He also said he would
reconsider his opposition to building a third major airport south
of Chicago _ opposition that has disappointed many unemployed
blacks in that area, along with their congressman, Rep. Jesse
Jackson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Governor Gets Lesson in Unity
</P>
<P>
   When Louis Goldstein, Maryland's longtime state comptroller,
died last week, leaving one of the state's most politically
powerful posts open, Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat involved in
a tough re-election fight, thought he saw an opportunity to give
his campaign a boost. He talked former Rep. Michael Arnes, his
campaign chairman, into jumping into the contest to succeed
Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   The governor figured that with Barnes at his side on the
Democratic ticket, there would be a better chance, in both the
September primary and, hopefully, the general election, to carry
Montgomery County, Barnes' home turf and one of the most populous
and heavily Democratic parts of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   What the governor did not figure on was former Gov. William
Donald Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer, an irascible, irrepressible fellow Democrat, asked
Glendening to back him for the comptroller's job. When he was
turned down, Schaefer jumped into the contest on his own and
demonstrated in less than 24 hours that he had far more support and
enduring popularity in the party than Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   No, he told the governor at that point, he would not back out in
the interest of party unity. Worse, he hinted darkly at perhaps
supporting some other Democrat for governor.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Barnes dropped out, talking party unity. And no
sooner was he gone than Schaefer was talking unity, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then Glendening joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Schaefer at a news conference, laboring mightily
to make the best of the politically embarrassing bargain he had
been forced to strike, the governor declared: ``We're running
together.''

AGREEMENT ENDS PHILADELPHIA TRANSIT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A 40-day strike that shut down the network of
buses, trolleys and subways serving 435,000 passengers a day here
ended Friday when the transport workers union and the regional
transit authority announced that they had reached a tentative
agreement on a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made Friday evening by the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, and Local 234 of
the Transport Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Service is to be restored starting at 4 a.m. Saturday, and to
persuade people to return to the habit of using public
transportation, rides will be free through Tuesday, the transit
authority said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to say SEPTA is coming back to life again,'' said
Jack Leary, the general manager of the United States' fifth-largest
transit system, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by the local's 5,000 members was the fifth work
stoppage in 21 years by SEPTA workers who run and maintain buses.
It did not affect commuter trains serving the suburbs, though bus
lines in the suburbs were shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people happiest about the settlement are sure to be
those drivers who have endured six weeks of gridlock and rush hours
that extended two hours longer than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year contract expired on March 15, but both sides
continued negotiations for 11 weeks before the strike began on June
1. The main sticking points in negotiations included the hiring of
part-time workers, work-rule changes to allow the greater use of
part-time workers, changes in workers' compensation, and plans to
adopt a zero-tolerance policy for drug and alcohol use.
</P>
<P>
   During talks before the strike, management negotiators said they
needed fundamental changes in workplace rules to keep the system
operating at peak efficiency. They cited decreasing federal
transportation subsidies and declining ridership _ down 5 percent
since the last strike, 14 days in 1995 _ as major reasons to
rewrite rules that in some cases have been on the books for more
than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   At one point earlier Friday, the transit authority and the union
called a news conference to announce a tentative agreement, only to
call it off. They reversed themselves within two hours, and
announced the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point that delayed the announcement was the hiring
of part-time workers, a union official said, adding that
negotiators had dealt with the problem by agreeing to submit to
binding arbitration on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard and difficult battle, a lot of bitterness and
hard feelings,'' said Steve Brookens, the president of the union,
The Associated Press reported. ``But make no mistake about it. Our
members are the best. We deserved everything we got.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookens would not discuss details of the contract, which were
to be announced to members at a meeting Saturday morning before a
vote on the agreement by the rank and file on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 days of the strike saw dozens of mass demonstrations, a
pair of lawsuits, court injunctions and sporadic negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, after a SEPTA employee was shot with a pellet gun
outside union headquarters, the City Council president, John
Street, filed a lawsuit seeking to force the two sides into
marathon negotiations under a court-appointed supervisor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The strike has been the second-longest by the union against the
transit authority. In 1977, the union struck for 44 days over wages
and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was especially demoralizing because Philadelphia has
been marketing itself as a reborn urban center, rich with tourist
attractions, vibrant night life and world-class cultural sites. And
the city had become one of a half-dozen contenders for the
Republican National Convention in 2000. The city has not been the
host of a national political convention in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican site-selection committee did visit the city
on the opening day of the strike, the city remains in contention
for the convention. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Eddy and Ivette Alvarez went into business
together almost five years ago, they had skills: Mr. Alvarez knew
how to make plaster statues, and Mrs. Alvarez knew how to paint
them.
</P>
<P>
   They also had a product: a small copy of the Infant of Prague,
the statue of the baby Jesus that some believe works miracles.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not have money, at least not enough to buy plaster.
Even if they had had the know-how to borrow from a bank, they had
nothing to put up as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Today, and Mrs. Alvarez have a workshop of their own in East
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they and five employees turn out
thousands of plaster statues of everything from coiled cobras to
Indian chiefs, along with different religious figures. They can do
so, Mrs. Alvarez said, thanks to several small loans they have
received from an organization called Accion New York, based in
Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Accion makes tiny loans _ as little as $1,000 _ to impoverished
entrepreneurs, many of them in the Spanish-speaking enclave in
Williamsburg. By helping people to become self-employed, Accion
hopes to help not just individuals, but also a community.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of loan program is known as microcredit, and it has
helped combat poverty in developing countries like India and
Ecuador, according to the World Bank. While variations of the
concept have been tried, with limited success, in developed
countries, microcredit is now winning a growing number of converts
in the United States, especially in New York. Philanthropists who
have made their fortunes from Wall Street are particularly
attracted to the idea of giving ``a hand up, not a hand out'' to
budding entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the efforts they are supporting is the first significant
foray into the United States by Grameen Bank, which started the
microcredit movement two decades ago in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   But as Accion and other groups like it have found, it is not so
simple to adapt a program designed for Bangladeshi villages to the
very different cultural and economic situation in the United
States. Although there are as many as 300 microcredit programs in
America, only a few have made more than a handful of loans. Even
programs like Accion, the largest in New York City, are struggling
to get big enough to make a real difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to grow as fast as we want,'' said Robin
A.E. Ratcliffe, a vice president of Accion International, which
runs several programs in the United States based on its much larger
program in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, microcredit programs are simple. Borrowers take
out very small, very short-term loans; if they repay on time, they
become eligible for bigger loans. The loans, which might be as
small as $5 in Africa but in the United States tend to start at
$500 or $1,000, might help a villager buy chickens to start an egg
business, or a city dweller to buy vegetables to sell on a street
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Few people default. At Accion International, for example, the
default rate is just above 2 percent. Because almost all the money
gets repaid, it can be reused, making microcredit programs very
cost-effective, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is being promoted by the Clinton administration, and
more than a thousand people working in the field met late last
month in Manhattan at the second annual ``summit meeting'' on the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been embraced on Wall Street, which is becoming a
source of both expertise and financial backing. Terri Ludwig, the
president of Accion New York, is a former executive at Credit
Suisse First Boston, the big investment bank; her boss, Michael
Chu, who runs Accion International, is a former limited partner in
the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust Corp., which caters to companies and wealthy
individuals, has set up a fund that last month made its first loans
to microcredit lenders, including Accion New York. The $500,000 in
the fund came from the bank and some of its well-to-do customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the success stories are striking. When Carlos Aldana
came to the United States from Ibague, Colombia, 11 years ago, he
worked at three jobs, including delivering packages, he said
recently through a translator. His first $1,000 loan from Accion
helped him buy a van to make deliveries; later, larger loans helped
him buy a tiny cafe in Queens, and to expand the production of corn
cakes known as arepas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Aldana employs 11 workers in his arepa factory, where
with the help of some small machines they turn out 7,000 corn cakes
a day, he said. His latest $15,000 loan helped him buy equipment
that should let him double production of the arepas.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are generally not in the business of writing tiny loans,
because they are as expensive to process _ and far less profitable
_ than larger loans. And bankers can be reluctant to base their
lending on a borrower's character, rather than collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Accion charges 16 percent a year in interest, which is more than
an established business might pay, but less than many Americans pay
on their credit cards. In 1997, the New York program had 344 active
borrowers who took out $1.4 million in loans.
</P>
<P>
   But there are challenges to running a program in New York,
challenges that are not faced by lenders in rural villages. Getting
the word out about the program is difficult, Ms. Ludwig said. So
she is trying to work with churches and job-training programs that
might send borrowers her way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the borrowers she has are not all within walking
distance, as they might be in a developing country; she has
assigned one person to do most of the on-site inspections of
potential borrowers' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the founders of the microcredit movement worry that
Americans have already tampered too much with the original model.
That is one of the reasons Grameen has decided to manage some
programs here, said Alex Counts, director of the Grameen Foundation
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, some American programs _ though not Accion _ tend
to emphasize formal training over lending, Counts said. ``It's very
typical, and close to universal, to require 10 weeks of business
training before you can talk about getting a loan,'' he said.
``People who are running a business or are serious about starting
one don't have time for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Alvarez certainly does not. She and her husband used to
work until 3 in the morning making statues, she said; now that they
have hired employees, they have to work only until 10 at night.
</P>
<P>
   But she is not complaining. She and her husband are now starting
to save to buy a house, she said. ``And we started with zip.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BODY FINALLY HAS A HEAD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when the announcement of a new
commissioner of baseball was greeted with banner headlines, like
the naming of a pope or the election of a president. The naming of
the man who led the national pastime was a solemn affair tied to
the sanctity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   When baseball's owners announced Thursday that Bud Selig would
go from acting commissioner to commissioner, the news was almost
like that proverbial tree falling in the forest. Few heard; of
those who heard, few listened; and of those who listened, few
cared. The news was overtaken by Don King's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom about the lack of attention is that the
announcement was anticlimactic: Selig has been acting commissioner
for so long _ since 1992 _ that the elevation was a mere formality.
As Felipe Alou, the Montreal Expos' manager, said Friday. ``What is
he going to do new?''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Selig is going to move at least part time to New
York from Milwaukee and give baseball the commissioner's presence
it has lacked. Not an ideal situation, but it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   Selig was essentially thrust into the commissioner's role in
September 1992, two days after the club owners forced Fay Vincent
to walk the plank in the best interests of baseball. In the
intervening years, baseball effectively ran itself while Selig
played the hokey-pokey, with one foot in ownership and the other
foot in the ill-defined commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the Brewers, he stood by as his Milwaukee team was
switched to the National League; as acting commissioner, he guided
the owners into voting for divisional play and wild card berths for
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Upon assuming the duties in the commissioner's office in 1992,
Selig said, ``I hope it's relatively short term, but if you ask me
what short term is, I don't know.'' Two years later, Selig was
still there, but not there, saying: ``I have no permanent interest
in this job. I have many other things in life I want to do.'' Three
days later, he said he still wanted no part of the job on a
permanent basis: ``I have no permanent interest in this job.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, Selig protested: ``All I'll say is, I
haven't changed my mind since Sept. 9, 1992.'' But this week Selig
sounded resolute: he wanted this position. He predicted that
baseball was about ``to move into the greatest renaissance in the
history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, the Expos' 60-year-old manager, said he thought Selig's
elevation was good for a game that finally seemed to be going in
the right direction. Alou, who played major league baseball for 17
years, ended his career with the Brewers and played under Selig.
``He has a lot of knowledge about the inner workings of the game,''
Alou said. ``He knows more about the insides and outside of
baseball better than any commissioner who's been in the position.
That's why I say he has a great opportunity to really do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou was asked who the commissioner was when he broke into the
majors in 1958. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I can't remember. Ford
Frick?'' Yes, Frick, the front man the owners hired in 1951 to do
essentially what they have hired commissioners to do ever since:
represent the game and keep their noses out of its wheeling-dealing
aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Alou said that when he broke into baseball, the game was filled
with pressing issues, though none that the commissioner took on:
black and Latin ball players had to battle discrimination on and
off the field. Players in general, black, white and brown, were
treated as chattel on baseball's plantation.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more than a decade before Curt Flood challenged
owners' dominance with a lawsuit testing the standard contract's
reserve clause. By the time Alou retired as a player in 1974, Bowie
Kuhn was the commissioner. With the exception of A. Bartlett
Giamatti, who banned Pete Rose from baseball, the commissioner has
been a gofer for owners.
</P>
<P>
   So why have one? For all the criticism the game has taken since
Vincent's resignation, baseball probably has the right idea. The
owners, in their self-serving, strong-armed manner, navigated
baseball through a dreadful strike and devised an exciting playoff
system that gives even a bumbling team like the Mets a chance to
make post-season play. When you get right down to it, a
commissioner is essentially a high-priced overseer whose job is to
patrol the manor, make sure the workers are working, make certain
the appropriate portion of profits is flowing into the owner's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to hire someone to do your bidding, might as
well hire someone whose interests are your own.

NO BRAWLEY VERDICT AFTER 2ND DAY OF DELIBERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ The jurors in the Tawana Brawley defamation
case deliberated for a second full day without reaching a verdict,
but sent signals Friday that they were working hard to find answers
to the 11-year-old questions posed by the case.
</P>
<P>
   In three notes to the judge, S. Barrett Hickman of state Supreme
Court, the jurors asked questions that showed they were grappling
with some of the complex legal issues presented by the suit. The
plaintiff, Steven Pagones, a former assistant district attorney, is
seeking $400 million dollars in damages because he was accused of
rape in 1987 by three advisers to Ms. Brawley: the Rev. Al
Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. Pagones was
exonerated by a grand jury and filed the suit in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   One juror's note asked whether they must find for the defense if
an adviser's statement included sentences the jurors deem were not
defamatory but had one they deem was.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman answered that the legal requirement that the jurors find
a statement was defamatory by a preponderance of the evidence meant
the jurors should look at the language of each statement ``as a
whole in context'' and determine whether it was defamatory. The
decision, Hickman said, did not focus on how many sentences in each
statement were defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors also asked for a repeat of the legal definition of
preponderance of the evidence, the legal standard they must apply
to answer some of the more than 100 questions on a 37-page verdict
sheet. For Pagones to prevail on each of 22 separate statements by
the advisers that he asserts were defamatory, five or six questions
concerning each statement must be answered in the affirmative by
five of the six jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors could decide that none or all of the statements were
defamatory, or could find that some statements by some of the
advisers were defamatory and others were not.
</P>
<P>
   The third of the substantive questions the jurors asked Friday
showed an attention to detail that both sides in the case obviously
found impressive. Although the lawyers and the judge had spent days
preparing the verdict form, the jury foreman wrote the judge
suggesting that in the 92nd and 97th questions on the verdict sheet
the court had referred to Maddox when it meant Sharpton. The judge
made the correction.
</P>
<P>
   Although jurors have gone home each night and on weekends during
the seven months of the trial, they are scheduled to deliberate
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After the jurors were sequestered Thursday, court officials said
the jury would deliberate through the weekend. But at the request
of the defense Friday, Hickman ruled that if there is no verdict
Saturday, deliberations will not take place on Sunday because of
religious observances, though the jury will remain sequestered. &QL;

BACKBONE TRAIL IS A CONSTANT

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Backcountry paths in the Sierra Nevada remain
choked with snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges are out along popular treks across the state, and
tumultuous runoff from El Nino's relentless winter has created
dangerous fords across waters that are normally subdued by this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a destination hike in 1998 is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend more time planning _ and waiting _ or you can get
back to the Backbone.
</P>
<P>
   I recently revisited my favorite regional hiking area and found
a 6}-mile section from Corral Canyon Road to Kanan-Dume Road that
eased the frustration of having to delay some High Sierra
backpacking plans until late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively flat hike (400 of the 500 feet in elevation loss
come in the final mile) is a study in extreme geography _ from
open, arid chaparral that screams for sunscreen to shady,
fern-lined canyons with year-round water.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the west edge of the dirt parking lot at the top
of Corral Canyon Road (elevation: 2,025 feet), the Backbone Trail,
or BBT, drops past an old power line service road (1,900 feet)
six-tenths of a mile in on its descent to Upper Solstice Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   (Be careful not to mistakenly tread the steep fire road leaving
the Corral Canyon Road staging area, as I did, or you'll wind up
headed along Castro Motorway toward 2,824-foot Castro Peak instead.
However, this option does shave about a half-mile off the total
hiking distance. Take Newton Motorway to return to the Backbone
Trail, which promptly was dubbed the Bonehead Trail when my error
was realized.)
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Hiking Trails of the Santa Monica Mountains,''
Canoga Park mountain man Milt McAuley notes that a 20-foot
waterfall can be spotted after heavy rains upstream from a creek
that the BBT crosses shortly after passing the service road.
</P>
<P>
   The track continues downstream to a watery junction (1,750 feet)
with what at this point is Solstice Creek. Turn right and it's
uphill from here, passing through coastal live oaks along Solstice
Creek and, in two-thirds of a mile, according to McAuley's
jottings, to a series of switchbacks at the west end of the wide
basin.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club trail-crew leader Ron Webster of Culver City finds a
unique quality to the Upper Solstice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different in that it has a usually permanent-running
creek. Then you are down in a riparian forest, primarily oak and
some sycamore _ big trees,'' said Webster, who designed and
directed the building of much of the BBT described herein. ``You
don't often have that in the rest of the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   The canyon is exited at Newton Motorway (2,275 feet) upon
reaching the 2.8-mile mark.
</P>
<P>
   The sun will continue to beat on your neck as the trail moves
along in a westerly direction for another mile until reaching a
cool canyon covered by a canopy of oak, lined with ferns and
aerated by the southern headwater of Newton Creek (1,925 feet).
Soak in the dampness; the smell of such moisture is a rare pleasure
in the vast desert that is Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, other oaks grow on precipitous hillsides. ``It reminds
me of Asian paintings,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   More brushy cover awaits as the course climbs about a half-mile
past thickets of mustard to Latigo Canyon Road (2,025 feet), 4.2
miles from the trip's start. Here hikers catch northwesterly views
of Boney Mountain and 3,111-foot Sandstone Peak _ the zenith of the
Santa Monica Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The longest and most diverse section _ slightly more than 2{
miles to Kanan-Dume Road _ lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Lazy zigzags lead hikers downhill beyond tall grass and brush to
a low point and then up toward a ridge, where a stellar vantage
affords panoramas of the Pacific Ocean and the hills and dales that
bow to its shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pop up on that ridge and see these very beautiful
views down Ramirez Canyon,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   En route, massive fields of black sage anchor the landscape; the
trail contours along the ridge's northern exposure, which is
largely shaded and at points covered with another layering of
ferns.
</P>
<P>
   Oak trees and Indian paint brush dot the ridgetop (maps indicate
a benchmark of 1,919 feet).
</P>
<P>
   After a generous respite, hoof downhill past a paved road and
try if you can to ignore the din of traffic that motors underfoot
through a tunnel on Kanan-Dume Road.
</P>
<P>
   After crossing the roadway via the perch over its tunnel, turn
right down the rutted path to the paved Backbone Trailhead parking
lot (1,525 feet) to end your adventure.

<P>
   About this time every year, investment banker Herb Allen holds
his big media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. Some 100 Bigs
arrived last Monday for a few days of horseback riding, whitewater
rafting and schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Warren Buffett brokered the sale of ABC television
network and the rest of Capital Cities to The Mouse (as Walt Disney
Co. is known in the trade) during a stroll in the parking lot?
Nicely timed, it coincide with this year's &UR;  &LR;  Allen conference was
the news that editor Tina Brown soon would be departing the New
Yorker for Disney's world.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Brown is joining the huge entertainment
conglomerate to develop a magazine, tv shows and films for its
Miramax unit. She is leaving after six years in the top job at
America's e most successful general interest magazine _ editorially
successful, at least. Under Brown, the New Yorker continued to lose
money.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is only the latest editor to move nearer the apex of the
fast-integrating news-entertainment complex. Michael Kinsley _ for
years the editor of the New Republic _ two years ago created Slate,
a digital magazine for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Norman Pearlstine, who during the 1980s had been
magaging editor of The Wall Street Journal, was hired by
Time-Warner to oversee its magazine group and explore its synergies
with the Cable News Network, Warner Brothers films and the
Internet. (The ultimate responsibility for the Time/CNN ``nerve
gas'' fiasco was his.)
</P>
<P>
   The famous firewalls between the business and ``content'' sides
(formerly the news sides) of these enterprises remain, at least to
the extent that these mega-editors don't attend the Sun Valley
conference. Instead, it is the money folk who get the invitations _
Bill Gates, Katharine Graham, Warren Buffett, Rubert Murdoch,
Sumner Redstone, Michael Eisner, Edgar Bronfman, David Geffen,
Barry Diller, Michael Bloomberg and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether these media magnates seem to wield an awful lot of
power. Are they about to assume control of all that we see, read,
and think?
</P>
<P>
   Recently I have been reading Tyler Cowen's book, ``In Praise of
Commercial Culture,'' and I am somewhat buoyed by it. A specialist
in the economics of fame and the arts, Cowen is professor at George
Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that market forces stimulate the production of
culture, high and low, and that far from homogenizing taste, they
tend to produce art that is more specialized and diverse than it
would be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In three especially lively chapters, Cowen traces the markets
for the written word (where the printing press has been around for
centuries,) music (where recording technology only relatively
recently became available) and painting (where reproductive
technology counts for much less.) It is the history of music, with
its multiple and changing means of delivery, that I found the most
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   In ``From Bach to the Beatles,'' Cowen tells the story of the
development of two quite distinct musical traditions: the rise of
Western music, and the musical revolution &UR;  &LR; from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of classical music are relatively well-understood.
For a long time after the Renaissance, composers depended on rich
patrons for work _ one Weimar prince actually threw Bach in jail
when he tried to move to a better job. Private commissions
permitted composers like Mozart and Haydn a greater degree of
freedom. And sheet music publishing made Beethoven into the first
genuinely autonomous star (``...People no longer bargain with me; I
ask and they pay.'')
</P>
<P>
   During the 19th and early 20th centuries, popular music
flourished, while classical music (like many others things) became
professionalized. Brahms wrote compositions too complicated to be
performed at home; the German government supported Wagner's opulent
visions; Stravinsky and Schoenberg relied on foundation support.
The advent of recording and the rise of radio broadened the market
and yielded more diverse _ and more obscure _ compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, African music that had been imported to the New World
had begun to make its influence felt. ``Slavery was a disaster for
its victims, but it revolutionized world music,'' Cowen writes, and
most contemporary poular musical forms _ blues, rhythym and blues,
rock and roll, soul, jazz, swing, bebop, bookie, ragtime, calypso,
samba, forro, son, ska, reggae, salsa, merengue, plena and rap _
flow out of it. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Like their classical counterparts in earlier centuries, the men
and women who made blues and jazz ``needed to establish markets,
overcome resistance to new musical sounds and develop innovative
means of distributing their creations,'' Cowen writes.
</P>
<P>
   No incident in Cowen's account is more telling than the the
story of the ``payola'' scandals of the 1950s, when producers
resorted to bribery to purchase airtime for their artists. ``The
Yellow Rose of Texas,'' ``Love is A Many-Splendored Thing'' and a
piano rendition of ``Autumn Leaves'' were the big hits when the
scandal started. &UR;  &LR;  Chuck Berry's ``Maybellene''  &UR;  &LR; gives disc jockey
Alan Freed partial song-writing credit to this very day _ a sly
inducement to play the song. Such is the power of money to benefit
novelty _ and the story of the rise of rap music from the Bronx
party culture of the 1970s is not much different, Cowen says.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the art markets that emerges from ``In Praise of
Commercial Culture'' is a reassuring one. Art markets consist of
artists, consumers and middlemen, or distributors, Cowen says. The
artists work for fame, self-fullfillment and riches. Consumers seek
``to live out our days in the the perpetual undertide of ecstasy''
that is the purpose of all culture (in John Cowper Powys' memorable
phrase.)
</P>
<P>
   Distributors, like the Media Chieftains who gathered last week
in Sun Valley, exist to bring artists together with audiences. But
rich as they are, these middlemen are powerless to invent the new
forms and novel interpretations of old ones that are artists'
enternal quest.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it is the consumers of art and their agents, the
critics, who are the ultimate givers of fame. That is the point of
the African musical revolution _ consumers know a life-enhancing
development when they hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is less than possible than ever before to create the
monopoly on commercial culture that is the objective of
totalitarian states. Within wide bands of fad and fashion, people
are going to decide for themselves what they like.

RUELAS WORKING TOWARD ANOTHER TITLE SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a fight that produced conflicting fallout
for Gabriel Ruelas: frustration and liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas and Arturo Gatti engaged in one of the most thrilling
bouts of 1997, a bout Gatti won by fifth-round knockout to retain
his IBF junior lightweight championship in October in Atlantic
City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost Gatti who fell. Ruelas had the champion badly hurt
in the fourth round before Gatti landed the crushing left hook that
put the challenger, perhaps too bold in his attack, down and out.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas (44-4, 23 knockouts) was that close to his second world
title and the money that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other loss stands out like the Gatti loss to me,'' said
Ruelas, who faces Troy Dorsey today in San Antonio, his first bout
since fighting Gatti. ``It's probably because I felt I was so close
to victory and not able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll stay with me for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   So will what he accomplished in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas, 27, was still experiencing the traumatic effects of the
1995 bout in which he delivered the blows that killed Jimmy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas said he had come to terms with the tragedy long ago and
was ready to resume his career in earnest. However, observers who
had seen so many fighters in Ruelas' position fall apart had their
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   So many believed he'd never be the same. He admitted he wondered
whether he could possibly be right and everyone else wrong _ until
the Gatti fight, in which he threw punches with abandon against one
of the toughest fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He convinced himself _ if not most of those who saw the fight _
that he was back, that he was again the fighter who thrashed
then-unbeaten Jesse James Leija to win the WBC super featherweight
title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that fight had the biggest effect on people around
me,'' he said. ``I don't think people are as concerned about it as
they were. And I'm not either. It made me really believe that if I
train real hard, I could be a world champion again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big turning point, not only in boxing but in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey, the former IBF featherweight champion, is rugged but
limited and a notorious bleeder. He's a 6-1 underdog in today's
bout, one of three featuring former champ vs. former champ.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he wins, Ruelas could get another shot at a
championship. He plans to move up to the 135-pound lightweight
class after this fight.
</P>
<P>
   His promoter, Dan Goossen, threw out such weighty names as
Naseem Hamed, Angel Manfredy, Shane Mosley and, yes, Gatti, as
possible future opponents but none are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it seems there's plenty of life in his up-and-down
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you this: If Gabriel wins on Saturday, watch
out,'' Goossen said. ``He'll be at his peak, the prime of career.
He's been through so much adversity. If he's successful Saturday,
there'll be no other situation in his career that he won't be able
to overcome.''

 &HT;    Marlin rookie ends Braves' streak at nine
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Jesus Sanchez is 23, just 5 feet 9 and is listed at 153
pounds. Friday night, he beat up the Braves with one left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's nine-game winning streak met an unlikely end, the
rookie Sanchez shutting down the hottest team in the National
League 3-1 in a game that had Denny Neagle seeking the heavens for
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended the Braves' longest winning streak in three
years. The last Atlanta loss came exactly two weeks before, 6-4 to
Toronto on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle (9-7) held the last-place Marlins scoreless for almost
seven innings while the Braves advanced four men into scoring
position and brought in none of them. Then in the seventh, Neagle
retired the first two men he faced before suddenly finding himself
trailing 1-0. Cliff Floyd singled, stole second on a high throw by
catcher Javy Lopez and then came around on a single by rookie Dave
Berg, who had been hitting .450 with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The run ended a three-game mastery Neagle held over the Marlins,
who had not scored against him in 22 previous 22 innings dating
back to an Aug. 2, 1997, start here.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bullpen gave up two runs in the eighth, one on Mark
Kotsay's RBI single off John Rocker, the second on a Rocker wild
pitch that allowed Edgar Renteria to score from third.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez (4-6) allowed five hits and one walk while striking out
five over eight innings. In his previous appearance against the
Braves, Sanchez threw five shutout innings before giving up four
runs in the sixth. No so this time. In just his 15th start, he ate
up the Braves' Nos. 3,4 and 5 hitters the first three times through
the order (0-for-8) while striking out Chipper Jones twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves allowed three excellent early scoring changes to get
away, stranding three men at third base in the first five innings.
In the first, Gerald Williams turned a flare down the right field
line into a double but died at third on Lopez's inning-ending
ground-out. Neagle then opened the third inning with a single,
moved to second on Walt Weiss's sacrifice but was also stranded at
third on Williams' ground-out and Chipper Jones' strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Tony Graffanino, struggling in a 2-for-25 slump,
singled, was sacrificed to second by Neagle, went to third on a
wild pitch and watched Weiss end the inning on a fly-out. Through
the first five innings, the Braves were 0-for-5 with runners in
scoring position.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Mexico and Venezuela have never been the best of
friends, especially when it comes to their chief export and revenue
generator, oil.
 &HT;    That's especially true now, as they're both chasing deals with
U.S. refineries to process their oil and get it to market.
 &HT;    Venezuela and Mexico have bumped up their oil production in
recent years. But they both produce a lot of heavy, high-sulfur
crude, and neither has the capacity to process it nor the
investment to build new refineries.
 &HT;    By buying into or signing joint-venture deals with existing U.S.
refineries, not only do they find a way to refine their crude, they
instantly gain access to U.S. markets.
 &HT;    ``Securing an outlet for these kinds of crude facilitates the
marketing,'' says Rafael Quijano, managing partner of Latin
American Petroleum Intelligence Services, a U.S.-based consulting
firm.
 &HT;    U.S. energy companies also win. Plagued by overcapacity and
lower oil prices, the oil-refining sector hasn't exactly been
brimming with profits lately. So by striking deals with their
southern neighbors, not only do these companies snare long-term
supply contracts, they bring in new investment to improve their
plants.
 &HT;    ``Margins have been very slim. And the capital that it takes to
process some of these barrels is so enormous that it exceeds the
ability of most companies to finance it,'' says Ray Ory, president
of Vector Associates, a U.S.-based consulting firm. ``So these
deals are viewed as a necessary evil.''
 &HT;    Mexico's state-owned oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex),
inked one of the first such agreements in March 1993, when it
hooked up with Dutch-British giant Shell Oil Co. to jointly own its
Deer Park refinery near the Houston Ship Channel. As part of the
deal, Pemex provided 150,000 barrels per day of heavy Mexican crude
in exchange for 45,000 barrels per day of unleaded gasoline.
 &HT;    In 1995, the plant completed a US$1 billion improvement program,
including a new coker. Initially, most of the gasoline was shipped
back to Mexico; it's now being sold in the United States.
 &HT;    Shell wouldn't comment on future such deals, but is open to the
possibility.
 &HT;    ``Our 50/50 joint venture in the Deer Park refinery [is] a
win-win for both Shell and Pemex,'' Shell spokesperson Sarah Payne
says.
 &HT;    Pemex clearly wants to do more. It is in talks with U.S.-based
Mobil about a joint project at its 320,000-barrel-per-day Beaumont,
Texas, refinery, which already processes some crude from Mexico.
 &HT;    Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela
(PDVSA), has been particularly aggressive. Over the last several
years, it has purchased nearly 1 million barrels a day of U.S.
refining capacity. ``We cannot do it on our own,'' says Nelson
Olmedillo, a senior adviser at PDVSA Services in Houston. ``We need
the capital investment, technology and the markets.''
 &HT;    Its deal-making has picked up lately. Last November, PDVSA
finalized a joint venture with Mobil in which it will own 50% of
its 100,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana. The
two plan to extract and process extra heavy crude oil from the
Cerro Negro area of the Orinoco belt and market it in the United
States. Total investment: $2.5 billion, $800 million of which will
be spent to upgrade the refinery.
 &HT;    Then, in February, PDVSA announced it would acquire half of a
500,000-barrel-a-day refinery in St. Croix, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, owned by New York-based Amerada Hess Corp. for $625
million. The deal calls for PDVSA to supply about 270,000 barrels a
day of heavy Venezuelan crude for processing into gasoline.
 &HT;    At press time, PDVSA was also in discussions with U.S.-based
Phillips Petroleum about a joint venture to build and own a
58,000-barrel-a-day coker at its refinery in Sweeny, Texas. Under
the agreement, the two would own the coker 50/50 and PDVSA would
supply up to 165,000 barrels of heavy crude per day to be processed
at the refinery.
 &HT;    Other deals are expected. The only thing that could halt the
deal-making is the Latin American oil giants taking too big a bite
of the U.S. refining industry. ``If Venezuela were to own a certain
percentage of the industry, it could trigger some debate as to how
big is big,'' Vector's Ory says. ``But right now, they need each
other.''

RELATIVES TESTIFY FOR ILLEGAL CHINESE IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ It was around 11 a.m. Friday when 21-year-old
Cheng Xing Da finally felt a little less lonely in an unfamiliar
land.
</P>
<P>
   Like 22 other Chinese men who illegally landed on a New Jersey
beach two months ago and have since been detained by federal
authorities, Cheng had seen few familiar faces other than
business-minded judges, lawyers, translators and reporters. But on
Friday, when he made another appearance at an immigration court
here to request his release on bond, he noticed a gaunt, balding
man with a toothless smile and an oversize suit _ a man he said was
his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng did not say anything at first; he just smiled, nodded and
shook his uncle's hands vigorously, repeatedly. After the uncle
promised Judge Mirlande Tadal that he would take care of Cheng, he
whispered to Cheng in the Fuzhou dialect, ``I'll try to get you
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a day of muted family reunions, as relatives of nine
of the 23 detainees offered testimony to support the men's release
on bond, giving a human dimension to a tale that had so far been
the province of legal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were 19 bond hearings Friday before Tadal and
Judge Esmeralda Cabrera in the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's case to deport the men to China. And for the families, at
least, the results seemed promising: Bond was set for most of the
men, including Cheng, at $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the reunions can actually resume outside federal
custody remains to be seen. The U.S. attorney's office in New
Jersey has issued warrants to arrest any, or all, of the 23, as
witnesses in a continuing criminal investigation into human
smuggling _ meaning that if the men make bail, they face the
prospect of being transferred immediately to another jail. This
happened on Thursday, for instance, to Jiang Dian Lu, 22, who was
taken to Passaic County Jail after his relatives posted a $5,000
bond.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the detainees, Chen Chen, appeared Friday in
a U.S. District Court in Newark, where bond was set at $20,000,
said Robert Porges, the lawyer for 21 of the 23 Chinese men. Porges
said he did not know why Chen was separated from the group several
weeks ago and transferred to Mercer County Jail before appearing in
Newark Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time, the federal investigation into Chinese
smuggling seems to be gaining momentum. Faith Hochberg, the U.S.
attorney in New Jersey, announced Friday that a federal grand jury
in Newark had indicted six Koreans for conspiring to smuggle the 23
Chinese men whose boat ran aground near Bay Head, N.J., on May 30.
The six are alleged to have been participants in an international
smuggling operation that transported the 23, and other Chinese,
from Fujian province in China via South America to the United
States. Five of the six are in custody.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Elizabeth, where the detention center is wedged
between industrial buildings and trucking-related businesses, the
flurry of official proceedings Friday seemed secondary to the
personal transactions occurring inside the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unusual to have relatives testify at bond hearings; it's
the first time that's ever happened,'' Porges said. ``But this is
what the judge wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the relatives arrived two hours early for the 9 a.m.
bond hearings, passing the time by reading Chinese-language
newspapers and smoking cigarettes, with some squatting on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Most said they lived in New York City. And most did not want to
be interviewed by reporters. But one woman, who declined to give
her name, said her brother was one of the detainees. ``I haven't
seen him for many years,'' she said. ``He didn't tell me why he
left, but I know that our family is poor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, the atmosphere veered from tense to
lighthearted. The first detainee, Ni Zhou Yong, smiled and said,
``Hey'' as his cousin entered the witness box. But the cousin
offered seemingly contradictory testimony, signing an affidavit
listing a Manhattan address, but acknowledging in court that he had
had a driver's license in Florida since 1995 and that he owned a
restaurant in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the other relatives, Ni's cousin said he knew of the
smuggling plans. In fact, the cousin said he had paid the smugglers
on behalf of Ni: ``Yes, of course, I helped him. That's why he
doesn't owe the other people money.''
</P>
<P>
   Tadal set bond for Ni at $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Tadal seemed surprised that Lu Yi Qiang's
aunt, a Brooklyn resident, would send not herself, not her husband,
not her oldest child, but the baby of the family to testify: a
19-year-old man in shorts and a black T-shirt. So the judge
postponed the bond hearing until Monday, and beseeched Porges to
secure additional affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   There was also some confusion over who would support Chen Shen
Kui, 19. Was it a cousin? An uncle? The documents were not clear,
and no relatives were present. So Cabrera postponed Chen's hearing
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find him and bring him in,'' Cabrera said, ``so we can satisfy
who it is that's out there, waiting to receive him.''

EDITORIAL: A SETTLEMENT ON IMPLANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Saturday, July 11:
</P>
<P>
   The tentative $3.2 billion settlement agreement between Dow
Corning Corp. and lawyers for thousands of women who claim they
have been made ill by silicone breast implants seems a prudent
financial move for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement would allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy and plaintiffs would get compensated for suffering and
for the costs of getting the implants surgically removed. A legal
settlement does not resolve scientific questions about the safety
of the implants. But those questions could not have been fully
answered in a court of law, even if the cases had gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
   How juries would have weighed evidence about the cause or extent
of the injuries is anyone's guess. Localized pain, disfigurement
and complications from ruptured implants have been documented. But
whether the implants cause autoimmune diseases is greatly disputed
by the company, a stance supported by several studies showing no
link between silicone and systemic illness. Yet even those studies
deal with probabilities and do not rule out all risk of harm.
Neither side evidently wanted to go through with the gamble of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Three other manufacturers made the same calculation and settled
in 1995, paying out an average of $26,000 per woman. Dow Corning,
once the leading manufacturer of silicone implants, faces the
greatest financial exposure. It filed for bankruptcy protection in
1995 against the 19,000 damage suits that had been filed against
the company. The proposed accord will still need to be approved by
two-thirds of some 170,000 claimants, the company's other creditors
and the bankruptcy judge.
</P>
<P>
   The legal system, which is not meant to advance scientific
inquiry, functioned in this case as it typically does. It forced
both sides to decide what outcome they could live with and left the
search for truth as measured by a scientific standard to other
arenas.

POLICE SAY MISSING WOMAN AND CON MAN ARGUED

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly before Irene Silverman, an Upper East Side
socialite, vanished Sunday morning, she was seen in an angry
confrontation with a convicted con artist who had rented an
apartment in her mansion on East 65th Street, an investigator said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A witness told police that Mrs. Silverman exchanged shouts with
the convict, Kenneth Kimes, 23, outside the first-floor office of
her mansion about 10:30 a.m., the investigator said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. When Mrs. Silverman tried to take the
elevator to her living quarters, Kimes stopped her in the hallway
and led her into his apartment, the investigator added.
</P>
<P>
   When the argument began, Mrs. Silverman ordered her maid to walk
the dog in her roof garden, the investigator said. Kimes later
phoned the maid and asked her to come to his $6,000-a-month suite
and clean it, the investigator said the witness had reported. The
maid refused, and Kimes later called and ordered her to ``Get out
of the house with the dog,'' the investigator said, quoting the
witness' statement.
</P>
<P>
   The witness' statement came as teams of police officers searched
the Garden State Parkway for signs of Mrs. Silverman and
investigators from three states and the Bahamas examined a sheaf of
financial records and other items found in Kimes' car.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes and his mother, Sante, 63, were carrying Mrs. Silverman's
identification when they were arrested Sunday night on an unrelated
charge of writing a bad check, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses, who investigators say took a notary public to Mrs.
Silverman's office last Wednesday and asked her to sign a power of
attorney form, are also considered suspects in the Los Angeles
slaying of their former business partner, David Kazdin, Los Angeles
police say.
</P>
<P>
   Kazdin was found in a Los Angeles garbage bin March 14, fatally
shot in the head, shortly after the Kimeses obtained a fraudulent
$280,000 loan on property he had owned, according to Los Angeles
police and financial records.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in the Bahamas want to question the Kimeses
about the 1996 disappearance of a Middle Eastern banker who had
befriended Sante Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Friday, detectives assembled a list of the names
of business associates to determine whether any had vanished or
been bilked of their assets. Investigators, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the documents found in the car contained names
of more than 10 business associates, but there was no evidence that
any were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives were also seeking a search warrant Friday to examine
the Kimeses' laptop computer, which was found in the trunk of the
car along with the financial documents, a 9-millimeter Glock
handgun, nearly $30,000 in cash, a box of .22-caliber ammunition
and at least 10 wigs, in several styles and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Kimeses at a news conference Friday, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said, ``They are apparently a very
violent couple.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said investigators believe that the Kimeses were on the
Garden State Parkway between 1 and 6:30 p.m. Sunday. New Jersey
troopers searched rest stops and service areas along the roadway
Friday, said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the New Jersey State
Police.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ MEXICO Y VENEZUELA NUNCA han sido muy buenos amigos,
sobre todo en lo tocante al petroleo. Esa situacion es mas visible,
cuando ambos paises buscan acuerdos con refinerias de EU para
procesar su petroleo y llevarlo al mercado.
 &HT;    Venezuela y Mexico han aumentado la produccion en los ultimos
anos. Pero ambos producen una gran cantidad de crudo pesado y de
alto contenido de azufre, y ninguno tiene la capacidad de
procesarlo ni las inversiones necesarias para construir refinerias.
Al comprar o firmar acuerdos de empresa conjunta con refinerias
norteamericanas, no solo hallan una manera de refinar su crudo,
tambien logran un acceso instantaneo al mercado de EU. ``Asegurar
una via de salida para este tipo de crudo facilita el mercadeo'',
dice Rafael Quijano, socio gerente de Latin American Petroleum
Intelligence Services, firma consultora de EU. Las empresas de
energia de EU tambien ganan. Plagadas por un exceso de capacidad y
los bajos precios del petroleo, los refinadores no han generado
muchas ganancias ultimamente. De modo que al firmar convenios con
sus vecinos del sur, estas companias no solo consiguen contratos de
suministro a largo plazo, sino tambien nuevas inversiones para
mejorar sus plantas.
 &HT;    ``Los margenes han sido muy escasos. Y el capital necesario para
el procesamiento supera la capacidad de financiamiento de la
mayoria de las empresas'', dice Ray Ory, presidente de Vector
Associates, consultoria de EU. ``Asi que estos acuerdos se ven como
un mal necesario''.
 &HT;    La estatal Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) sello uno de los primeros
acuerdos de ese tipo en marzo de 1993, cuando concerto con la
angloholandesa Shell Oil Co. la propiedad conjunta de su refineria
Deer Park. Como parte del trato, Pemex envio 150.000 barriles
diarios de crudo pesado a cambio de 45.000 barriles diarios de
gasolina sin plomo. En 1995, la planta concluyo un programa de
mejoramiento por valor de casi US$1.000 millones. Inicialmente, la
mayor parte de la gasolina se enviaba de vuelta a Mexico; ahora se
vende en EU. Shell no hizo comentarios sobre futuros acuerdos de
esa clase, pero contempla la posibilidad. ``Nuestra empresa
conjunta al 50% en la refineria de Deer Park es un triunfo para
Shell y para Pemex'', comento Sarah Payne, portavoz de Shell.
 &HT;    Obviamente Pemex quiere hacer mas. Sostiene conversaciones con
Mobil, de EU, sobre un proyecto conjunto en su refineria de
Beaumont, Texas, que produce 320.000 barriles diarios y que ya
procesa cierta cantidad de crudo mexicano.
 &HT;    La tambien estatal Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) ha mostrado
una gran acometividad. En los ultimos anos, ha comprado capacidad
de refinacion de casi un millon de barriles diarios a refinerias
norteamericanas. ``No podemos hacerlo solos'', dice Nelson
Olmedillo, asesor de los Servicios de PDVSA en Houston.
``Necesitamos la inversion de capital, la tecnologia y los
mercados''. Ultimamente se ha dedicado con mas ahinco a buscar
convenios. En noviembre del ano pasado, PDVSA creo una empresa
conjunta con Mobil que le da una participacion del 50% en su
refineria de Chalmette, Louisiana, que produce 100.000 barriles
diarios. Las dos empresas planean extraer y procesar crudo
extrapesado de la zona de Cerro Negro, en la franja del Orinoco, y
comercializarlo en EU. La inversion total es de US$2.500 millones,
de los cuales US$800 millones se destinaran a mejorar la refineria.
En febrero, PDVSA anuncio la compra por US$625 millones de la mitad
de una refineria que produce 500.000 barriles diarios en St. Croix,
en las Islas Virgenes norteamericanas, propiedad de Amerada Hess
Corp., de Nueva York. Segun el acuerdo, PDVSA debe suministrar unos
270.000 barriles diarios de crudo pesado venezolano para
convertirlo en gasolina.
 &HT;    Al cierre de esta edicion, PDVSA sostenia conversaciones con
Phillips Petroleum, de EU, sobre una empresa conjunta para
construir y tener la propiedad de un coker de 58.000 barriles
diarios en su refineria de Sweeny, Texas. Segun el convenio, los
dos serian propietarios al 50% del coker y PDVSA aportaria hasta
165.000 barriles de crudo al dia para procesarlos en la refineria.
Se esperan otros convenios. Lo unico que podria detener el proceso
es que los gigantes petroleros latinoamericanos adquieran una
porcion demasiado grande de la industria de refinacion de EU. ``Si
Venezuela llegara a poseer cierto porcentaje del sector, se
desataria un debate'', dice Ory, de Vector. ``Pero en estos
momentos, se necesitan mutuamente''.

ELIJAH PITTS, 60, PACKERS RUNNING BACK, BILLS ASSISTANT HEAD
COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., N.Y., Wis.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elijah Pitts, a running back for the Green Bay Packers during
their glory years of the 1960s and the assistant head coach of the
outstanding Buffalo Bills teams of the 1990s, died July 10 at Mercy
General Hospital in Buffalo, N.Y. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   He had been suffering from abdominal cancer and had been on
medical leave from the Bills since October.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts played for the Packers from 1961 to 1969 and again in 1971
during the Vince Lombardi era, when Green Bay won four National
Football League championships and two Super Bowls. He scored on
touchdown runs of 5 yards and 1 yard in the Packers' 35-10 victory
over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl I on Jan. 15, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant coach in the NFL for more than two decades
and took over as the Bills' acting head coach for three games
during the 1995 season when coach Marv Levy was being treated for
prostate cancer. The Bills went to four Super Bowls, losing them
all, during his years in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts hardly seemed destined for a long career in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a sharecropper, he grew up in Mayflower, Ark., a town
with a high school so small that it did not have a football team.
He attended high school 12 miles away in Conway, Ark., was a
football star there and was offered scholarships by a number of
colleges. But he decided to stick close to home, playing for
Philander Smith College in Little Rock, a school with several
hundred students.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts was picked by the Packers in the 1961 draft as only a
13th-round selection and had to compete with the star runners Paul
Hornung and Jim Taylor. ``I went with the attitude that I was as
good as anyone,'' Pitts would recall.
</P>
<P>
   He made the Packers as a backup runner, but he was such an
aggressive tackler that Lombardi soon selected him as captain of
the special teams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, when Hornung was hampered by an injury, Pitts teamed up
with Taylor, the fullback, in the starting backfield, and in the
NFL championship game against Dallas in the Cotton Bowl he was
Green Bay's leading runner. In gratitude for his performance in the
inaugural Super Bowl, the Packers pictured him on the cover of
their 1967 guidebook, running behind a block by the lineman Fuzzy
Thurston. Pitts ran for 28 touchdowns during his career and was
named to the Packers' Hall of Fame in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   During his playing days, Pitts never thought of becoming a
coach, but he went on to be an assistant with the Los Angeles Rams,
the Bills and the Houston Oilers of the NFL and the Hamilton
Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League between 1974 and 1984.
He returned then to Buffalo as an aide in charge of running backs
and special teams, and he became the assistant head coach in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, who lived in Buffalo, is survived by his wife, Ruth; two
sons and a daughter. His son Ron was a cornerback for the Packers
and the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apply some of Lombardi's teachings,'' Pitts said in the
mid-1980s. ``Not in the way he would, but in my own way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lombardi's tenet that ``fatigue makes cowards of us
all'' made the greatest impression on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell it to my players,'' he noted in an interview for
``Distant Replay,'' by his former Packers teammate Jerry Kramer
with Dick Schaap (Putnam's, 1985). ``If you're tired, you're a
coward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts could hardly have considered himself lacking in courage,
given the odds he faced in making the Packers. But when he was once
asked whether the intimidating Lombardi had scared him the first
time he heard him, Pitts responded: ``He scared me the last time I
heard him, too.''

SHOWING OFF THE SUBWAY CAR OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first glance, New York City Transit's subway train
of the future looks a lot like the train of the present.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the impression of many of the people who
gathered Friday to see a wooden mock-up of the front half of the
new subway car at the transit agency's maintenance yard on 207th
Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the train has already been running along the
Eighth Avenue line, and the model on display Friday incorporated
changes that resulted from public comments about those cars.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who examined the new model noted Friday that
although it looked like other subway cars on the outside, there
were many changes inside. Transit officials hope those changes will
make for smoother riding in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The transit agency hopes to buy 1,081 of the cars, using them to
replace older models on the lettered subway lines. Transit
officials plan to have all the new cars in place on these lines by
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Timone, a Bronx man who uses the subway primarily to
shuttle between home and the doctor's office, said he liked the new
design, except for one detail. ``There should be no bumps in the
seats,'' Timone said. ``When you are as fat as me, that is really
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Timone was commenting on the sloping indentations in the new
seats, one of several changes. Other innovations include fold-up
seats to accommodate wheelchairs, an emergency intercom system that
allows passengers to talk to the conductor, electronic maps and
information displays, new handrails, including some that hang from
the center of the train, and curved handholds.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were well received by most of the people who visited
during the five-hour open house, though not everyone was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   William Stanford of the Bronx said he disliked the electronic
technology in the train, which will, among other things, tell
riders which stop is next. Transit officials hope the displays will
carry advertisements, announcements, the time and other information
for riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget these display messages,'' Stanford said. ``Come on,
this is a train, not an answering machine or a clock. Do it the old
way, not this new and confusing way.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called for something that is a rare commodity in New
York City subway stations and on streets. ``Put bathrooms on the
cars. If you can do it on a Greyhound, you can do it on a train,''
Stanford said.
</P>
<P>
   The open house attracted more than 100 people, mainly subway
enthusiasts, retirees and schoolchildren who were off for the
summer. Albert O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said
that in the next few weeks the agency plans to compile the answers
to a 10-page questionnaire that visitors filled out about the cars.
``The point is to make our customers as happy as possible,''
O'Leary said.

<P>
   The full-scale mock-up was designed based on focus-group
suggestions and changes being made in other cities, transit
officials said. The transit agency contracted with Sigi Meeslinger
and Masamichi Udagawa of Antenna Design New York Inc. to develop
the prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Udagawa said the new train's most important features are the new
information display systems, including an electronic map that
indicates the train's location at each stop and a monitor that
gives riders information such as which way the train is going.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said that although there are many changes in the new
cars, riders can expect only so much, because ``fundamentally, when
it comes out of the wash, it is still a big subway train.''

LORD RAYNER, 72, CHIEF OF MARKS &AMP; SPENCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lord Rayner, who oversaw a revival and vast expansion of
Britain's leading retailer as chairman and chief executive of Marks
&AMP; Spencer PLC, died June 26, the company announced in London. He
was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The tight financial controls and strong management practices
that Lord Rayner applied at Marks &AMP; Spencer were also put to use in
the British government, where he served in a variety of posts, most
notably beginning in 1970 when he arranged to have all three
branches of the British military use a single procurement office,
which he then ran for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just applying some of the things that we do
commercially at Marks &AMP; Spencer to a government organization,''
said Christopher Littmoden, chief executive of the company's North
American operations, which include the Brooks Brothers clothing
chain acquired a decade ago. ``In defense, he saw efficiencies in
having one buying overhead instead of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek George Rayner was a management trainee with Marks &AMP;
Spencer in 1953 when the company's chairman, Lord Marcus Sieff,
asked for his thoughts about solving a problem. The young man's
advice was so cogent that he was soon rising in the ranks of
management, becoming a director in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Edward Heath became prime minister, the future
Lord Rayner joined the government to centralize military
procurement. He also advised Margaret Thatcher in the early years
of her efforts to improve government efficiency, saving taxpayers
millions of pounds through efficient operations of mundane
government tasks.
</P>
<P>
   He often railed against the number of meetings officials held,
once suggesting that a ``meet-o-meter'' be used to charge
individual departments the cost of time spent in meetings, The
Times of London reported.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 he was knighted for his work on behalf of taxpayers and
in 1983 he was given a life peerage for his work cutting government
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Rayner returned to Marks &AMP; Spencer in 1982 and two years
later became the first person from outside the founding families to
become chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   St. Michael, the company's world famous trademark, had become a
bit tarnished by the early 1980s, with the company reporting its
first decline in unit sales of clothing and household goods, in
1980. Sales became so weak that for the first time in two decades
the company held an unscheduled sale to bring in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Rayner set about restoring the company, with an emphasis on
holding down costs and encouraging enterprise by employees. ``He
introduced much stricter financial controls and carried out a
larger store refurbishment and expansion than anyone had previously
envisioned,'' Littmoden said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he arranged for the company to buy Brooks Brothers for
$770 million (a price that was later trimmed by $20 million) from
Campeau Corp., a Canadian company that collapsed two years later
under heavy junk bond debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Lord Rayner introduced a store charge card and
opened stores in distant suburbs of major cities. He also expanded
operations in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He was a bachelor who left no survivors, the company said.

BERNARD HAERING, 85, A LEADING MORAL THEOLOGIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., R.I., Conn., Texas)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernard Haering, a Roman Catholic scholar who
influenced the sweeping modernization of Vatican II by emphasizing
a moral theology of Christian love rather than the cataloging of
sins, died July 3 at a German monastery. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, according to the Catholic News Service.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, moral theology _ the study of the morality of
human actions _ had concentrated on sin: the causes,
characteristics, degrees and consequences of the gamut of
wrongdoing. Beginning with ``The Law of Christ,'' several volumes
published in 1954, Haering pioneered a much broader approach that
became the standard in Catholic seminaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   For Catholics, the result, said one theologian, was a new
definition of how to live a Christian life. Later, his criticism of
Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II and of their conservative
stances on birth control and other sexual issues provoked an
investigation by church officials, in which he was exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He emphasized the positive,'' said the Rev. Richard McCormick,
a Jesuit professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame.
``He emphasized the aggressive following of Christ. He said that
the heart of moral life is charity to one's neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Law of Christ,'' he added, was ``ground-breaking,
revolutionary.'' His teachings were a touchstone when the changes
of Vatican II were debated in the 1960s. Haering, a priest of the
Redemptorist Order who taught moral theology at the Alphonsian
Academy in Rome from 1950 to 1986, was a member of several Vatican
II councils.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was up most nights advising bishops who came to him,'' said
the Rev. Richard McBrien, who studied with him in Rome during the
1960s and now teaches theology at Notre Dame. ``He always looked so
tired at his lectures in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   As the man some people called the most important moral
theologian of the century, Haering was at first a most reluctant
student. The son of a German peasant, he entered the priesthood
hoping to be a missionary. Conscripted as an army medic during
World War II, he offered Communion to the faithful though he had
been forbidden to perform priestly functions.
</P>
<P>
   After his ordination, he was dismayed when his superior asked
him to teach moral theology. ``I told my superior that this was my
very last choice because I found the teaching of moral theology an
absolute crushing bore,'' he wrote in ``My Witness for the
Church,'' written in the 1970s. ``He mollified me with the answer:
`We are asking you to prepare yourself for this task with a
doctorate from a German university so that it can be different in
the future.'''
</P>
<P>
   One difference was his ecumenical attitude toward other faiths.
He studied Protestant theologians. He taught at Brown University,
Union Theological Seminary and Yale Divinity School _ all
non-Catholic institutions _ and led annual retreats for Protestants
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, when he taught at Catholic University of
America, students crowded into his classes, eager to hear the fresh
and supple religious ideas that were replacing the church's rigid
and traditional approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us dislike a fellow who always speaks to us and never
listens,'' he told Catholic University students in 1964. ``If the
church doesn't listen to the world, then the world will never
listen to the church.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During Vatican II, he helped draft statements saying that
Christians have an obligation to cultivate an appreciation of
beauty, to participate in cultural events, and to help the poor.
``We must learn that to be a Catholic means to see the needs of all
men.''
</P>
<P>
   For Catholics who had grown up thinking the obligations of
Christianity consisted of stepping around a complicated web of
sins, this was a vast and exciting thought. Today, said Charles
Curran, a Catholic moral theology professor at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas, these views of the subject are widespread.
The older teaching of the fine points of sin has virtually
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   After Pope Paul VI issued ``Humanae Vitae,'' the declaration
forbidding Catholics to use birth control, Haering was one of the
most prominent dissenters. He was investigated by church officials
but was not charged with any offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing ever came of it,'' McCormick said. ``They just
harassed him.''

5-HOTEL MINI-EMPIRE IS SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York real estate investor who in the last
decade has turned five small, troubled hotels in Manhattan into
luxury properties has sold his mini-empire to Credit Suisse First
Boston, the global investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The investor, Bernard Goldberg, sold the properties _ the
Mansfield, the Shoreham, the Hotel Wales, the Roger Williams and
the Franklin _ for an estimated $132 million, said an official in
the real estate industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to move on to larger properties, and I don't think
I could manage these five and also acquire two or three much larger
properties in New York,'' said Goldberg, the chief executive
officer of Gotham Hospitality Group.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg added that he had nearly closed on a deal to buy a
large Manhattan hotel, the name of which he said he would not
disclose until next week. He recently made an unsuccessful bid on
the Chrysler Building, hoping to operate a 500-room hotel in the
Art Deco landmark that would have been called the Hotel Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Goldberg's hotels comes as the hotel industry in New
York is booming, with occupancy rates of more than 80 percent,
average nightly room rates nearing $200 and several hotels charging
an average of more than $500 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The prices for rooms at Goldberg's five hotels _ which are
scattered throughout Manhattan, including the Upper East Side and
near midtown _ range from $165 to $325 a night. Not long ago,
however, before the hotelier took over and renovated the
properties, they charged as little as $49 a night and sometimes
housed homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only buy undervalued properties,'' said Goldberg, who added
amenities to his hotels like larger lobbies, chamber music concerts
and CD players in the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Wood, a hotel analyst with Price Waterhouse Coopers, said
that even though Goldberg intends to reinvest in the hotel
business, the sale of his five properties ``has to be an indication
of the industry being at or near a top.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Credit Suisse First Boston, Lance Graber, a
director, disagreed. ``It is an opportunity that was presented to
us that has real upside potential and is consistent with our
business plan with regard to real estate,'' Graber said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the bank keeps a low profile about its real estate
investments. ``We have nothing to gain by publicizing,'' he said.
He noted, though, that the bank owns or co-owns several other
hotels outside New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unique Hotels &AMP; Resorts Inc., a management company that
specializes in small, high-end hotels and resorts, will operate the
hotels for Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   L.K. Prevette, co-managing director of Unique Hotels, which is
based in New York and Los Angeles, said the company planned to make
few changes to four of the five Manhattan hotels. But the Hotel
Wales, known for its turn-of-the-century decor, will receive a
multimillion dollar renovation, because it was last renovated 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a central reservations system and make
improvements to the telephone systems,'' Prevette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldberg has done a nice job with the decor and style of the
properties,'' he added.

PETER K. BLOCH, 79, WHOSE COMPANY DEVELOPED USES FOR ULTRASOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Conn.)   (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter K. Bloch, a founder and former president of Branson
Instruments, a company that developed ultrasound fetal monitoring
and a number of other medical and commercial uses for ultrasound,
died July 7 in New London, N.H. He was 79 and lived in New London.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a swelling on the brain believed to be
produced by an aneurysm, the family said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch, a refugee from Nazi Germany who enlisted in the Army ski
troops in World War II, started Branson Instruments in 1946 in a
garage in Danbury, Conn., with Norman Branson and Robert Fehr, also
a German refugee, who had worked on antisubmarine sonar at General
Electric during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Fehr, 87, was married to Bloch's sister, Edith. Fehr also died
July 7, at home in Greenwich, Conn. Mrs. Fehr said the cause was
pneumonia. Fehr was the editor of The Journal of Audio Engineering
for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Branson Instruments developed devices to test railroad track,
turbines and ship hulls, clean hard-to-reach surfaces in watches,
weld plastic toys, and quilt synthetic bedding fabrics.
Ultrasound's many uses as an alternative to invasive surgery
include breaking up gallstones.
</P>
<P>
   The founders sold the company in 1965 for about $12 million to
Smith Kline &AMP; French Laboratories, which later sold the business to
Emerson Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch was active in local government in Greenwich, Conn., where
he was a member of the Board of Estimate and Taxation for more than
20 years; board president of the Greenwich Library, and a member of
the Greenwich Hospital Corp. He was chairman of the Greenwich
Democratic Town Committee in the early 1970s and a Democratic state
central committeeman from 1968 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch was born in Floss, Germany, near Munich, and came to the
United States in 1938. He graduated from the Columbia University
School of General Studies.
</P>
<P>
   He was divorced from his wife, Barbara Bemis Bloch of Old
Greenwich, Conn., in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, Edith, he is survived by two sons,
Peter L., of New London, and Roger B., of Dallas; a daughter,
Jennifer Samia Bloch of Jaffrey, N.H.; four grandchildren, and his
companion, Dorothy Carter of Milford, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Fehr is survived by a son, David, of Pound
Ridge, N.Y., and two grandchildren.

NBA STARS NOT LOCKED OUT HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHANDEL   RICHARDSON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Talks of an NBA lockout circulated for
several months. So it was no surprise to Gino Kwok, president of
the Fila Summer Pro League, when it finally happened July 1.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his foresight that has allowed Fila to be able to
sponsor the only summer league with pro players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects of a lockout were there,'' Kwok said.
``Everybody could see that there was big talk that was going to
happen. So we went forward organizing it both ways if there was
going to be one, or if there wasn't going to be one.''
</P>
<P>
   The SPL is set to begin its 29th season at 12:15 today at the
Pyramid at Long Beach State. Through July 26, more than 120 players
are expected to participate. Indiana Pacers guard Jalen Rose,
Orlando Magic forward Bo Outlaw and Boston Celtic forward Antoine
Walker are a few NBA stars expected to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices are $7 for general admission and $20 for
courtside. Children under 5 are admitted free when accompanied by
an adult. Game times each day are 12:15, 2:30, 5 and 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 teams scheduled for play, but because of the
lockout, there is little NBA involvement. Under lockout rules, no
trades, free-agent signings or summer camps are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   NBA teams aren't allowed to bring their own group of players, as
has been the case in the past. Coaches and all other NBA personnel
are allowed to attend the games but cannot interact with the
players.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are sponsored by corporations and agents, such as Arn
Tellem and Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like Switzerland,'' Kwok said, ``in a sense that we're
not really run by one or another. It provides them the perfect
environment to continue playing in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are here in a neutral territory doing what they
have to do in the summertime. We support both of them. We hope they
are able to resolve this as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In its history, the league has been a proving ground for several
NBA stars. In 1996, then-17-year-old Lakers guard Kobe Bryant
played his first game as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman, Karl Malone and Nick Van Exel are among the
league's alumni, but the league is generally a common ground for
the younger players struggling to make the NBA, CBA or a foreign
professional league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a bigger concern to guys that are free agents
and rookies fighting for playing time,'' said second-year Indiana
Pacers forward Austin Croshere. ``Whereas someone like Reggie
Miller or Antonio or Dale Davis, those guys are under long-term
contracts and are established. Someone like me, who's fighting for
time, obviously I want to improve as much as I can.''

CITIZENS GROUP CHALLENGES GOVERNOR ON HMO CONTRIBUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A citizens group called on Arizona lawmakers and Gov. Jane Hull
on Friday to shake off $1 million in campaign contributions and
reform the health-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the industry that gives the most money in the state to
candidates for public office,'' Louis Rhodes of Arizona Citizen
Action said at a news conference to announce the formation of
Arizonans for HMO Reform. ``We've got to reform the HMO process.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is asking all candidates to pledge support for
quicker care, more time in the hospital for women's ailments,
malpractice liability for HMOs that deny care, and more access to
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Arizonans for HMO Reform comes as Congress,
President Clinton and other policymakers are proposing so-called
``patient's bill of rights'' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rhodes on Friday was Ken Moore of the National Council
of Senior Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everyone I know has had a problem with an HMO,''
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   However, records supplied by the Arizona Department of Insurance
indicate that only one in 1,800 managed-care patients had a beef
last year. The department received 413 complaints from the 746,000
patients enrolled by the dozen health-maintenance organizations
doing business in the state, Erin Klug, chief market conduct
examiner, said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes released an analysis of campaign contributions from
lobbyists dating to 1995, contending that they have supplied more
than 11 percent of Hull's election funds, contributions that he
said protected managed care from regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hull, son of the governor and her campaign manager,
rebutted the contention, saying she has collected no more than 3
percent of her $1 million campaign fund from the health-care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting out wrong information to promote socialized
medicine,'' Mike Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a person who could debate that there's unhappiness
with HMOs,'' he said. But he accused Arizona Citizen Action of
mounting a political attack on behalf of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson, Democratic primary candidate
for governor, proposed legislation last month to increase patient
rights under managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said his group's proposal is similar to Johnson's but
independent of it. Rhodes said that HMO benefits have been limited
because lobbyists for the health industry have ``purchased access
to elected state officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by Arizonans for HMO Reform named Allan Stanton as
the leading contributor _ giving more than $3,000 to Arizona
elected officials since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton noted, however, that his total comes to only $3 a day
and that he represents a dozen clients besides Blue Cross-Blue
Shield of Arizona. Those others include railroads, General Motors
Corp., Robson Communities and Raytheon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Citizen Action also listed lobbyists Don Isaacson and
Joe Abate as major contributors to candidates, saying each gave
$1,625 over the past three years to head off regulation of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Said Isaacson, who lobbies for St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical
Center, ``I don't represent an HMO, and haven't for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Abate's clients include 10 health-care provider groups, such as
dental hygienists, podiatrists, psychiatrists and even
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of them fight the HMOs,'' Abate said. ``They're for
more patient protection and reform.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ James Rod, a naturalist who revealed the secret world
of Hudson River snapping turtles, muskrats and cattails to
governors and schoolchildren alike as warden of a protected marsh
in Garrison, died July 4 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York
City. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, said his brother Douglas, of
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   James Rod became manager and warden of the Constitution Marsh
Sanctuary, a 270-acre preserve managed by the National Audubon
Society, in 1982. In every season he could be found leading a canoe
tour or dipping a seine in that secluded backwater on the east bank
of the Hudson, 50 miles north of New York City in Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   Rod's studies of cadmium contamination in the marsh's muskrat
population helped prompt the federal Environmental Protection
Agency to order a $100 million Superfund cleanup at a defunct
battery factory that abutted the preserve, New York state
environmental officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup was completed last year, and Rod helped cultivate
thousands of cattail seedlings to plant where tainted mud had been
dredged. Along with leading countless school groups and
bird-watchers through the marsh over 16 years, he frequently acted
as a wildlife guide to Gov. George Pataki, who lives two miles from
the marsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more high-profile figures in conservation,''
Pataki said, ``but there was no more knowledgeable or caring a
figure than Jim Rod. He taught me an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling one tour of the marsh, before the cadmium cleanup,
Pataki said: ``We were out there in canoes one time, and he said,
`Look for the muskrats.' There weren't any. And that was the whole
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The marsh, tucked in a bay created when railroad tracks were
laid along the Hudson in the 19th century, is a refuge for more
than 200 bird species, 45 kinds of fish and several reptiles,
including an ugly, sometimes nasty creature Rod was particularly
fond of, according to his family and friends: the snapping turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Rod, who is 51, said his older brother began taking
snapping turtles and other creatures to their home in Ames, Iowa,
when he was 5 or 6. Soon, the boys started a ``neighborhood zoo''
in the garage, he said. ``Jim was scaring little girls with
snapping turtles 40 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That early fascination with wriggling things led to
undergraduate studies in wildlife biology at Iowa State University.
Rod dropped out before graduating, later earning a bachelor's
degree in journalism at Iona College in New Rochelle.
</P>
<P>
   He received a Bronze Star and Air Medal for service in Vietnam
in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   When Rod started work at the marsh, it was a rarely visited
preserve, known mainly to duck hunters. But soon, with rounds of
fund raising and hammering, Rod and a small crew built meandering
boardwalks, bird-watching blinds and a small education center that
is visited by 5,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother, he is survived by his mother,
Pauline Rod, of Ames; his wife, Dee Hughes, of Garrison; another
brother, William, of Ames, and a son, Terry Totemeier of Idaho
Falls, Idaho.

LONG BALL CARRIES YANKEES OVER DEVIL RAYS, 8-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Chuck Knoblauch swings at the first pitch
about as often as the Yankees lose. Taking pitches is part of what
he does, part of why he has still been an effective offensive
player as a leadoff man, despite a plummeting batting average.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch apparently got tired of making outs and made up
his mind to swing at the first pitch in his at-bats Friday night.
In the process, he catapulted the Yankee attack. Knoblauch whacked
a game-tying three-run homer in the sixth inning against Tampa Bay,
and the Yankees got a game-breaking three-run homer from Scott
Brosius in the eighth as they beat the Devil Rays, 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Yankees' eighth consecutive victory, their 12th in
their last 13 games. They have won 63 and lost 20 and are four
victories better than the 83-game record of the legendary 1927
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, in danger of being replaced in the rotation by
Ramiro Mendoza, barely pitched well enough to win but still
improved his record to 7-3. It was Knoblauch who bailed him out
with his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's average had dropped to .263 by the All-Star Game
break, but he said he felt much better Thursday, after returning
from the break. He had had a chance to get away from the game,
flying to Minnesota to repair water damage in his house there,
ripping up water-logged carpets with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But things hardly seemed improved for him on Thursday. Knoblauch
lined out in his first at-bat, hit another hard grounder for an out
in the second inning, struck out in his final two at-bats and
nearly committed a costly throwing error. Afterward, manager Joe
Torre said that maybe Knoblauch was a little frustrated; he just
needed something good to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch made his own luck Friday night, swinging at the game's
first pitch, swinging at the first pitch again in the third; he was
going to remain aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay was ahead by 3-0 in the fifth inning, and Wilson
Alvarez had not allowed the Yankees a hit. But after hitting
Brosius on the elbow with a fastball, Alvarez yielded a single to
Joe Girardi. Alvarez then tried throwing a fastball past Knoblauch,
who smashed it to left, about 10 feet over the wall, his first home
run in 135 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added two runs in the sixth, and Brosius finished
off the Devil Rays two innings later.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Thursday whether Irabu might be replaced in the
rotation, Torre said all options had to be considered, a nice way
for a manager to say, yeah, the guy could be in trouble. After all,
Irabu had allowed eight home runs in 11 2/3 innings in his previous
three starts, and beyond that, he seemed unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Torre seems convinced Irabu is healthy, but is much less certain
about Irabu's mental approach.
</P>
<P>
   If Irabu was, in fact, pitching to keep his job in the rotation
Friday night, he offered an inconsistent performance against the
league's worst- hitting team _ but ultimately made the pitches
needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay scored single runs in the second, third and fourth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored their first run after Al Clark, the home
plate umpire, missed what appeared to be a called third strike
against a pivotal hitter in the inning, and Mel Stottlemyre, the
pitching coach, had to go to the mound to calm Irabu afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's second run was no fluke: Fred McGriff anticipated a
fastball, correctly, and blasted a home run over the left field
wall, his first in Tampa Bay since April 28.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the fourth inning, Dave Martinez hit a looping
liner to center field, where Chad Curtis rushed in, attempted a
shoestring catch _ and missed.
</P>
<P>
   Like a pebble skittering across ice, the ball bounced off the
artificial surface and rolled and rolled, to the deepest part of
the park, banging against the wall in center field 415 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tim Raines retrieved the ball and Derek Jeter
relayed home, Martinez was across home plate with a dive, the first
inside-the-park home run in the Devil Rays' short history.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees tied the game in the fifth, Tampa Bay
sandwiched a single and a walk around a throwing error by Jeter,
loading the bases. Behind two balls and one strike, Irabu
challenged Paul Sorrento with a fastball; Sorrento fouled it
straight back, just missing.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu threw a ball high, for a full count, then came back with a
diving split-finger fastball that Sorrento swung over and missed.
</P>
<P>
   If Irabu stays in the rotation and revives his season, he might
look back on this as a pivotal pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez then ended the inning by bouncing to short and into a
double play _ the end of a devastating inning for the Devil Rays,
no runs after loading the bases with nobody out. The Yankees
swarmed the top step of their dugout to greet the infielders. It
was as if they knew they had won the game right then.
</P>
<P>
   Errors by shortstop Kevin Stocker and third baseman Wade Boggs
in the sixth provided the Yankees with two runs and a 5-3
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was relieved in the bottom of the inning, with one out,
and after Graeme Lloyd pitched out of the jam left for him, Irabu's
final line was no better than respectable: 7 hits, 4 walks, 3 runs
and 5 strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings. He had thrown 102 pitches, only
59 strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' rotation has failed to produce a quality start in
only seven of the last 33 games, and Irabu is responsible for four
of those seven.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time since June 10, Irabu won. And once again,
the Yankees won. No matter who pitches or who hits or who they
play, they win.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The loss for Tampa Bay was its eighth in a row. The first-year
Devil Rays trail the Yankees by 31 1/2 games in the American League
East.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza pitched two and two-thirds scoreless innings in
relief and earned his first save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game, matching David Cone (12-2) for New York
and Rolando Arrojo (10-5) for Tampa Bay, is a sellout _ the Devil
Rays' first since opening day.
</P>
<P>
   The inside-the-park homer by Dave Martinez was the first against
the Yankees since Aug. 8, 1996, when Minnesota's Roberto Kelly hit
one off Dwight Gooden at the Metrodome.

MAYOR REJECTS SUGGESTION FOR GUARANTEE ON YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Friday rejected George
Steinbrenner's suggestion that the city guarantee a record number
of ticket sales this season at Yankee Stadium if the team stays
there, saying it was ``not the right way to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said it would be unfair to ensure record profits for
the Yankees without doing the same for every other business in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up an area of negotiations that other businesses
would then want,'' Giuliani said during a news conference at City
Hall. ``Every business wants to be more and more profitable. You
don't want to put the city in the position of guaranteeing that
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Steinbrenner said that he would consider keeping
the Yankees in the Bronx if attendance reached 3 million this year
_ about 6 percent more than the team is on pace to draw, and 14
percent more than the team's previous record _ and can be
guaranteed to stay at that level.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was seen as a softening of Steinbrenner's
insistence that his team cannot make enough money in the Bronx,
because worries about crime and traffic keep potential spectators
away. He has pressured city officials to build a new stadium on the
West Side of Manhattan, and Giuliani has enthusiastically taken
steps toward such a project, saying that while he wants to keep the
team in the Bronx, his primary goal is to keep it somewhere in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   But the City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, and the Bronx
borough president, Fernando Ferrer, have repeatedly denounced the
plan, saying that the Yankees should stay in the stadium that they
have called home for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor
this year, has sought to put a referendum on the November ballot
that would block a West Side stadium. That effort started a bitter
dispute between him and Giuliani over the city budget that is still
being fought out.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Giuliani praised Vallone for not taking
Steinbrenner's request seriously. Vallone told reporters on
Thursday that asking the city to guarantee 3 million fans was
``like asking George Steinbrenner to guarantee 100 wins every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that Steinbrenner had thrown ``a sucker punch''
and that Vallone had understood how to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time in which I probably agree with the speaker,''
Giuliani said Friday. ``I think the speaker's reaction to it,
despite our disagreement over a resolution, indicates the great
experience that he has in city government negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said he saw the mayor's comments, taken along with
Steinbrenner's new willingness to discuss staying in the Bronx, as
a small triumph. Both suggest that the two men are coming around to
his point of view, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think we're all moving in the right direction
now,'' Vallone said. ``Hopefully we will all be sitting down and
talking soon to figure out the most viable way of keeping the New
York Yankees in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Steinbrenner, Howard Rubenstein, said that
Steinbrenner would come to a decision on his own about where he
wanted his team to be, and that he would not announce it until
fall. Selling 3 million tickets this season would be a reason to
discuss staying in the Bronx, but Steinbrenner does not really
believe so many tickets can be sold, Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the 3 million is reached, that doesn't necessarily
close a deal,'' Rubenstein said. ``All George was saying was: `Put
up or shut up. If you can guarantee 3 million, then we can talk.'''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the house at 2121 Geronimo Way in Las Vegas was
damaged in a suspicious fire last January, it did not take long for
agents from Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. to begin an investigation
of a policy written only two weeks earlier to a man named Robert
McCarren.
</P>
<P>
   But McCarren was not an average homeowner in the plush
neighborhood of $300,000 homes abutting the Las Vegas National Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, police and private investigators now say McCarren was
picked out of a Las Vegas homeless shelter by Sante Kimes, a con
artist suspected in the disappearance of at least three people, and
put squarely in the middle of a scheme to defraud the insurance
company and a bank of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And, the investigators say, Ms. Kimes went so far as to prepare
him for an interview with an investigator from the insurance
company and to threaten him if he did not stick to the story she
had written.
</P>
<P>
   To investigators in Nevada and New York, the story of 2121
Geronimo Way seems like a mirror image of what they believe to be
the case in the disappearance of Irene Silverman, a Manhattan
millionaire: fraudulent efforts to quickly transfer the ownership
of valuable real estate _ followed by murder.
</P>
<P>
   After officials in Las Vegas determined that the house had been
deliberately burned, Fireman's Fund contacted McCarren to set up an
interview. He agreed to the meeting, according to an investigator
familiar with the case, but insisted that it be held in the lobby
of an airport hotel in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to that investigator, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, the company was unaware that the location had been
chosen so that Ms. Kimes and her son, Kenneth Kimes, the real
owners of the house, could sit nearby and listen to the
conversation. They wanted to make sure that McCarren didn't confess
to being a front man for their elaborate scheme, the investigator
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kimes and her son are in custody in New York City, held on a
Utah warrant involving a bad check. And just as New York police are
trying to unravel the disappearance of Mrs. Silverman,
investigators are piecing together the remarkably complex tale of
the Las Vegas home.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1992, Ms. Kimes filed court papers indicating that
her family had transferred the ownership of the house to David
Kazdin, a Los Angeles businessman acquainted with Ms. Kimes for a
long time. But insurance investigators now believe that Kazdin did
not know that he had been listed as the property's owner.
Investigators said they believe that Ms. Kimes put the home in
Kazdin's name so that it would not be seized as part of any civil
lawsuits or criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1997 or very early this year, investigators say, Ms.
Kimes took out a new mortgage on the home with a bank in Florida,
using Kazdin's name.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after obtaining the mortgage, investigators say, Ms.
Kimes decided to change the name on the title. This time, they say,
she found McCarren, an indigent man who was at a homeless shelter
in Las Vegas, and had him listed as the new owner. The documents
making the transfer were notarized by Nanette Wetkowski, a notary
public who was a business associate of Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   After transferring ownership to McCarren, Ms. Kimes used his
name in January to buy an insurance policy on the home. The house
was burned on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before McCarren's meeting with the insurance
investigator, Ms. Kimes grilled him mercilessly, demanding that he
memorize the script she had prepared on how to respond to the
investigator's questions, according to police officials in Los
Angeles. McCarren later told police that when he made mistakes in
their practice sessions, Ms. Kimes would beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sante Kimes is an incredibly manipulative and controlling
woman,'' said an insurance investigator familiar with the case.
``And she intimidated and manipulated McCarren, and she tried to
manipulate and control everyone else she came in contact with.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McCarren got through the first interview with the
insurance company officials, the scheme was beginning to unravel,
officials said. Given the suspicious nature of the case, Fireman's
Fund refused to pay out on the insurance claim on the Las Vegas
home.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, an official from the Florida bank contacted Kazdin,
who told the official that he had not applied for a mortgage on the
house and did not know what he was talking about, investigators
say.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, investigators say, Ms. Kimes had wired the
money _ at least $200,000 _ from the mortgage to an offshore bank
account in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Kazdin was found dead in a Dumpster at Los Angeles
International Airport, and some investigators suspect that he may
have confronted the Kimeses about the house after being contacted
by the Florida banker.
</P>
<P>
   McCarren, meanwhile, became increasingly afraid of the Kimeses,
especially after he heard about Kazdin's killing, police say.
Investigators say the Kimeses were holding McCarren captive in Los
Angeles, but he broke free and contacted Los Angeles police.
Investigators said they believe that these developments prompted
the mother and son to embark on a cross-country trek that
ultimately led them to an elegant Manhattan town house on East 65th
Street.

COMMENTARY: DANGER SIGNS, BUT NO SENSE OF URGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the corner of Alice Herb's living room is a box
for a game her grandchildren play whenever they visit her in
Greenwich Village. It's called ``Snafu _ the Maze Game That Runs
You Ragged.'' ``Push the buttons,'' the instructions read. ``Spin
the dials.'' If she had to spin her wheels, Grandma could probably
win with ease; she has had practice in another labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herb is a lawyer and ethics consultant to a group of health
and social-service providers in Brooklyn. Since late February, she
and several agencies have asked the city's Administration for
Children's Services to remove two children from the home of a
19-year-old client of the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, they said, appeared incapable of adequately feeding,
clothing and protecting her children. They said she had been
attacked, in front of the children, by a man who forced his way
into her filthy apartment. Often, they added, the children, 2 and 5
years old, had come to office visits unkempt or agitated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herb said she never received a reply to three detailed
letters written to the administration's general counsel and to
Nicholas Scoppetta, its commissioner. She was also upset that even
though she and the four service providers who worked with the
family recommended that the children be removed from their home,
child-welfare officials decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herb and several of her colleagues are dumbstruck by what
they see as a breakdown in communication with child-welfare
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get strong recommendations from four agencies, you'd
think there would be some meat to the claims,'' Ms. Herb said.
``There are warning signs. These are two children that can be saved
except for the ridiculous policy of keeping them with the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Child-welfare officials who reviewed the case said they had been
in touch with the mother and ``all the right people'' from the
beginning. They said that the letters prompted an investigation.
But they also said that among the representatives of four
social-service groups that met on Feb. 20 to discuss the case, not
everyone agreed that the children needed to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have responded to their concerns,'' said Leonora Weiner, a
spokeswoman for the administration. ``The casework has been
thorough, and we are still monitoring the family.''
</P>
<P>
   But four people at the February meeting insisted that the
service providers who attended were unanimous in recommending that
the mother give up custody. They said that one of them, a
caseworker from Covenant House, which provided counseling and other
services to the mother under a contract with the city agency, was
later overruled by her supervisor. A spokeswoman for Covenant House
declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say for the record who were ``the right
people'' they consulted on the case. Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, a
pediatrician on the faculty of the State University of New York
Health Science Center at Brooklyn, said he was not among them. He
could have told investigators how he treated the mother when she
came in with a black eye after an attempted rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had an agency not respond in such a way,'' said
Birnbaum, who wrote to Scoppetta in early May. ``I've had cases 10
times more complicated than this where a supervisor in a field
office responds front and center. Here, we haven't gotten
sufficient response.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Adon, a caseworker who assists him, said that she had
tried repeatedly to contact a city caseworker and supervisor, but
that they had seemed irritated on the three occasions she reached
them. She said they had been upset that she and her colleagues had
written to their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even know the mother was in the hospital,'' Ms.
Adon said of her last call on April 21. ``The situation
deteriorated as to why I was doing this to them. After that I made
calls and got no answer. The communication just died out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother has since enrolled in the Job Corps in Massachusetts.
She placed her children in the custody of their grandmother, who
lives in a studio apartment with two of her own children. Birnbaum
wonders what will happen if the mother returns to New York. He also
wonders if the agency will ever respond to him directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stuff going on now we could be telling them,'' he
said. ``We're trying to serve as supplemental sources of
information, and we need to have feedback on what they're doing.
We're trying to make sure they don't have a disaster on their
hands, because we see things that are going on.''

PARIS _ Some Croatian fans are sitting in a bar near the
Champs-Elysees just a few hours after their team lost a
heartbreaking World Cup semifinal game to France.
</P>
<P>
   Much to their surprise, in walk three Croatian players. The
players walk up to the fans and begin thanking them for their
support, signing autographs and shaking hands.

<P>
   Later, the Croatian players give the fans some money when they
realize the fans were desperately trying to get home after spending
everything they had on scalper's tickets.

<P>
   It's nearly 1 a.m. at a Paris subway station near the Gare de
Lyon, when hundreds of Mexican fans flood the station after
arriving by bullet train from the Mexico-South Korea game.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of South Koreans are among the throng, holding
Korean flags and quietly, curiously watching the Mexicans sing
wildly about their team's victory.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans, about 10 of them, softly begin chanting,
``Viva Mexico, Viva Mexico,'' as if to say congratulations to the
partying mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans break into a thunderous round of applause when they
hear the cheer, then begin chanting ``Viva Korea'' in return. The
subway arrives, they stuff themselves into the train together and
the last train of the night speeds away into the darkness.

   It is time for the national anthems to be played before the
England-Tunisia match in Marseille. Hours earlier, a group of
English hooligans and local thugs bloodied the streets with ugly
rioting.
</P>
<P>
   As if to make a statement that not all English fans are
hooligans, the huge contingent of English fans at Stade Velodrome
sing God Save the Queen to a deafening level. Later, during the
game, a group of English fans hold up the flag of St. George
inscribed with the words, ``We're sorry.''

   The bus stops, but before anyone can get off to retrieve the
flag a young American picks it up and hands it back through the

   It is a stuffy, long, sad ride on the bullet train from
Saint-Etienne to Lyon after Scotland yet again was eliminated from
the tournament in the first round. Scottish fans are sitting
together, talking quietly about the sad streak of never advancing
in the sport they cherish.
</P>
<P>
   A pair off Scottish fans still wearing red wigs, kilts and
tassled shoes stand and shout encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, we are Scotland,'' one of them shouts. And the two
begin kicking their feet and singing, ``Hey, hey, hey, Scotland!''
</P>

   For the next hour, the train rocks with songs.

   Moments after eliminating the Argentines from the competition in
a tough quarterfinal game, several Holland players put a different

   After raising their arms over their heads and applauding the
Dutch fans, the Dutch players walk toward the grandstands where
Argentina's fans are still standing stunned and silent over the
elimination loss.

   It is the gut-wrenching moments of the second half of a
semifinal game between France and Croatia. France is looking for a
hero and out of nowhere comes Lilian Thuram.
</P>
<P>
   He is a tall, thin black man, a native of Guadeloupe who
immigrated as a child with his mother to France. Thuram flashes
upfield and somehow unleashes a magnificent shot that rips the net
and gives France a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   During the ensuing celebration, French defender Laurent Blanc,
who is white, wraps both hands around Thuram's neck, leans forward
and softly touches foreheads with Thuram. The moment probably did
more for the sometimes-strained race relations in this country than
any words could.

   ``I can only say that it has been a success in every way,'' said
Michel Platini, the famous French soccer star who served as
president for France '98. ``It is an enormous responsibility and a
great weight on our shoulders to organize and stage the World Cup,
but I think by any standard, people have been very satisfied with
how it has gone.''
</P>
<P>
   There remain a few pictures to be taken before the 1998 World
Cup comes to a close. Most notably, Sunday night it will be France
or Brazil holding up the World Cup trophy.
</P>
<P>
   But even before that tempting match kicks off, or today's
third-place game between Croatia and the Netherlands, the pictures
that this World Cup will leave behind figure to be lasting and
mostly good ones.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tournament that promised much more wide-open soccer,
the emergence of new stars, dramatic moments, safe and full
stadiums and colorful moments for the world to remember.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part it fulfilled the promise, with the exceptions
being a handful of bloody scenes involving English and German thugs
that led to numerous arrests and injuries, including the beating of
a French officer who remains in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing our security force could do to stop those
incidents from starting,'' said Jacques Lambert, managing director
of France '98. ``But (security) reacted swiftly and took control. I
wish we could have had a perfect record for security, but that was
impossible. I think overall, it was very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, no matter what happens in the dream match between the
host nation and the world's greatest soccer power Sunday, the World
Cup likely will be deemed successful, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the games were at times dramatic in a thespian
sense _ players taking dives and flailing their arms hoping to get
calls from trigger-happy referees.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact Federation Internationale de Football Association
president Sepp Blatter urged officials to use more yellow and red
cards against illegal tackles did lead to more open games.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there have been 21 players red-carded (ejected) and
more than 160 yellow warning cards drawn. As a result, teams
averaged nearly 2.8 goals per game in this tournament, up from four
years ago. Shots on goal also increased by 20 percent from four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the referees hadn't been making those calls, we wouldn't
have seen some of the great goals we've seen,'' English soccer
legend Bobby Charlton said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more memorable 1998 goals that likely would have been
stopped by hard tackles in past tournaments were the run by
England's Michael Owen through the Argentine defense, Luis
Hernandez's late dash for Mexico against Holland and Ronaldo's
impressive run through the Denmark defense in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given people a better chance to just play football,''
Brazil coach Mario Zagallo said. ``The level of play during this
World Cup has been very high. The Africans have played well and the
Europeans have been moving the ball around better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, individual stars have shined.
</P>
<P>
   Owen, 18, figures to be an English force for years. Paraguay
goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert probably can name his price on the
international market after the performance he had in France.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's Davor Suker is another previously unheralded player
who created a stir here. So did the Danish Laudrup brothers,
Michael and Brian. And there were Italy's Christian Vieri, Chile's
Marcelo Salas and, of course, France's Thuram.
</P>
<P>
   There remain a few sticking points that FIFA leaders hope to
iron out before the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding elimination games that end in a tie with penalty kicks
is something nobody seems to like. But no one has come up with a
suitable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Also, FIFA promises to keep tinkering with tackling rules in
hopes of making the game even more offense-oriented and less
entrenched with old-style defensive tactics. Blatter has expressed
a preference for penalizing not just back tackles, but tackles from
all angles that are ruled inappropriate or intentionally malicious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blatter said he was, ``completely happy'' with France's
staging of the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And now it will be France-Brazil in the final. The world should
get its cameras ready.

MORE ICE IN VALLEY'S FUTURE?  
 COYOTES HOPE TO BUILD 3-5 PUBLIC SKATING RINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After the ice rink at Metrocenter was turned into a
mini-amusement park, there were only two places left in the Valley
for the public to skate, youth and adult hockey leagues to play and
aspiring figure skaters to train.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine state-of-the-art rinks, complete with full-size
restaurants and impeccable locker-room facilities, popping up all
over the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa? Peoria? Ahwatukee? Chandler? Central Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we'd like to ultimately surround the Valley. That's
going to be our goal,'' said Mike O'Hearn, who on Friday was
promoted by the Coyotes to president of B.G. Ice Incorporated, a
business extension of the Valley's NHL team that could build as
many as three to five new rinks in the area within the next five to
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of hockey operations/facilities last season
for the Coyotes, O'Hearn helped get the team's Scottsdale-based
headquarters and training facility off the ground and tackled the
political battles that went with it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Cellular One Ice Den is one of the hottest new
attractions for public ice consumption. Apart from when the Coyotes
use the two-rink building, it is open for public use 90 percent of
the time, day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' goal, O'Hearn said, is to spread the wealth around
the Valley so ice time doesn't become too congested. Exact
locations for the potential new sites and dates for completion have
yet to be determined, but each will include upscale ice surfaces,
in addition to Team Shops and, ultimately, frequent appearances by
Coyotes players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to generate a lot of grass-roots interest
here, and these types of facilities will enable us to do even
more,'' O'Hearn said. ``Think about it: Of the four major
professional teams (in the Valley), we're the only one that enables
the public to literally come to our front door and be a part of our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hearn, who has spent 12 years with the franchise, previously
serving as a broadcaster and assistant general manager, also
figures to be a point man in the Coyotes' pursuit of a new arena in
the Valley should acceptable renovations for hockey not be made at
America West Arena within the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if it came to that, yes, I'd be involved,'' O'Hearn
said. ``(Coyotes Owner) Richard (Burke) and (team president) Shawn
(Hunter) are dealing with those possibilities. If the decision from
the organization is to move in that kind of direction, hopefully
they'll come back to me and use some of the things I've learned
from this last process here in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we're a long leap yet from that.''
</P>
<P>
   B.G. Ice Inc., which includes the name of Burke and former
partner Steven Gluckstern, will be renamed to Coyotes Ice LLC or
Coyotes Ice Futures LLC within the next several weeks. &QL; 
Note &QL; 
Chris ``Frosty'' Scoppetto, an assistant equipment manager for the
Coyotes the past two seasons, has resigned to accept a similar
position with the expansion Nashville Predators, who will begin NHL
play in October. &QL;

POLICE OFFICER AND FRIEND ARE FOUND SHOT TO DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ A decorated veteran of the Jersey City
police department and a friend were found shot to death in the
officer's apartment Thursday, and a prime suspect, the officer's
former roommate, apparently killed himself in rural Pennsylvania,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Daniel Talty, 48, and his friend, Joseph
Plascencia, 35, of Bayonne, were shot several times each in the
head and chest as they prepared to wallpaper a room in Talty's
ground-floor apartment near the Bayonne border, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings apparently occurred late Sunday or Monday, after
Talty returned from a holiday weekend at the Jersey shore, but the
bodies were not discovered until Thursday night, after Talty failed
to report for work and his colleagues grew concerned, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Talty's car, a late-model Mercury Marquis, and a snub-nosed .38
caliber handgun he oned, were missing. The car and a gun that
appeared to be Talty's were found Friday afternoon in a farmer's
field near Harrisburg, Pa., said Daniel Gibney, chief of
investigations in the Hudson County prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the car was the body of a man, tentatively identified as
Mark Polidoro, 42, who resigned from the Jersey City Police
Department four years ago and has been unable to hold steady work
since then, Gibney said. He said that the man died from a
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the mouth, but that no suicide note
was found.
</P>
<P>
   Gibney said the car had been parked in the field since Tuesday,
but that the farmer did not report it to the Pennsylvania State
Police until Friday. By then, the Jersey City police were already
searching for Polidoro and had issued an alert for the slain
officer's missing Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they believed only one weapon was used in
the murders, but they were not certain it was Talty's handgun.
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey City police chief, William Thynne, said Talty, who
was divorced and had two grown children, had invited Polidoro, a
friend for years, to live in his apartment several months ago
because he was jobless and Talty felt sorry for him. But in late
June, the chief said, Talty told Polidoro to leave, because his
life remained in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Talty told friends he had become uneasy about
Polidoro. ``He was acting irrationally, and Talty was concerned,''
Gibney said of Polidoro.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bret Schundler and Thynne praised the slain officer, a
25-year veteran of the force who had received 13 commendations and
excellent service awards and was once honored by the New Jersey
Legislature for his work with troubled youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a credit to his department, his family and his
friends,'' Schundler said. ``He will be missed by us all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thynne said: ``He gave up many hours of his own time and
dedicated it to the children. I can't say enough good things about
this officer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the state Senate and Assembly issued a proclamation
naming Talty New Jersey's ``Police Officer of the Year'' for
helping create two police-sponsored programs _ ``We Care for Kids''
and ``Protect Our Children'' _ for teen-agers veering toward
delinquency, said Lt. Michael Louf, an aide to Thynne.
</P>
<P>
   Under those programs during the 1980s and early 1990s, Talty, on
his own time, helped organize athletic events, counseling sessions,
and other events for youths in a multicultural, multiracial
neighborhood, Louf said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Talty was assigned to a police substation at
the Newport Center Mall, a sprawling, 12-year-old shopping center
of 140 stores on the revitalized Jersey City waterfront on the
Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good friend to the managers,'' said Jim Roberts, the
mall's marketing director. ``A lot of them left early today when
they heard the news. He's going to be very missed and difficult to
replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday that Talty had failed to report for duty
on Monday and Tuesday, but that his colleagues would not have
noticed his absence, because he normally worked alone at the mall.
His days off were Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow officers became uneasy after they were unable to reach
him by phone several times during the week, officials said.
Finally, two went to his home late Thursday and found the bodies
after the landlord, a Jersey City police officer, let them into the
locked apartment, officials said. Both bodies were found in the
kitchen, officials said, and there were no signs of forced entry.

METS LOSE 5TH STRAIGHT, 8-6 TO EXPOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was expectation in the air at Shea Stadium
Friday night on the eve of Todd Hundley's return from elbow
surgery. There was a trade for a pitcher, Greg McMichael, whom the
Mets had traded away 36 days before. There was a big, noisy crowd
on hand waiting not-so-patiently for a late-night merengue concert.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a baseball game, and a pretty wild one. The Mets
survived two lost arguments and a four-run deficit to rally for a
brief lead before the Montreal Expos rallied for three runs off
John Franco with two out in the top of the ninth for a demoralizing
8-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the ninth in 11 games for the reeling Mets
(44-41), who have lost five straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Franco (0-4), the losing pitcher in the Mets' last three games,
probably deserved better. The Expos left the bases loaded in the
eighth when pinch-hitter Mike Hubbard grounded sharply into a force
play at third. But that was after Montreal had been denied a run
when Chris Widger had to settle for a ground-rule double when his
two-out shot off Franco with a runner on first skipped over the
center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos tied the game at 6-6 in the top of the ninth on a
one-out infield single to short by Vladimir Guerrero, a two-out
single to right by Rondell White through a hole in a shifted
infield, and a high-chop infield single from Mark Grudzielanek on a
ball that got caught in third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo's glove,
allowing the tying run to score. Shane Andrews followed with a
two-run triple to deep center field on a full-count pitch. And the
Mets were on their way to another crushing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   That the Mets even needed Franco was something of a surprise
after the Expos jumped on Masato Yoshii for four early runs. The
first three came during in the third on Guererro's 16th homer, a
420-footer. Montreal picked up another run in the fourth on a
lead-off triple by Grudzielanek and Widger's successful suicide
squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets rallied for three runs off Carlos Perez on a
two-out run-scoring single by Yoshii (it was his second major
league hit); a misplayed fly ball in right-center field off the bat
of Bernard Gilkey that dropped for a two-base error to score Yoshii
from first, and a run-scoring single by Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, the arguments began. With one out in the sixth,
Mike Piazza rocked a ball to deep left-center that manager Bobby
Valentine thought had cleared the fence before bouncing back into
play. The umpires ruled that Piazza had to settle for a double,
however. One pitch after Valentine had lost the argument, Butch
Huskey drilled a run-scoring double, tying the game at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with two out and nobody on in the top of the seventh, F.P.
Santangelo tried to bunt. The plate umpire, Jerry Meals, ruled that
the ball had first hit Santangelo's bat. But after Santangelo
argued vehemently, the umpires conferred and ruled that Santangelo
had been hit by the pitch. That brought Valentine out of the dugout
again, again to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   On Yoshii's first pitch after the argument, Orlando Cabrera
drilled a run-scoring double to left for a 5-4 Montreal lead,
before Bill Pulsipher came on to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez led off the bottom of the seventh with a single off
Perez and pinch-hitter Todd Pratt hit a run-scoring double. On came
the right-hander Miguel Batista to face the left-handed-hitting
Gilkey. He responded with a run-scoring single, one of his three
hits, to give the Mets their first lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco and the Mets just could not hold on.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Despite the objections of the Yankees' owner, George
Steinbrenner, the home- and-home weekend series between the Mets
and Yankees on next year's schedule will stand as designed. The
teams will play June 4-6 at Yankee Stadium and July 9-11 at Shea
... Al Leiter, who is on the disabled list with a slight tear of
the patella tendon in his left knee, threw 50 pitches from a mound
Friday and remains on course to make his first start back on July
18. ``Al looked great,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He felt
good, too.'' Said Leiter, ``I was able to throw with no pain.'' ...
Valentine chose to wait until Saturday to announce which field Todd
Hundley will play Saturday night. ``I'd just like to get him
here,'' Valentine said. ``Once he gets here, I think he'll be fine.
What we've missed from last year is that other guy in the outfield.
Last year, we were getting a lot of production from Carl Everett.
Hopefully, Todd will add to our overall production. If he's fine,
he's good and he's better than anything we've had, maybe better _
depending on how fine _ than any other outfielder. If he's not
fine, then I don't know what to do. But everything I've read in the
reports says he's fine.'' ... Carlos Baerga was out of the starting
lineup with a tight right hamstring. ``I don't know how one more
day after three days off is going to do,'' Valentine said. ``If
it's that close to where he can't run, it's that close to being
pulled. So I definitely have a concern.'' But Baerga did not seem
concerned. ``It's tight, that's it,'' he said. ``I can run, just
not at full speed. I'm playing tomorrow.''
