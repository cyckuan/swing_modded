<HEADLINE> Blood Pressure Drug Linked to Cancer Rise: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Use of Calcium channel
blockers, one of the most widely prescribed classes of medications
for high blood pressure, has been linked to higher rates of cancer
among older people, according to a study made public on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The risk of developing cancer was 72 percent higher among those
who used the short-acting forms of calcium channel blockers, the
federally financed study noted.
</P>
<P>
The percentage increase is equivalent to eight excess new
caners in each 100 people taking the drugs for five years, and 16
excess cancers over 10 years, scientists who conducted the study
which is to be published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet, an
international journal published in London.
</P>
<P>
The scientists described the findings as tentative, for they
did not provide enough evidence to recommend that people should
stop using calcium channel blockers. But the findings should be
used to generate new studies to determine the degree of risk among
the millions of people who take all forms of calcium channel
blockers, they said.
</P>
<P>
Calcium channel blockers are the most widely proscribed class
of drugs for high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has also approved the drug for treating a variety
of ailments affecting the heart and the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that a possible biological explanation
exists for the link between calcium channel blockers and cancer,
if it is confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Healthy Economy Leads to improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. labor market showed some
improvement in the last two years resulting from a better economy
and fewer workers were displaced from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a survey by U.S. Labor Department on Thursday, The
Washington Post said today a total of 8.4 million people lost
their jobs between January 1993 and December 1995, less than 9
million between January 1991 and December 1993.
</P>
<P>
About 3.8 million workers lost jobs they had held for at least
three years due to insufficient work or because their positions
were abolished between January 1993 and December 1995, the Bureau
of Labor Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
But 73 percent of them had found new work by February 1996.
That compares with just 68 percent who had found new work two
years earlier. About 13 percent remain unemployed comparing with a
19 percent in the previous two years and the rest are dropped out
of labor force.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that almost half of re-employed full-time
workers had equal or better earnings in their new jobs compared
with their old ones. But about one-third suffered earnings losses
of 20 percent or greater, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The data from the earlier period reflected the impact of the
1990-91 recession and the slow labor market recovery that
followed," the labor report said. "In contrast, the (more recent)
survey covered a period of economic expansion and declining
unemployment."
</P>
<P>
The numbers are likely to provide fuel in the presidential
election, as President Clinton takes credit for a healthy economy
and Republican nominee Bob Dole argues that too many workers are
still insecure.
</P>
<P>
But Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of the U.S. president's Council
of Economic Advisers, said it was not all good news.
</P>
<P>
He said that "while the decline in job dislocation is a
positive trend, the report also confirms that some American
workers who lose their jobs remain unemployed and, for those who
do find new jobs, many experience a drop in earnings."

<HEADLINE> 35 Russian Mafia Members To Be Deported From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Legal proceedings are now
under way to deport a total of 35 suspects of Russian mafia,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani disclosed at the
weekly cabinet meeting that police had set up a special
department and had kept close surveillance of CIS immigrants
suspected of links with organized crimes all the time.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that police forces in the former Soviet
Union say that gang members of organized crimes have arrived
in Israel. He added that the number totals 35.
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, Minister of Trade and Industry and a Soviet
immigrant, asked whether Wednesday's media reports of Russian
mafia in Israel are true. He objected to attaching the stigma to
all new immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Russian immigrant leaders have charged that the police, by
exaggerating their community's role in crime, have unfairly given
the newcomers a bad name. Sharansky is chairman of the immigrant
party, Yisrael B'alyah, which holds 7 seats in the Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
Kahalani responded that his ministry had not used the term of
Russian mafia. "There is no such a thing," he promised.
</P>
<P>
Former public security minister Moshe Shahal said Wednesday
that a police operation aimed at deporting dozens of CIS
organized criminals operating in Israel, slated for last spring. He
said that it was not clear why the operation had been called off.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman in a statement that "there has been
absolutely no connection in the entire affair with political
pressure."

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Kostis
Stephanopoulos today signed a decree dissolving parliament prior
to the general elections on Sunday, September 22.
</P>
<P>
The decree was signed following a visit by Prime Minister
Costas Simitis to the president asking for the dissolution of
parliament and proclamation of early general elections.
</P>
<P>
A two-hour cabinet meeting Thursday night chaired by Simitis
unanimously decided that the government should seek a renewal of
its mandate, more than a year ahead of the expiration of its
current term in office. The decision set elections for September
22.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint meeting of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) central committee and parliamentary group today,
Simitis spoked of "a new historic period" which was opening up, in
which "PASOK is called to play the most important role."
</P>
<P>
Simitis outlined the government's main targets which at the
same time constitute the reasons for calling early elections.
</P>
<P>
The first target, Simitis said, was the process of European
integration, the second, the new order of things in the Balkans in
which Greece had an important role to play.
</P>
<P>
The third target, Simitis said, was the "modernization" of
society and the fourth, "the modern state which we must build".

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wholesale Trade Rose Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The wholesale trade in Canada
rose 0.3 percent in June, while inventories edged downward as
much.
</P>
<P>
Wholesales have now risen for six consecutive months, following
a very flat 1995, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In June, the category of metals, hardware, plumbing and heating
equipment and supplies increased 1.8 percent; motor vehicles,
parts and accessories 1.3 percent, and other products 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the largest declines in sales -- 7.2 percent -- were
recorded for computers, packaged software and other electronic
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Lumber and building materials posted their first decline -- 3.5
percent -- over the last five months, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in lumber sales has resulted from the current
Canada-United States softwood lumber agreement, under which
shipments above a set quota would attract an extra fee.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and four Turkish security members
were killed in separate clashes in southeastern Turkey, according
to a statement issued today by the governor's office of the
emergency rule region.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Turkish security forces wiped out
eight PKK rebels in Baskale and Gurpinar towns of Van province,
five in the Beytussebap town of Sirnak province, and four near the
Uzumcu village of Hakkari province.
</P>
<P>
But the statement failed to disclose when the PKK rebels were
shot dead.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers of the government security forces and two village
guards also were shot dead in their clashes with the PKK rebels in
the region, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the security forces had captured two PKK rebels in
their military operations in southeastern Turkey and one PKK rebel
surrendered to the security forces in Tunceli province.
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops have been killed since the PKK started
fighting a guerrilla war for self-rule in the southeast of
Turkey in August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Greek Defense Industry Orders Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece's four armaments
production industries have registered a record number of orders
over the 1995-96 period, after a series of "bad" years.
</P>
<P>
According to a finance ministry report today, the orders for
deliveries in 1996 totaled 157 billion drachmas (680 million U.S.
dollars), compared to only 50 billion drachmas (210 million
dollars) in 1994, 31 billion drachmas (140 million dollars) in
1993 and 1992 and 29 billion drachmas (130 million dollars) in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Of this year's orders of 157 billion drachmas, the large
majority of 117 billion drachmas (508 million dollars) came from
the Greek armed forces, especially for armored vehicles and
missile launchers, and the rest from abroad, mainly from African
and Middle East countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders for Durable Goods up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods rose 1.6 percent in July, the second advance in
three months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods totaled a
seasonally adjusted 172.7 billion U.S. dollars in the month, up
from 170 billion dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a large decline in orders for shipbuilding
and tanks offset an increase for motor vehicles. Transportation
orders have fallen in three of the last four months.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the transportation category, orders jumped 2.1
percent in July, the fourth consecutive advance.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment posted the
largest gain, up 4.7 percent after a strong 3.9 percent advance in
June. The increase was led by communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment and for primary
metals both rose 2.1 percent. And orders for nonmilitary capital
goods excluding aircraft jumped 3.6 percent, the second straight
gain.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders increased 1 percent after
advancing 0.7 percent in June. It was the 10th increase in the
last 11 months.
</P>
<P>
A growing backlog suggests businesses may have to increase
production facilities and manpower to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, also advanced, a 0.7
percent gain that erased a 0.4 percent drop in June. It was the
third increase in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's
manufacturing sector and continued gains could mean increased
production and more jobs. The orders dropped 0.2 percent in June
following an increase of 4.2 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. manufacturing sector had been in a sluggish state for
most of the year. Other than July and May, only March posted a
gain, a 1.5 percent increase, in the first four months of 1996.

<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The planned strikes today and
next Tuesday by London Underground drivers were called off last
night although rail passengers in many areas of Britain will still
face chaotic journeys.
</P>
<P>
After last-minute talks between the Rail, Maritime and
Transport Union (RMT) and Tube managers, the union's executive
committee lifted the planned strikes, thus ended three-month long
industrial dispute.
</P>
<P>
But 24-hour strikes in seven of the 25 train operating
companies will go ahead as planned. With hundreds of thousands of
people expected to travel by road, rail and air on one of the
busiest weekends of the year.
</P>
<P>
The RMT originally had planned to impose the worst possible
Bank Holiday disruption on travelers by combining an all-out Tube
strike, in conjunction with the train drivers union ASLEF, with
two 24-hour rail stoppages.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the Tube dispute, which caused widespread
disruption for travelers in London, gives all drivers a basic
35-hour working week by 1998.
</P>
<P>
In return, they have to accept pay rises 2 percentage points
below the inflation rate over the next two years and without any
further productivity improvements.
</P>
<P>
Bob crow, the RMT's assistant general secretary, described the
deal as "a remarkable achievement". London Transport will create
300 new jobs, withdraw the use of part-time staff and remove the
option that staff should work on rest days.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Not To Implement Land Nationalization, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Swaziland will not implement a motion, passed by the senate last
week, aimed at nationalising privtely-owned land, Swazi Prime
Minister Barnabus Dlamini said today.
</P>
<P>
The motion, proposed by former Prime Minister and Traditional
Chief Prince Bhekimpi Dlamini, seeks to repeal the concessions
and partitions act of 1907, which allows private ownership of
freehold land.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the capital Mbabane today,Barnabus
Dlamini said he had no intention of changing the existing law,
reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the motion will bring about serious
political and economical implications, inter alia, the
disturbance of peace and stability in the kingdom, said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the government will help Swazis to buy
farms and other freehold properties through loans from the
government-owned Swazi bank, the Swaziland Building Society and
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's statement, came after a special joint
caucus meeting in parliament on Thursday, was welcomed by the
business community, which shocked by the passing of the motion.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary of the Federation of Swaziland Employers,
Mosa Hlope, said the government is taking a swift action to
" arrest an event that is fast eroding business confidence in
Swaziland".
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's decision is further evidence that the new prime
minister is determined "to stamp out inconsistencies and
contradictions within the system or organs of the government in
Swaziland, which should be seen to be pursuing the stated policy
directions of the government of the day", said Hlope.

HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 356,433 road
accidents have been reported in Zimbabwe since independence in
1980, claiming lives of 16,770 and injuring other 185,367 people,
the Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Board (ZTSB) Director Ronald Luwaca
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the major causes of bus accidents generally are
speeding, front tyre bursts, vehicle defects, driver judgement
error and negligent pedestrians. However, all these causes are
associated with the human factor and motorists have almost lost
control over these causes."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe now has a trained police accident investigation and
evaluation unit which scientifically assesses and evaluates
accidents, said the director.
</P>
<P>
He added if all motorists, drivers of public service vehicles
in particular, took it upon themselves to exercise caution and
courtesy on the roads, a dramatic reduction in traffic accidents
and needless suffering could be achieved each year.

<HEADLINE> Omani Foreign Minister Criticizes U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Omani Foreign Minister Yusef
Ben-Alawi said today in Muscat that "the policy of economic
pressures and sanctions can only complicate problems rather than
solve them."
</P>
<P>
Ben-Alawi was referring to the U.S. D'Amato Kennedy bill which
was signed into law early this month by U.S. President Bill
Clinton to punish non-American companies investing more than 40
million U.S. dollars a year in Iran and Libya's oil industries.
</P>
<P>
"The best way for ironing out differences and serving the
interests of both sides is to have dialogue on the basis of mutual
respect," the Omani News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is a neighbor that has trade and economic
agreements with Oman and there is a joint commission between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think that the U.S. law should be given priority
over these agreements," he said, adding that "We will sidestep any
thing that may prejudice our trade cooperation with Iran."
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Clinton signed the D'Amato bill into law to
toughen sanctions against Iran and Libya, accusing the two
countries of sponsoring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sanctions, Iran recently signed a number of oil,
gas and other economic agreements with Turkey, Syria and some
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreements further enhanced Tehran's confidence in
thwarting U.S. efforts to isolate Iran, diplomatic sources here noted.

<P>
ROME, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program's (WFP)
first consignments of food aid have arrived in the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to be distributed to some 1.5
million people in the flood-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cargo ship, the MV Tampa Bay, carrying 13,000 tons of
rice, corn meal and corn soya blend from the United States,
arrived on Tuesday and is presently unloading in the Nampo harbor,
the WFP said in a press release today.
</P>
<P>
Two DPRK ships, carrying 9,000 tons and 9,797 tons of rice
respectively, are also pulling into the Nampo harbor. The rice
was purchased in Vietnam with money donated to the WFP by Japan,
Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Demark and a
non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, the United Nation's food aid agency, has been
coordinating the food relief effort in the DPRK since floods first
devastated the country in the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The floods marked the worst natural disaster in the DPRK's
history. New floods this summer worsened the food shortage.
</P>
<P>
As the largest international food aid organization in the
world, the WFP in 1995 fed more than 50 million people, including
half of the world's refugees and internally displaced people.

immigrants who were forcibly evacuated from the Saint-Bernard
Church this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, while the government announced the plan, Agence France
Presse quoted Air France, Air Liberte and AOM airliners as saying
that they have so far received no request for planes to be
chartered for the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
Some trade unions said they would not work on the planes to be
used for such expulsions.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the airliners are also reluctant to let the
government use their planes for the expulsions, which they said
could damage the image of their companies.

<HEADLINE> Horror, Metamorphosis, War Dominate French Novels in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Horror fantasies, metamorphosis of
human being into animals and plants, war and memoir of childhood
time are the dominating topics in bestselling French novels in
1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by Agence France Presse on 286 novels
displayed in the window of French bookstores this year, stories of
metamorphosis are the most welcome by French readers.
</P>
<P>
Among the titles of the type are "Truism" written by Marie
Darrieusecq, whose heroine changes into a sow, and "Bamboo" by
Jean-Marc Aubert, who has its major characters transformed into
bamboos.
</P>
<P>
Horror stories have "The Trade of Blood" by Gilles Petel, who
tells about a butcher's daily life and work to the minutest
precision.
</P>
<P>
Among the childhood stories are "A Phrase for My Mother" by
Christian Prigent, "The Metamorphosis of Father" by Joel Schmidt,
"A Circle of Family" by Michele Gazier, "The Harm of Father" by
Frederic Roux, all of which anlyze family relations and relations
between children and adults.
</P>
<P>
Ecological destrution is the topic in the bestsellers "Those
Who Run After the Birds" by Marie Nimier, "The Rest of the Day" by
Karine Nouri who tells about toxic stocks, and "The Atomic" by
Eric Laurrent which is about nuclear wastes.
</P>
<P>
War is always a popular topic in French novels, which have this
year "Hypothesis of the Desert" by Dominique Sigaud, which is
about the Gulf War, "The Lost War" by Ghassam Fawaz who tells
about the war in Lebanon, "A Country of Ashes" by Elisabeth Gille,
which is about the German invasion in 1940, and "Buried Tragedy"
by Jean-Claude Snyders, who uses Auschwitz death camp as the
background of the story.

<HEADLINE> Only Two in Five of Young in UK Plan to Vote, Mori Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Political parties face a hard
task to persuade young people to vote in the next general
election, according to a poll conducted by Mori published here
today.
</P>
<P>
Only two in five l8-24 year olds are "certain or very likely"
to vote compared with a turnout of more then half in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters, who were conducting the research on behalf of
the Trade Union Congress (TUC), discovered widespread apathy among
young electors but also found that the highest level of support
went to Labor.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 41 percent would always, or normally,
vote for Labor, compared with l6 percent for Conservative and 11
percent for Liberal Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Another poll conducted by TUC helps to explain young people's
apathy. When asked how well politicians understood what working
life was really like, 45 percent said "not very well". A further
24 percent said "not at all well".
</P>
<P>
While the survey results will make disappointing reading for
Labor politicians who are expecting to attract most of the votes
among the young, John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the
findings were most depressing for the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found nearly three-quarters of the young people
surveyed did not meet the "two-year-rule" qualifying period for
legal protection against unfair dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Half of respondents cited instances of unfair treatment at work
with the most commonly mentioned examples low pay and "poor
treatment by management".
</P>
<P>
Some 78 percent wanted a national minimum wage to protect
employees from exploitation and 90 percent agreed they should have
the right to be represented.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Orders Changes in Boeing 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration Thursday ordered changes in flight controls on all
1,037 Boeing 737s now being used by U.S. airlines.
</P>
<P>
First flown in 1967, the world's most popular jetliner has been
involved in the only unsolved aviation accidents in U.S. history,
a United Airlines crash in 1991 and a USAir crash in 1994. A total
of 157 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, pilots lost control of their planes in clear
weather without any apparent cause. The 30-ton 737s suddenly
rolled over and flew straight into the ground. Investigators found
signs of rudder or other control malfunctions on both planes.
</P>
<P>
The control system changes being ordered should not be linked
directly to the crashes, says a FAA official.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the changes apply to tail and related controls.
</P>
<P>
The FAA is giving airlines between 90 days and 18 months to
perform inspections or make the changes being ordered.
</P>
<P>
Other steps include testing and strengthening 737 wheel wells
and installing stronger wheels to prevent damage to flight
controls in the wings in case of tire fire or puncture. A spring
in the cockpit will also be replaced to reduce the force needed to
control the flight of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The FAA says the tests and changes will cost up to 5 million
U.S. dollars for the entire U.S. fleet.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,830 of the 737s in service around the world.

<HEADLINE> Irish Navy Detains First Japanese Trawler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Irish naval forces have detained
a Japanese trawler and escorted it to port in a crackdown on
illegal fishing in the country's Western waters, according to
press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Irish authorities have detained a
Japanese fishing vessel inside the country's 200-mile "Irish Box"
waters on suspicion of illegal fishing.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese vessel, the Minato Maru, was being escorted to the
coast of Cork, southern Ireland after being found in the Irish
waters earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Its captain is expected to be charged with fishing about 100
miles off the Galway coast inside Irish waters and about eight
tons of tuna have been found in its hold.
</P>
<P>
A senior Irish naval officer told Irish radio that navy
officers are preparing to board another Japanese fishing vessel
earlier today found inside the Irish Box.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not know whether the vessel would also be
detained and escorted to port after a search of the hold and
inspection of the trawler's documentation is carried out.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a further 30 Japanese vessels were grouped
just outside Ireland's international waters and the Irish naval
officer declined to admit that there is a coming standoff between
Japanese fishing fleet and Irish fisheries protection
vessels.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Friday reaffirmed its strong support for the work of Rolf
Ekeus, the Executive Chairman of the U.N. Special Commission, just
two days before his visit to Baghdad on 25 August.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus is going to be accompanied by a weapon inspection team of
the U.N. Special Commission. The commission is in charge of
verifying the total destruction of Iraq's massive weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council, on the eve of the planned visit to
Baghdad by the Executive Chairman of the Special Commission,
strongly reaffirms its full support for the Special Commission in
the conduct of its inspections and other tasks entrusted to it by
the council," said the presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
Th Security Council said it remained gravely concerned at the
previous failures by Iraq to cooperate with the Special Commission
and urged it to respect its relevant commitments.
</P>
<P>
"The denial by Iraq, on repeated occasions, of immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to sites which they wished
to inspect and the attempts made by the Government of Iraq to
impose conditions on the conduct of interviews with Iraqi
officials by the Special Commission constitutes a gross violation
of its obligations under resolutions 687, 707 and 715," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council will continue to consider how best to ensure
Iraq's full compliance," it added.

<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that Egypt would not remove its Scud missiles unless
all other countries in the Middle East do the same.
</P>
<P>
In an open dialogue with university students in Egypt's port
city of Alexandria, Mubarak said that Egypt's possession of these
missiles does not violate any international treaty.
</P>
<P>
Israel possesses missiles with a far longer range, he argued.
</P>
<P>
He criticized what he called an anti-Egyptian foreign media
campaign that demands Egyptian removal of its missiles.
</P>
<P>
The president once again called for freeing the Middle East
from all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries, particularly Egypt, have urged Israel to join
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Jewish state is
widely believed to be the only country in the Middle East that
possesses nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Chance for Better Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The chance for the
international community to deal with the humanitarian and
political crises in Somalia seems to be very slim even after the
death of General Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Only three weeks after the death of General Aidid who has been
well known for his role against the United Nations, his
successor, Hussein Mohamed Aidid has contested the way his father
did and reminded the UN and other international agencies that his
supporters will not accept political intervention or humanitarian
activities mixed with politics as he put it.
</P>
<P>
The way Hussein Aidid responded to the UN has shocked many
Somalis and hopeful donor countries. The response of Hussein
Aidid was also criticized by some of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, there are many Somalis who would like to
see again the international community fully committed to the six
years long crises of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
From the better living warlords and their well-fed militiamen
to the ordinary citizens and deep to the neglected disabled
communities of Somalia, the humanitarian situation in the country
is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The warlords are calling for a foreign financial presence in
the country so that they remain being capable of feeding their
militiamen and keeping the clannish skirmishes continue, while
the ordinary people need some way of earning their bread.
</P>
<P>
When the warlords need US Dollars 100,000 for each day's clan
fighting expenses, two ordinary families need Somali Shillings
100,000 (about 15 US Dollars ) per day.
</P>
<P>
From early in the morning at six, you receive visiting beggars
knocking your door every 10 minutes. Streams of the beggars go
the main Bakara market to check their chance of getting one
mouthful of bread. Some do not even make to the market as they
fall in the streets and meet their death on the spot.
</P>
<P>
"There's no more Aidid, let the world step down here for the
last time to rescue our starving people," said another Somali
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed who never opposed to the world
community.
</P>
<P>
Since the power left behind by General Aidid has been
inherited by his son Hussein Aidid, the chance for a better
relation with the international community remains uncertain.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Lawmakers Charged With Election Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Twenty South Korean incumbent
lawmakers were today formally referred by the Central Election
Management Commission (CEMC) to the prosecution for alleged fraud
in the April National Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
The CEMC discussed the action to be taken against 3,568 people
associated with suspected election law violations involving 1,096
of the 1,309 candidates in the elections.
</P>
<P>
It decided that 109 violators will be charged, 231 others will
be subject to investigations by law enforcement authorities and
the remaining 3,228 will be given warnings or admonitions.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent lawmakers to be prosecuted include 13 from the
ruling New Korea Party (NKP) including former NKP Chairman Kim
Yoon-whan, three from the main opposition National Congress for
New Politics (NCNP), two from the conservative opposition United
Liberal Democrats (ULD), one from the minor opposition Democratic
Party (DP) as well as one independent.
</P>
<P>
Of the 20 lawmakers, nine are direct targets of investigations,
while another nine are indirectly involved through their campaign
accounting officers (who are also direct targets of
investigations) and the remaining two through their campaign
managers.
</P>
<P>
In the worst case scenario, the nine legislators directly
involved could lose their parliamentary seats and be deprived of
the right to elected office for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Those indirectly involved may also have their elections
nullified if their campaign managers or campaign accountants are
convicted of a crime severe enough.
</P>
<P>
The CEMC found that 1,096 candidates, or 79 percent of all the
candidates who ran in the April parliament elections, violated the
election law in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a total of 420 officials from the four political
parties which took part in the election were found to have
violated the law and the CEMC has asked the prosecution to look

<P>
Under law, the prosecution must determine whether or not the
alleged violators will be indicted or not by the October 11 legal
deadline because the period of limitations for public action for
election violations is six months after the parliamentary election

In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11 this year, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim

</P>
<P>
However, the NKP later lured into its fold 12 opposition and

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Croatia Sign Normalization Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Croatia, the two
most powerful states in the region, signed a landmark
normalization agreement here today, paving the way for a lasting
peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic and his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic was a
historic event in ending the five-year-long hostilities between
the two countries, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic relations between Yugoslavia
and Croatia was important for peace and stability in the Balkans
and also crucial for solving the former Yugoslav crisis, Yugoslav
Prime Minister Radoje Kontic said when meeting with Granic.
</P>
<P>
Granic said that mutual recognition would help solve the
territorial disputes between the two countries if not all the
problems existing between them.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hoped that the pact would also allow the safe and
free return of Croatian Serb refugees.
</P>
<P>
The way to the normalization was paved by Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic and his Croatian counterpart Franjo Tudjman on
August 7 in Athens, Greece, where they held their first
face-to-face meeting to discuss the normalization issue since the
war broke out in former Yugoslavia in the summer of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia have been strained
since the Croatian Serbs and the Croats fought a six-month war in
Croatia in 1991 when Croatia tried to gain independence from
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement signed last December, Yugoslavia and
Croatia have started to seek ways to normalizing their ties, which
would benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of Yugoslav-Croatian relations was expected
to help solve the issue of the last Serb enclave of Eastern
Slavonia bordering Yugoslavia and improve economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries as well.
</P>
<P>
It would also help settle the disputes over the strategically
important Prevlaka peninsula on the southern tip of Croatia, the
legal succession to the former Yugoslav assets and the protection
of Serb refugees trying to return to Croatia, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Compete with Europeans in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A silent competition is going on
between U.S. and European companies to win contracts in Lebanon,
which has become one of the most important markets in the Middle
East due to the government's multi-billion-dollar reconstruction
plan.
</P>
<P>
Activities of the American businessmen in Lebanon are
restricted by a travel ban imposed by the U.S. government upon its
citizens on the grounds that the security of the U.S. interests
are still threatened by the presence of Islamic extremists in this
country.
</P>
<P>
The ban was enforced in the middle of 1980s following a series
of terrorist attacks at American targets amid the climax of
Lebanon's civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Since Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction was launched by the
billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri at the end of 1992,
European companies have strengthened their positions in this
market at the cost of their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Major projects were captured by European, particular French,
German and Finnish, contractors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government argued that the head start of the Europeans
in Lebanon was a revenge for the U.S. gains in the aftermath of
the 1991 Gulf war. U.S. companies were given most of the
reconstruction projects in Kuwait after the war.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. investors disagreeed with the argument and have
pressed with futility for a lift of the travel ban to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, a penetration was made when Motorola company won a
contract from the private sector to complete the cellular network
in the country, and it was even widened when one of American
petroleum companies succeeded in entering the project of
modernizing the Tripoli oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the most remarkable competition was in the
aeroplane market after the Lebanese flag-carrier airlines decided
to upgrade its fleet comprising 16 planes and intentionally
expressed its interest in Airbus.
</P>
<P>
The American Boeing Company is trying hard to persuade the
state-run Middle East Airlines (MEA) to buy Boeings, informing
the Lebanese government its readiness to sell the planes with
favorable prices and the way of payment chosen by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is also one of those American major companies which
have launched a large-scale campaign lobbying the
Clinton Administration to lift the travel ban, complaining that
no effects have been derived from it but damages to the American
companies' interests.

<HEADLINE> Russian, Chechen Troop Chiefs Meet on New Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The commander of Russian troops
in Chechnya today met with Chechen separatist chief of staff Aslan
Maskhadov on a new peace accord, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Russian General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov today flew to the
southern village of Novy Atagi to review the details of the accord
on disengagement of the Russian troops and Chechen rebels in
Grozny and the withdrawal of Russian forces from southern mountain
regions, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tikhomirov and Maskhadov would discuss the route and timing of
Russian troops' pullout from the Vedeno, Nozhai Yurt and Shatoi
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Russian general was also expected to raise the question of
Chechen separatists' continuing encirclement of Russian troops in
two areas of Grozny, which he said had violated the ceasefire
accord.
</P>
<P>
A day ago, Russian national security chief Alexander Lebed and
Maskhadov agreed on a ceasefire covering all of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Lebed is planning to return to the Caucasus republic Saturday
when both sides will continue talks on a political settlement of
the 20-month war in the breakaway republic, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Foreign Minister Arrives in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda arrived here this morning on a two-day working
visit to Syria, the second leg of his current five-nation Mideast
tour.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al Sharaa at
Damascus airport, where he said that his country was trying its
best "on the political and economic levels" to promote Mideast
peace.
</P>
<P>
"We stress the significance of the peace process and we
strongly desire to help push it forward," Ikeda said upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
Syrian official sources here said that the Japanese Foreign
Minister will meet with top Syrian leaders on the Mideast peace
process and business opportunities. Ikeda will also visit the
Japanese unit in the UN disengagement force.
</P>
<P>
Syrian political analysts believe that Ikeda's Middle East tour
aims at boosting Japan's political and economic involvements in
the Middle East, where the peace process faces new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that the peace process might suffer setbacks
after the right-wing Likud Party came to power in Israel in June.
In this case, Japan"s oil imports from the region might be
affected.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Minister had stressed during his visit to
Cairo that Japan's stance focused on the importance of adherence
and implementation of all obligations, agreements and principles
already agreed upon as pillars of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda stayed in Egypt for three days before he flew here. His
Mideast tour will also take him to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Japan heavily depends on oil imports from the Mideast
countries. This has prompted Tokyo to contribute to the peace in
the region. Some 45 Japanese soldiers have been serving with a
1000-strong U.N. disengagement Observation Force in this country
since February.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans University Campus Unionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The federal military government
of Nigeria today slammed a final ban on unionism in the nation's
universities by proscribing all the three major unions in the
campuses.
</P>
<P>
The authorities dissolved their executive councils at all
levels and forfeited their assets and properties to the
government.
</P>
<P>
A source in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, told Xinhua today that
the action follows an amendment of a government decree in 1993
which puts to an end the existence of the Academic Staff Union of
Universities (ASUU), the Non Academical Staff Union and the
Senior Staff Association.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued in Abuja today, the Chief Press
Secretary to the head of state, David Attah, explained that the
government took these actions to give legal backing to end
unpleasant developments in the Nigerian university system.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that since September 1992 when the ASUU
concluded an agreement with the federal government to end their
strike, several steps have been taken to improve service for
university staff, providing more facilities and teaching aids.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, the government regrets that
despite its positive response to problem militating against the
university system, campuses have known no peace as there have
been endless strike actions by both academic and non-academic
staff, making this drastic intervention inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Birds of Prey Flocking Back in Record Numbers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Some of Britain's rarest birds of
prey, many once close to extinction, are flourishing as they have
not for more than two decades, a report published today in the
journal, British Birds, said.
</P>
<P>
Honey buzzards, marsh harriers, Montagu's harriers, red kites
and ospreys are more numerous than at any time during the past 22
years since ornithologists began collecting detailed records.
</P>
<P>
The honey buzzard, a summer visitor to Britain that feeds on
bees and wasps, numbered up to 28 breeding pairs in England and
Scotland in 1994, compared with two pairs ten years earlier.
</P>
<P>
There were 111 pairs of breeding red kites in Wales, up from 33
in 1984, and 28 pairs in England and Scotland, where they were
reintroduced in 1989 after becoming extinct.
</P>
<P>
Of the 111 red kite pairs in Wales, 70 bred successfully and
reared 90 young, both record totals, the Rare Breeding Birds Panel
said in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
The panel, consisting of members of the British Trust for
Ornithology and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,
collates and analyses data gathered from all over Britain.

<HEADLINE> Early Release for Inmates in UK after Sentence Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of prisoners are facing
imminent release from jail because of a legal blunder over the way
in which the Prison Service has been calculating sentences for
almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 prisoners in the 138 jails in England and Wales are
also likely to have their release dates brought forward after an
urgent review by prison governors of sentence lengths, the Times
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that prisoners could receive 95 pounds (147 dollars) a
day in compensation for the blunder. The bill for the taxpayer
could thus run into millions of pounds.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Michael Howard, Britain's interior minister,
said "Those who have been affected and have been kept in prison
for longer than they should have been might well be entitled to
compensation."
</P>
<P>
The disclosure is a damaging blow to the Prison Service, where
morale has been low since the breakouts from Parkhurst and
Whitemoor top-security jails and strong criticisms in official
inquiries into both incidents.
</P>
<P>
It is also a serious embarrassment to Michael Howard during his
summer offensive aimed at highlighting the Government's record on
law and order and its efforts to curb crime.
</P>
<P>
A legal challenge brought by inmates last year led to a ruling
by Britain's Court of Appeal that the Prison Service was
miscalculating the time due to be served by many prisoners given
consecutive sentences for a number of offences.
</P>
<P>
For instance, a prisoner who spent a month in a remand centre
before trial, and was then given three consecutive sentences,
should have the total period he had to serve in jail reduced by
three months, not one, it ruled.
</P>
<P>
Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National
Association of Probation Officers, said that "the sudden release
of prisoners has meant that rehabilitation plans have been hit and
there is great concern at what will happen to these people if they
do not have help."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the event, the Guardian newspaper said "mass
prison release is the one headline Michael Howard must have wanted
to avoid as the Conservative Party conference approaches. But if
errors have been made, inmates should have been informed about
them. they have a legal right to compensation."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Iran of Violating Its Sovereignty by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today accused Iran of
violating its sovereignty and international norms by shelling
residential quarters in the Kurds-controlled northern Iraq in
support of one of the two fighting factions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) said that fightings between two
Kurdish rivals of Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) continued in the cities of Iraqi Kurdish
area where various kind of weapons were used.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian artillery started destructive bombardment of the
residential quarters in Qaseri, Choman, Galala and Haj Omran, INA
said.
</P>
<P>
It reported that the Iranian bombardment in support of the
attack of Jalal al-Talabani, head of PUK, targeted the village of
Sedikan and inflicted considerable damages on residential houses
and public properties of the Kurds. More than 100 people have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian government proves once more its violation of
Iraq's sovereignty and its surpassing over the good neighborliness
and international norms as well as its illegitimate cooperation
with the 'outlawed Kurdish gangs,'" INA concluded.
</P>
<P>
There are frequent fightings between the two warring Kurdish
factions after the 1991 Gulf war. Since then the Kurdish people
in northern Iraq have been outside the control of Iraqi government
and protected by U.S.-led forces stationed in southern Turkey.

MAPUTO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 644,000 Mozambican
children have no access to school this year because of lack of
education facilities, according to Mozambican Minister of
Education Arnaldo Nhavotso.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique Information Agency today quoted the minister as
saying the southern African country needs to build or rebuild
3304 primary schools for those school-age children.
</P>
<P>
Education facilities were seriously damaged during the
country's 16-year civil war, which ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.756 million children aged six to 10 studying in
all the 5,886 primary schools of the country. Mozambican schools
enrolled only 1.345 million pupils of the same ages in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Receives Clinton's Message on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
received today a message from U.S. President Bill Clinton, which
reaffirmed U.S. support for the Middle East peace process,
according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by the U.S. Charge D'affaires to Gaza
during a meeting with Arafat Thursday night, MENA quoted Arafat's
advisor Nabil Abourdeneh as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Clinton also reiterated U.S. commitment to
making efforts to reach agreements satisfactory to both the
Palestinian and Israeli sides, Abourdeneh said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the policy of the Palestinian Authority in
tackling the various political problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
The message was a reply to a letter Arafat sent to Clinton last
week, in which Arafat talked about the perils threatening the
peace process, especially the Israeli plans to expand settlements
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Arafat asked Clinton to put pressure on Israel
to advance the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He complained about Israeli plans for settlement expansion, its
failure to withdraw troops from the West Bank town of Hebron and
its delay in opening a safe passage between Gaza Strip and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Arafat met with former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres to discuss the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres told reporters after the meeting that Israel should keep
its promises to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I feel deeply obliged that every promise we made on behalf of
the government, on behalf of the Israeli people, must be
respected."
</P>
<P>
"I shall do whatever I can _ not as the government, but as the
head of the opposition, to support the peace process."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Arafat said, "Peace is not only a Palestinian
need. It is a Palestinian need, an Israeli need and an
international need, and we have to protect it."
</P>
<P>
Peres also warned that (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu's policies could unite the Arab world once again against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is in a difficult situation. This government is
giving them an alternative to peace," he said. "That is a
dangerous alternative _ a unified Arab front against us."

<P>
ANKARA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Albania are expected
to hold a joint military exercise in the Adriatic Sea off the
coast of Albania from August 25 to 31.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the Turkish Office of the Chief of
General Staff said that three Albanian warships (including a mine
sweeper and two torpedo ships) and the Turgut Reis, one of the
best frigates in the Turkish Navy, will take part in the military
exercise, dubbed Mares-96.
</P>

The statement said that Turkey would provide military aid and
assistance to Albania, adding that the training will include
naval operations, on board fire fighting techniques and rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will be monitored by foreign military attaches
in Albania and officers from NATO.
</P>
<P>
This week, Albanian deputy Chief of General Staff Major
General Armando Vincani came to Turkey to meet with top
military officials for an exchange of views on military matters.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Agrees to Harmonize Customs Tariffs With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
today agreed to harmonize its customs duties with mainland
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by the Tanzanian Ministry of
Finance said the Zanzibar government has allowed Tanzania Revenue
Authority (TRA) and Preshipment Inspection Company (PIC) to
operate in the isle.
</P>
<P>
"The harmonization of customs tariffs between the isle and the
mainland, following talks between Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa and Zanzibar President Salmin Amour, would kill the
notorious Zanzibar Route," said a senior official from the
Tanzanian Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Trade through the Zanzibar Route is said to be denying
Tanzania's union government about 10 million U.S. Dollars every
month through non-payment of import duty and other taxes of goods
brought to the mainland via Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar government, however, requested that a Zanzibari
be given a senior position in the isles, and special tariffs be
imposed on cooking oil, sugar, rice and wheat flour for the
purposes of making them affordable to the people of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
"To benefit the low-income Zanzibar people, the Zanzibar
authorities put a proposal that the essential commodities -
sugar, rice, wheat flour, cooking oil and khaga - should be
given special treatment while harmonizing the tariffs," he said.

<P>
ANKARA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are underway to
remove the wreckage of the EgyptAir passenger plane which skidded
off the runway of the Ataturk Airport Wednesday and came to remain
on the Yesilkoy-Florya motorway, the state-run TV station reported
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-707 passenger plane, which broke through protective
barriers and hit a taxi after its landing on a flight from Cairo,
has caused major traffic congestion on the motorway.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were injured when the airplane overshot the
runway and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
In order to open the road completely, the tail of the airplane
will be cut away immediately and the 15 tons of fuel that were on
the wings of the aircraft have been removed.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, Mohamed Fahim Rayyan, chairman of national carrier
EgyptAir, told reporters Thursday that the control tower should
have allocated the plane another runway instead of the one the
plane landed on.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said: "The one it landed on is 2,250 meters long
while the other one is more than 3,000 meters long and is less
steep."

<HEADLINE> Omani FM Urges Israel to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Omani Foreign Minister Yusef
Ben-Alawi today called on Israel to speed up the peace talks with
its Arab partners on the basis of the already-signed accords and
land--for-peace principle as well as relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. Security Council resolutions provide for
Israeli pull-out from the Arab territories occupied by the Jewish
state in 1967, the Omani News Agency monitored here reported.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the current stalemate of the Middle East peace
process to the hardline Israeli hardline government which came to
power after the general elections on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The Omani minister urged Israel to take the first step to
revive the peace process and implement the accords signed by the
previous Israeli government and the Arab partners.
</P>
<P>
He renewed his country's commitment to the resolutions of the
Arab summit on June 22-23. The next meeting of the Arab foreign
ministers, which is scheduled to be held in Cairo next month, will
deal with the issue of the peace process in the region, Ben-Alawi
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Arab states do not like to go back to the period of
confrontation with Israel or the boycotting of it, "but we seek to
go ahead with the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Omani Foreign Ministry has signed an agreement with its
Israeli counterpart on opening trade representation offices in
Israel and Oman.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "this matter hinges on the progress of the
implementation of the land-for-peace principle and the relevant
U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
As for the "Lebanon First" proposal, offered by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ben-Alawi said Israel faces many
problems in south Lebanon and tries to find a way out.
</P>
<P>
"However, all indications point out that separation of the
Israeli-Lebanese track from other major Israeli-Arab tracks in the
peace process is impossible," he added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Praises Lebed's Peace Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today praised national security chief Alexander
Lebed for his successful efforts in stopping the bloodshed in
Chechnya, a source in the government said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Lebed by telephone, Chernomyrdin congratulated him
on the first successful efforts and described them as "only the
first step."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that these efforts should be consolidated and that
the political aspect of the Chechen settlement should be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Lebed, back to Moscow from Chechnya where he signed
a truce agreement with Chechen rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov,
was going to report directly to President Boris Yeltsin about the
results of his mission.
</P>
<P>
However, a source in the Kremlin said that Yeltsin did not plan
a meeting with Lebed, secretary of the Russian Security Council
and his special envoy to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expects Lebed to present a written report on his
two-day Chechnya trip concerning the settlement of the Chechnya
crisis and on a cease-fire and disengagement agreement, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire accord signed by Lebed and Maskhadov Thursday
evening after eight hours of talks near the Chechen capital of
Grozny, went into effect at noon today.
</P>
<P>
But the situation in Grozny remained extremely difficult at
midday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Moscow early this morning, Lebed told
reporters that he expected to meet Yeltsin today to inform him
about the agreements signed in Chechnya "if nothing goes wrong."
</P>
<P>
"I shall return (to Chechnya) in two days to sign a joint
document on our relations with Chechnya. This will be a political
document," Lebed said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a presidential decree on Chechnya of August
14, Lebed was vested with broad powers, such as "taking operative
decisions concerning the settlement of the crisis, controlling
their implementation, taking decisions on employing and sacking
federal officials, servicemen and police officers to the rank of
deputy minister inclusive."

<HEADLINE> Canada OKs Mercury Fillings for Most People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Health Department of Canada
has said that dental fillings containing mercury don't make
Canadians sick even though medical evidence about them isn't
ironclad.
</P>
<P>
After years of study, the department has decided to defend in
most cases the continued use of of the silver-colored fillings, or
dental amalgam, that includes a mixture of metals including
mercury.
</P>
<P>
"A total ban on amalgam is not considered justified," local
media reports quoted an official with the department as saying.
</P>
<P>
There have been no conclusive studies proving amalgam is safe,
but there is also no evidence it poses a significant risk for most
people, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
To be safe, the department recommends that dentists consider
using other kinds of fillings in the primary teeth of young
children.
</P>
<P>
Women shouldn't have amalgam fillings installed or removed
during pregnancy, although there is no evidence that existing
fillings pose a significant risk to the fetus, he added.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Germany, Denmark and Sweden are moving to
phase out or ban the use of amalgam, according to the reports.

<HEADLINE> French Leftwing Bitterly Condemns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- French leftwing parties, the Green
party, trade unions, humanitarian groups and some Catholic priests
today bitterly condemned the violent expulsion of some 300 African
paperless immigrants from the Saint-Bernard Church by police this
morning.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people went to the street this afternoon in
Paris to condemn the rightwing government for using violence to
expel and detain the immigrants. Some demonstrators called for the
resignation of interior minister Jean-Louis Debre and the
abolition of the Pasqua immigration law.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were held in other major French cities
including Strasbourg, Toulouse, Grenoble, Lille, Dijon, Marseille,
Orleans and Montpellier. A major demonstration is planned to be
held in Lyon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
National secretary of the French Communist Party Robert Hue,
Socialist Party leaders Martine Aubry and Francois Hollande, the
leader of the powerful Confederation Generale du Travail Louis
Viannet, Professor Albert Jacquart and Bishop Jacques Gaillot
joined the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators started from the Republique square in eastern
Paris and ended their march at the Nation square in the southeast
of the city.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is inacceptable. Mr. Juppe has chosen
violence against the weak. Today it is the paperless, but who will
be the next tomorrow? The salary-owners, the farmers, the
unemployed who refuse the policy of social disaster of Mr. Juppe?"
said Hue.
</P>
<P>
Aubry said that the protest was launched out of "a coup of
emotion" and showed how angry people were towards today's
expulsion. He said he was deeply worried about the fate of the
paperless who are being detained in an administrative center
outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
"This cannot last long. The government of Vichy (collaborators)
in 1943 also applied its law. But above the law of the state,
there is a human law," said Professor Jacquart.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Gaillot said that "oppression can solve nothing. The
fight will continue with other paperless immigrants who will go
out of the dark to manifest in their turn."
</P>
<P>
Jack Ralite, a former government minister from the Communist
Party, said that "the debate on immigration in the whole of
Europe should be approached with humanism. We will finally end it
by abolishing the Pasqua law."
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held a black coffin with the words "Human
Rights" written on it, and some placards which said "Le Pen
dreamed about it, Chirac, Juppe and Debre did it."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the humanitarian group Medecin du Monde (MDM), whose
doctors had taken care of the paperless in the church in the past
two months, accused police of "brutality" when expelling the
paperless this morning.
</P>
<P>
The group also denounced the forcible evacuation of the 10
paperless hunger strikers to military hospitals by the government.
</P>
<P>
"Although the military hospitals have proved their
professional qualities and ethics in the past, we should recall
that these hospitals directly depend on the military hierarchy and
thus its political decisions," said MDM.

GENEVA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's three leading banks
reported overall profits of over 2.76 billion Swiss francs (some
2.3 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The new total profits of the three banking giants -- the Swiss
Union Bank (UBS), the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBS) and the CS

The UBS saw its first-half-year profits expanded by 32.7
percent to 1.1 billion francs (917 million dollars), while the
SBS's profits grew by 33.8 percent to 720 million francs (600
million dollars). The CS registered a profit expansion of 26
percent, to 940 million francs (783 million dollars).

According to the press reports, most of the Swiss Big Three's
profits came from their international deals in shares, bonds,
futures, interest rates, and most notably, asset management.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest list of rankings of the world's top 500

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) has completed the destruction of some 400 tons of
ammunition which the Bosnian Serbs illegally stored in a former
school house, an IFOR spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Lt. colonel Max Marriner said that the demolition, which
started Monday, was completed Thursday and the IFOR engineers have
started the cleanup work at the destruction pits where the small
arms and mines were blown up.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR discovered the cache at Margetici, a village some 45
kilometers east of Sarajevo, on August 5. Since the ammunition
depot had not been reported to the IFOR in violation of the Dayton
peace accord, the IFOR seized it last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although Bosnian Serbs have raised complaints and even threats,
they did not interfere with Operation Volcano as the IFOR
demolition mission was code-named. At the height of the operation,
2,500 IFOR soldiers were working or guarding in the Margetici
area.

<HEADLINE> US General: Russian Nuclear Forces Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's development of
nuclear weapons is facing some troubles and the number of its
nuclear warheads is likely to drop to about 3,500 by 2005
whether it ratifies the U.S.-Russia START-II treaty or not.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made today by General Eugene Habiger,
commander of U.S. nuclear forces, while meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Russia was developing four new nuclear
weapons but only one of them, the SS-27 single-warhead
intercontinental ballistic missile, was going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"The other three are not," Habiger said without giving details.
</P>
<P>
The general predicted that Russia's efforts to develop a new
submarine-launched nuclear missile, a nuclear missile-firing
submarine and a nuclear cruise missile were not proceeding "as
quickly as you would have seen 10 years ago."
</P>
<P>
"Even if they developed those systems, there wouldn't be the
capability, the dollars, the resources to bring up their force
structure... that's going to just run out of shelf life or
capability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START-II), both
the United States and Russia should reduce their nuclear weapons
to between 3,000 and 3,500 each by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian PM on Ties With Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi today criticized Sudan for refusing to extradite
fundamentalist terrorists to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"The extradition of the alleged terrorists sheltered in Sudan
is our assurance that the Sudanese government would never again
indulge in such sinister act of terrorism," Meles told a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"But the Sudanese government has still refused to abide by the
international decision that it extradite to Ethiopia the alleged
terrorists and as such there is no reason for the improvement of
our relations," said the Ethiopian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to military action recently taken by the Ethiopian
Defense Force against the multi-national fundamentalist group,
Meles said it was only a partial solution of the problem.
</P>
<P>
"In order to dry it up from the source it is imperative that a
preventive action with full participation of the general public
should be taken, that we are prepared to safeguard ourselves from
any terrorist attack," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has no special relation with any country of the
world. Our relations with all countries is based on our national
interest," said Meles, adding that Ethiopia would maintain good
relations "with all its friends far and near."

<HEADLINE> College Board: US Students Improve SAT Scores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. high school students
have improved their study by gaining a two-decade best math score
and a satisfactory verbal score last year, following more rigorous
courses of study after the nation was alerted at "risk" in
education in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), which is considered a
crucial barometer of student skills, last year, the average
mathematics scores increased two points to 508 and the average
scores on the verbal part last year was still far from returning
to the 1972 level of 630 points. It showed a continuing
improvement.
</P>
<P>
"This seems to indicate that the nation is less at risk than it
was in 1983," said Donald Stewart, president of the College Board.
He referred to the 1983 Department of Education report, "A nation
at Risk," which sharply criticized American education as the SAT
scores declined sharply in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The 1983 alert prompted many reforms. Emphasis was renewed on
core academic subjects. College Board officials credit the
continuing improvement to the increased portion of high school
students taking more years of college-preparatory courses. Last
year, 41 percent of test takers reported they had taken 20 or more
year-long, academic courses in high school, up from 34 percent a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the class of graduating seniors -- the class that is
just entering college -- has taken more honors courses and more
calculus, chemistry, physics and other academic courses.
</P>
<P>
Some educational experts said that the improvement in math
scores was the result of investment in math and science courses in
recent years. Beginning in 1978, the National Science Foundation
has pumped billions of dollars into the math and science
curriculum throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The College Board, meanwhile, noted that the verbal part of the
two-part test improved more slowly, remaining far below what it
was 20 years ago. In 1972, the average verbal scores reached 530
points.
</P>
<P>
Educators blamed the slower progress on fewer students taking
four years of high school English, more who speak English as the
second language, and more time spent watching television and less
reading.
</P>
<P>
College Board officials said, English was the only area where
students had not increased their studies in recent years. The
proportion of students with four or more years of study fell to 84
percent last year from 88 percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also attributed the slow improvement in verbal test
to less investment in the area.
</P>
<P>
The SAT results showed that white students gained the highest
scores in verbal test among all the ethnic groups, with an average
of 526 points in the last test largely because of their native
language of English.
</P>
<P>
But Asian-American students received the highest marks of 558
points in math, 35 points more than their follow-up group of white
students.
</P>
<P>
Black students remained the lowest mark group in both the
verbal and math tests, averaging their scores of 434 in verbal and
422 in math.

<HEADLINE> Unusual Asteroid-Like Object Moves Like Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have discovered a
unique and baffling object that may be either an unusual asteroid
or an extinct comet, according to a report from NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
</P>
<P>
The object, designated 1996 PW, was detected by astronomers
using data from the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program.
Puzzled scientists are still striving to understand exactly what
object it is and where it came from.
</P>
<P>
"This is a misfit in the grand scheme of things," said Eleanor
Helin, a planetary astronomer at the JPL and the NEAT Principal
Investigator.
</P>
<P>
At a first look, the object with a diameter of eight to 16
kilometers appears to be an asteroid, Ms. Helin said, but unlike
most typical asteroids, it has a highly elongated, comet-like
orbit that stretches into the vast outer reaches of the Solar
System far beyond Neptune and Pluto.
</P>
<P>
Although 1996 PW has an orbit resembling a long-period comet,
no gaseous emissions or other normally expected comet-like
activity such as a dust coma have been observed, even during its
current closest approach to the Sun, Scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers studying the object believe that it was once an
active comet, but is now inert, either because its ice and gases
have been stripped away or because it is covered and insulated by
a crust of non-volatile materials.

<HEADLINE> US: Iraqi Kurdish Factions Agree to Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said in a
statement today that the two warring Iraqi Kurdish factions agreed
to a cease-fire after six days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said the
agreement was reached between Massoud Barzani, leader of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Jalal Talabani, leader of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, following U.S. direct contact with
both of them.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement came hours after the Kurdistan Democratic
Party claimed it had repelled an attack by thousands of Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan fighters and inflicted heavy losses on its
rival. But the Patriotic Union refuted the claims.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the two leaders "have agreed to return their forces
to the positions held before the current fighting began" on August
17.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to meet with U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Pelletreau in September to seek reconciliation,
Davies added.
</P>
<P>
He gave no venue or precise date for the September meeting, but
the United States had already called on the two leaders to hold
peace talks in London.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Seeks Swiss Help in Gold Smuggling Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is seeking legal
help from Switzerland in a bid to stem the massive smuggling of
gold stolen from its gold mines and laundering of the profits
through the Swiss banking system, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Lausanne-based Swiss Supreme Court is reportedly expected
to rule on South Africa's request for legal assistance in the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Import of gold ingots in Switzerland, the second biggest gold
trading center after London, amounts to over 1 billion U.S.
dollars a year and is virtually unrestricted, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to a South African lawyer, about 90 percent of the
gold stolen in a minute amount from the country's gold mines ends
up in Switzerland. It is collected by local operatives, melted
into ingots and smuggled out of the country.
</P>
<P>
South African authorities said that the smuggling of illegally
obtained gold by international crime syndicates was costing the
country some 300 million dollars a year in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lausanne newspaper Nouveau Quotidien, much of
the stolen gold is airfreighted to Geneva and processed by a
gold-smelting company in the northwestern Swiss city of Neuchatel.
</P>
<P>
But Swiss legal experts said that because of the adeptness of
the gold-smuggling syndicates at covering their tracks, it was
hard to prove to what extent the legally processed gold in
Switzerland involved illegally obtained gold.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Mixed, London Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
finished mixed today, with British share prices surging strongly
to their third record high this week after having breached the
3,900 barrier for the first time.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares had peaked at 3,911.6, up 20.5 points earlier in
the day before closing 16 points higher as the market failed to
succumb to losses on Wall Street and weakness in gilts.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market was sparked by British rate cut
hopes following the German Bundesbank's move Thursday and that the
next big target of the market was 4,000 points.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt bourse ended 2.10 points down as stocks suffered
during the day, dragged down by profit-taking. A lower dollar also
dulled investors' interest.
</P>
<P>
French shares closed slightly higher today after spending most
of the day being dragged down by profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said that there were still too many uncertainties to
really start buying French shares as Prime Minister Alain Juppe
will meet President Jacques Chirac during the weekend to discuss
budget and tax cut details.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index closed 16.4 points up at a record
3,907.5. Frankfurt's DAX-30 shares ended down 2.10 at 2,555.16.
Paris's CAC-40 index finished up 3.06 at 2,020.82.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reassures Arafat on Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
delivered a letter today to Yasser Arafat, reassuring the
Palestinian leader of the U.S commitment to the Middle East peace
process, the White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated the United States' readiness to continue its
support for "the Palestinian people and the peace process" in the
letter, which was carried to Arafat by Charge d'Affaires Jack
Wales.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's message came after Arafat wrote to the White House
last week, expressing his concerns that Israel's hardline Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not serious about implementing the
Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjiorn Goal said today that Norway
will sent its 22-person observer team home from Hebron unless
Israel goes ahead with a troops redeployment from the West Bank
city as agreed on in the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Fatouh, deputy director of the Palestinian diplomatic
office in Washington, said, "(Arafat) told Clinton about the
current situation in the region and asked him to tell the Israeli
government that it should execute (peace) agreements signed by the
previous government."
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that Netanyahu is not serious about
implementing the agreements that Israel promised to abide by. If
the process falters, it is going to endanger peace in the whole
region," Fatouh said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has since his assuming power in June refused to meet
with Arafat and to pull out the troops in Hebron under the pretext
of Israeli security.

<HEADLINE> French Protestants Urge Paperless Immigrants' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred French protestants
arrived tonight at the retention center in Vincennes east of Paris
where 210 African paperless immigrants are being detained, urging
the government to release the paperless immediately.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who refused to disperse after arriving at
the Nation square in southeast Paris at the end of a large-scale
demonstration this evening, continued their march towards the
retention center.
</P>
<P>
A large number of police were deployed outside the center, who
were confronted by the demonstrators who shouted, "Free the
paperless."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SOS Racism organization called on all French
associations and organizations to prepare for a nationwide
demonstration to call for the abolition of the Pasqua immigration
law.
</P>
<P>
Fode Sylla, president of SOS-Racism, said in a communique that
the success of the demonstration in Paris this afternoon showed
that the government "had failed in its attempt of intimidation."
</P>
<P>
He said that the organization will "multiply in the coming days
the operations of solidarity with the paperless."
</P>
<P>
Emergency Sick Foreigners in Danger, an association which is
membered by several humanitarian organizations including the
National Committee Against Double Punishment, Medecins du Monde
and Information on AIDS, sent an open letter to President Jacques
Chirac expressing its dismay and disagreement with the expulsion
of the paperless this morning.
</P>
<P>
The association also presented to the president a draft law on
the protection of foreigners who are ill in France, asking Chirac
to have it discussed at the next session of parliament.

ZAGREB, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian Airlines will start
next Monday regular commercial flights from Zagreb to Sarajevo,
the company said today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the company said that there would be four
flights a week in September, while everyday flights would be
introduced in winter.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Airlines had scheduled to fly regular flights last
week immediately after the Sarajevo airport reopened, but the
airliner had to keep its plan on hold because of a certain dispute
with NATO peacekeeping forces which still control the Bosnian sky.
</P>
<P>
The Croatia Airlines may cancel flight to Sarajevo if bad
weather prevents landing at the Sarajevo airport, the airliner

<HEADLINE> Main Muslim Party Threatens Boycott of Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Action Party
(SDA), the Muslim-led ruling party in Bosnia, said today that it
would reconsider its participation in the upcoming elections if
its requirements were not met.
</P>
<P>
An SDA statement said that the party demanded that the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is in
charge of the elections, cancel voting on the basis of a so-called
P-2 form, which allows refugees or displaced persons to choose
places of voting.
</P>
<P>
The demand is apparently in response to reports that Serb
authorities have mobilized refugees to register in Brcko in order
to outnumber Muslims in such strategically important areas.
</P>
<P>
The SDA also required that municipal elections, which are
feared to only legalize the participation of Bosnia, be postponed.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Halid Ganjac, chairman of the SDA general
board, as saying that his party would meet Sunday to reach a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
"Unless these demands are met, the SDA will not reconsider its
participation in the September elections," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes Efforts by Cypriots to Contain Unrest </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
welcomed the efforts of both sides in the Cyprus conflict to
contain the unrest which flared up last week on this divided
island state.
</P>
<P>
"The good news out of Cyprus of course just recently is that
the troubles that we saw over the last week seem to be over,"
State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The conflict flared up last week when two Greek Cypriots were
killed by Turkish Cypriot security forces during a Greek Cypriot
demonstration in the buffer zone, a 120-mile "green line"
separating Turkish and Greek Cypriots living in the island from
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
As the conflict came to be fading away, Davies said it was
"absolutely a positive development." And he called on both sides
to work hard to "prevent individuals not authorized to do so from
entering the buffer zone."
</P>
<P>
Davies admitted that there are "no developments" in the U.S.
diplomatic efforts to get the two sides to hold talks to resolve
their long-standing differences.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav FM: Normalization Accord, Historic Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The just signed agreement on
the normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia was
a "historic step for both countries," Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Milan Milutinovic said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed here this afternoon by the Yugoslav
foreign minister and his Croatian counterpart, Mate Granic, "is
also very important for the Balkan region as a whole," Milutinovic
told a joint press conference with Granic after the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his Croatian
counterpart, Franjo Tudjman, reached an agreement on August 7 in
Athens to normalize their relations and the signing of the mutual
recognition treaty was set on August 23.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia has always considered good, friendly and rich
relations with Croatia the backbone of overall regional
relations," the Yugoslav foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic pointed out that much work remains to be done as
not all issues have been resolved, but the agreement provides a
good framework and foundation for further talks based on good
principles.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the controversial territorial issue of the
Prevlaka peninsula should be resolved through negotiations and
that the present security arrangements with U.N. supervision
should remain in force until a definite agreement is reached, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Prevlaka on the southern tip of Croatia is a tiny promontory
which guards the entrance to the Bay of Kotor, the main Yugoslav
naval base. It had been one of the major obstacles blocking the
normalization of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic described as "especially important" the agreement
reached on the safe return of refugees and displaced persons to
their former homes and on the return of their property or the
compensation for the lost property.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Serbs fled their homes in Croatia last
summer when Croatian government troops launched a massive
offensive to recover the areas held by the Serbs. Their return to
Croatia and compensation for lost property were also the focus of
their hard negotiations over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Specific agreements on social security and other relevant
issues, including payment of old-age pensions, will be concluded
within six months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav minister underlined that Yugoslavia considers
Croatia's acceptance of Yugoslavia's continuity with the former
federation as "an issue of principle."
</P>
<P>
Croatian Foreign Minister Granic said at the same press
conference that the signing of the agreement was an important
development both for Croatia and Yugoslavia as well as for their
peoples.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides a foundation for peace and stability in
the region and also in Europe, Granic said.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is future-oriented and provides a framework for
future agreements on economic, scientific and cultural
cooperation, as well as for resolving important issues such as
succession, Granic said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the agreement will largely
contribute to the overall peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The full normalization of relations between the two most
powerful countries in the region is regarded by the West as the
most crucial step towards a lasting peace in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Tribunal Prosecutor Opens Office in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prosecutor of the
International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Graham
Blewitt opened a liaison office in Belgrade today.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt said at a press conference after the opening ceremony
that the new office in Belgrade could work on investigations on
war crimes in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The office was opened in line with an agreement signed last
week at the United Nations headquarters in New York between
representatives of the U.N. and the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
According to this agreement, "The tribunal can now send
investigators to Yugoslavia to undertake interviews and other
investigation," Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal's prosecutor stressed that the agreement
guaranteed the freedom of movement to tribunal experts. He said it
also enabled the prosecutors to interview witnesses and crime
victims and gather evidence in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Belgrade office "will contribute to better
understanding and increased trust between the tribunal and the
Yugoslav government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked to provide further details on effects and results
expected from the activities of the Belgrade office, Blewitt said
the prosecutor could initiate investigations in Yugoslavia and
there were several investigations in progress about atrocities in
which "Serbs were apparently victims."
</P>
<P>
Blewitt said he had been assured of full cooperation by
Yugoslav authorities and he was leaving Belgrade very pleased.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Yugoslav government was not happy about the
war crimes tribunal, saying it was not a judiciary institution but
a political body with biased charges against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has so far listed 75 war criminals in the former
Yugoslavia, of whom more than 50 are Serbs, including former
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Ratko
Mladic.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils New Rules to Protect Minors from Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced strict government regulations which declare
nicotine an addictive drug and impose strict limits on tobacco use
by minors.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are taking direct action to protect our children from
tobacco -- and especially the advertising that hooks children on a
product," Clinton said in announcing the regulation at a White
House ceremony. "Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man will be out of our
children's reach forever."
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations that are a
slightly modified version of his 1995 proposal would require all
tobacco advertising in magazines to be black-and-white, text-only.
That means no more Joe Camel in Rolling Stone or Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also include a provision requiring tobacco
billboards to be black-and-white, text-only -- and no billboards
at all within 300 meters of schools or playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, young people would be required to provide
a photo identification to establish age before they could buy
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
It is already illegal in all 50 states to sell cigarettes to
anyone under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
Sales or giveaways of products like caps or gym bags that
carry cigarette or smokeless tobacco product brand names or
logos would also be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The White House said an estimated 4.5 million children and
adolescents smoke in the United States, with an estimated 3,000
starting each day.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 states are suing tobacco companies demanding the
industry repay billions of dollars spent on smoking-related
illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Police Seize 1.3 Tons of Drugs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran police have seized 1.3
tons of drugs so far this year and arrested 1,200 alleged drug
traffickers, 116 of them foreigners, law enforcement authorities
said today.
</P>
<P>
The biggest haul was posted last month when a police operation
codenamed Jupiter clamped down on several drug trafficking
syndicates and their laboratories to seize 866 kilograms of
cocaine and detain 36 drug traffickers and refiners.
</P>
<P>
In May, police arrested 10 drug traffickers and charged them
with possession of 500 kilograms of highly-refined cocaine with a
street value of upwards of 2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was made in a seafood cannery and the drug was
being packaged in cardboard boxes and labeled as seafood products
to be exported to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Local law enforcement authorities said that drug traffickers
use Ecuador to refine and transport drugs, to launder drug money
and to provide Colombian and Peruvian drug refiners with the
chemicals they need.

MEXICO CITY, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Colombia's economic growth during the
first half of the year was 3 percent, against approximately 6
percent during the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by the National Planning Department.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural and livestock sector and the manufacturing and
construction industries were responsible for the drop.
</P>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA -- Spain granted Honduras two
30-million-U.S.-dollar credits to finance projects to provide
equipment for the hospital network of this Central American
country.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish credits have been granted under favorable
conditions and with a long grace period. The resources will also
be applied to expand the big hydroelectric power plant being built
in Nacaome in south Honduras.
</P>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR -- Tourism in El Salvador, considered the second
most deforested country in Latin America, will be affected by the
accelerated environmental deterioration, the Salvadoran Ecological
Unity (Unes) warned.
</P>
<P>
Unes spokesman Nestor Martinez said this country has just 2
percent of all its original vegetation and that more than 80
percent of its fertile soil is eroded.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the salty forests, most of them made up of
mangle trees along the Pacific coast, was 160 square kilometers in
1989. Now just 2 percent of it remains and 90 percent of the El
Salvadoran rivers are contaminated, said Martinez.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's income from national and foreign
tourism during the first four months of this year was 2 billion
dollars, as reported by Tourism Minister Silvia Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said sales of tourism-related products have been
exceptional this year, helping to post a 16-percent increase in
foreign tourism and a 20-percent rise in domestic tourism,
compared to figures for the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC)
signed an 18-million-dollar agreement to finance the expansion of
an Argentine petrochemical company.
</P>
<P>
The IIC loan will be applied to increase the production
capacity of ammonia, urea, and ethyl benzene of the private
company Petroquimica Argentina S.A., one of the biggest complexes
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project is estimated to cost 38.1 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Praises Lebed's Peace Efforts in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today congratulated national security chief Alexander Lebed on the
initial success in seeking peace in Chechnya and authorized him to
have further talks with the separatists there.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Lebed, who returned to Moscow
after a trip to Chechnya, where he signed a truce agreement with
rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov, Yeltsin expressed the hope that
Lebed would brief him regularly on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Lebed had earlier told reporters that he will go back to
Chechnya Saturday to sign a "political document" with Chechen
leaders on relations between the federal government and the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also praised
Lebed for his successful efforts in stopping the bloodshed in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Lebed by telephone, Chernomyrdin stressed that
these efforts should be consolidated and that the political aspect
of the Chechen settlement should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire accord signed by Lebed and Maskhadov Thursday
evening after eight hours of talks near the Chechen capital of
Grozny, went into effect at noon today.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a presidential decree on Chechnya of August
14, Lebed was vested with broad powers, such as "taking operative
decisions concerning the settlement of the crisis, controlling
their implementation, taking decisions on employing and sacking
federal officials, servicemen and police officers to the rank of
deputy minister inclusive."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acts to Protect Immigrants Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- One day after signing a
controversial welfare reform bill, U.S. President Bill Clinton
moved on Friday to try to reverse or mitigate some parts of the
legislation that he opposed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed Thursday the bill putting a five-year lifetime
limit on welfare benefits and allowing states to impose even
tougher restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton described himself as satisfied with the overall package
but opposed to several of its elements that the Republican-led
Congress refused to remove.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president primarily faulted it for cutting too deeply
into nutritional programs and benefits for legal immigrants who
are not U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
His initiatives, the first in a series of promised corrective
executive actions and legislative recommendations, were designed
to help immigrants.
</P>
<P>
One action will extend the time periods for states to certify
the eligibility of immigrants, and a second will reduce
bureaucratic delays for legal immigrants seeking citizenship,
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The time-limit extension, McCurry said in a statement, "will
give states time to develop the procedures needed to make accurate
determinations of the many facts -- such as immigration
classification, veteran status, or work history -- that the new
law makes relevant to eligibility.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, the directive will decrease inaccurate or
inequitable decisions to cut off food stamp benefits," McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Attorney General Janet Reno planned to issue a
list of services that cannot be denied to immigrants because they
are "necessary for the protection of life and safety," McCurry
said.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Cuban Pilot Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban pilot whose plane
was hijacked to waters off the U.S. Florida coast has returned
home, U.S. officials confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Florida refused
to identify the Cuban pilot.
</P>
<P>
But Cuban officials told reporters that the hijacked pilot was
47-year-old Perez Pantoja, who left for Havana on Thursday on a
flight from Miami, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Cuba had strongly demanded the return of the pilot but the
U.S. State Department said that the pilot could be returned to
Cuba only after conclusion of the investigation of the hijacking
which took place on August 16.
</P>
<P>
Three hijackers reportedly forced the pilot of the Cuban Aero
Taxi Service of Havana to fly to the United States after the plane
took off on a scheduled domestic flight.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted three hijackers
-- Adel Regalado Ulloa, 22, Leonardo Reyes Ramirez, 27, and Jose
Roberto Bello Puente, 22.
</P>
<P>
The three men, all from Havana, were charged with air piracy.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the three hijackers would face a mandatory
minimum of 20 years imprisonment without the possibility of parole
and as much as life imprisonment.

RIO DE JANEIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Space
Agency (AEB) today invited international bidding for the launch of
an observation satellite, the second one built in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Data Gathering Satellite-2 (SCD-2) is scheduled to start
working during the first half of 1998, substituting SCD-1 launched
in 1993.

<P>
The SCD-2, built by the National Institute of Space Research,
will orbit the Earth 750 kilometers away from its surface.
</P>
<P>
The SCD-3 satellite is being built and its launching will

<HEADLINE> Over 1,322 People killed in Traffic Accidents in liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,322 people were
killed and 3,730 people were injured in traffic accidents in the
first half of this year in northeast China province of Liaoning,
official statistics released here said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the number of accidents, totaling 7,454, was down 5.27
percent from the that in the same period last year, and the
death toll was lower by 6.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, this year's accidents caused direct losses of nearly
44 million yuan (5.29 million US dollars), which was slightly
higher than that in the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the traffic situation in rural Liaoning is the
more extreme, with 855 out of 1,340 serious traffic accidents
occurring there.
</P>
<P>
The province has rather developed transport facilities, with
expressways connecting all major cities and high-grade highways
forming a fairly convenient network. Local traffic police are
taking steps to reduce the number of accidents by using more
scientific methods.

<HEADLINE> Upcoming Nicaraguan Elections to Be More Complicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming Nicaraguan
elections will be more complicated than the previous voting,
President of the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) Rosa Marina
Zelaya said today.
</P>
<P>
There will be six elections occurring simultaneously nationwide
until October 20, compared with only three in the 1990 elections.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four political organizations will compete in the
presidential elections, and 54 associations will participate in
the municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
Zelaya said that despite the complexity, inaccuracy of
statistical data and armed violence in the northern part of the
country, the entire nation is working arduously to overcome the
difficulties and make the elections successful.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, the Organization of American States (OAS)
observation mission detected serious irregularities in the
country's pre-electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The OAS said in a report that the CSE failed to provide
information to the international electoral observers, preventing
them from fully performing their mission.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
promised that the elections will be clean.

<HEADLINE> Histidine Essential for Milk Protein: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An amino acid, histidine, has
been found essential for the quantity of the protein in milk,
Finnish farming researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Histidine added to cow feed will effectively increase the
content of the protein in milk, researchers of an agricultural
institute said.
</P>
<P>
They found after three years of research that histidine is the
most important player in determining the amount of protein in milk
although about 10 amino acids are needed for the formation of milk
protein.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that cow feed with the addition of six
grams of histidine can produce the same amount of protein brought
about by 1,000 grams of protein-rich forage.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is expected to improve the quality of milk and
make milk production more cost-effective.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Counteract Against Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican Congress will
discuss and pass a counter-legislation against the
U.S. Helms-Burton Law during its next session starting on
September 1 to protect the country's commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the Helms-Burton act which seeks to punish those foreign
companies doing business with Cuba, the United States announced on
August 19 sanctions against the Mexican company Grupo Domos. The
sanctions will take effect in 45 days if the company refuses to
cut off its trade ties with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Domos Group defied the sanctions while Mexico formally
condemned the U.S. threat.
</P>
<P>
Legislative sources said that under an antidote bill to be
presented to the congress by the Foreign Ministry next week, the
Mexican government will control the entry into its territory of
the officials from the companies that would file law suits against
Mexican enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It will provide protection for Mexican enterprises against any
other extra-territorial laws apart from the Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
The bill will prohibit national enterprises from providing
information requested by foreign governments on the basis of
extra-territorial laws.
</P>
<P>
Also, it will forbid the Mexican judicature from recognizing
any decision of a foreign judicial system based on laws of that
nature.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, Mexican companies can file lawsuits
against enterprises which have previously sued them.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Mexican enterprises maintain business links with
or have commercial interests in Cuba, worth 2 billion U.S. dollars
in all.

third countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, the United
States and some West European countries. Others have returned to
Hanoi.

<HEADLINE> East China Villages Learning From Advanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 heads from over
3,000 poor villages in east China's Zhejiang Province have been
sent to prosperous villages to draw on their experience.
</P>
<P>
The move has been organized by local governments to help poor
villages to achieve prosperity as soon as possible, according to
an official at the Organization Department of the Zhejiang
Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The heads of less developed villages are secretaries of village
Party Branches, or directors of villagers' committees, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
They serve as assistants to Party branches, or to directors of
villagers' committees of prosperous villages, he said, adding that
they usually work for two to six months in developed villages in
coastal ares.
</P>
<P>
After returning to their home villages, they use what they have
learned to help their fellow villagers eliminate poverty by
developing resources and opening up markets for products from
their own villages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also help link their own villages with national
markets, by building roads and telecommunication facilities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years some 300 heads of villages in Pan'an
County, central Zhejiang, have worked in developed villages in
nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
After returning to their home villages, the heads helped set up
600 enterprises, which contributed over one-fifth to the county's
annual rural production value.
</P>
<P>
Yangbei village in Jinyun County, one of the ten poorest
villages in Zhejiang, has been receiving assistance from
Bazhangjing village, in both funds and technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Yangbei Village now has access to power supplies,
and has direct dialing telephone service, and has built a
well-equipped primary school.

in a letter to Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, the current
assembly president.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he asked the president to arrange a plenary session
of the 50th General Assembly on the nuclear test ban treaty when
it reconvenes on September 9, one week before the opening of the
51st General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Australia would introduce a draft
resolution on September 9, as a follow-up to an earlier resolution
adopted by the assembly on December 12, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The earlier resolution said the assembly was ready to consider
a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty before its 50th session
ended on September 17.
</P>
<P>
"In Australia's view, the time to resume consideration of the
item has now arrived, and we understand this view is shared by
other members," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT), which the Geneva Conference on Disarmament failed to adopt
earlier this week, can be endorsed by the assembly for open
signature.
</P>
<P>
The treaty can be open for signature if it passes the General
Assembly, whose passage require only a simple majority of its 185
members.

<HEADLINE> 64 Pilgrims Die of Cold, Rain in India-Held Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 64 pilgrims to the
Amarnath shrine (one of the noted Hindu temples) have died and
hundreds have been ill as a result of the extreme cold and
interrupted rains lashing Indian-held south Kashmir in the last
few days, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir authorities have reportedly called off the
pilgrimage activities in view of the inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
Evacuation has been made difficult by heavy snowfall all along
the way. Officials said that nearly 62,000 pilgrims had been
stranded at various points on the 46-kilometer trekking route from
Pehalgam to the holy cave.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, about seven inches of snowfall was recorded
at the cave at an altitude of 3,380 meters, 13 inches at
Mahagunus' top of 4,600 meters above seal level, the highest point
on the route.
</P>
<P>
Severe food shortage has accentuated the tragedy. Officials
admitted that relief measures were inadequate to meet the
emergency.

TOKYO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese man was arrested
Saturday on charges of extorting 120 million yen from a
convenience store chain by threatening to contaminate shelf
produce with the O-157 E. coli bacteria, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
Hiroaki Chiku, 51, a corporate executive in Tokyo's Nerima

</P>
<P>
He has also made about 20 threatening telephone calls to the

<P>
Chiku was arrested when he went to collect the money at a bus
stop on Chuo Expressway in Tokyo's western suburb of Hachioji.
</P>
<P>
The O-157 E. coli bacteria is blamed for Japan's
three-month-long food-poisoning epidemic that has claimed 11 lives
and sickened more than 9,500 people nationwide.

<HEADLINE> 30 Dead, 100 Injured in Pakistan After Heavy Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- About 30 people died and more
than 100 wounded in a two-day heavy rains which hit Lahore,
capital of Punjab province of Pakistan, local press reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The devastating down pour which started Thursday also inundated
thousands of houses, leaving tens of thousands of people
shelterless.
</P>
<P>
At least 461 mm of rain in the past 38 hours' deluge has been
reported.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency has been declared in Lahore, the
political, economic and cultural center of Pakistan, as the record
rain broke down the water, power and communication systems.
</P>
<P>
The army have been called out to do the rescue work and doctors
have been asked to remain on duty round the clock.
</P>
<P>
The administration was facing difficulty in carrying out the
rescue work as all the roads leading to the flood-hit areas were
blocked by water.
</P>
<P>
Now, the only conveyance for Lahore roads is motor boat as
motor cars can't move in the waist-deep water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were also reports of heavy rains in
Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sheikhupura, Okara and Kasur districts which
are near Lahore and the water level in the nearby rivers is
keeping high.
</P>
<P>
The regional meteorological office has predicted more rains in
the next 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO), rubber and tin ended the week with the first two
stronger and the third unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals closed the week higher on short covering
following a stronger sentiment in the palm oil market.
</P>
<P>
August-South jumped 45 ringgit (about 18 U.S. dollars) a ton
against the previous Friday's price.
</P>
<P>
Expectations that local palm oil exports would remain steady in
the next few months boosted the local market, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
And the rubber market here ended the week stronger on the
return of buying interest from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber exchange and licensing board price
indicator for September RSS One on Friday was up half a sen to
322.00 sen (about 128.8 U.S. cents) per kg, while SMR 20 soared
2.5 sen (about one U.S. cent) to 305.00 sen (about 122 U.S. cents)
per kg.
</P>
<P>
The market was recovered with the presence of overseas buyers
from China, the Middle East and the United States.
</P>
<P>
China re-entered the market on Tuesday to tender for 300 tons
of RSS One for September shipment.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the local tin market remained unchanged this
week at 15.00 ringgit (about 6 U.S. dollars) per kg against last
Friday's performance in low ranged trading throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
However, trading this week was better with turnover amounting
to 650 tons compared with 510 tons traded last week.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange market were traded mixed this week with
slight upward bias due to spillover effect on finance-related
stocks upon Maybank's 22 percent jump in pre-tax profit.
</P>
<P>
The fine performance by Maybank saw players buying into
finance-related counters on Wednesday and other blue chip stocks
as investors parked their second board gains from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's
decision to leave interest rates unchanged prevented bearish
sentiment on the local bourse.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index stayed above the 1,103 level and hit a high
of 1,122.82 on Wednesday, and settled at 1,119.48 points on Friday
against the previous Friday's close of 1,102.09 points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were of the view that domestic interest rates had
peaked, hence, any easing in interest rates would attract foreign
funds in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it was expected that other regional bourses like
China and Hong Kong would gain from the initial flow of funds out
of the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for next week, trading was expected to remain
moderate to sideways, with trading range to be 1,110 to 1,130
points.
</P>
<P>
The all-main board stocks Emas Index was up 0.34 points to
322.33, the Industrial Index rose 5.37 points to 2,119.24 and the
second board index was up 6.43 points to 511.43.
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board ready turnover rose to 600.829 million
shares worth 4.235 billion ringgit (about 1.694 billion U.S.
dollars) from 452.746 million shares valued at 2.848 billion
ringgit (about 1.1392 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover fell to 262.662 million shares worth
2.816 billion ringgit (about 1.1264 billion dollars) from 274.010
million shares valued at 2.762 billion ringgit (about 1.1048
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals rose to 81.087 million shares worth 673.41
million ringgit (about 269.364 million dollars) from 61.203
million shares valued at 623.924 million ringgit (about 249.5696
million dollars) previously.

<HEADLINE> China's Health Care and Insurance Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, Augest 24 (Xinhua) -- The world's most populated
country will establish a new medical insurance system by the turn
of the century, the Ministry of Labor announced recently.
</P>
<P>
Previously, medical costs for workers were paid by the state
and by work units, but this is now changing somewhat, with three
main reform measures in the works.
</P>
<P>
First, individual workers will be asked to cover 10 to 20
percent of the costs themselves so as to "avoid waste" and
"relieve the government and enterprises of their burden."
</P>
<P>
Second, a unified fund will be set up to help workers at less
profitable enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Third, medical insurance will be paid jointly by society and
the individual.
</P>
<P>
This new reform policy has been tested in some cities and will
be applied in more cities this year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the nation's largest industrial and commercial city,
has been marked to take the lead in the reform, with the first
step having been taken in May with a policy asking workers to give
4.5 percent of their income for insurance.
</P>
<P>
"If the medical fee is over 2,000 yuan (240 U.S. dollars) then
the insurance agency will pay 85 of that and the rest will be paid
by individuals and their units", it was explained.
</P>
<P>
The source said that if the costs are below 2,000 yuan, payment
will be made in accordance with the patient's unit.

HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwen government said
that thousands of employees who took part in a strike action and
defied the order to report for duty on Friday have been sacked
and efforts to replace them have begun.
</P>
<P>
Public service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro said last night that even those civil servants who may
decide to return to work on Monday will not be taken back.
</P>
<P>
The government said on Thursday that civil servants who
continued with the strike will be dismissed as the action is
illegal and a violation of the public service regulations.
</P>
<P>
''The government has already taken adequate measures to
guarantee the delivery of essential services in all the key
sectors,'' said Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
The civil service with a workforce of about 161,000 this week
plunged into a crisis when thousands of employees in most parts
of the country downed tools to demand a 60 percent salary
increase.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Prosecution Probes into Election Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Supreme Public
Prosecutor's Office today started a full-fledged investigation
into lawmakers charged with election fraud in the April 11
National Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will summon related lawmakers, their campaign
managers and accountants early next week.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 incumbent lawmakers and their aides are alleged
to have exceeded the legal limit of campaign spending, offered
gifts to voters or omitted their expenditures from their financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will determine whether to indict the 20
lawmakers by the end of next month, a prosecution official said.
</P>
<P>
Those incumbent legislators who were implicated include 13 from
the ruling New Korea Party (NKP), three from the main opposition
National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), two from the
conservative opposition United Liberal democrats (ULD), one from
the minor opposition Democratic Party (DP) and one independent.
</P>
<P>
If they are convicted of election fraud, they will
automatically lose their parliamentary seats, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean general elections held on April 11
this year, the ruling NKP led by President Kim Young-sam won 139
seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
But, the NKP later lured into its fold 12 opposition and
independent legislators to secure 151 seats.

NEW DELHI -- At least 64 pilgrims to the Amarnath shrine (one
of the noted Hindu temples) have died and hundreds have been ill
as a result of the extreme cold and interrupted rains lashing
Indian-held south Kashmir in the last few days, the local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir authorities have reportedly called off the
pilgrimage activities in view of the inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
Evacuation has been made difficult by heavy snowfall all along
the way. Officials said that nearly 62,000 pilgrims had been
stranded at various points on the 46-kilometer trekking route from
Pehalgam to the holy cave.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, about seven inches of snowfall was recorded
at the cave at an altitude of 3,380 meters, 13 inches at
Mahagunus' top of 4,600 meters above seal level, the highest point
on the route.

<P>
In a telephone conversation with Lebed, who returned to Moscow
after a trip to Chechnya, where he signed a truce agreement with
rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov, Yeltsin expressed the hope that
Lebed would brief him regularly on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Lebed had earlier told reporters that he will go back to
Chechnya Saturday to sign a "political document" with Chechen

arms and mines were blown up.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Use of American Ginseng In China Dated Back to Over 300 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- American ginseng has been used
as a medicine by the Chinese for over 300 years, according to a
Chinese specialist on traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guang, who has worked at the Beijing Municipal Bureau of
Public Health, introduced his latest finding on the history of
American ginseng at a National Symposium on the Development of
American ginseng in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He told the symposium that American ginseng, or panax
quinqaefolium l., has been used as a medicine in China since 1694.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Chinese history, Wang Ang, a well-known
medical scientist in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), mentioned
American ginseng in his book, the "Essence of the 'Illustrated
Compendium of Materia Medica'".
</P>
<P>
Since then, the efficacy of American ginseng has been
constantly mentioned in authoritative medical books, such as the
"Supplementary Amplifications of the 'Compendium of Materia
Medica'" and the "Research on the Property of Medicine", according
to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors of traditional Chinese medicine even replace
Chinese ginseng with American ginseng in traditional prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang and Li Xianggao, a professor of Jilin
Agricultural University, knowledge of American ginseng by European
and Oriental people should be attributed to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In 1916, a French priest, with his knowledge of Chinese
ginseng, found American ginseng in Quebec, Canada. Six years
later, a Chinese worker surnamed Mei found the same kind of plant
in a forest area in eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
American Ginseng belongs to the same family and genus as
Chinese ginseng, but they are not the same species, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, American ginseng has always been used as traditional
Chinese medicine, according to Yang. The name "American ginseng"
was given by the Chinese to distinguish it from Chinese ginseng.
</P>
<P>
In Western countries, American ginseng is till mainly used by
foreign citizens of Chinese origin, and has not been listed into
the pharmacopeia there.
</P>
<P>
American ginseng has been listed in the "Pharmacopeia" in
China, the largest consumer, and the third largest producer of it
in the world.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Obligations Reaches 1.2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Investment
obligations under Kuwait's Offset Program has reached about 1.2
billion U.S. dollars since the country started the program three
years ago to attract foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
According to a quarterly economic review published lately by
Kuwait's National Bank, the investment obligations are mainly
from the U.S. U.K, France, Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The offset Program was established in July 1992 by the Council
of Ministers. Under the program, all foreign contractors awarded
government contracts in excess of 1 million Kuwait dinars (about
3.3 million U.S. dollars) bear an obligation to invest a capital equal
to 30 percent of the contract's value in the country within eight
years.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of this obligation must be fulfilled during the
first four years.
</P>
<P>
The review said the program now includes 12 foreign
contractors, seven of them have already signed memorandums of
agreement.
</P>
<P>
It said the contractors actively involved in the program
include General Dynamics, Hughes Corporation, Raytheon, and T-Com
from the United States, Short Missiles Systems, GKN, and
Tecquipment from Britain, CMN International, Thomson-CSF and
Aerospatiale Missiles from France.
</P>
<P>
Japanese contractors include Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Sasakura
while Russian participant is Rosvorouzhenie.
</P>
<P>
Hughes was one of the first companies to incur an offset
obligation. To fulfill its obligation, Hughes, along with a local
firm, set up an offset business venture. It provides back-up,
supplies, training, and maintenance services to the Kuwaiti
Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, the company should have
fulfilled over 50 percent of its 27 million U.S. dollars
obligations by now.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance approved the formation of a fund in
June which is directly related to the Offset Program. Foreign
contractors may choose to fulfill their obligations by investing
in the fund.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Industrial Investment Company, entrusted with the
task of managing the fund, plans to raise some 50-100 million
Kuwait dinars (about 165-330 million dollars), eight percent of
which will be invested in Kuwait and the remainder be invested
abroad.
</P>
<P>
But the Offset Program chiefly aims at benefiting from the
expertise of leading foreign firms in establishing key state
projects, obtaining state-of-the-art technology and conducting
studies.
</P>
<P>
So far projects that companies within the Offset Program have
provided include the construction of a bridge, treating sewage
water, handling industrial and sanitary waste, transferring
medical information and operating and leasing planes, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Reduce Miscellaneous Charges on Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, is to cancel or cut miscellaneous
charges imposed on overseas-funded businesses in an effort to
improve its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Various departments in the south China city currently collect
228 kinds of fees from oversease-funded businesses, amounting to
2.796 billion yuan (about 337 million US dollars), more than three
times that of 1989.
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous charges have led to complaints from overseas
businesses and stemmed the inflow of overseas investments into the
city.
</P>
<P>
At present the city has few hi-tech, technology-intensive,
capital-intensive or big-ticket projects. Few multinationals or
few Western business people have brought investments to the
city. Hong Kong and Macao are still the main sources of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
The city government has held a series of meetings with
experts, deciding to cancel some administrative charges which have
not got approval from the state or provincial governments, lower
several charges approved by the state or province, and merge some
charges.
</P>
<P>
Since China introduced its reform and opening up polices in
1979, the city has accelerated the construction of roads, bridges,
telecommunications and other infrastructure facilities to attract
overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the city was selected as one of the best 40 cities
with good investment environment facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past 17 years and more, the city used 8.45 billion US
dollars. Overseas investments in the city increased at an annual
growth rate of 40.44 percent during that period.
</P>
<P>
At present overseas investments comprise one third of the
Guangzhou's investments in fixed assets, becoming a major
financial source in the city's modern construction.

<HEADLINE> Hissou, Masterkova Set New World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan Salah Hissou and
Russia's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova set two new
world records in the men's 10,000 meters and women's 1,000 meters
at the Brussels track and field Grand Prix on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hissou shattered Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie's world record by
5.45 seconds when he clocked 26 minutes 38.08 seconds while
Masterkova set her second world best in nine days when she
registered 2:29.98 to win the 1,000m.
</P>
<P>
"I have achieved my main goal," said Hissou, bronze medalist at
the Atlanta Olympics. "I once thought it was impossible but a year
ago I realized I could do it."
</P>
<P>
Masterkova, who took the 800m and 1,500m golds in Atlanta,
comfortably bettered the time of 2:29.34 set by Mozambique's Maria
Mutola last year, also in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday in Zurich the 28-year-old had set a new world best
for the mile.
</P>
<P>
Another Olympic champion, Allen Johnson of the United States,
came within one hundredth of a second of another world record when
he timed 12.92 seconds in winning the men's 110m hurdles.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this season that the 25-year-old
American had gone that close to breaking Briton Colin Jackson's
record set in Stuttgart 1993.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who has now lost 10 times to Johnson this season, was
well back in second in 13.24, with Cuban Emilio Valle third in
13.33.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Michael Johnson, who won the Olympic 200m and 400m
golds, easied up to win the 400 in a slow time of 44.29 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the 100m, Dennis Mitchell beat Olympic champion Donovan
Bailey of Canada for the second time in a nine days, clocking
10.03.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, fourth in Atlanta, followed up his big win in Zurich
to finish six hundredths ahead of Bailey.
</P>
<P>
The 1984 and 1988 Olympic champion Carl Lewis was third in
10.10, outpacing both Trinidad's Ato Boldon and Briton Linford
Christie.
</P>
<P>
Britain's world record-holder Jonathan Edwards won his third
Golden Four Grand Prix triple jump of the season -- after
successes in Oslo and Zurich -- with a leap of 17.50m.
</P>
<P>
American Olympic champion Gail Devers stamped her authority on
the women's 100m by clocking her fastest time of the season, 10.84
seconds, to finish ahead of compatriot Gwen Torrence and Jamaican
Merlene Ottey.
</P>
<P>
There was a rare defeat for double Olympic champion Marie-Jose
Perec of France in the 400m.
</P>
<P>
The 200m and 400m winner from Atlanta was beaten into second
place by Olympic silver medalist Cathy Freeman of Australia, who
won in 49.48 seconds.

PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- "With heart and humanity," as Interior Minister Jean-Louis
Debre once said, police finally stormed the Saint-Bernard Church
Friday morning to expel some 300 paperless African immigrants.
France was overcome by emotion and anger after the expulsion, with
widespread protests launched in the evening. About 100 Malians
among the paperless are expected to be expelled today.
</P>
<P>
The director of public security told the press after the church
was emptied: "This is a holy place. I want this to be written
down. You have seen that the Africans have turned it into a
brothel." One of the paperless African women said: "We are
treated like dogs, like slaves." Meanwhile, the 10 hunger
strikers now in military hospitals are continuing their protest.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The operation to evacuate the paperless Africans from
Saint-Bernard Church was carried out Friday morning amid cries and
tears, but without serious incidents.
</P>
<P>
While some 100 Africans of the 300 paperless immigrants are
expected to have their residential status legalized, the first
military aircraft will expel some of the paperless today back to
Mali.
</P>
<P>
The event brought the traditional split between the left and
the right to the surface again. While the majority of the French
society support the firmness of the government, the opposition
denounced the operation as brutality.

<P>
PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- About 50 paperless African
immigrants will be brought back to Mali by France on a military
aircraft today, Agence France Presse quoted the Malian government
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paperless immigrants were among the 300 Africans expelled
from the Saint-Bernard Church in Paris Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"These people expelled from the French territory will be
decently received," said a communique of the Malian government
issued today in Bamako.
</P>
<P>
The communique also expressed the solidarity of the Malian
government with "the Malians of France and others."
</P>
<P>
In France, several military air bases have been put on alert
in preparation for the expulsion of the paperless immigrants, said
local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "Paris-Normandie" said that Air Base 105 in
Evreux will be used for the expulsion of the first group of the
immigrants on board a DC-10 military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some attorneys for the paperless Africans have
appealed to the Administrative Tribunal of Paris to annul the
order of the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
The government order of expulsion cannot be executed without
the approval of the tribunal, which has 48 hours to make its
decision after being appealed.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expels Iraqi Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan started a new round of
diplomatic flare-up with Iraq by expelling an Iraqi diplomat,
today's English-language daily Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Adel Ibrahim, a press attache at the Iraqi embassy here, was
ordered to leave the kingdom after he was found to be gathering
intelligence information, a Jordanian official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The move, seen as another sign of worsening ties between Amman
and Baghdad, came following Jordan's charges that the Iraqi
government had instigated bread riots in southern Jordan on August
16 and 17, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi press attache, the second Iraqi diplomat asked to
leave Jordan in five months, "has been asked to leave Jordan
because of activities incompatible with his diplomatic status,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The notice was given in the past two days to the Iraqi
embassy here and "enough time has been given to the diplomat to
collect his things and leave the kingdom," the official said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from the Iraqi embassy.
</P>
<P>
It was feared here that the Iraqi government might take some
"tit-for-tat" steps toward the kingdom in the near future, which
would worsen the already strained relations.
</P>
<P>
In March, Hussein Faraj Khalaf, an assistant to Ibrahim, was
expelled from Jordan on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the expulsion of Khalaf, the Iraqi consul here
also left Jordan. But Jordanian officials said that the
government had not ordered him to go but he had ended his term of
office here.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said Jordan has also refused to allow
another Iraqi diplomat, Khaled Mousleh, to take up the post as
first secretary at the embassy here, because he was found to be an
officer for Iraqi intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Jordan may seek to reduce the number of
Iraqi diplomats here to the minimum level.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Iraqi diplomats work at the Iraqi embassy here
while Jordanian diplomats in Baghdad are only three, including
ambassador Bassam Qaqish.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has accused the Iraqi Arab Baath Party, the power base
of President Saddam Hussein and his regime, of instigating last
week's riots in southern parts of the kingdom that occurred
following the government's decision to increase the prices of
bread and fodder.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, who has been
leading efforts to distance Jordan from Iraq since February, said
last week that the ruling Baathist Party of Iraq had a role in
the riots in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad had made no word on the charges so far.
</P>
<P>
Jordan stood by the Iraqi side during the Gulf crisis sparked
by the August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and refused to join
the U.S.-led coalition that evicted Iraq from Kuwait in February
1991.
</P>
<P>
However, Amman started to move away from Baghdad in 1994.
Relations between the two countries took a major plunge after
Jordan gave shelter to two sons-in-law of President Saddam Hussein
who fled to Jordan last August.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also severely criticized the Baghdad regime for its
internal and external policies.
</P>
<P>
In return, Iraq accused Jordan of participating in an aborted
attempt to topple President Saddam Hussein earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
It is not known to what extent the current tense diplomatic
relations between the two one-time allies will impact their
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad, which is under the six-year U.N. sanctions imposed
after its invasion of Kuwait, is Jordan's once biggest trade
partner. It met Jordan's need of oil, half of which was free and
the other half at a very low price.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also reportedly pinned hopes on the
Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food deal signed in May to help it to revive
its slack economy and reduce its high unemployment rate and reap
its badly-needed hard currency.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Economic Liberalization Should </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Du Zhenfeng)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Economic liberalization now
undertaken in African countries does not mean to have all sectors
in the economy 100 percent unrestrainted, instead, it should be a
macroeconomic strategy to benefit national development.
</P>
<P>
This is a common view among participants of the internatinal
seninar ''On Economic Liberalization: Experiences And The Way
Forward'' held here from August 21 to 23 under the auspices of
the Bank of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
African countries, particularly those south of the Sahara,
have undertaken economic reforms by liberalizing their economy
since the 1980s. Better results have been achieved in national
development in various countries. This can be demonstrated with
the following statistics: in the year 1995 the average annual GDP
growth rate in Africa reached about 3 percent while GDP of the 33
United Nations registered least developed countries in Africa
also recorded an average 2.2 percent progress compared to their
0.3 percentage during the period of 1990-1994.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or so, countries in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA)
implemented reforms to liberalize markets in four major areas of
their economies: external trade and foreign exchange,
agriculture, domestic goods market and financial market.
</P>
<P>
The acvhievements are also attributed to comparatively social
and political stability and enabling investment enviornment that
have appeared in most of the ssa countries.
</P>
<P>
Without social stability there is nothing to be talked about
economic development such as in the cases of Rwanda and Burandi.
As for the political system, it should be in accordance with the
specific conditions and national traditon instead of simply
coppying those of foreign countries, particularly the modality of
the west. It is happily to notice that African nations are making
their efforts to make and improve their own political systems
suitable to their own conditions for the sake of their national
developments.
</P>
<P>
Similar steps in economic liberalization result in different
and various achievements in SSA nations. In some countries, such
as Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia, their
economies are growing in a steady and fast way. This is because
they make policies of economic reforms based on studies on the
specific needs in development and implement measures in a
positive way.
</P>
<P>
However, there are countries in the sub-region who benefit
little from the liberalization as they only do what some
international financial institutions and doners instruct them in
a passive way without their own macroeconomic strategy. Their
economies remain difficult.
</P>
<P>
African countries, particularly their economists, are
summarizing their experiences in carrying out economic reforms.
They are of the view that liberalization of economy should lead
to liberalization of human capability to utilize fully human and
natural resources which are boundless in Africa, and
liberalization of economy should result in economic growth and
poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
To promote the insentives of the private sector to contribute
to national development, Zambian Finance Minister R. Penza's
remarks are worth thinking: The government will not rent on its
commitment, it will not only continue to provide an enabling
enviornment for private investment but will also help in the
provision of public goods to augment efforts of the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
African countries have made some achievements in economic
reforms, as long as they formulate macroeconomic strategies in
accordance with their specific national conditions and take solid
measures along the way, the future of their economies are
promising.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Maintains Neutrality in Liberian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will stand neutral in the
next political dispensation in Liberia as the Head of State
General Sania Abacha has no intention to support any of the
country's factional leaders, Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the alleged strained relationship between Abacha
and Liberia's major warlord Charles Taylor as only an impression
created by outsiders, the minister said: ''General Abacha has no
interest in any faction or leader but for the peaceful resolution
of the Liberian crisis.''
</P>
<P>
Ikimi called on the warlords to lay down their arms and urged
them to have confidence in the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) and its new leadership under Abacha as it would
act as a neutral empire, the newspaper Saturday Champion reported
today.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that more troops would be sent to reinforce the
strength of the ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG that
has been operating in Liberia for six years.
</P>
<P>
The troops will come from Nigeria, Mali, Ghana, Togo and
Burkina Faso, he said, adding that the reinforcement will be
beefed up with the 30 million U.S.Dollars financial aid promised
by the United States immediately after the warring factions
agreed to restore peace in the war-torn country at an ECOWAS
summit last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The foreign affairs minister also dismissed any difference
between Nigeria and the United States over the handling of the
Liberian crisis, saying that Liberia is of great interest to both
the United States and Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Iran Destroys Mines Left over by War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian ground forces have
discovered and defused 2.54 million land mines and 528,000 anti-
tank mines left over by the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, the Persian
daily Jumhuri Islamia reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Iranian forces have cleaned 12,000
square kilometers of lands in the south, west and northwest of
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a military officer as saying that the Iranian
forces have also deactivated and collected 2.798 million units of
undefused shells launched by Iraqi forces between 1980 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
However, the military officer said that 85 troops were killed
and 361 others wounded in their clean-up operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 17,000 square kilometers of the Iranian
lands were rendered dangerous for habitation or farming as a
result of land mines and shells left over by the eight-year-old war.
</P>
<P>
Many explosion incidents have frequently occurred in western
Iran, especially the port city of Khorramshahr, which was occupied
by Iraqi forces for about three years, resulting in heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said earlier that
the damage caused by the Iran-Iraq war totaled 1000 billion U.S.
dollars, an equivalent to Iran's income from oil exports in 80
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Major General Liu Zhenwu,
commander of the military forces of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) to be Stationed in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), has ended his second visit to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Liu arrived in Hong Kong on August 14 and his itinerary was
arranged by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG).
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Shenzhen Friday, Liu said that his
visit was successful and he learned a lot from the British side in
his meetings with the officials of the related departments of the
British Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
Liu also held talks with Hugh Davies, British senior
representative on the JLG.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A 100-year old withered ginkgo
tree has been moved to a new "home" and is doing well, thanks to
efforts by local government to save the tree.
</P>
<P>
This ginkgo tree is 18 meters high and has a root circumference
of 188 cm.
</P>
<P>
The tree was originally growing in the county town of Changxing
county, east China's Zhejiang province. Since it was very near to
underground water pipes, and had been soaked by water, 60 percent
of its roots had started to rot and its main trunk was withering.
</P>
<P>
To save the precious tree, Changxing county forestry
authorities invested 5,000 yuan to remove it to another place with
good soil.

DAMASCUS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
met here today with visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the situation in the Middle East and the future of
the peace process as well as the bilateral relations between Syria
and Japan, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda held talks Friday with Al-Shara and asserted his
country's keenness on establishing a just and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East on the basis of the land-for-peace principle
and the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister expressed appreciation for Japan's
role in the Middle East peace process and ties between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Calls for Stronger, Cohesive Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong today called upon his fellow countrymen to use their
growing wealth to build a stronger and more cohesive nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Day dinner here, Goh said he was
worried about the fact that "many Singaporeans are scrambling for
the fruits of success instead of thinking how we can work together
to produce more and better fruits first."
</P>
<P>
"Work hard, try your best but do not be greedy," he said,
urging people to "strike a balance between material and
non-material needs."
</P>
<P>
"Singaporeans must know how to use their growing wealth to
build a stronger and more cohesive nation, a better society, a
happier home, instead of allowing it to divide the country through
envy, dissatisfaction and selfishness," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I want to balance Singapore's material success with emotional
strengths," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
"We need warm human relationships to enjoy a high quality of
life, not just cold material wealth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to balance our constant calls to be amongst the best
in the economic race with a greater emphasis on the emotional
aspects of a country -- its soul, its social glue, its arts and
culture, its history, its care for one another, its values and
principles, its people's loyalty and commitment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that was why he focused on graciousness, social
behavior, commitment, emotional bonding and social cohesion.

<HEADLINE> Australia Expected to Be No. 2 Gold Producer by 2000: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia is poised to become
the world's second biggest gold producer by the year 2000,
according to a media release at the 1996 Gold Conference held in
Gold Coast, Australia, today.
</P>
<P>
John Cairns, a gold market analyst, told the conference that
the world's gold demand was outstripping supply, especially in
Asia and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The total gold demand grew by eight percent in 1995, and is
expected to grow further towards 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cairns said that the increasing demand and an expected flat
output from the United States put Australia in a good position to
leap into second place behind South Africa in gold production with
an output of 350 tons per annum by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Currently Australia produces just over 273 tons of gold per
annum.
</P>
<P>
However, another speaker told the conference that the
challenges facing the industry were big, notably the shortage of
skilled workers in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Head of one of Australia's largest gold producers, Peter Lalor,
said the lack of mining engineers, geologists and other tertiary
qualified resource sector workers had a negative impact on the
industry and "forced salaries through the roof."

<HEADLINE> Amateur Performers' Club Thrive in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Every Saturday 63 year old
retired teacher Mrs. Zhang visits the Jiuqi Sea Food City, near
the Hilton Hotel in Beijing, with her husband.
</P>
<P>
They don't go there just for the food, but to enjoy Beijing
opera.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Zhang takes two cards with her. Every card is worth 20
Yuan (about 2.5 US dollars), the same as a monthly bus ticket, and
with it holders can watch the Beijing opera there four times.
</P>
<P>
"We can request what we want to listen to, and we can also
enjoy the performance, while drinking tea and eating pastry", says
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Her husband says that every time they go there are more than
150 people gathered there. Included in the audience are many
foreigners from the nearby tourist hotels.
</P>
<P>
Jiuqi Sea Food City is a regular venue where the
recently-founded "87.6 Amateur Performers' Club" is based.
</P>
<P>
The club, the sixth of its kind to be founded in Beijing since
last year, was sponsored and invested by Cheng Yuwen, once a
Beijing opera actress and now a general manager with a local
company.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of theater fans in Beijing want to listen to
Beijing opera regularly at low prices, that is why I have
sponsored the club", said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
As a national culture, Beijing opera is becoming well-known
throughout the world. Many foreigners say that they come to
Beijing for three things: The Great Wall, roast duck and Beijing
opera.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a time when Beijing opera faced many
problems. Several of the theatres famous for performances of
Beijing opera closed one after another.
</P>
<P>
Things changed last year when Chinese government officials,
including high officials from the central government, decided to
give more attention to the development of what is seen as a
national art.
</P>
<P>
"Communicating with the outside world and serving the domestic
audience", and "The prosperous Beijing opera is in accordance
with Beijing's international image," -- such thoughts have
reported to be very popular among senior officials in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Yuwen, her club will give free training to
audiences who have an interest into how to enjoy Beijing opera.
</P>
<P>
"I believe more amateur performers' clubs will come into being
in Beijing and ours will try to become the largest," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our performances will be broadcast by the Beijing
Entertainment Radio Station."
</P>
<P>
The name of the club, "87.6", is the radio frequency on which
the Beijing Entertainment Radio broadcasts its programs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Suggest Approval of Two Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top
legislature, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), suggested today that two draft laws be approved at
their current meeting.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the draft laws on the Coal Industry and draft
amendments to the Law on Mineral Resources, legislators said that
they have been well revised over the past months and are now
mature enough to be passed.
</P>
<P>
Another draft law on Protecting Rights and Interests of the
Elderly is seen as basically feasible and should also be approved
as soon as possible, legislators said.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight draft laws have been submitted for discussion
at the 21st session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, which
started Friday.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned three drafts will be put forward for voting
by the end of the 7-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers will continue to deliberate on another five
drafts, on rural enterprises, preventing and controlling noise
pollution, construction, air defense, and revision of election
methods of NPC deputies of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in
the coming days.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Begin to Take Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Judging by the number of
articles written by Chinese Scholars in the world's most
authoritative science journals, Chinese scientists are now
beginning to take the lead in the world of science.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Information Office of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, Wu Lebin, said that in 1995 in the world's three most
authoritative comprehensive science journals a large proportion of
all the articles were written by scientists or co-researchers from
China.
</P>
<P>
In "Science" it was 23.4 percent, compared with just two
percent a decade earlier. In "Nature" the 1995 level was 22.8
percent, much higher than the 1985 level of 3.7 percent. While in
"The Journal of Cytology" it was 35.6 percent, compared to the
1985 level of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that Chinese Scientists began to take the lead in
the world, and that China has taken a big step forward towards the
goal of being the world's main center for scientific activity,"
said Wu.
</P>
<P>
According to the authoritative international definition, if a
nation's total amount of scientific findings exceeds 25 percent of
the world total in a certain period, then the country will be
known as the world's main center for scientific activities.

<HEADLINE> Large International Port Expected in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to build Tianjin
Port into a large international port with complete facilities at
the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
By 2000 the port is expected to handle more than 70 million
tons of cargo and load and unload 1.4 million standard containers.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the two figures are expected to rise to 100 million
tons and 5.6 million standard containers.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Transportation believe that the goals are feasible, said Wang
Ende, director of the Tianjin Port Office.
</P>
<P>
It has been predicted that the port's capacity for handling
coal, oil, metal ores, containers and steel will increase rapidly;
Coal will become the the most important cargo handled by the port;
Exported goods will account for two thirds of the total amount
handled by the port.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goals, the port will build 12 deep-water berths,
and a range of important infrastructure facilities, including a
100,000 dwt berth and an expanded navigation route, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In the northern part of the port, five deep-water berths for
coal, non-metals, coke coal and liquid chemicals will be built. In
the southern part, five multi-purpose berths and two berths for
international passengers will be built, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the port will need a total investment of 4.7
billion yuan (about 566 million US dollars), he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Wang said big-name companies are welcome to invest in the new
port, and promised that his office will cooperate with investors
in land use and the provision of appropriate facilities.

<HEADLINE> Dismissal of Civil Servants Criticised in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean opposition United
Parties today criticised the dismissal of thousands of civil
servants who went on a nationwide strike paralyzing government
services.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Information and Publicity of the United Parties
Isaac Manyemba said the government should not have threatened the
striking workers, but persuaded them through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
''Threatening the civil servants was making a bad situation
worse, the government should have come up with a reasonable
percentage and persuaded the civil servants to go back to work,''
said Manyemba.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the majority of the civil servants whose week-long
work stoppage made the provision of social services to a halt,
were sacked by Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social
Welfare Florence Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said the strike is illegal and a violation of the
public service regulations.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, doctors, nurses, magistrates,
firemen, air traffic controllers and thousands of other
government employees across the country defied the government
order to return to work and were subsequently fired.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National President of the Zimbabwe Congress Party
Kenneth Mano said the government should address the workers'
grievances in a manner that is beneficial to both parties to the
conflict.

PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will send a different peace-keeping force to

the press here quoted German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
"An all new and different mandate will be decided" by NATO to

Ruehe as speaking in the latest issue of the German weekly Bild am
Sonntag, due to come out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers will discuss the issue during their
meeting on September 25-26 in Bergen, Norway, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should avoid the resurgence of war and massacre (in
Bosnia)," he said, adding that such a new force will be "well less
numerous in its members than the IFOR but equipped with a greater
strike force."
</P>
<P>
The new force will consist of about 20,000 soldiers, and will
be strongly supported by "outside forces, notably the air forces,"
he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government Saturday
granted its permission to about 100 motor racers to stage their
16,000 kilometer challenge from Beijing to Paris via Iran.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in 20 years for Iran to give such a
permission, said Philip Young, manager of the Beijing-Paris rally.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Young said "I has received the written
permission from the Iranian government this morning. However,
women drivers have to observe the Islamic code and put on black
long chadore."
</P>
<P>
Moharam Faryadshiran, President of Automobile and Motorcycle
Federation of Iran, wrote in the document "We will be happy to
provide full assistance for a secure and successful event. This
competition will be organized according to Iranian regulations."
</P>
<P>
Young said that two women drivers were among the racers, and
some competitors would also bring their spouses together through
the challenge course.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing to Paris Challenge, the world's first international
motor marathon in 90 years, would be the first ever rally to cross
Tibet, the Himalayas and three deserts, he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Government Reports Large Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government has
accumulated large cash savings of over 100 billion Singapore
dollars (about 70.4 billion U.S. dollars) over the years, Finance
Minister Richard Hu said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a National Day gathering that the accumulation was made
possible by the country's strong economic growth and the
government's tight control of public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The strong economic growth has allowed the government revenue
to rise even with regular cuts in income taxes since 1985, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was very careful in its spending of
public money, which was only spent on infrastructure projects as
investments for future growth, such as schools, polytechnics,
universities, hospitals, roads, ports, airport, waterworks, power
stations.
</P>
<P>
Hu refuted the argument that by accumulating so large a sum of
money, the government is rich but the people are poor, dismissing
it as "nonsense talk."
</P>
<P>
"As a small country without natural resources, we must have
cash reserves to support our independence in bad times. We will
also need the money in the future when our population ages and
there are fewer young working people who pay taxes," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that in the past 31 years since Singapore's
independence, "the combination of hard work and good government
has allowed Singapore to grow at a compound rate of over nine
percent per year," a record unmatched anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
Even more remarkable, he said, was the fact that this growth
was achieved with low rates of inflation, averaging only 3.5
percent per year in the past 30 years, while the average monthly
earnings of all Singaporeans grew at compounded rates of 8.5
percent per annum.

The ports account for 10 percent of the country's total,
second only to south China's Guangdong province.

state from the border trade.
