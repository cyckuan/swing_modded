JOHN HOHENBERG, 94, FORMER PULITZER PRIZE OFFICIAL, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Hohenberg, who began his journalism career as a teen-ager
by snatching an interview with the president of the United States
and went on to become administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes, died
Sunday morning at his home in Knoxville, Tenn. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Hohenberg also taught journalism for many years at Columbia
University and wrote a widely used textbook on reporting. In all,
he wrote 22 books _ including a novel at the age of 80 _ and
maintained an arduous professional itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote for numerous New York newspapers and taught at
universities from New York to Tennessee to Florida to Kansas. He
traveled the world, particularly Asia, lecturing for the State
Department and other federal agencies. He began the practice of
publishing the names of Pulitzer jurors and of drawing jurors from
regions beyond New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hohenberg came from the golden age of competitive newspapering,
covering the 1935 trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann _ who was
convicted of kidnapping Charles Lindbergh's baby _ hanging out with
Hemingway in Paris and reporting on the birth pangs of the United
Nations and Israel. Tom Goldstein, dean of the Graduate School of
Journalism at Columbia University, speaks of ``the John Hohenberg
legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hohenberg's larger mission was elevating journalism itself, and
he viewed the painstaking selection of Pulitzer winners as another
means of raising the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our news media, our reporters and editors _ if they are
serious people and if they really mean business and aren't merely
sensation-minded _ should be the conscience of the American
people,'' he said in a 1988 interview in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He abhorred pomposity and wordiness, regarding journalism as a
spontaneous ballet that could seldom be perfect because of daily
deadlines. His motto, first growled to him by a crusty editor, was,
``Go with what you got.'' Generations of journalism students at
Columbia committed the slogan to memory and the class of '69 had it
printed on sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Hohenberg was born on Feb. 17, 1906, in a tenement on the Lower
East Side of Manhattan, the son of Louis Hohenberg, a Hungarian
immigrant, and Jettchen Scheuermann, an immigrant from Germany.
When he was 18 months old, the family moved to Seattle, where his
father set up several small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He started as an engineering student at the University of
Washington but did not like it. His father refused to pay for the
liberal arts education he wanted, so the gangling 17-year-old
showed up at The Seattle Star, now closed, to ask for a job.
</P>
<P>
   The response was brusque, he later recalled. ``Listen, kid,''
the city editor said, ``the president of the United States is
coming to Seattle tomorrow. You get me an exclusive interview and
I'll give you a job.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Secret Service demanded to see his nonexistent press
credentials, employment seemed unlikely. He called the office,
fearing that his name would mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercifully,'' he wrote later, ``by grace of the kindly Jehovah
that watches over babies, pretty girls and addled young men, the
city editor remembered me and was sportsman enough to clear me for
passage to the pier as a Star reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a second's conversation in which President Warren
G. Harding allowed that he liked Seattle. Hohenberg turned the
remark into a three-page story. ``For better or worse, I had become
a newspaperman,'' Hohenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The family soon moved back to New York to be nearer relatives.
While attending journalism school at Columbia, Hohenberg worked for
The New York Graphic, his first stop in 25 years of working for New
York papers. After graduating, he toured Europe as the recipient of
a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, as he was reporting on the establishment of the United
Nations at Lake Success, N.Y., he was asked to substitute for a
Columbia journalism teacher who had broken a leg. The students
liked him, he liked the students and a new career began.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he published what became the basic reporting and
writing textbook used at many journalism schools, ``The
Professional Journalist'' (Holt, Rinehart &AMP; Winston), which went
through five editions and has been translated into Chinese,
Japanese, Arabic and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   His 21 other books ranged from several histories of the Pulitzer
Prize to an exhaustive history of foreign correspondence,
recounting its beginnings in the Napoleonic Wars and offering long
analyses of the challenges facing journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his appointment in 1953 as administrator of the
Pulitzer Prizes and secretary of the Advisory Board on Pulitzer
Prizes, he nudged at least two members of the Pulitzer board into
seeing all the plays under consideration for the drama prize,
something not necessarily done before.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, he wrote about how the Columbia trustees, as
final arbiters, refused to accept the Pulitzer board's
recommendation that The New York Times be given a prize in 1972 for
its publication of stories based on the Pentagon Papers, the
government's classified history of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees were uneasy over the newspaper's decision to report
classified material, an unusual action for journalists in that
period. Columbia's president, William J. McGill, persuaded the
trustees to reverse their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Then, McGill and Hohenberg persuaded the trustees to yield veto
power over the Pulitzers, perhaps the biggest procedural change
during Hohenberg's tenure, which ended in 1975. The year before, he
had accepted an appointment as professor of journalism at the
University of Tennessee. That was the first of a chain of academic
stops over the last two decades of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Hohenberg married Dorothy Lannier, a classmate at Columbia, in
1928. She died in 1977. They had no children. He is survived by his
second wife, JoAnn Fogarty Johnson, and her two children, whom he
adopted: Pamela Green of Knoxville and Eric of Dawsonville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Hohenberg's wife found a yellowing manuscript on
newspaper copy paper in the basement that turned out to be the
skeleton of a spy novel he had abandoned in the 1920s. He whipped
it into shape and sold it, under the title ``The Parisian Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he received a Pulitzer Prize special award for his
service to journalism. The citation said thousands of journalists
had learned to value his tough integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``From you they learned to respect the language,'' it read.
``They might split an infinitive because you taught them how. But
they dare not dangle a participle. You forbid it.''

LIEBERMAN CAN RUN FOR SENATE WHILE RUNNING WITH GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Joseph I. Lieberman's life will never be quite
the same now that Al Gore has tapped him to be his running mate,
but one thing seems likely to remain unchanged: Lieberman can
continue to run for re-election to the Senate, a race he is an
overwhelming favorite to win, while also running in the tougher
race for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Connecticut law prevents Lieberman from running for
both offices simultaneously. And, as news of his selection by Gore
swept across the country Monday, state Democratic Party officials
said that they expected Lieberman to be on the ballot for both
offices this November.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic Party chairman, Edward L. Marcus, said that
Lieberman ``was inclined'' to remain in the Senate race. Other
state party officials and aides to Lieberman said they also
believed he would stay on the ballot for the Senate, following
precedent set by two senators and vice-presidential nominees from
Texas, Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is immensely popular in Connecticut and has long been
viewed as a heavy favorite to win a third term in the Senate by
trouncing a little-known opponent, Mayor Philip A. Giordano of
Waterbury. But while Republicans and Democrats said Monday that
they still expected Lieberman to be re-elected, his decision to
seek two offices at once carries several political risks that could
alter the state and national political landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious benefit to Lieberman is that he can hedge his bet.
Should the Democrats fail to defeat George W. Bush, he could keep
his job in the Capitol. Predictably, Republicans in Connecticut and
elsewhere pounced quickly Monday, calling this evidence that
Lieberman lacks full confidence that the Democratic ticket will
prevail in November.
</P>
<P>
   And even Lieberman's best-case outcome, that the Democrats win
the White House and he also wins re-election to the Senate, has a
potential drawback for his party. Although he can run for both
offices, he cannot serve in both. If Lieberman is inaugurated as
vice president in January, Connecticut's Republican governor, John
G. Rowland, will pick someone to serve in the Senate until the next
statewide election, in November 2002.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday night whether Gore or Democratic leaders
in Washington would pressure Lieberman to give up his Senate
re-election campaign. Under state election rules, Lieberman has
until Oct. 27 to quit the race and be replaced by a Democratic
nominee. But state party leaders said it was already too late to
hold a primary, and that if Lieberman dropped out, a replacement
would have to be chosen at a special convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, during a news conference Monday afternoon at the state
Capitol, said that he had not yet considered whom he would appoint.
And although he praised Lieberman, he described the prospect of
appointing someone as far-fetched because, he said, he expects Bush
to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the seat comes open, it is virtually certain that
Rowland would appoint a fellow Republican, either one of the
state's two Republican members of Congress, Nancy Johnson of New
Britain or Christopher Shays of Stamford, or his lieutenant
governor, M. Jodi Rell. Rowland could select himself, but at
Monday's news conference he pledged not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one definite I can give you,'' he said. ``I have no
interest in going to Washington, and I also think it would be
self-serving for any governor to appoint himself or herself to the
U.S. Senate. I want to finish this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, the state Democratic chairman, said his party was
researching whether the state Legislature had the authority to
enact a bill calling for a special election for the U.S. Senate
sooner than the November 2002 election.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed Rowland would support such a bill and sign
it.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican whom officials in both parties said Rowland was
unlikely to choose as the interim senator was Giordano, the man who
is actually running against Lieberman this year. Giordano, whose
long-shot candidacy was initially opposed by the governor and state
Republican leaders, moved quickly Monday to take advantage of the
national spotlight on Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't be a man of two countries, if you will,'' Tim
Longino, Giordano's campaign manager, said of Lieberman. ``That is
the issue of the campaign now. We don't believe he represented us
enough as U.S. senator, never mind as a vice president, and don't
think he should run for both seats at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Giordano was enjoying the newfound interest in his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling now to find out who Phil Giordano is,''
Longino said, adding that Giordano would hold a news conference in
Hartford on Tuesday to attack Lieberman's voting record in the
Senate. ``He has been on `CNN Live' today,'' Longino said. ``He'll
be on all of the nationwide networks this week. Most of the
Connecticut networks have picked him up already. So our job just
got a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's senior senator, Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat,
said Monday that he had urged Lieberman to remain on the ballot for
the Senate and that he was confident that the Democrats would
eventually reclaim the seat in a special election. He also said it
would be difficult to find a replacement candidate for November.
``It's 12 weeks away,'' Dodd said. ``Joe is our strongest candidate
for re-election to the Senate.'' He added, ``I don't think it's
fair to deprive him of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As potential Democratic candidates to succeed Lieberman, Dodd
named two members of Congress, John B. Larson and Rosa DeLauro, and
the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that he was not sure whether Lieberman should
run for both offices, but he was confident that the law allowed it.
State law, he said, does not address the issue of dual candidacies
for federal office and, therefore, by not banning it, effectively
permits it.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ward, a Republican state representative, said he believed
that Gore was trying to distance himself from President Clinton, to
no avail. ``There is no question that Joe Lieberman is an honorable
and trustworthy individual,'' he said. ``I think Joe Lieberman's
problem is that his running mate is Al Gore.''

TOURIST RISE MAKES BIG APPLE NO. 2 U.S. SITE  
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC LIPTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City welcomed an estimated 36.7 million
visitors last year, an 11 percent rise from the previous year,
generating billions of dollars in sales for city businesses and
supporting several hundred thousand jobs, but also intensifying
congestion on city streets and sidewalks, officials said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, compiled from federal surveys and a tourism
research concern, earned New York City a second-place ranking
nationwide as a destination for U.S. travelers, pushing Las Vegas
down to the No. 3 spot. Orlando, Fla., maintained its top ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani pointed to the numbers on Monday as
further proof of the city's improved reputation within the United
States and around the globe as a safe, family-friendly place to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are staggering,'' Giuliani said, adding that the
total number of visitors should hit 38.4 million this year, up from
28.5 million in 1995. ``This means a tremendous number of jobs and
tremendous benefits to citizens of the whole city.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists, business travelers and others visiting the city
spent an estimated $15.6 billion last year at hotels, restaurants,
stores, cultural institutions and countless other locations,
according to the survey, released by NYC &AMP; Company, the city's
convention and visitors bureau.
</P>
<P>
   That spending generated an estimated $2.9 billion in local,
state and federal tax revenues, and supported about 275,000 jobs.
But even Giuliani acknowledged on Monday that the flood of tourists
had its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad side is we are very crowded,'' Giuliani said, speaking
at a Times Square news conference, while crowds of tourists pressed
up against a window to get a glimpse of the mayor. ``But the last
time I was in Los Angeles you could not move, on all of those, what
do they call them, `freeways,' `stopways,' . . . `parking lots.' So
I think we are in better shape than some other cities, even with
the tremendous amount of tourism we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from outside the United States made up about 20 percent
of the total last year, with tourists from Britain, Canada,
Germany, Japan and France topping the list of international
visitors. Overall international visits to the city rose to about
6.6 million last year, up 9 percent, according to data attributed
by NYC &AMP; Co. to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But the strongest growth has been from within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, domestic travel increased by an estimated 3.2
percent last year, according to D.K. Shifflet &AMP; Associates of Falls
Church, Va., a company that collects travel information from about
100,000 households each year. In New York City, visits increased by
11.6 percent, a growth rate faster than at all but 3 of the
nation's top 10 tourist destinations, a spokesman for D.K. Shifflet
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sweeney of Boston, who brought his wife and three children
to New York this week, said the trip was fascinating, but he is not
planning to move to the city. ``It is a great place to visit,'' he
said in Times Square. ``But I would not want to live here. The
stress level is a couple of notches higher than I can bear.''

DB HOUSTON HAS MORE PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lovell Houston, who UCLA coaches had hoped would
start at free safety, will undergo reconstructive surgery on his
right shoulder and be lost for the season, the school announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had offseason surgery on both shoulders to tighten up
the joints, but the right shoulder did not respond and a decision
was reached Friday to have him undergo more-extensive surgery, UCLA
sports information director Marc Dellins said. No date has been set
for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Houston leaves the position wide open. Jason Zdenek,
a fifth-year senior whose only action last season came against
Boise State, will be atop the depth chart Saturday when camp opens.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the latest in a series of physical setbacks for
Houston, a 6-foot-1, 187-pound sophomore who arrived from Denver as
one of the stalwarts of the Bruins 1998 recruiting class that was
ranked No. 1 in the country by some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   While others in that class _ running back DeShaun Foster,
defensive tackle Ken Kocher and linebacker Robert Thomas _ have
shined, Houston has rarely been healthy enough to live up to his
billing as one of the top defensive back prospects in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, expected to contend for a starting cornerback position
two years ago, missed training camp with a thigh injury and was
redshirted. After offseason shoulder surgery to repair high school
injuries, Houston reinjured his left thigh in training camp last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Houston touched the ball for the Bruins, he
returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown against Stanford. He
moved from cornerback to strong safety and started three
consecutive games, but a concussion against Washington ended his
season. The Bruins planned on moving him to free safety this
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hoops update: The basketball team could get its first verbal
commitment from the 2001 recruiting class this week in Michael Fey,
a 6-foot-11, 235-pound center from Olympia (Wash.) Capital High.
</P>
<P>
   Fey, who said he was offered scholarships by Syracuse,
Connecticut and Washington, said he decided two weeks ago he didn't
want to leave the West Coast. He must earn a qualifying ACT score;
Fey said he scored 16 on the test last spring, one point below
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now UCLA is on top of my list,'' Fey said Monday. ``When
I went down there for my unofficial visit (in June), I fell in love
with it. The only thing left to do is commit.''

WRITTEN COMPLAINTS HAVE BEST CHANCES WITH PUC
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Filing a complaint about the phone company is a little like
playing craps in Reno:
<P>
   You're likely to do much better if you understand the odds.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle analysis of 125,000 complaints filed with the
California Public Utilities Commission found that consumers are 10
times more likely win a favorable decision if they send a letter to
the PUC, instead of trying to get a problem solved with a phone
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to analyze (a complaint) when you have it in
writing,'' said Linda Woods, manager of the PUC's consumer affairs
office. A letter, for instance, allows consumers to send along
documentation, such as copies of phone bills or ads promising a low
price.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that logic might seem obvious, of course. But the
differences in success rates even surprised PUC staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, for instance, recommended that customers swing by the
PUC's offices in San Francisco to state their case. But The
Chronicle found that the odds are actually tilted in the utilities'
favor when consumers complain in person.
</P>
<P>
   You're likely to do somewhat better if you send an e-mail or
complain to a commissioner, who will then refer the complaint to
the PUC's consumer affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing matches a fax or letter. Consumers who mailed their
complaints to the PUC received a favorable decision 58 percent of
the time. Callers won just 5 percent of their cases. (Overall,
customers won 39 percent of the time.)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, customers often receive help even without a clear
victory. Sometimes the PUC brokers a compromise. On other
occasions, the PUC refers a problem back to the utilities, which
can find ways to appease an angry customer.
</P>
<P>
   And overall, many consumers say the PUC worked wonders after
they complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a month, the CPUC was able to resolve an issue that I
was unable to resolve in almost a year,'' one consumer wrote the
agency. Another gushed: ``I am glad there is such a thing as the
CPUC,'' the person wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the process often lets consumers down, not doing
enough to fix individual problems or warning consumers after
spotting a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an internal PUC survey completed in January found
that 4 in 10 people who filed a written complaint said the PUC fell
short of their expectations. ``I was very disappointed,'' one
person wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers griped that the PUC sloughed off complaints with
only a cursory review. Other times, it took the PUC a month or more
to respond, according to the PUC survey, which The Chronicle
obtained under public records laws.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the PUC probably would have found even more
frustrated consumers had it also contacted people who filed
complaints by telephone, because these complaints were far less
likely to receive a positive verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to see a system where everyone gets attention,''
said Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network,
a San Francisco consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Hoge said she believes that the consumer affairs division is
understaffed and undertrained. The agency has about 40 people to
handle 500 calls, letters and other queries per day.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods, the PUC's consumer affairs manager, insists that some
consumers are bound to be unhappy _ especially if the PUC rules in
favor of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Woods said consumers have recourse. If they don't
get satisfaction from a PUC staff member, they can appeal to a
supervisor ``who will give it a second look,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can file a formal complaint with the commissioners. The
process is often slow and cumbersome, but it is the only way to ask
commissioners to penalize companies for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC levied a $2,500 fine on Pacific Bell earlier this year,
after George Sawaya of Pollock Pines complained. He said that he
was overcharged and that key information was omitted from his
telephone bill. Sawaya, who is retired, said he filed a formal
complaint because it was the only way to make sure the company
would be sanctioned for the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics say the agency rarely takes the initiative to
prosecute a company on its own after spotting a pattern of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It took the agency years to finally file a lawsuit against
WorldCom. And although the PUC's enforcement arm initiated a formal
investigation last year of USP&AMP;C, a billing company that drew
hundreds of complaints, similar firms with just as many problems
have escaped scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are effectively letting the criminals do whatever they
want,'' said Charles Carbone, a San Francisco lawyer retained by
the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group.
``One bad actor might get stung. But it sends a clear message ...
that 99 percent of the market can get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Schulte, who oversees the PUC's enforcement arm,
said the PUC does not have the staff to take on an entire industry
at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of resources,'' he said. In addition, he said,
the PUC wanted to first test the waters with USP&AMP;C before
proceeding against other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Schulte said Monday he was being stripped of his position
because the PUC president wants to choose her own consumer services
chief.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups also say they wish the PUC would do more with
the complaint data, such as creating a report card ranking the best
and worst companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a bully pulpit,'' said Utility Reform's director,
Hoge. The Federal Communications Commission already produces a
``score card'' for telecommunications firms nationwide, though a
state report might be more relevant for Californians, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has already corrected some problems. Two years ago,
roughly half the people who participated in the survey said they
had trouble getting through to the agency. But those complaints
declined after the PUC's consumer branch hired more people and
extended its hours in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   PUC Commissioner Carl Wood, who has championed stronger consumer
rules to protect telephone customers, said the current complaint
process is under review. But he declined to give details.

LONG-DISTANCE CARRIERS ARE COMPANIES CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS LOVE
TO  HATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI surprised Paul Harvey in San Francisco with a $2,000 phone
bill, after abruptly raising his rate to call England from 10 cents
per minute to $2.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T charged Howard Frohlich of Redwood City, Calif., $17 for
four short phone calls, totaling 8 minutes: 97 cents for the calls
and $16 in surcharges, taxes and other fees.
</P>
<P>
   And Cindy Taormino in San Jose haggled with Sprint for more than
a year, after she switched long-distance companies to AT&AMP;T, but
Sprint kept trying to charge her a $7 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   By the tens of thousands, angry telephone customers in
California are fuming that long-distance companies overcharged
them, switched their service without permission or kept them
waiting forever on hold when they called with a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints against long-distance companies roughly doubled in
the state from 1997 to 1999, according to a Chronicle analysis of
more than 125,000 complaints filed with the California Public
Utilities Commission. The Chronicle obtained the records using
public records laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wish I didn't have to have a telephone,'' said the
exasperated Taormino, a health care contract analyst. She said she
finally resolved her problem with Sprint after firing off a letter
to the PUC. But now she is upset about strange charges that have
popped up on her cellular phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, long-distance phone woes are not limited to the
Golden State. A national regulatory group found last month that
complaints in 28 states against AT&AMP;T and WorldCom nearly tripled in
two years as companies employed increasingly aggressive tactics to
recruit new subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say stiffer competition, coupled with looser regulation,
is pushing companies to promise ever more fantastic offers, and
then sock consumers with a litany of minimum fees and other hidden
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are getting ripped off,'' said Regina Costa, a
telecommunications specialist with the Utility Reform Network, who
chides regulators for expecting the marketplace to eliminate any
problems. ``If nobody is watching, (long-distance companies) are
going to maximize profits.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, however, state regulators around the
country have been cracking down on long-distance companies.
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the PUC last month
sued WorldCom, the second largest long-distance company, over a
laundry list of complaints, ranging from deceptive advertising to
shoddy customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Five other states also filed separate suits against WorldCom,
which merged with MCI in 1998, mainly for false advertising. And
several states attacked AT&AMP;T and Sprint for running similar ads.
Lockyer confirmed that California is gearing up to sue other
telecom firms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as in other states, the PUC is considering tougher
rules to protect consumers. Most of the current regulations were
designed to cover traditional local telephone monopolies, such as
Pacific Bell, not long-distance giants like WorldCom and AT&AMP;T. But
Commissioner Carl Wood has proposed a ``telecommunications bill of
rights'' that would apply to all telecom firms in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing catch-up,'' Wood said. ``There is an
unacceptably high level of complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Although complaints are rising across the board, The Chronicle
found that a few companies were responsible for more than their
share of grief.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom, which is better known to consumers as MCI, racked up
more than 3,500 complaints last year, several hundred more than
rival AT&AMP;T even though it has less than a quarter as many
customers. Several smaller firms, like NOS Communications, scored
even higher complaint rates.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Pacific Bell is still the phone company many
Californians love to hate. The local company received 5,400
complaints last year, more than any other telecommunications
company in California. But complaints against Pac Bell tumbled 35
percent from 1997 to 1999, even as gripes against long-distance
giants soared. (Caveat: All the complaint figures against Pac Bell,
AT&AMP;T, WorldCom and Sprint in this story exclude their fast-growing
wireless businesses to better show the shift from local to
long-distance gripes. But the trend still holds even when those
figures are included.)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cited several reasons for the turnabout:
</P>
<P>
   --Confusing promotions. Long-distance giants have rolled out a
plethora of complicated pricing plans, ranging from Sprint's
``Nickel Nights'' to AT&AMP;T's ``One Rate Seven Cents Plan.'' One Web
site,  &UR; www.abelltolls.com, &LR;  tracks 170 different long-distance
plans. And most of the plans are more complicated, said the site's
co-founder, Marc-David Seidel.
</P>
<P>
   --Minimum fees. Starting two years ago, AT&AMP;T, WorldCom (MCI) and
others slapped customers who rarely make long-distance calls with
minimum fees of at least $3 per month. The change affected 15
million low-volume AT&AMP;T callers alone, many of whom did not know
about the fee in advance. ``People really get ticked off when they
see a large charge on their bill they don't expect,'' said Linda
Sherry, a spokeswoman for Consumer Action in San Francisco. AT&AMP;T
dropped the minimum fee last month, but has raised other rates.
</P>
<P>
   --Slamming. Overly aggressive telemarketers are increasingly
switching customers' service without permission. Complaints have
soared. And in the past two months, federal regulators forced
WorldCom (MCI) and Qwest Communications to cough up a total of $5
million to settle slamming charges.
</P>
<P>
   --Hidden surcharges. Critics say companies are increasingly
disguising extra charges to look like mandatory taxes. California,
for instance, sued WorldCom (MCI) for levying a 7.2 percent
``federal'' universal service fee, even though the government does
not require companies to charge the fee or set the rate. ``It
appears to be a standard government tax or fee, ... but it's
different for every company,'' Seidel said. WorldCom has since
increased the fee to 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seidel and other analysts agree many of the surcharges are
confusing. But some attorneys general say they are also illegal.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom (MCI), for instance, pitches rates as low as 5 cents a
minute in television commercials featuring basketball star Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer and others say the ads are misleading because customers
always pay more than 5 cents a minute. First, the rate applies only
to out-of-state calls on evenings and weekends. Then, WorldCom
tacks on a $5 monthly minimum, a $4.95 flat monthly fee, the 8.3
percent universal service charge and a $1.46 ``carrier line
charge,'' which also is not required.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and AT&AMP;T's promotions have also come under fire. Sprint,
for instance, trumpets rates as low as 2 cents a minute. But Sprint
also tacks on more than $20 in monthly fees under the plan, so
customers always pay more than is advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more fine print consumers need to be aware
of,'' said Lesley Fair, a senior attorney with the Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But while consumer watchdogs complain customers need a
magnifying glass to read all the pint-size catches, companies
sometimes do not tell customers about important details at all.
Under the Byzantine rules covering telecommunications firms,
companies are only legally required to spell out restrictions and
extra fees in thick government documents, called ``tariffs,'' filed
with the PUC or FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Wood, for instance, has noticed cellular telephone
companies sometimes neglect to warn consumers about expensive
``termination fees,'' which kick in when customers cancel their
service early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real problem,'' Wood said. ``If it's in the tariff,
you're stuck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Wood said, tariffs may have made sense in the days
of Ma Bell, when regulators carefully scrutinized a single monopoly
phone company. But today, state regulators normally just
rubber-stamp tariffs unless someone files a formal protest.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, tariffs are generally available only in a handful of
government offices, like the PUC's office in San Francisco, putting
them out of reach of most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the problem, both federal and state regulators are trying
to dismantle much of the tariffing process. Under Wood's proposal,
for example, telecom companies would have to tell consumers about
all the key terms and fees.
</P>
<P>
   Wood also hopes to close another loophole: Cellular phone
companies are exempt from most state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints against wireless firms more than doubled from
1997 to 1999, in part because mobile phones are becoming nearly
ubiquitous. A trade group estimates that U.S. residents used 86
million cell phones last year, up from 55 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints are rising even faster, though, especially involving
billing disputes. Gripes against Sprint PCS jumped 13-fold, and Pac
Bell's figures leaped nearly 500 percent. Only AT&AMP;T's held steady.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of the wireless carriers would say how many
subscribers it has in California, so it's unclear who receives the
most complaints per customer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But The Chronicle found stark distinctions among long-distance
giants. Of the three largest carriers, WorldCom appeared to have
the worst record both in California and nationwide. Complaints
soared 132 percent from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom officials insist they are responding. One source said
the company fired 300 telemarketers suspected of slamming. And
through June 2000, complaints have fallen 20 percent in California.
``We are doing the right things,'' said WorldCom Vice President
Sally McMahon. ``We simply must continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, AT&AMP;T has had the lowest number of complaints per
customer, although its luster is fading. Complaints against the New
York firm soared 69 percent over the past three years. Now, AT&AMP;T is
in the same ballpark as Sprint, whose complaints rose just 9
percent. But complaints are not surging against all telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell mostly fixed the problems it had installing new phone
lines in 1996 and 1997. The phone company was so understaffed in
1997 that it couldn't keep up with orders, inciting blistering news
articles and angering regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Pac Bell's complaint rate is slightly lower than its
counterpart in Southern California, Verizon Communications, the
only other major local phone company in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Pac Bell is now grappling with new installation
headaches _ keeping up with orders for high-speed Internet
connections, digital subscriber lines. The PUC has received
hundreds of complaints about DSL in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, Bay Area residents are pinning their
frustrations on long-distance and wireless companies.

WEST FINALLY EARNS BELOVED ANONYMITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was forever in the spotlight, searching for shadows. There
might never have been a sports figure who accomplished more, and
seemed to enjoy it less, than Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest players in NBA history. A successful and
completely miserable head coach. One of the greatest executives in
NBA history, if ultimately somehow still as miserable.
</P>
<P>
   So West finally went out Monday, a multiyear, on-and-off-again
production that only he could manage. Perhaps fittingly, he went
quietly. Without saying a word, save for the safe haven of a press
release.
</P>
<P>
   You would like to think he's not agonizing anymore. That he
won't have to be ducking into a tunnel at the Forum. Won't be
staying away from the Staples Center, tormented by those private
demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to be anonymous,'' West once said. ``It's no
fun living your life in a fishbowl. Some people like it. Some
people promote it. I never liked it. . . . There is something about
my life, my personality, that I don't feel comfortable in the
limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept trying to slip into the chorus line, only to be thrown
back into a starring role. He wanted to blend into some dark corner
of the theater, not be given billing above the title.
</P>
<P>
   But if never at ease with the adulation, West always craved the
competiton. He was probably happiest playing the games, happiest
winning.
</P>
<P>
   It was his own spectacular gifts matched with his unrelenting
drive to succeed that made West one of the finest guards in NBA
history.
</P>
<P>
   He had one of the smoothest jumpers ever seen. He was an
outstanding defensive player. During his 14-year playing career, he
averaged more than 30 points four different seasons. He once led
the league in assists.
</P>
<P>
   The complete player with a burning desire to win, he was dubbed
``Mr. Clutch'' long before anyone ever saw Michael Jordan hit a
game-winner. For his career, West averaged 27.0 points per game _
stepping it up to 29.1 in the playoffs, second in league history
only to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his success, he could seem more tormented by the
team's failures. During his first 10 seasons, he led the Lakers to
the NBA Finals seven times. The Lakers lost each one _ four in a
painful seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if West had left those balloons hanging in the Forum
rafters in '70. Finally, with Wilt Chamberlian at center, West won
his lone title two years later, on what some consider the greatest
team in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after retiring as a player, he returned as the Lakers
head coach. Maybe he was never so unhappy. A perfectionist as a
player, it pained him to receive less that full effort from his
team.
</P>
<P>
   His team failing to live up to his standards, the high-strung
West left after three seasons. The Lakers were a winning team each
season but never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The first year after he left as head coach, the Lakers drafted
Magic Johnson and won the first of five NBA titles in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years as a consultant before taking over the top
front-office spot. The first player he ever drafted was James
Worthy. With Worthy, Magic and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he had the core
of an elite team. Yet throughout his tenure, West was continually
complementing his big three with key additions _ a Bob McAdoo,
Mitch Kupchak, Maurice Lucas, Mychal Thompson, Orlando Woolridge or
Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   As a talent evaluator he liked to say he ``trusted his
instincts,'' and few could claim to be his peer.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting low every year because of the team's continued success,
he found gems were others were left empty. He selected A.C. Green
with a 23rd pick, Vlade Divac 26th, Elden Campbell 27th, Nick Van
Exel 37th, Derek Fisher 24th.
</P>
<P>
   Not every selection proved a steal _ there was Earl Jones and
Ken Barlow taken with 23rd picks, and David Rivers with a 25th _
but more often, rival general managers were left lamenting when
West saw what they had not.
</P>
<P>
   His trades were normally winners, too, especially the early
ones. He essentially got Byron Scott for a fading Norm Nixon.
Traded change for Thompson. Second-round picks for Lucas. Later did
the same for Sedale Threatt.
</P>
<P>
   The Eddie Jones and Campbell deal for Glen Rice proved
disappointing. He has only Tyronn Lue and Travis Knight to show for
Van Exel. He traded away a first-round pick for George McCloud's
half-season stint.
</P>
<P>
   But his biggest, sweetest trade, was when he gambled by sending
Divac to Charlotte for a high school kid named Kobe Bryant. A week
later, he signed Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   West had his new cornerstones. He had a new championship team
that he had built from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   And still, he couldn't recede far enough into the shadows of the
Staples Center. He stayed away when the Lakers won the title at
home last June.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has finally stepped away from the pressure, the wringing
of the hands, the anguish of games out of his control. He can be a
recluse if he wants. An anonymous NBA silhouette.

ANALYSIS: LIEBERMAN'S REPUTATION FOR PROBITY SEEN AS MAJOR FACTOR
IN SELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for rewriting) (With GORE-LIEBERMAN) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After striving for more than a year to outrun
President Clinton's restless shadow, Vice President Al Gore on
Monday made his boldest bid yet for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Sen. Joseph Lieberman, one of the earliest Democrats
to rebuke Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair, Gore's objective,
his advisers and other Democrats say, is to replace his political
partner of eight years with a fresh _ and untainted _ candidate who
is widely regarded as one of the most upstanding elected officials
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats close to Gore also said he was seeking a No. 2 who
could inject a note of excitement into the race and illuminate the
Democratic ticket, as polls show that Gov. George W. Bush is on the
ascendancy after his triumphant convention in Philadelphia last
week.
</P>
<P>
   At that convention, the Bush campaign left no doubt it will make
the moral lapses of Clinton a basic subtext of its strategy,
emphasizing the need to restore dignity and honor to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear after Philadelphia that these guys are going
to run a campaign of innuendo and guilt by association,'' said Al
From, the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council,
a moderate group that Lieberman had chaired for five years. ``It's
going to be harder for Republicans to sustain that campaign. A
Gore-Lieberman ticket is not going to be associated with bad
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the very factors that make Lieberman an enticing choice also
make him a vulnerable one.
</P>
<P>
   In picking the first Jewish running mate _ and an Orthodox one
at that _ Gore hopes to underscore his willingness to break the
political rules and display a dash of daring that has largely been
absent from his campaign. But while the choice could energize
Jewish voters (though they are overwhelmingly Democratic anyway) it
could alienate others who might not be comfortable with a Jew in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes to protect himself from scandals of Clinton by
tethering himself to a politician who is above reproach, and who
has spoken out not only against the president but for campaign
finance reform. The downside is that Lieberman's public
denunciations of Clinton in 1998 could give the Republicans cover
to even more forcefully raise questions about the Clinton
administration's conduct, including Gore's own fund-raising
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In turning to a politician with a decidedly moderate voting
record who prides himself as not being particularly partisan, Gore
also may have an easier time challenging Bush for the loyalties of
independent voters that he desperately needs to win. But that could
also unsettle some faithful Democrats who cringe at Lieberman's
breaks with the Democratic Party _ and Gore _ on issues ranging
from school vouchers to capital gains taxes. Some of these voters
could even end up defecting to Ralph Nader, the Green Party
nominee, Democratic strategists fear.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Gore campaign had tried to tar Bush by invoking Dick
Cheney's conservative voting record, the Bush campaign on Monday
sought to use Lieberman to undermine Gore's positions. The campaign
said Gore picked a running mate whose ideology is closer to Bush
than to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to figure out what the Gore people were
thinking,'' said Michael Nelson, a political scientist and
authority on the vice presidency at Rhodes College in Memphis.
``He's Jewish but it's not as if the Democrats don't already have
them energized. The only thing it brings is criticism of the
president _ and I don't see that as an advantage. Like it or not,
the vice president is yoked to the president whom he served.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledged it was difficult to directly condemn
Lieberman because of his reputation for moral rectitude. William
Bennett, the conservative morals maven who is close to Lieberman,
said he could not find fault with a politician who joined him in
repudiating the film industry in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's arguably the best Democrat in the Senate,'' Bennett said.
But asked whether Lieberman's ramrod reputation would inoculate
Gore against being linked with Clinton, he made a point echoed by
some Democrats, ``I don't know that Gore becomes a saint because of
Lieberman's virtues.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans made it clear that they are not about to abandon
their drive to fasten Clinton to Gore with the same zeal that
Democrats tied Bob Dole to Newt Gingrich four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said they had no expectation that they will drop
this refrain that Cheney declared to cheers in Philadelphia last
week: ``As the man from Hope goes home to New York, Mr. Gore tries
to separate himself from his leader's shadow. But somehow, we will
never see one without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, an adviser to the Bush campaign, practically
validated Gore's choice by calling Lieberman ``a decent man and an
honorable person.'' But, he added, ``There are just a number of
significant issues that Gore has just bitterly attacked Governor
Bush on and now he turns around and picks a running mate who agrees
with Bush on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even bigger danger for Gore is that several political
consultants said they did not have to think hard to come up with an
attack commercial for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It would open with a clip of Lieberman shaking his finger like
an Old Testament prophet, denouncing Clinton for ``disgraceful''
and ``immoral'' behavior. The next frame would be a clip of Gore,
celebrating Clinton as ``one of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial could end with side-by-side photographs of a
scowling Clinton and Gore and the tagline, ``Even his running mate
disagrees with Al Gore over what is appropriate conduct for a
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   However Lieberman is received, this much is clear: It was not a
play-it-safe choice as was Bush's pick of Cheney. That reflects the
political reality that as his convention approaches next week in
Los Angeles, Gore advisers said they felt it was necessary to do
something daring _ yet not foolhardy _ to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats on Monday said they have come around quickly to
Gore's thinking. In assessing the other possibilities on Gore's
short list of running mates, they said that Sen. John Edwards of
North Carolina was charismatic and youthful, but would be attacked
for serving only a year and a half in the Senate. And Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, they said, had the experience and a
compelling war record, but could be dismissed as a Northeast
liberal as Gore is trying to broaden his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But in keeping with the mold cast by Clinton in selecting Gore
eight years ago, the vice president demonstrated that he was not
driven by crass electoral considerations, like picking a candidate
from a battleground state. Some Democrats said they expect, though,
to hear grousing from voters who complain that in picking a Jewish
running mate, Gore is pandering to one of the most important
segments of the Democratic electoral base and one of the party's
deepest sources of contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans, however, rejected the notion that
Lieberman's religion could damage him. They said that people who
would oppose the ticket because of Lieberman's religion would
probably support the third party candidacy of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Lieberman, Gore also showed he was comfortable with
a No. 2 who is not known as especially scintillating on the
campaign trail. (It could be, of course, that after being Clinton's
understudy, Gore did not want someone who would outshine him.)
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president's choice seemed to reflect his genuine
concern about having a No. 2 with the experience and temperament to
help him govern. In addition, many people close to Gore have long
said that if personal chemistry were the more compelling factor,
Lieberman would shoot to the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   For all the calculations of how Lieberman would help or hurt,
the senator, in an interview several weeks ago, dismissed what he _
or anyone _ could bring to the ticket. ``I presume any factor can
make enough of a difference,'' he said, ``although not a large
difference to be significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The relevance of a running mate choice, he said, was that it
``may tell the American people something more about the two major
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the choice may tell the public something more not
just about Gore, but about his relationship with his political
partner for the past eight years.

 MIXED REACTION FROM JEWS OVER LIEBERMAN CHOICE  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman's selection as
the first Jewish vice presidential candidate in U.S. history breaks
a centuries-old religious barrier and could serve as a national
referendum on anti-Semitism in America.
</P>
<P>
   That was the sentiment of Jewish leaders in the Bay Area and
around the country Monday to Al Gore's selection of the centrist
senator as his presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew who adheres to that faith's strict
laws on diet and Sabbath observance, also put the national
spotlight on the limitations _ and benefits _ of traditional Jewish
religious practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be discussed around every Jewish dinner table
tonight and lots of other dinner tables, too,'' said Rabbi James
Rudin, senior interreligious adviser for the American Jewish
Committee. ``Win or lose, the Gore-Lieberman ticket has made
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Some compared discussion over Lieberman's faith to John F.
Kennedy's Catholicism being an issue in the 1960 campaign, or Jimmy
Carter putting the spotlight on evangelicals in the 1976
presidential race, when he told reporters he was a ``born-again
Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political observers say Gore choose Lieberman, in part, to
distance himself from the scandal over President Clinton's affair
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Lieberman was one of the
first Democratic lawmakers to openly criticize the president's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Dworken, executive president of the Orthodox
Rabbinical Council of America, praised Lieberman as someone who
``professes the faith and lives by the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dworken feared that widespread media attention
on a national Jewish candidate will ``provoke some anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is enough anti-Semitism to cause significant harm
to the Gore-Lieberman ticket may not be known until election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't show up in the polls, but it shows up in the voting
booth,'' said Rudin. ``It will force Americans to look themselves
in the mirror and say, `I am not an anti-Semite,' or to admit to
themselves, `Yes, I am a bigot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who want to make this a `Christian
America,' '' he added. ``This is a repudiation of that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leading evangelicals praised the Lieberman selection,
indicating that Gore's choice may play well among religious voters
impressed by the senator's commitment to his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``American evangelicals respect persons of great moral substance
and conviction, and we certainly share with Senator Lieberman a
great moral heritage,'' said R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   News of Lieberman's selection provoked a complicated mix of
reactions among many Bay Area Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, it makes me feel proud. At the same time, I
don't think America will vote for a Jew,'' said Marcy Weiss of
Hayward, who runs a service that helps bring together young
professional Jews in Northern California. ``It will rally the
anti-Semitic vote. It's very upsetting. I think Gore threw away the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jacob Traub, who leads Adath Israel, an Orthodox synagogue
in San Francisco, wasn't so pessimistic. He called Gore's move ``a
wise choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sen. Lieberman were running for president, it might be
different, but I don't know if there's enough anti-Semitism for it
to show up on the tail end of the ticket,'' he said. ``People are
going to vote for Gore or Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Traub, who has spoken with Lieberman several times over the
years, said Jewish law regarding the Sabbath would not interfere
with his fulfilling his duties as president or vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews are supposed to refrain from work, driving,
handling money, operating lights and many other daily chores during
their Sabbath, which runs from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday,
and during Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is something of major importance for the common good,
all the rules of the Sabbath are suspended,'' said Traub, citing as
an extreme example the Israeli government mobilizing troops during
the Yom Kippur War. ``There is enormous flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Traub said Lieberman's campaigning would be restricted on the
Sabbath. ``He couldn't leave San Francisco and fly to L.A.,'' Traub
said. ``He could walk across the street from the Fairmont to shake
people's hands, but he couldn't grab a briefcase full of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman addressed the religion issue himself Monday, saying he
wanted to be judged on his experience and his ideas, not his
religion.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``My faith is part of me. It's been at the center
of who I've been all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Sabbath observance, the senator said he believes he may
still work during that time if it is to promote ``the respect and
protection of human life and well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Traub recalled a conversation he had with Lieberman about a time
before the Clinton presidency. The senator had decided to stay and
sleep in his congressional office one Friday night so he could walk
to cast an important Saturday vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Gore heard about it, and said, `Don't be foolish. I
have a condo next door and you can go sleep there.' Gore even went
over and turned on some of the lights, telling Lieberman, `I'll be
your  &UR; Shabbas goy. &LR; '''
</P>
<P>
   That's a Yiddish expression for a job once offered to gentiles
in Jewish neighborhoods who were paid to turn on and off the lights
in synagogues and Jewish households _ before the advent of
automatic timers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jewish Community Center in San Francisco, executive
director Nate Levine said the reaction to the Lieberman news was
also mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted that the American political system is
including Jews _ and women and African-Americans _ at all levels,''
he said. ``But we strive for a day when people are no longer
measured by the way they choose to pray.''

 GORE PICKS CENTRIST JEWISH SENATOR AS RUNNING MATE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making history and a clear appeal to the political center, Vice
President Al Gore has chosen Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew
and an outspoken critic of President Clinton's sexual escapades, as
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to formally announce the selection of the
two-term senator from Connecticut at a Nashville rally Tuesday.
Lieberman officially received the call from Gore Monday and told
the vice president he was ``humbled'' by the opportunity and
``excited because I believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   A deeply religious man who is the first Jew ever to run on a
major party presidential ticket, Lieberman was praised by Democrats
as a bold choice. Even normally combative Republicans in the
campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush lauded him as a man of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has chosen a good man whom Governor Bush and Secretary
Cheney respect,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer in a statement
that praised Lieberman's ``intelligence'' and ``integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democrat to attack Clinton on the Senate
floor after the president admitted he did not tell the truth about
his relations with Monica Lewinsky. But Monday, Clinton also had
high praise for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's one of the most outstanding people in public
life,'' said Clinton, who was rumored to be considering Lieberman
as a running mate in 1992. ``He's a bold thinker. He is always full
of new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who appeared elated when word of his nomination
leaked out, wasted no time assuming his role as an aggressive
defender of Democratic policies _ and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that he is without a doubt a more qualified,
more honorable, more intelligent, more progressive, more
hardworking candidate for this high office'' than Bush, Lieberman
told an AFL-CIO audience in Hartford Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line: When the working people of America look for a
helping hand from the other party and the other ticket, they too
often will receive the back of their hand,'' Lieberman said as the
audience cheered.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week to go before the opening of the Democratic
National Convention in Washington, Gore's pick of Lieberman gives
his presidential campaign a much-needed shot of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some potential upside in picking somebody who has a
real strong independent streak, who's going about doing things in
his own way and is a different kind of Democrat,'' said pollster
Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lieberman is a centrist Democrat who voted for the North
American Free Trade Agreement against the wishes of major unions,
is pro-choice and has fought for campaign finance reform. But he
also has supported parental consent laws and an experimental
school-voucher program, and in a vote last year he asserted that
prayer in schools as part of memorial services is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a liquor store owner who grew up in Stamford, Conn.,
and attended Yale College and Yale Law, Lieberman is widely admired
by colleagues precisely because, from time to time, he has broken
with his party to speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He earned national attention in 1998 when _ before others in
Washington began to speak out on the Monica Lewinsky affair _ he
issued a stern rebuke to Clinton for his ``immoral'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term senator and former Connecticut attorney general has
also formed alliances with conservatives, such as Republican values
guru William Bennett. He is an honorary co-chairman of the Center
for the Study of Jewish and Christian Values, a group that boasts a
number of leaders of the Christian conservative movement, such as
former presidential candidate Gary Bauer, on its board.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Senate committee investigating campaign
fund-raising abuses, for instance, he said he was ``suspicious''
that Chinese money entered the 1996 election. In a position that,
no doubt, will be highlighted by the George W. Bush camp, Lieberman
chastised both Clinton and Republican Bob Dole for betraying the
public trust through ``issue ads'' and other ``back-door''
fund-raising devices that evaded spending limits. The ``mad
hatters'' from both parties, he said, ``hung a giant `For Sale'
sign on our government.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has been an outspoken critic of the movie and television
industries, frequently lamenting what he calls the ``increasingly
toxic popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Lieberman has called for the Federal
Communications Commission to consider the content of television
shows when renewing broadcasters' lucrative licenses. He has said
that if it were up to him, shows like ``Friends'' would be shown
only in movie theaters or late at night so children couldn't watch.
He has even asserted that Hollywood ``doesn't understand piety.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, observe the Jewish
Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, the Connecticut
senator said he will vote on legislation and engage in important
meetings during the Sabbath, but only to promote ``the respect and
protection of human life and well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare said Lieberman's resume may assist Gore in drawing
support from the all-important moderate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is going to need all the support he can get outside
the Democratic Party,'' Baldassare said. ``The fact that Lieberman
has this strong independent streak, has spoken out against Clinton
and seems to be a person with strong integrity and a strong
viewpoint will help those independent voters who might otherwise
feel uncomfortable about going with (Gore).''
</P>
<P>
   But Baldassare noted that vice-presidential picks do not
influence the vast majority of voters, and Lieberman's home state,
Connecticut, doesn't provide Gore with a geographic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the choice carries important strategic
implications for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He neutralizes or diminishes (Green Party presidential
candidate Ralph) Nader in the Northeast and picks up the Jewish
Republican vote in the Midwest,'' said Bob Mulholland, campaign
adviser to the California Democratic Party. Mulholland said
Lieberman will attract the critical soccer-mom vote given his
outspoken concern about the effects on children of violence in
video games and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal Democrats _ irritated by last week's GOP convention
and its show of diversity _ said Lieberman will serve to underscore
that the Democrats are the truly inclusive party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that diversity is not just something that is talked
about,'' said California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. ``It's
attempted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful step for the country,'' said Rabbi Steven
Chester, a leader in the Reform Movement who heads Temple Sinai,
Oakland's largest congregation. ``It says a lot about the country
and the feeling of the candidate, that (Gore believes) the country
will not judge Lieberman by his religion.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the vast majority of Jewish voters tend
to be Democrats, Chester said he doesn't believe anti-Semitism will
affect Gore's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans _ even those with generous praise for Lieberman
_ also said Gore's choice could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Jewish American, I can't help but be proud to see Senator
Lieberman on a national ticket,'' GOP political analyst Dan Schnur
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Gore obviously sees Lieberman as willing to speak out
against Clinton, to distance himself from Clinton's ethical
lapses,'' Schnur said. ``Lieberman's courage and independence just
underscore that Gore wasn't willing or able to show either.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Schnur said, Gore cannot take much credit for boldness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between a campaign that's 10 points
ahead,`` he said, ``and one that's 10 points behind.''

POWER PLANT SELL_OFF ATTACKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Department of Water and Power plan to capitalize
on Los Angeles' power surplus by selling an old plant to help build
more efficient, cleaner plants faced a stepped-up attack Monday
just before it goes before the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   City Controller Rick Tuttle sent a letter to the council, which
is to consider the $1.7 &UR;  &LR; billion plan Tuesday, urging rejection of
the sale of the DWP's aging plant in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   DWP General Manager S. David Freeman sees the plant sale as
critical to a 10-year plan to reduce rates, ensure a power surplus
to attract new business to the city and eliminate the rest of the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to expand now to meet growing demand, and the longer
we sit on this, the more expensive it's going to be for us,''
Freeman told Daily News editors and reporters. ``Things are hot
right now, and that's when you need to go to town.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuttle said the city should reject the $265 million offer
for the Mojave plant and borrow instead to build new facilities. He
warned that the DWP cannot be certain it will get necessary permits
to replace existing power plants, including an energy inefficient
and polluting facility in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income from the Mojave sale represents only a fraction of
the total costs of these upgrades,'' he wrote, ``a fraction which
might better be financed through debt than through any measure
which puts the city's power supply at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   During Freeman's three years as head of the DWP, he has lowered
the agency's debt from more than $4 billion to $1.7 billion by
eliminating about 2,000 jobs and getting more than $130 million a
year in windfall profits selling excess power in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion would help lower customer rates by 5 percent in
2002 and 10 percent the next year, Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Freeman is scheduled to outline his plan to the council.
</P>
<P>
   He needs 10 votes to get it on the agenda because it did not
pass through committee.
</P>
<P>
   Business community support for the plan is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist at the county Economic Development
Corporation, said the DWP expansion plan would help retain local
businesses and bring new ones to the area by ensuring a cheap and
stable source of energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new economy is technology-driven and new businesses are
power hogs,'' he said. ``The rest of the state is going to be
facing power problems for the next few years, while L.A. can offer
a low-cost and stable alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, president and chief executive officer of the
Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley, said the DWP plan is
good for business if it would ensure affordable rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some other parts of the state are now seeing that deregulation
didn't pay off they way they thought it would,'' he said. ``Also,
any time you can build with existing capital or resources instead
of borrowing, it usually makes good business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said he wants to finance the 2000 Integrated Resource
Plan without borrowing, thereby avoiding huge debts that nearly
bankrupted the department over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the city's 20 percent share in the coal-burning Mojave
Generating Station in southern Nevada to private companies would
bring $190 million in cash and an additional $75 million in savings
by not having to implement government-imposed environmental
upgrades at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman argues Los Angeles has more than enough power without
Mojave, and that the cash in hand would help pay off its entire
debt by 2003, freeing up revenues to increase production and lower
rates.
</P>
<P>
   If the city waits until after a Sept. 1 sale deadline, Freeman
says, the city's share value will decrease by 20 percent once the
new owner, the AES Co., goes through with its current plan to buy
out all the other major shareholders this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new local power plants would be natural-gas-burning and
built on the same sites as old, less efficient natural-gas-burning
plants in Sun Valley, Long Beach and Playa del Rey.
</P>
<P>
   In Sun Valley, Freeman said, a new 500-megawatt plant could be
constructed by 2004 and would produce up to 50 percent more energy
with less pollution than the old plant.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion plan was unanimously approved by the DWP Board of
Commissioners, but requires final approval from the council.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who chairs the Commerce, Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, said she supports the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of L.A. has an opportunity to get out of a dirty coal
contract, rely on local power generation instead of a faraway
plant, and create jobs here in our own communities,'' she said.

LOCAL JEWS HOPE RELIGION WON`T TURN INTO NEGATIVE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Los Angeles area Jewish leaders and residents
praised the historic choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as Al Gore's
vice presidential running mate Monday, but also said it will test
the strength of anti-Semitism in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator is the first Jew nominated for a role in
the White House, symbolizing an assimilation of Jews into society
but providing a possible outlet for anti-Semitism in the nation,
Jewish leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they fear anti-Jewish sentiments would be enough to
hurt the Democrats' chance to win the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little frightening because it could stir the flame of
anti-Semitism and I would hate to see factions call sides -- not
about the man, but because he's a Jew,'' said 76-year-old Shelley
Greenspan, a resident of the Jewish Home for the Aging's Grancell
Village in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could become fractious and that's the politics that
frightens me in general. (Gore) is doing a wonderful thing, but I
hope it doesn't hurt him in the end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Jewish leaders across Los Angeles said they believe America
is ready to embrace leaders based on issues and not personal
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not going to vote for someone just because he's
Jewish. Ultimately it's up to which of these guys would be the best
president,'' said Steve Soboroff, a Republican who is a candidate
for Los Angeles mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good, a very smart choice. I always vote for the best
candidate regardless of party. But, again, these are vice
presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Jewish leaders agreed that issues and not religion will
cast the deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are racist will challenge anything that is not pure
Anglo-Saxon Protestant, but most Americans prize leadership,
integrity and personal strength,'' said Rabbi Abner Weiss, former
president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California, and a
longtime friend of Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss -- who married Lieberman and his second wife, Hadassah,
while a rabbi in Riverside, N.Y. -- said the 58-year-old Lieberman
is a man of great moral strength and an espouser of ``family
values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no skeletons in this cupboard, believe me, because I
know his cupboard.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thinks the senator's integrity and leadership
abilities are what is most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is of great intellect and integrity and is a reformer of
the first order,'' said U.S. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills.
``So the vast majority of Americans will not care if he's Jewish.
We are past the point where this is a crucial issue in voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman also noted that once again, the Democratic National
Convention will take on historic importance in Los Angeles. The
last time the city hosted the Democrats, in 1960, the first Roman
Catholic, John F. Kennedy, was nominated for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a most outstanding choice. It will put to rest forever
the taboo that Jews can't run for the highest office,'' said Rabbi
Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and
the Museum of Tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a stroke of genius. I don't think any other candidate
would engender this kind of reaction,'' he said. ``It really opens
the doors of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli Broad, the billionaire developer and financial management
executive who was one of the leaders seeking to bring the
convention to Los Angeles, praised Gore's selection of Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say I was surprised by it, but it is superb
selection,'' Broad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans were all talking about Colin Powell being a
running mate and if the country is ready to accept an
African-American, I don't think there will be any problem with
someone being Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders also said they think Lieberman will help the
Democrats attract voters in key states such as Florida and New
Jersey, while maintaining Democratic strength in Midwestern states,
which have fewer Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't traveled in the Midwest for a while, so I don't
know, but we'll find out if we have to worry,'' said Assembly
Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys. ``But it's his politics that
are where the support is, so we're excited. It adds a lot of energy
to the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg also cited CNN polls that report 94 percent of
Americans said they would vote for a Jewish, Baptist or Catholic
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in a statement, said Lieberman has
been a pleasure to work with on Capitol Hill. He speaks his mind,
she said, and has the ability to form bipartisan consensus on
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Senate, he is respected for his independence, his
civility and his ability to work with members on both sides of the
aisle to forge bipartisan agreements,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For 90-year-old Grancell Village resident Melvin Weintraub, it's
that bipartisan appeal that matters most.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more middle-of-the-road. He understands the needs of the
country and will attack them in that fashion,'' he said. ``I've
never heard anything contrary about him. He would make a wonderful
vice president.''

EDITORIAL: VETOING PRESS FREEDOM IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   In every recent election, Iranians have overwhelmingly voted for
politicians who promise to loosen theocratic controls and establish
the rule of law. But hopes for seeing that reform agenda enacted
into law diminished on Sunday when Iran's supreme religious leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, forbade Parliament to revise a restrictive
press law. By thwarting the elected Parliament, Khamenei mocks
democratic principles and invites more radical challenges to
clerical rule in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, younger voters, women, urban dwellers and other
Iranians fed up with clerical repression helped elect Mohammad
Khatami, a moderate cleric, to the presidency. But a conservative
majority in Parliament blocked many of the changes he advocated.
</P>
<P>
   After a coalition of pro-Khatami parties won a decisive
parliamentary majority in elections this February, it seemed
possible that the reformers would be able to pass legislation
delivering on their promises of increased personal and political
freedoms. But the conservatives have now shown that they are
prepared to use the veto power of the unelected clerical leader,
Khamenei, to resist changes they do not want.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers deliberately chose press freedom as an issue to
test their strength within Iran's divided political system. The
religious establishment, under Khamenei, holds ultimate authority
and directly controls the army, the courts, the security services
and broadcast outlets. But in other areas, the elected president
and the legislature have carved out some influence. The current
press law was enacted by the outgoing conservative legislature in
March. Reformers wanted to amend that law to restrict the power of
judges to close newspapers and to make it easier for journalists
from those publications that have been shut to move on to new
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have been an important element of the reform movement
in Iran. Their exposures of official links to violence and
corruption have embarrassed prominent conservatives. One
particularly bold investigative journalist, Akbar Ganji, exposed
the role of the intelligence ministry in a string of murders of
dissenting intellectuals two years ago. A conservative crackdown
earlier this year sent Ganji and other crusading journalists to
jail and has so far shut down more than 20 reform newspapers. The
latest was closed just Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the clerics have again prevailed. But the large
majority of Iranians who have consistently voted for change have
every reason to be angry and frustrated. With less than a year
remaining in President Khatami's four-year term, his efforts to
change the system appear to be dangerously stalled by a clerical
leadership that refuses to respect the will of the Iranian people.

VALLEY HOME SALES SLUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sales of single-family homes plunged 19.5 &UR;  &LR; percent
in the San Fernando Valley during July as an unseasonable cold
front buffeted the market, a trade group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The sales slowdown, the biggest annual percentage drop since a
20.1 &UR;  &LR; percent decline in December 1995, reflects rising prices and
a tight inventory, said the Van Nuys-based Southland Regional
Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, escrow closed on 1,051 previously owned, detached
homes -- 255 fewer than in July.
</P>
<P>
   While the drop is significant, both the association and analysts
note that sales counts are being compared with one of the Valley's
best years ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big drop, but we are coming off the second-strongest
year in San Fernando Valley residential real estate history, so we
have to keep it in perspective,'' said Jim Link, the association's
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   July's median price, the point at which half the homes sold for
more and half for less, increased 8.3 percent to $236,000. That's
$4,000 less than June's median but the highest for a July since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The record median of $245,000 should be surpassed later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to say whether the sales slide is a trend
or a blip, prices will continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the easy part of all this,'' John Karevoll, a market
analyst at DataQuick Information Systems Inc., said of predicting
the price curve. ``The strength of the economy and new job creation
is driving prices. The question is at what rate?''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Realtors group predicted sales would fall about
5 percent from last year's level while prices would gain between 7
percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the numbers are tracking we're pretty much going to
hit that right on the head,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   Rising prices have been pushing buyers, especially first-timers,
into the condominium market.
</P>
<P>
   During July, Realtors sold 396 condominiums, an increase of 35,
or 9.7 percent, from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The median price of $138,000 was a gain of 8.7 percent over the
past 12 months, the highest for a July since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the all-important single-family sector slumped last
month, agents remain upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strong market with no signs of fundamental weakness
on the horizon. Indeed, this may represent the kind of activity
we'll see for several years to come -- very busy with just enough
restraint on resale prices to prevent them from rising into the
stratosphere,'' noted association President R.E. ``Mitch'' Davis.
</P>
<P>
   While sales took a hit last month, they still broke the 1,000
barrier for the fifth consecutive time this year.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger concern is the inventory.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last month there were 5,040 active listings,
nearly 15 percent fewer than a year ago. That's less than a
four-month housing supply at the current sales pace.
</P>
<P>
   A market of the Valley's size should have about a six-month
supply.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Karevoll said more homes could soon come on the
market as prices keep rising.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make sense for some homeowners to sell right now
because they would not make enough money on the transaction for a
down payment on a nicer home. Rising prices will change that
thinking, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very close to a threshold as we speak we may be in the
process of crossing it -- where homeowners can walk away from the
sale with enough money to make it feasible. They couldn't do that
three or four months ago,'' Karevoll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen this happen in other areas and once that line is
crossed, a huge amount of inventory goes on the market and we feel
certain it will happen sometime this fall.''

 GORE SELECTS ANTIDOTE TO GOP ATTACK  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joe Lieberman went to bed Sunday night convinced
that he was not going to be on the Democratic ticket. Al Gore went
to sleep knowing otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, whose quest for the White House spans more
than a dozen years, knows that Lieberman is the Democratic antidote
to every venomous argument made by Republicans last week in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In speech after speech, the GOP portrayed Democrats as spoiled
Baby Boomers, driven by polls, seduced by the trappings of power
and lacking the ethical moorings to preside over the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is apparently gambling that such charges will have a hard
time penetrating a ticket containing Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's liabilities were evident to the pundits, whom
Lieberman acknowledged he spent too much time listening to over the
weekend; he comes from a region of the country that is already
solidly Democratic; his conservative voting record bothers
liberals; and his Judaism is a political risk that is hard to
calculate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Republicans are trying to make the 2000 campaign about
character. And no one questions Lieberman's honor or his devotion
to public service. No one can accuse him of being a ``smash mouth''
campaigner from the attack-dog school of politics. And no one will
say of him what Texas Gov. George W. Bush said of Gore last week:
that he is ``running in borrowed clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman has an identifiable moral compass,'' said the
Rev. Lou Sheldon, the social conservative who has attacked
Democrats over so much as a sniff of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who is independent,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif. ``He goes by an inner compass that guides him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will be sharp disagreements over the direction
of that compass.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon condemned Lieberman's support for legal abortions, gay
rights and social spending.
</P>
<P>
   Many liberals are disappointed by Lieberman's support for
vouchers, school prayer, the death penalty, his opposition to a gas
tax and his inclination to allow workers to privately invest their
Social Security savings. Lieberman is a devotee of the centrist
Democratic Leadership Council at a time when Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader is threatening to take votes from the party's liberal
base.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lieberman is seen as a Democrat who has been able to stay
above the partisan fray, and his inclusion on the ticket deprives
Republicans of the moral high road that they signaled in
Philadelphia would be a central part of their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman is a good man, who certainly has the personality
and temperament of a statesman,'' said David Keene, chairman of the
American Conservative Union, who gave Lieberman a ``worst and
dimmest'' award last year based on 25 votes cast against
``conservative'' causes.
</P>
<P>
   Through the final days, Gore considered a number of running
mates, including war heroes, women, liberals and promising young
party stars. But ultimately he settled on a man who, among other
things, would inoculate him against the moral failings of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cleansing choice, a
separating-from-Bill-Clinton-choice,'' said California state
Assemblywoman Carole Midgen, D-San Francisco, a member of the
National Democratic Committee and a strong Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
   After President Clinton's admission in August 1998 that he had
misled the nation and had an ``inappropriate'' relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, Lieberman was the first Democrat to take to the
Senate floor, and in his deliberate, gravelly voice, said: ``Such
behavior is not only inappropriate, it is immoral and it is
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong and unacceptable and should be followed by some
measure of public rebuke and accountability,'' said Lieberman, who
had been a close friend of Clinton for 30 years since he first ran
for state Senate from New Haven and Clinton was a young volunteer
in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Lieberman's harsh words may have helped save
Clinton, by providing Democrats an example of how they could
condemn his behavior without calling for his ouster. Lieberman
voted against removing Clinton from office and was persuaded by
Democratic leaders to drop his push for a censure.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's moral approach to politics, rooted in his religion
and his belief that government service is a high calling, is
outlined in his recent book ``In Praise of Public Life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Lieberman calls on public figures to make decisions
about their personal life based not upon the calculation ``Is it
legal?'' but upon the question ``Is it right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When public figures begin to separate these two questions, the
foundation of trust between the people and their leaders is
compromised,'' Lieberman writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume that everything I do in my life _ everything _ could
possibly become public, and therefore I should not do anything
privately that I could not justify publicly,'' he continues.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman argues that the public's distaste for politics is
partly the responsibility of negative campaigning, which he equates
to ``Kmart launching an all-out advertising offensive against
Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart doing the same in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net effect would be that fewer people would shop at either
place,'' he concludes. Lieberman also finds blame for the media,
which he accuses of turning every policy argument into a political
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when politicians shun politics, Lieberman is
unapologetic about his calling, arguing that term limits are
shortsighted and that calling someone a ``professional'' politician
should be a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same is true with a neurologist, or an architect, or a
hairstylist,'' he writes. ``Why should we ask any less of the
people who run our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's voting record and character will now be subject to a
new level of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening paragraphs of his book, Lieberman tells of
regular phone calls from his mother after she reads critical
accounts of him in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetheart, do you really need this?'' his mother asks him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mom,'' he responds. ``I really do need this. I love it.''

AD ACTORS DRAMATIZE STRIKE

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In their biggest show of strength since going on
strike in May, 2,000 actors marched through Hollywood on Monday
after being urged by union leaders to stand strong in their
contract dispute with advertisers over TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The actors who packed the Hollywood Palladium for the two-hour,
members-only rally were reassured that the unions have a strategy
to win the strike, justifying the work stoppage by some 135,000
actors -- about a quarter of them in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, they finally put a face on the enemy with
the mathematics. They just broke it down: Here's what they're
offering, and here's the real math,'' said striking actor S.A.
Griffin, one of five union actors on a hunger strike. ``It's a huge
pay cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers say the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation
of Television and Radio Actors are being unreasonable in rejecting
what advertisers say amounts to a 17 percent pay raise for the
typical commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to negotiate at any time, but they have to come
back to the table to modernize the contract and negotiate over our
offer,'' said Ira Shepard, an ad industry negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 15th week, the strike is the longest in the history
of the unions, and there are no scheduled talks or resolution in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The unions went on strike May 1, and an effort by federal
mediators to get the two sides talking again proved unsuccessful
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The core issue is whether actors will be paid residuals or a
flat fee. The actors want residuals for cable-TV ads, as they are
now paid for network spots, while the advertising industry favors
the flat-fee system used in cable for networks as well. Both sides
are also wrangling over control of Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   During the rally Monday, Todd Amorde, chairman of the unions'
National Strike Committee, announced that he will meet with AFL-CIO
representatives in Washington on Wednesday to enlist their help in
the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to identify corporate leaders who sit on the
advertisers' negotiating committee and target their companies with
further picketing and boycotts, Amorde said.
</P>
<P>
   `'We're going to keep turning up the heat,'' Amorde said.
``There's no secret that we're on strike against corporate America.
We know the advertising agencies take their cues from their
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the ad industry, Shepard said the unions' new
strategy is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be better off focusing on the strike than trying to
further divide us,'' Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Striking actors said the rally and march made them feel more
united than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reassured me that I did the right thing,'' said Peaches
Johnson, another of the actors who were in the seventh day of a
hunger strike taking place at a house in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Griffin were given an ovation for their campaign,
Amorde said.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, actors hit the streets for three-mile march led
by Larry Hagman and others on a fire truck. Celebrities included
Hagman, Tom Bosley, Diane Ladd and Harry Hamlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was to really show our solidarity and say we plan to
stay strong in the strike and our membership is very much behind
us,'' said SAG spokeswoman Ilyanne Kichaven.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders are planning protests to coincide with the
upcoming Democratic National Convention next week in Los Angeles
but do not plan to make that a focus of their strike actions,
Kichaven said.

AD ACTORS DRAMATIZE STRIKE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In their biggest show of strength since going on
strike in May, 2,000 actors marched through Hollywood on Monday
after being urged by union leaders to stand strong in their
contract dispute with advertisers over TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The actors who packed the Hollywood Palladium for the two-hour,
members-only rally were reassured that the unions have a strategy
to win the strike, justifying the work stoppage by some 135,000
actors -- about a quarter of them in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, they finally put a face on the enemy with
the mathematics. They just broke it down: Here's what they're
offering, and here's the real math,'' said striking actor S.A.
Griffin, one of five union actors on a hunger strike. ``It's a huge
pay cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers say the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation
of Television and Radio Actors are being unreasonable in rejecting
what advertisers say amounts to a 17 percent pay raise for the
typical commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to negotiate at any time, but they have to come
back to the table to modernize the contract and negotiate over our
offer,'' said Ira Shepard, an ad industry negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 15th week, the strike is the longest in the history
of the unions, and there are no scheduled talks or resolution in
sight.

L.A. ICON RETIRES

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ There would be no buzzer- beating shots
this time, no timely last-minute maneuvers from a man who
personified the term ``clutch,'' no symbolic, halfcourt heave to
change the outcome of one dramatic, franchise-shaking decision.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, not even a farewell appearance by Jerry West
either.
</P>
<P>
   West retired Monday as the Los Angeles Lakers' basketball
operations chief, ending a 40-year tenure and a legacy unmatched in
professional sports. It concluded not with a moving send-off, but
with a brief, simply worded, five-paragraph open letter to Laker
fans.
</P>
<P>
   And that was that. West, who helped bring seven NBA
championships to L.A. as a player and executive, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers held a press conference to announce the promotions of
general manager Mitch Kupchak to head of basketball operations and
Kurt Rambis to assistant general manager. But West himself was far
from the proceedings, having cleaned out his office weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers spokesman John Black noted the absence was ``a little bit
awkward,'' but added, ``This is the way he wanted to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, reported by the Daily News last month, was not
made official until Monday morning, and members of the organization
had held out hope West would change his mind. But after suffering
an irregular heartbeat this past season, health concerns and a
desire to shred the stresses of the job won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels the pressures are tearing him down physically as well
as mentally,'' said Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn, West's close
friend for almost 40 years. ``I think he just said to himself,
`I've got to go now.' I commend him for that. . . . It's a sad day
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If West's career is truly over, he departed on a winning note,
less than two months removed from the Lakers' seventh championship.
He helped win the first as a player, the other six as a member of
the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult yet happy time for me personally,'' wrote
West, 62, adding he looked forward to ``more freedom to enjoy my
friends and particularly my family, unburdened with the pressures
of the professional athletic business.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications, however slight, that West could return.
He has a contract with owner Jerry Buss to act as a paid consultant
and will be in constant contact with Kupchak. This could turn out
to be just a break. But officially, West is retired, a fact with
which his loyal proteges were still coming to grips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me tends to look over at that door over there and
(expect to) see Jerry's face come out and (say), `I was only
kidding.' But I don't think he's only kidding today,'' said
Kupchak, who at 46 inherits one of the premier positions in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got mixed emotions about today,'' he said. ``On one hand,
the Laker organization is losing a guiding light for over 40 years.
I no longer get to stand side by side with my mentor, my confidante
and my best friend on a daily basis. That part I will miss to no
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The West era included seven championships and an lengthy string
of NBA legends _ from Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the
``Showtime'' 1980s to Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Jerry West is irreplacable. What he's meant to the
Lakers franchise over the past 40 years is immeasurable,'' Buss
said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   West singled out only three individuals in his letter,
expressing thanks to Buss and ``gratitude'' to O'Neal and Bryant
``for their belief in the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was West's signing of O'Neal and trade for Bryant in a
one-week span in the summer of 1996 that catapulted the Lakers from
their post-``Showtime'' malaise _ including two losing seasons _
back to preeminence. And aside from the personal torment West
subjected himself to daily, it was the conclusion of the Lakers'
restoration that paved the way for his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was important for him for that (``Showtime'' era)
group to retire and for him to rebuild this team from scratch,''
Kupchak said, ``and get it from the very bottom, which is where we
were several years ago with a lottery pick (in 1994), to where it
is today.''
</P>
<P>
   West's tightly wound personality didn't allow him to enjoy the
march back to greatness. He didn't attend a single game after Game
2 of the Western Conference finals and didn't even watch the Finals
on television, saying it was too stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hearn, the team's broadcaster since 1961 _ and the one who
dubbed West ``Mr. Clutch'' for his play as a Lakers guard in the
'60s and '70s _ was surprised West decided to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed he'd succumb to this,'' Hearn said. ``I
thought he was strong enough to overcome it if there were anything
there. I think he feels for his family and himself it's time to
take a one-year sabbatical, so to speak. The door is open for him
to come back, he told me that himself. . . . I've got a funny
feeling he'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, apparently not even West, knows if he will come back. He
visited Kupchak at home on Sunday night to deliver some fish he
caught on his recent Alaska vacation, and Kupchak said West never
looked more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it in his face that this is it, he's really gonna do
it,'' Kupchak said. ``Compared to where he was a month ago, he was
relaxed last night, oh yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   No one questioned the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wish him the best,'' said Lakers forward Rick Fox,
``and pray for those who run into him over at the Bel Air country
club. Now he has more time to tune his golf game up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal, on his Web site, Dunk.net, ``All good times must
come to an end. If it's not fun for him anymore, then it's time for
him to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Bill Bertka, who has spent 25 years in the
organization, including a stint in the late '60s when West was a
player, said he was ``extremely happy for him that he's made his
decision and he's at peace with himself. . . . The thing that
probably is best about it is he's leaving at the pinnacle, having
won another world championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Given West's Hall of Fame playing career and his four-decade
string of success, Bertka placed him among sport's all-time
greats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They call them icons. He's certainly an icon of professional
basketball, as Lombardi was in football and John Wooden in college
basketball and Babe Ruth to baseball and Jim Thorpe to track and
field,'' Bertka said. ``He's one of the most significant, one of
the true superstars of the game. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not only one of the greatest of basketball players,
then he turns around and becomes one of the greatest of executives,
because of the goals he establishes for himself.''

ANGELS RELEASE HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels released veteran
right-hander Ken Hill Monday, citing his lack of consistency on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days I felt good, some days I didn't,'' Hill said. ``I've
had pain (from arthritis) in my elbow for three years and it ain't
going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Manager Mike Scioscia: ``We saw glimpses of what he could
do . . . but he couldn't maintain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt he could still pitch, Hill answered,
emphatically, ``Yeah, I can still pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was in the last year of a three-year $16.05 million
contract which paid him $5.6 million this season. The Angels must
eat just under $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of a lot of things,'' general manager Bill
Stoneman said. ``I can't say enough about Ken's effort . . . but
the results just weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was 5-7 with a 6.52 earned run average in 16 starts. He had
been scheduled to make start No. 17 tonight against the Boston Red
Sox and Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who has a 117-107 record with eight shutouts in a 12-year,
five-team career, was 22-28 with the Angels. One of his wins was a
two-hitter against Texas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He also went on the disabled list eight times, including four
times since coming to Anaheim and once this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he certainly would listen to a proposal from a
contending club, otherwise, he said, ``I'll just go home to
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Baby-faced staff: The Angels' pitching suddenly has the look
of a young-boys choir. The 34-year-old Hill is now out of the
picture, along with Kent Bottenfield, 31, who was traded away last
month; Tim Belcher, 38, and Kent Mercker, 32, remain on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn, who started Monday night's game, is the oldest
of the new breed. He'll turn 27 Sunday. Scott Schoeneweiss is 26,
Ramon Ortiz 24 and Matt Wise 24. Brian Cooper, who was optioned
Monday to Triple-A Edmonton but will soon return, will be 27 Aug.
19.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Tim Salmon was selected AL player of the week
after batting .583 (14 for 24) with two homers, a triple and four
doubles. Salmon is the third Angel honored this season, joining
Darin Erstad (twice) and Mo Vaughn. . . . Left-hander Kent Mercker,
who suffered a life-threatening cerebral hemorrhage in mid-May,
will continue his comeback Wednesday night with a rehab start for
Triple-A Edmonton in a Pacific Coast League game at Tucson.
Scioscia said Mercker will throw between 75 and 80 pitches. If all
goes well, Mercker will rejoin the club this weekend and might even
be activated for the series against the New York Yankees. . . .
Disabled reliever Troy Percival underwent an MRI exam Monday, which
confirmed the original diagnosis of tendinitis in his right elbow.

EL POLLO TO OPEN FLOCK OF SITES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Building to meet the growing numbers of people
crazy for fast-food chicken, El Pollo Loco announced Monday a major
expansion of its company-owned and franchised restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The company will open 10 to 20 new locations in the San Fernando
Valley and an additional 80 to 90 locations in the Southwest within
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The chain already has 25 Valley restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a targeted market for us,'' said Brian Berkhausen, vice
president of development. ``We've been very successful there.
Whenever we've opened restaurants in the San Fernando Valley,
they've performed well. The community is receptive to us.''
</P>
<P>
   El Pollo Loco opened its first Valley location in 1984. Since
then, the company has built two or three restaurants in the Valley
each year, Berkhausen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going forward, we are going to continue to build the brand in
that market with quality site locations and quality operators,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   El Pollo Loco now has 272 restaurants -- 122 are company-owned
and the remaining 150 are franchises. The 100 new restaurants are
expected to be about half company-owned and half franchises and
will increase the company's locations by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine-based El Pollo Loco reported sales of $291 million in the
year ending June 28. That's up 12.4 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Olsen, communications manager for the California
Restaurant Association, said the market looks very good for El
Pollo Loco and other alternative fast-food restaurants right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more Americans are eating out, and more and more are
taking food home from quick-service facilities or restaurants as an
alternative to cooking,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hendrickson, research director of B. Riley &AMP; Co. in Santa
Monica, said some publicly traded restaurants had seen their stock
prices beaten down because of labor market shortages. Investors
fear restaurants' earnings will decrease if they are forced to pay
more to attract staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are just as busy as ever, so the trend to fast food
and convenient locations is one that's not going to go away no
matter what happens to the labor market,'' Hendrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Since El Pollo Loco is privately held by American Securities
Capital Partners, a New York-based investment group, it is not
required to report earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Executives attributed its strong sales growth partly to adding
restaurants, but changes in its menu also played a role.
</P>
<P>
   El Pollo Loco had a strong dinner business built on the chicken
meals. Its lunch business has been increasing since the chain
introduced more portable meals such as its chicken bowls, tostada
bowls and specialty burritos.
</P>
<P>
   The menu has garnered wide appeal: Berkhausen recalled seeing a
television star eating next to a table of maintenance workers.
``It's quality fast food that doesn't break the bank,'' Berkhausen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is implementing a new recruiting and training
program for employees and is advertising for experienced
restaurateurs to operate franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had hundreds of inquiries,'' Berkhausen said. ``Now
we're trying to find the best candidates with the best experience
and the best fit. We look at financial and business history and
experience and cultural fit within our company. We want people with
philosophies of providing quality products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to California, El Pollo Loco has restaurants in
Arizona, Nevada and Texas.

IT'S KUPCHAK'S TURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Mitch Kupchak is measured, soft-spoken and
deliberate. Methodical, and some will say even conservative. But
there are moments now and then when he gets passionate, maybe even
a bit frenetic, and his wife, Claire, sees another personality come
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, she has mentioned a couple times, that `You're
starting to act just like Jerry,' '' Kupchak relates with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison to his friend and mentor, Jerry West, is taken as
a compliment. And Kupchak is eager to continue earning such
comparisons _ presumably more for his bold and successful
management of the Los Angeles Lakers than for those occasional fits
of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old Kupchak was elevated Monday to the head of
basketball operations, succeeding the retired West. If West's
departure sent waves through the organization and the league,
Kupchak's ascension hardly caused a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, when Kupchak joined the front office, he has been
moving, step by step, toward this day. It has been taken as a given
that Kupchak would one day succeed West, and that made for a smooth
transition when owner Jerry Buss made the promotion official
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, Kupchak has learned at West's side. For the last
two seasons, in particular, he has been taking on greater
responsibility and exerting more influence over day-to-day
operations. At every stage, Kupchak has been groomed for the job by
the man many consider the best executive in pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Laker fans hope that somewhere along the line,
somehow, someway, some of Jerry's magic has found its way to me
over the years,''Kupchak said. ``And I also feel after 14 years of
working with Jerry that nobody can be more prepared than I am for
this job right now. And I embrace the opportunity and I look
forward to working and walking in Jerry West's footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak, who retains his title as general manager, has
three-plus years left on his existing contract _ a deal he signed
in 1998 when he nearly left to take over the Denver Nuggets. There
have been many such opportunities for the highly regarded Kupchak,
but each time he has chosen to stay with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Now all he has to do is replace a living legend.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed unfazed at the prospect, however, knowing he inherits
a team well positioned for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   They have just won a championship, stars Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant are under contract for several years and coach Phil
Jackson has four years remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very good news is that the cupboard is full, not unlike it
was 12 to 14 years ago when we had Magic (Johnson) and Kareem
(Abdul-Jabbar),'' Kupchak said. ``We have two pretty good players
on this team that my hope is they'd be around for a long time. And
that will provide the people in this city and our owner with a lot
of comfort, knowing that going forward we're going to win a bunch
of games. And each move in a team like this is a crucial and a
critical move. But by and large, when you have those two players,
the organization is in pretty good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask those who know Kupchak well, and they'll offer the same
assessment. He is respected around the league and well-liked within
the organization. And significantly, he's the one West wanted to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost respect for and confidence in Mitch
Kupchak,'' Buss said in a prepared statement. ``He is Jerry West's
hand-picked successor and was trained by the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say the passionate, ever-stressed-out West is much more
impulsive than Kupchak, who admits he's more likely to take his
time making a decision. But Kupchak said he and West have similar
eyes for talent _ a quality he referred to as West's ``gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 lesson he learned from West? ``To follow your gut
instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's totally prepared,'' longtime Lakers broadcaster
Chick Hearn said. ``I think he's a totally different personality. I
think he's slower to make a judgment. . . . I have great faith in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak's first moves could come quickly, although neither one
will involve acquiring a much-needed power forward. The Lakers are
on the verge of signing, or trading for, Nets swingman Kendall
Gill, and are pursuing former Lakers forward Cedric Ceballos, now
with Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the Lakers have offered center Travis Knight and
guard Tyronn Lue for Ceballos, who has one year left on his
contract. But they have bigger concerns as well, primarily
frontcourt depth and what to do with unsigned free agent Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak knows the credit and blame for such matters are now his
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So to a degree, the pressure that goes along with that
position is there, and there's no doubt about it,'' he said. ``But
it is the most challenging and the most satisfying part of the job.
And it's really the part that I look forward to.''

UNION WORKERS WILL KEEP PEACE DURING CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; With an agreement guaranteeing labor peace inside
next week's Democratic National Convention, organizers Monday
seemingly had a united message: Let the hype begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the greatest convention of this century and last
century,'' declared Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the convention
committee. ``It is being held in the greatest state, in the
greatest city, in the greatest arena. This will be the convention
that people remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. Gray Davis, not known for overenthusiasm, got caught
up in McAuliffe's spirit after witnessing some three dozen
volunteers handpainting signs for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the best Democratic convention we have ever seen,
and it will be far different than what the Republicans did in
Philadelphia,'' Davis said. ``The nation will see the real Al Gore
and see us talk about real issues of importance to the American
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Los Angeles police arrested four people from the
Ruckus Society who were attempting to hang a banner from the
Figueroa Hotel, which directly faces Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the banner was a depiction of the American flag
with corporate logos across it. The banner was to have covered an
Apple Computer mural with the theme of ``Think Different'' and
images of the late President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Eleanor
Roosevelt, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and labor leader Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Staples Center President Tim Liewecke signed
a labor peace agreement with Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer
of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, and
representatives of a dozen unions that have workers at the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came up with the concept of Staples Center, it was
always with the idea of working with the unions,'' Liewecke said.
``We did this not to win the Democratic convention, but as a goal
toward helping working people.''
</P>
<P>
   From the union's standpoint, Contreras said it sent an important
message to union workers in the city as well as to the Democratic
Party nationally even though the agreement affects a maximum of
about 3,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will guarantee labor peace inside Staples Center and the
Convention Center, where all the workers will be union workers,''
Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, he said it would not stop local
unions from protesting such as at the Loew's Santa Monica Beach
Hotel, which will be the home of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee and where, coincidentally, union organizers feel
their efforts have been blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while national labor leaders have pledged to not have any
massive disruptions of the convention, Contreras said he believed
many would come out and join various protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-third of the delegates are from labor, and I'm sure they
want to show their support to co-workers,'' Contreras said.

IN THE END, WEST WENT OUT ON OWN TERMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he departed Monday for his annual two-week summer vacation at
the Greenbrier golf resort in his native West Virginia, Jerry West
had to be in an euphoric mood, or at least as close to such a
blissful state as his frayed nerves will allow.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Los Angeles Lakers finally made official what he had
done several weeks ago and what he had threatened to do on several
other occasions in recent years _ resign as the team's executive
vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he had visited his cardiologist earlier in the week and
been pronounced in perfect health, meaning there were no signs of
the irregular heartbeat that had plagued him during the playoffs
and that had even kept him from attending any of the Lakers' games
during the NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Lakers owner Jerry Buss had emphasized to West during a
recent meeting that his old position always would be open to him at
the same $4 million annual salary and that Buss still would like to
confer with West at least twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, West had worked out an amicable severance
agreement with Buss, which some insiders believe to be in the $6
million range. This was a particularly generous gesture by an owner
known to be committed to cutting his payroll and not legally
obligated to give West anything since West voluntarily forfeited
the opportunity to finish out the three years he had left on his
Lakers contract.
</P>
<P>
   So, Jerry West, whose 40-year incumbency with the Lakers spans
nine American presidents and dramatic demographic and sociological
changes in the Los Angeles area, whose dominant presence here as a
player and executive across four decades have made him among the
most revered sporting icons in Southern California history, is
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not for long.
</P>
<P>
   As his former teammate and longtime friend, Elgin Baylor, said,
``I look for Jerry to take a year off and then come back again.
Basketball is too much in his blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, West is now secure and doesn't have to work again
if he so chooses, especially after the deserving bonus he received
from Buss for his exemplary work as a Lakers executive _ he was
responsible for putting together four world-championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   West always has lived within his means and has made sound
investments over the years. His major concessions to wealth are the
home he owns in Bel Air and the membership he has in the Bel Air
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   There will be loud media debates over the real reason West has
decided to skip out on the Lakers after a 67-win,
world-championship season in which the two men he maneuvered to
obtain in 1996, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, played the most
important roles.
</P>
<P>
   There are some pundits who insist that the presence of the
strong-willed Phil Jackson pushed West over the precipice, that
Jackson's spouting off publicly about his need for a power forward
and his well-chronicled exhibition-season desire for Ron Harper
were a cultural shock to West.
</P>
<P>
   After all, West had always been accustomed to making all the
Laker roster moves himself and to previous coaches like Mike
Dunleavy, Randy Pfund, Del Harris, Kurt Rambis and even Pat Riley
remaining silent on such matters.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm sure West felt uneasy about Jackson's public candor,
I'm not sure he was so upset about it that it inspired his
resignation at a time when the Lakers might be on the threshold of
another Showtime-like dynasty with the 28-year-old O'Neal and
21-year-old Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   West continually confided to me throughout the past season that
he had no problems working with Jackson, and that he had tremendous
respect for Jackson as a coach. Remember, West endorsed Jackson
strongly to Buss as the person Buss should hire to succeed Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   And it also must not be forgotten that Jerry West had come close
to departing the Lakers twice in recent years before Jackson even
came aboard _ only to reluctantly change his mind both times at the
final moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I quit, people are going to say that it was
because I didn't get along with Phil Jackson _ and that's just a
lie,'' said West. ``I'm quitting because I want to keep living.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the overwhelming feeling here that serious health concerns
compelled Jerry West finally to bid farewell to the Lakers, with,
incidentally, Buss' blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I've been told from one Lakers insider that Buss
actually told West at their last meeting, ``I think it's a good
idea you're getting away from it awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that the same maniacal competitive juices that
fueled West as a player _ and he was such an extraordinary player
as a guard with the Lakers that his likeness now adorns the NBA
logo _ also carried over when he joined management.
</P>
<P>
   Before doctors advised him to stop attending playoff games, West
would sit in Buss' Staples Center suite and nervously watch the
Lakers perform, fidgeting throughout the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how a drug addict has to keep doing more and more
drugs to catch the high he once got,'' he once told me. ``Well, in
a weird way, that's happened to me. Basketball is my drug and it's
just become a greater strain for me as each season passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't wait to live a normal life, to not get bugged all
the time by the press, to not worry about if the Lakers win or
lose. I'd just like to take some time off, and fish and play golf
and enjoy life without all the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   And so this is what Jerry West has done.

COMPUTER ASSOCIATES RESHUFFLES ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for a way to bolster its sagging stock, Computer
Associates International reassigned senior managers on Monday and
said it intended to use spin-offs or other strategies to tap the
value of fast-growing units that are currently overshadowed by the
company's main businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The management changes start at the top with Charles B. Wang,
the company's founder, turning over the job of chief executive to
Sanjay Kumar, who had been president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wang (whose name rhymes with ``long'') will continue as
chairman. He will devote his attention to creating new ventures for
the company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y., and is a leader in
software for mainframe computers and management of large networks,
including data storage and security.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other management changes were related to the
formation, announced Monday, of iCan-ASP Inc., which will include
Computer Associates' fast-growing collection of technology for
so-called application service providers. Such companies, known as
ASP's, provide services including accounting, e-mail and data
processing to other companies over the Internet. Nancy Li, who is
chief technology officer of Computer Associates, will become chief
executive of iCan-ASP.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates said it was studying the best way to spin
off iCan-ASP. Computer Associates also affirmed its plan to
eventually spin off ACCPAC, which provides accounting software for
desktop computers, and said that it was looking for ways to get
more value out of its telecommunications joint ventures. It has
retained Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
as advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to unlock the value and the talent of this company,''
said Wang, the company's 55-year-old founder, whose personal
fortune has declined by more than $1.2 billion as Computer
Associates shares have fallen from their 52-week high of $79.4375
to below $24 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted with little enthusiasm to what many analysts
described as minor tinkering. The company provided no financial
details on the size of the ventures it intended to spin off, other
than to say that their total revenues were small enough that it
expected to make them up through growth in other businesses. It
told analysts not to revise their estimates for the year. Computer
Associates' shares edged up $2.3125, to $27.625 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is looking for better performance out of the core
business,'' said Kevin M. Buttigieg, who follows the company for
PaineWebber. ``They didn't really address that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Buttigieg said the company's biggest problem was a ``Y2K
hangover.'' Many customers bought more large computers like IBM's
390 series than they needed while modernizing their systems to
avoid Year 2000 computer disruptions. Until the sales of such
hardware pick up again, Computer Associates and others that provide
software for such computers will face a tough market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slow sales forced Computer Associates to warn Wall Street in
June that its quarter ending June 30 would produce disappointing
results. In late July, it reported net income of just $23 million
on revenues of $1.14 billion for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar, who is 38, said that the reorganization would be
accompanied by more focused marketing in the core businesses,
including a plan to assign some research workers to the field sales
force to help close sales in new areas like software applications
for Internet portals. The company will also start providing Wall
Street with more financial information on fast-growing segments
that it wants investors to pay more attention to, said Kumar,
citing Computer Associates' $900 million in network-management
revenues as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much sitting under the C.A. umbrella that we are
not getting credit for,'' Kumar said.

LOYAL LAKER RAMBIS EMBRACES NEW ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ With a new job comes a fresh look for Kurt
Rambis, who ditched his famous glasses 11 days ago thanks to laser
eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, the Los Angeles Lakers' new assistant general manager,
says it's much easier now to see which way the waves are breaking
when he's out surfing. Of course, Lakers' fans hope Rambis'
improved eyesight enables him to uncover talented players, which
he'll be counted on to do under director of basketball operations
Mitch Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   So does Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure hope so,'' Rambis said Monday at a press conference
announcing team president Jerry West's retirement after 40 years
with the club, the elevation of Kupchak to top man and the addition
of Rambis as his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   For Rambis _ the loyal Lakers company man who has served in
every imaginable role with the team _ going from player to
assistant coach to head coach and most recently advisor to owner
Dr. Jerry Buss, the first task might be locating his new office and
not reporting to the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about my new job and I'm very excited about
getting my fourth set of business cards from this franchise,''
Rambis joked.
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, Rambis seems prepared for his new job. He
certainly didn't waste time as Buss' advisor. He used that
opportunity to study the complicated NBA salary cap, perhaps to the
point of mastering it, if that's humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' cap knowledge will be invaluable to Kupchak as they plot
the Lakers' future together with Buss and Phil Jackson. Rambis will
also handle most of the day-to-day operation such as training camp,
practice sites, practice games and scouting, freeing up Kupchak to
concentrate on personnel issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cap is something that, probably in the last year or so,
Kurt has gone from not knowing much about it to really being pretty
proficient in it,'' Kupchak said. ``Just in the last three or four
weeks working together, he's shown me how much he's learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis was nothing if not resourceful as a player, so it's no
surprise he set aside any bitterness when the Lakers passed on him
as head coach after his ill-fated, half-season interim stint in
1998-99. He left the bench but not the organization, turning down
other offers to stay on as an advisor to Buss, who's always
considerd Rambis one of his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak and Rambis' friendship goes all the way back to 1981,
when they started their Lakers careers together. The cozy
relationship mirrors that of the one West and Kupchak enjoyed and
should make the transition period easier.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak looks forward to working with his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt played the game, he coached the game, he's broadcast the
game and he's played for different teams and different coaches,''
Kupchak said. ``The experience level that he brings to the
organization and what he'll bring to me on a daily basis is
something that, within an organization, you just can't go out on
the street, look for and find in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis hasn't ruled out a return to coaching, but for now he's
content in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting to be learning and helping out the business
aspect of running the franchise,'' Rambis said. ``And I hope Mitch
will listen to some of my gut instincts too, as he follows his
own.''

DODGERS LOSE THIRD STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ah, the soft part of the schedule. You know, the
Philadelphia Phillies, the Milwaukee Brewers, the Chicago Cubs. The
teams good teams beat upon.
</P>
<P>
   If the Los Angeles Dodgers hadn't beaten Pittsburgh two out of
three, think where they would be.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Dodgers' so-called easy portion of the schedule is
proving to be nothing of the sort as setbacks to anemic teams add
up. The latest was a 7-3 loss to the Cubs in the opener of a three-
game series Monday at Dodger Stadium in which rookie Matt Herges
pitched well in his first major-league start but had nothing to
show for it.
</P>
<P>
   He was outpitched by Cubs rookie Ruben Quevedo, who won for the
first time in his major-league career. Quevedo (1-3) allowed seven
hits and pitched a complete-game as the Dodgers (58-53) dropped
their third straight.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning three of four at Colorado and being poised to make
a run at first place in the National League West, the Dodgers have
dropped six of 10 to the Phillies, Pirates, Brewers and Cubs. That
quartet entered Monday a combined 56 games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa led off the ninth with a towering
homer to right-center field. It was his 35th of the season, tying
him with the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield for the major-league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Herges (8-1) was inserted into the starting rotation after a
magnificent four months in which he went 8-0 with a 3.00 ERA in 44
appearances as a reliever. However, when lefty Carlos Perez had
trouble in his last two starts, it was Herges whom manager Davey
Johnson turned to.
</P>
<P>
   Herges pitched well, yielding three runs on five hits in six
innings, but he still saw his winning streak end at eight. It was
the best start by a rookie since Livan Hernandez won his first nine
decisions in 1997. With eight straight wins, Herges also equaled
the best start by a pitcher since Fernando Valenzuela began the
1981 season 8-0. Pedro Martinez was the last Dodger to win eight
straight decisions, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave Herges a 1-0 lead in the first inning, but it
could have been much more. Tom Goodwin led off with a single and
scored on Mark Grudzielanek's double to the right-center field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek went to third on Quevedo's errant pick-off throw
but then was caught straying too far from third on Gary Sheffield's
bouncer back to Quevedo. Grudzielanek was tagged out at the plate
and Sheffield compounded the problem when he was caught between
first and second to complete the double play.
</P>
<P>
   The only inning Herges had difficulty in was the third. He
allowed a leadoff single to Jeff Reed and Eric Young's one-out
single put runners on first and second. Ricky Gutierrez put the
Cubs ahead 2-1 with a triple to right-center field and he scored on
Mark Grace's sacrifice fly to give the Cubs a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still-slumping Shawn Green, who began the day batting .274,
connected for his 20th homer of the season on the first pitch he
saw from Quevedo in the fourth inning to pull the Dodgers within
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's one-out single in the fifth presented the opportunity
for him to showcase his speed, but he was thrown out trying to
steal second.
</P>
<P>
   Herges reached his pitch-count after six innings (he threw 79
pitches) and was relieved by right-hander Antonio Osuna, who
quickly allowed the Cubs to build upon their lead. Young walked
with one out and Gutierrez followed with a two-run homer as Chicago
went up 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs extended their lead to 6-2 in the eighth as Osuna, who
was unavailable Sunday because of illness, continued to have
problems. He caught a break when Quevedo bunted into a double play
with two on and none out, but he couldn't capitalize and allowed a
run-scoring single by Young.

ANGELS VICTORY COSTLY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jarrod Washburn returned from the disabled
list Monday night, hoping to shoulder some of the load on a
suddenly attrition-laden Anaheim Angels pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he left in the sixth inning with a sore one, continuing
an alarming trend by Angels pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But Washburn stayed around long enough to earn the win in the
Angels' 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox before 23,078 fans at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant hit two home runs and Mo Vaughn hit one as the Angels
ended their season-high five-game losing streak while handing the
Red Sox their third loss in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn is the closest thing the Angels have to an ace. The
win, his fourth in a row, was his seventh of the season, tying him
for the club lead. It was also the fourth time he's followed a loss
with a win.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't known immediately how serious Washburn's latest injury
might be. What is known the Angels can ill afford losing him again,
especially now.
</P>
<P>
   In little more than a week _ eight days, to be precise _ the
Angels have one way or another lost seven pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Sunday they traded Kent Bottenfield to Philadelphia
in exchange for Gant. No arguing that deal at the moment, not after
Gant's two homers Monday night, his first in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, reliever Al Levine was placed on the disabled
list. Saturday, two more were on the DL: Troy Percival, their
closer, and Seth Etherton, one of their starters.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Monday. First, veteran Ken Hill, who was 5-7 with a
6.62 earned run average, was released. The immediate pain from that
development was felt mostly in the wallet; the Angels still owe him
nearly $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Brian Cooper, who had served up 16 home runs, roughly two
for every nine innings he worked, was demoted to make room on the
roster for Washburn's return from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Some return. It lasted all of 71 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring Bernard Gilkey on a grounder for the first out in
the sixth inning, Washburn immediately walked to the side of the
mound, holding his left arm, bringing Angels manager Mike Scioscia
and trainer Ned Bergert out of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   A sore left shoulder was the reason given for Washburn's early
departure. Whether that had anything to do with the strained left
biceps that had him on the disabled list the past two weeks was not
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek took over and worked two scoreless innings,
followed by Mike Holtz, who walked the only batter he faced.
Shigetoshi Hasegawa came in and pitched out of a mini-jam in the
eighth, then the ninth for his fourth save. It extended Hasegawa's
scoreless streak to 24 consecutive innings.
</P>
<P>
   The four Angels pitchers restricted the Red Sox to just five
hits. Nomar Garciaparra, who came in with a major league-leading
.394 average, was hitless in three at-bats with a walk, dropping
his average to .390.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels collected 10 hits, including one by Darin Erstad,
ending his season-high 0-for-13 drought, and two by Tim Salmon, who
extended his hitting streak to 15 games, matching his career best.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's two-out homer in the first inning gave the Angels their
quick lead. It was his 26th homer of the season but his first in 17
days, and the first he's hit against Boston since leaving the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Gant hit his first homer with two outs in the fourth, his first
extra-base hit since coming to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Both homers came off of Boston starter Tomo Ohka, who pitched a
perfect game earlier this season in the Triple-A International
League and was making only his third big league start.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox cut the Angels' lead to 2-1 with a run in the fifth,
on a walk to Ed Sprague, a double by Brian Daubach and an infield
out by Mike Lansing that scored Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Gant then homered again in the sixth, and the Angels added a run
in the eighth, when Adam Kennedy walked and eventually scored on an
infield out by Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed a timely end to the Angels' slide. Tonight they'll
face the Red Sox's Pedro Martinez and his stingy 1.42 earned run
average.

WHITE WANTS MALONE'S EAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Devon White sought
manager Davey Johnson for a hallway meeting Monday to once again
discuss his role, which has changed since Tom Goodwin's arrival a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   White got the same answer he was given when he met with Johnson
a week ago in Pittsburgh _ he was going to be the fourth outfielder
and start when Gary Sheffield or Shawn Green need a rest.
</P>
<P>
   But White, a 14-year veteran and seven-time Gold Glove winner,
is bothered that general manager Kevin Malone hasn't talked to him
personally since Goodwin's arrival. It was Malone who inked White
to a three-year, $12.6 million contract after the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he reiterated to White that the speedy Goodwin
would make the majority of starts because the club needs his
leadoff ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Malone doesn't owe me (anything),'' White said. ``But I
think a veteran would have gotten respect that (front office
personnel) can come down and tell (a player) what's going on. I've
been here for three days now and he hasn't made an effort to come
down, and I'm not going up to his office because that's not my
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I've never been in the position where management
hasn't told me (the plans), so I don't know what the future plan
is. So we have to wait and see what comes up. I did speak to Davey,
but Malone didn't come down here and tell me what the scoop was.
Not that he has to, but I think as a veteran player, I deserve that
much respect.''
</P>
<P>
   White's agent, Eric Goldschmidt, spoke with Malone via telephone
Monday to discuss White's role. Goldschmidt and Malone were
scheduled to meet today, but that meeting might not happen.
</P>
<P>
   When Goodwin was acquired in a trade for Todd Hollandsworth at
the trading deadline, the Dodgers were on the road and Malone was
in Los Angeles. When the club returned home Friday, Malone left to
watch the Dodgers' Double-A affiliate in San Antonio. He returned
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manager talks to his team. (White) plays for the
manager,'' Malone said. ``I have a whole organization to run. I've
been out of town in Texas for four days. That's really not my role.
My understanding was he understood what his role is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wants to play and it'll work itself out. He's
frustrated. Right now we're going to see what Goodwin can do and
try to keep everybody fresh down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Perez's position: Dodgers lefty Carlos Perez was pulled from
the starting rotation, and though he doesn't like it, he said he's
willing to do whatever the club wants.
</P>
<P>
   However, Perez still doesn't appreciate finding out about the
move only when he was questioned by reporters last Wednesday in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that was the right thing,'' said Perez, who
pitched 5 scoreless inning of relief Sunday but hasnt won since May
20. ``If you're the manager, you're supposed to come to me and tell
me. Call me into your office and tell me, `OK, we're going to make
a move.' That's fine. But that was a big surprise when (reporters)
came to me and told me what's going on. I didn't even know what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Team sources said Perez not only trashed the clubhouse after
being pulled after four innings in his last start, against
Pittsburgh, but he also got into a profanity-laced shouting match
with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Left fielder Gary Sheffield returned to the
starting lineup after missing one game with a jammed right thumb. .
. . Utility player F.P. Santangelo served the last of his five-game
suspension Monday and is eligible for tonight's game against the
Cubs.

SHE STRUGGLES WITH A SMILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Alexandra Stevenson flashes an
easy-going smile, as every 19-year-old should, but the pleasant
facade masks the growing pains that have dominated not only her
tennis game, but also her life of the past 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I saw my friends who are in college, and I said,
`I feel about five years older than you guys,' '' Stevenson said
after defeating Silvija Talaja of Croatia 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 Monday in
the first round of the estyle.com Classic at Manhattan Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're living in a different hotel every week . . . and
lugging your luggage around the airport. Everybody thinks it's
glamorous, and it's not. They think it's all limousines and
chocolate, and it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely you remember Stevenson, the Wunderkind of the last year's
Wimbledon, the first female qualifier to reach the tournament's
semifinals and the center of a publicity firestorm after it was
learned she is the daughter of NBA Hall of Famer Julius Erving.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year later, Stevenson is ranked 87th in the world after a
post-Wimbledon high of 36th. She tries desperately to be an
exceptional player on the court and a normal person off of it.
</P>
<P>
   She's putting off college to live her dream of being a
professional tennis player, and even though this year she has been
eliminated in the first round of 10 of her 19 tournaments and lost
in the second round at Wimbledon, Stevenson denies being
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tennis is about 90 percent mental,'' Stevenson said.
``It's important to focus hard on every point, and instead of being
up and down with every point, to just go through the entire match
on one level.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's match was a step in that direction. Stevenson won the
first three games of the first set but had her serve broken three
of the next four times and lost the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first set, I was very upset,'' Stevenson said. ``She
fought back and played hard, but I just made a lot of silly
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson went up a break at 3-2 to take control of the second
set and was never threatened in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson credited her strong play late in the match to improved
training, which she said has intensified over the past three weeks
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-1, Stevenson lacks the pure quickness of many of her
contemporaries and seeks to make up for that with power and
stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my whole life sitting in a classroom, not working
out all day,'' Stevenson said. ``These girls out here can get every
(shot) back, and they can stay out there all day. I want to stay
out there even longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson advances to face No. 4-seeded Conchita Martinez of
Spain, who had a first-round bye, in a second-round match probably
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's other first-round matches, Elena Dementieva of
Russia beat Nathalie Dechy 6-4, 4-6, 6-4; France's Anne-Gaelle
Sidot beat Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-3, 6-4; and American Chanda Rubin
beat Julie Halard-Decugis of France 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis, a finalist last year at Manhattan Beach, dropped
her first service attempt in each set and struggled to keep up with
Rubin's powerful ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, a finalist in 1995, advanced to face top-seeded Martina
Hingis in the second round.

CISNEROS, KAUFMAN AND BROAD TO DEVELOP NEW HOMES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Hoping to tap a well of urban pioneer spirit,
former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and
Westwood-based Kaufman and Broad Home Corp. on Monday formed a
joint venture to build new homes close to the core of some
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, called American CityVista, will focus on infill
projects of homes that will be affordable to average-income
families. And the San Fernando Valley will likely be a key market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at places like Reseda, San Fernando, Pacoima,
East Los Angeles, San Pedro and Long Beach,'' Cisneros said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 53, resigned as president and chief operating officer
of Los Angeles-based Univision Communications, parent company of
the nation's top Spanish-language television network, to
concentrate on the new venture. He served as HUD's chief during
President Clinton's first term and was a four-term mayor of San
Antonio, where the new company will be based. It will also have a
Los Angeles office and Cisneros will have a seat on Kaufman and
Broad's board.
</P>
<P>
   American CityVista will be jointly financed by the home builder
and Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   The company will select sites and plan the tracts as well as buy
the land and build the homes.
</P>
<P>
   It should be in operation by September and will look for
building sites in 28 communities in California, Texas, Arizona,
Nevada and Colorado. The majority are in California.
</P>
<P>
   Infill development is commonplace now in many sections of the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisneros said the new venture has a broad vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the differences here is the scale we're talking about.
We're trying to get (projects) of really substantial scale so we
can effectively create villages within the city, a critical mass of
citizens that can fight for good schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The housing will not be subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros acknowledges that it may be easier to build this kind
of housing in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this is not going to be easy,'' he said. ``This is a
difficult challenge. The low-hanging fruit has been picked. The
sites to be developed on tend to be on the tougher side and there
are delays built into the entitlement process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, there is great momentum for new development in
central cities, and city leaders recognize that large-scale
homeownership provides community stability,'' Cisneros said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles alone has a thirst for this type of housing: There
is a shortage of about 200,000 housing units across the county,
according to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a big market,'' said Jack Kyser, chief
economist at the nonprofit group. ``There is just a real shortage
of affordable housing around the area. This looks like a very
interesting venture and I think people will probably be surprised
at the results they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Other California areas the company is eyeing include
Riverside/San Bernardino, Bakersfield, Anaheim, San Diego, Fresno,
Sacramento, Modesto and Stockton.

they face less regulation than in the carefully monitored forests
of the Pacific Northwest. Timber harvests in North Carolina,
Tennessee and 11 other Southern states increased by 50 percent from
1977 to 1997, according to the draft of a federal report. By

<P>
   LIEBERMAN-ASSESS (Washington) _ News analysis: After struggling
mightily for two years to move out of President Clinton's shadow,
Vice President Al Gore, in a bold but risky choice of a running
mate, effectively thrusts Clinton and impeachment front and center
in the 2000 presidential campaign. By Richard L. Berke.

   LIEBERMAN-PROFILE (Undated) _ A man-in-the-news profile of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman. By Robert D. McFadden.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RECORD (Washington) _ In two terms in the Senate,
Joseph Lieberman has often taken positions at odds with Vice
President Al Gore and important constituencies of the Democratic
party on school vouchers, regulation of managed care, capital gains
taxes and product liability. But he sided with the Clinton
administration on all important budget votes, and unlike many other
Democrats, supported the administration's positions on trade and
welfare. His views are completely in tune with the vice president's
on abortion, the environment, gun control and gay rights. And he
usually supported the Clinton administration on foreign policy
issues. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RIGHT (Undated) _ In Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Al Gore
has managed to choose as his running mate an Orthodox Jew whom many
Christians _ and especially conservative evangelicals _ regard an
ally on many social and moral issues. Although he wears a yarmulke
on his head, Lieberman has been seen by some Christians as a
kindred spirit for his willingness to wear his religion on his
sleeve. His talk of the Talmud inspiring both his values and his
vote has often been cited by those Christians who believe the Bible
ought to guide public policy. By Laurie Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-CLINTON (Undated) _ In a Senate speech on Sept. 3,
1998, Sen. Joseph Lieberman sharply criticized President Clinton's
conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter, but he voted against
impeaching the president, giving his reasons in a statement
released on Feb. 11, 1999. Exerpts from these two statements.

groups to gin up their core voters. By James Dao.

   JAPAN-SMALL-SHOPS (Machida City, Japan) _ Roughly 10 years have
passed since Japan began to dismantle the litany of licenses,
permits and other regulatory approvals that were long part of
breaking into business here. Under deregulation, competition has
grown, the number of stores has increased and Japanese consumers
now enjoy many of the same benefits as Americans in areas ranging
from convenience banking to the purchase of gasoline. But the
endangered shotengai, or local shopping district, has become a
rallying point against deregulation among Japanese who are worried
that they are destroying something precious. By Stephanie Strom.

steadily, the mosquito-transmitted virus is dispersing from last
year's focal point in northern Queens in New York, leaving a trail
of dead birds that so far extends north to Boston, west to
Syracuse, and south to Maryland. According to virus experts, this
pattern indicates that West Nile, which was first identified in
Uganda in 1937 and flares up sporadically in Africa, Europe, and
the Middle East, appears ensconced in the New World. Many
scientists expect that a scattering of human infections and a few
deaths may well become the norm in years to come. Still, these
experts say, the disease appears unlikely to become a significant
threat to public health. By Andrew C. Revkin.

   SCI-PHYSICS-BIAS (Undated) _ Despite its image of arcane
intellectuality, particle physics is fast becoming a field with
plenty of heart-pounding, high-stakes suspense. The reasons lie not
so much in the field's recent string of discoveries as in how some
of them were made. Several large, multinational teams of particle
physicists, who design experiments to capture, measure and
understand the most elementary building blocks of matter, have
adopted an analysis technique that may best be compared to walking
a tightrope while blindfolded. The problem is bias, and it plagues
all realms of scientific experimentation. Recently, somewhat in the
spirit of biomedicine, research teams in particle physics have been
programming their computers to add unknown numbers, called
``offsets,'' to their data to make the outcome of their analyses
blind. When an experiment is over, the researchers open their
metaphorical sealed envelopes and discover what the value of the
offset is _ learning only then whether they are close to a routine
confirmation of theory, a Nobel Prize or a humiliating mistake. By

relying more on experience-based knowledge than abstract logic, and
showing more tolerance for contradiction. Westerners are more
analytic in their thinking, tending to detach objects from their
context, to avoid contradictions, and to rely more heavily on
formal logic. By Erica Goode.

DODGERS LOSE TO ANOTHER PATSY
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ah, the soft part of the schedule. You know, the
Philadelphia Phillies,the Milwaukee Brewers, the Chicago Cubs. The
teams good teams beat.
</P>
<P>
   If Pittsburgh didn't throw a wrench into the situation by losing
two of three, think where the Los Angeles Dodgers would be.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Dodgers' so-called easy portion of the schedule is
proving to be nothing of the sort as losses to anemic teams mount.
The latest was the 7-3 defeat to the Cubs in the opener of a
three-game series Monday at Dodger Stadium in which rookie Matt
Herges pitched well in his first major-league start, then
eloquently laid out the Dodgers' travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the thick of it and as I've said before, and maybe it
offended people, but these are teams we should beat up on and we're
not,'' Herges said after allowing three runs in six innings.
``Right now we have to be winning. If we want to be there in the
end, which we all believe we can, games like this are definitely .
. . definitely frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges was outpitched by Cubs rookie Ruben Quevedo, who earned
his first major-league victory. Quevedo (1-3) allowed seven hits in
a complete-game win as the Dodgers (58-53) dropped their third
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning three of four at Colorado and being poised to make
a run at first place in the National League West, the Dodgers have
dropped six of 10 to the Phillies, Pirates, Brewers and Cubs. That
quartet entered Monday a combined 56 games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa led off the ninth with a towering
homer to right-center field. It was his 35th of the season, tying
him with the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield for the major-league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers leadoff man Eric Young, who's had a public feud
with Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, went 3 for 4 with a walk and
scored twice in his return to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always love coming back to L.A.,'' Young said. ``This is
where I started. It's always special to come back here. It was good
to get on base. I was trying to put the pressure on.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges (8-1) was inserted into the starting rotation after a
magnificent four months in the bullpen. But when lefty Carlos Perez
had trouble in his last two starts, it was Herges to whom Johnson
turned.
</P>
<P>
   Herges' eight-game winning streak equaled the best start by a
Dodgers pitcher since Fernando Valenzuela began the 1981 season
8-0, and was the longest by a Dodger since Pedro Martinez won eight
straight in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took a 3-1 lead in the third inning on Ricky
Gutierrez's two-run triple and a sacrifice fly by Mark Grace, but
it was reliever Antonio Osuna who was pounded. He allowed four runs
in three innings as the Cubs stretched a 3-2 lead after six innings
to a 7-3 win thanks to a two-run homer by Gutierrez in the seventh,
a run-scoring single by Young in the eighth and Sosa's homer in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osuna, I don't know what his problem was,'' Johnson said. ``He
didn't throw the ball the way he did all year. That's one of the
few times the bullpen hadn't kept us right there, and our offense
is sluggish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave Herges a 1-0 lead in the first inning when Tom
Goodwin scored on Mark Grudzielanek's double to the
right-center-field gap, but it could have been more. Grudzielanek
went to third on Quevedo's errant pick-off throw but was thrown out
at the plate on Gary Sheffield's bouncer back to the mound.
Compounding the blunder was that Grudzielanek didn't stay in a
rundown and Sheffield was tagged out heading to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say we let down after that, but it was kind
of like, 'We could have scored 10 this inning,' '' Herges said.
``That's how we felt in the dugout. We were pumped. I can't say it
affected us too much, but maybe it did.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mimi Bloom shrugged off her recent layoff from SmartPlanet, a
San Francisco start-up that offers classes over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old graduate of Harvard University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology was let go after just eight
months on the job, but she is planning to go to work for another
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the second time I've been laid off,'' said Bloom, who had
also lost a job three years ago in New York. ``The first time
around, it felt much more shameful. The general public wasn't as
aware of the dot-com world and the risks you have to take being in
that world. I definitely felt I had more explaining to do then.
Now, it's considered common.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a practical reason for this newly casual attitude toward
layoffs: To encourage the kind of risk-taking needed to spur
entrepreneurs to hack away repeatedly at the American Dream,
failures must be easily forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   And, increasingly, they are. ``There's no such thing as blood on
a resume,'' said Ann Peckenpaugh, a veteran recruiter for
Schweichler &AMP; Associates in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's no longer unusual, especially in Silicon Valley,
for technology workers to change jobs within two years or less.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this unsentimental new attitude is a response to the
massive corporate layoffs of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which
left hundreds of thousands of workers stranded and disillusioned.
Today, there are no hard feelings, because job opportunities abound
and workers no longer feel they have to stick with a company until
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean all the rules have been chucked out the
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there's lots of opportunity, it still doesn't feel
good'' to be laid off, said Paul Angeli, who in May lost his job at
Petstore.com in Emeryville, Calif. ``On the other hand, this isn't
devastating either. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose.
That's the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Peckenpaugh recalled a piece of advice she got from Tom Perkins
of the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley's top-tier
venture capital firm: ``It is to a certain extent in the best
interest of venture capitalists to encourage people to keep trying,
to not be afraid of failure. We need people to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not whether you fail, but whether you
ultimately succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, failure is ``a badge of honor,'' said Amy Vernetti who
is a ``human capitalist'' for Garage.com, a venture capital
investment bank in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK to have a failure on your record,'' Vernetti said.
``Mistakes are how you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   What has Bloom learned from working at companies that have
failed? That ``anything can change on a dime,'' Bloom said. ``And
you need to be prepared for it.''
</P>

<P>
   These days, in the dot-com world, the game is fast-paced,
brutally intense, and exhilirating. And that's what is drawing
people like Derek Regier.
</P>
<P>
   Regier left his job with Nortel Networks Corp. in Dallas a year
ago. He had climbed the corporate ranks of the telecommunications
equipment company, but he dreaded the meetings. As executives
droned on, Regier kept his sanity by reading e-mail messages,
planning his weekly agenda, and mapping out his own company
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have meetings to plan meetings,'' the 29-year-old
executive said. ``We would have meetings to agree on the process of
decision-making at future meetings. We would have meetings to make
the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   When Regier left Nortel for the world of technology start-ups,
he knew the risks would be much higher. But he also knew he would
be more comfortable working at Internet speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted high risk, high reward,'' said Regier, now senior
vice president of business development for Allmystuff Inc., an
enterprise software company in Austin, Texas. ``I didn't feel I
would get that in a corporate environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Allmystuff was not Regier's first Internet start-up. He had
previously worked for Cozone.com, a Marlborough, Mass. online store
for CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely fast-paced,'' he said. ``We launched in
October and had $7.5 million in sales in our first quarter.
Decisions were made quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozone collapsed in March. Regier said he was disappointed but
did not regret the move, which taught him how to launch an Internet
company in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   This is a typical day at his current employer: Attend a quick 8
a.m. meeting at Allmystuff's headquarters. Fly to Dallas to meet
customers and partners, and take a recruit out to dinner. Fly back
to Austin and rush to the office to answer e-mail messages. Arrive
home at 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Regier says he has never been happier with his career. And the
risks in this fast-moving world, he adds, do not seem to be as high
as everyone thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a dot-com fails, ``your valuation skyrockets anyway,
because you have that experience,'' he said. ``And you never would
have had that experience if you hadn't left the security blanket of
your existing environment for a more dynamic environment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because dot-coms and their business plans can morph at any
moment, workers must also move fast, often putting aside any
company loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more job-hopping you do, the more experience you get,''
said Brent Durst, a Web site producer who was laid off a month ago
from HealthCentral.com after nine months at the Emeryville company.
``It's OK as long as you're getting the skills you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst recalled that the woman who had recruited him to
HealthCentral.com left soon after he was hired. ``There's just a
lot of turnover,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many recruiters agree that churn is a major part of the
technology workplace today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of control, especially here in the Valley,'' said
Jack Van Berkel, vice president of human resources for Netigy
Corp., an e-commerce consulting firm in San Jose, Calif. ``People
jump jobs incredibly fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, there is a joke that people can change jobs
without having to tell their families; they simply drive off in
another direction the following Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude is encouraged by a similarly nonchalant view by
companies that euphemistically refer to layoffs as ``reducing burn
rate'' _ that is, reducing the rate at which the company is burning
through its cash, according to Vernetti.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that attitude toward employment is taken by a
typically younger class of workers than those who were laid off a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the youngest people in the industry,'' said
Peckenpaugh. ``In the past, it's been middle-aged men with
retirements at stake and kids in college. They've had a much harder
time dealing with a layoff. It's a lot easier for younger people.
They know they can just spring right back. They also didn't come in
with the expectation that they would put the best years of their
life into the company and retire.''
</P>
<P>
   As Durst, 30, said of his layoff, ``It wasn't such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a huge part of the reason why workers can take
layoffs so casually is because they know there are plenty of other
jobs awaiting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the second someone is laid off, they have
five other opportunities to look at,'' Vernetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Some recruiters routinely scan for news of troubled dot-coms, in
hopes they can lure away workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for technology talent is immense,'' said Van
Berkel, whose company has more than 100 openings. ``The
unemployment rate for technology-related fields is essentially
negative because there are more jobs than people to fill those
positions. So what happens is employees of companies being laid off
get attacked by search firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart recruiters don't wait for the layoff notices. They begin
recruiting as soon as they start picking up vibes of financial
trouble at a company, Peckenpaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank, by the time the layoffs hit the papers, these
people have already been approached, and some have already lined up
their next job,'' she said. ``It's not quite as easy as shooting
fish in a barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cozone folded, Regier received a multitude of offers from
both established technology companies and dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be loved,'' Regier said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if all the old rules are irrelevant. On the East
Coast, especially, traditions die hard.
</P>
<P>
   Take Josef Blumenfeld, a public relations executive, who lost
his job at Cozone. He jumped to DriverFX.com, a Maynard, Mass.
start-up in the automotive accessories market. After a major
partner pulled its support, DriverFX.com slammed on the brakes in
June.
</P>
<P>
   In an all-too-familiar scene, the company's chief executive
asked Blumenfeld and other employees to gather around. Then he
launched into his farewell speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally started to cackle,'' Blumenfeld said. ``I thought,
`Oh great! More worthless options!' ''
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment in his days of unemployment, Blumenfeld
considered leaping to another dot-com. Then he remembered the stack
of business cards he had collected in his travels from companies
that no longer existed.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Blumenfeld opted to take a position with Concord
Communications, a fast-growing but more mature technology company
in Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want stock options,'' he said. ``I want health
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists and job-placement firms say they are not surprised by
Blumenfeld's reaction. Even with the local boom in Internet
start-ups, Massachusetts employees have long been more conservative
than their job-hopping counterparts out West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is somewhat less job switching in Boston than in Silicon
Valley,'' said Sara Johnson, chief regional economist for Standard
&AMP; Poor's DRI. ``I think there's more of a standard of company
loyalty in Boston, whereas job switching is the norm in Silicon
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Some recruiters in the Boston area seem to look down on dot-com
job-hoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay focused on ones that are successful,'' said Ed Takacs,
chief executive of HighTech Ventures, a Cambridge, Mass. recruiting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Fraize, who lost his job when Internet retailer
Toysmart.com collapsed this spring, said he has no desire to jump
from job to job. The high-risk, high-rewards game, he said, is not
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared to death of not working,'' said Fraize, who now has
a job as a design developer for Event Zero in Woburn, Mass. ``I
have bills to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in Silicon Valley, labor is not entirely
``frictionless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've dedicated your time and focus to helping a company
succeed,'' Angeli said. ``You're tied into that success with stock
options. So the employee loses when a company fails. You have to
start all over again. I don't think the fields are totally green.''

E-COMMERCE: PRIVATE MATTER

<P>
   It was supposed to work like Good Housekeeping's seal of
approval. A TRUSTe logo on a Web site would reassure consumers that
their personal information would be safe from prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say online privacy seal programs such as TRUSTe,
which includes 2,000 sites as members, provide little protection
for consumers who leave their tracks on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe's opponents grew more vocal after Toysmart.com, a
Waltham, Mass. online seller of toys, collapsed in May and tried to
auction off data that included customers' names, addresses,
shopping preferences, and children's birthdays. Toysmart.com was a
TRUSTe member and had promised its shoppers it would never sell
their information to a third party.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Dave Steer noted that TRUSTe contacted the Federal
Trade Commission after hearing about Toysmart.com's plans to sell
the data. ``I think we've been very firm and clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors Inc. of Lincoln, Mass. has become a high-profile
reviewer of consumer Web sites. But lately, the critic has been
facing criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In April, several Web sites that ranked low on the company's
lists challenged Gomez to disclose its rating criteria. Last month,
Realty Times, an online real estate news service based in Dallas,
joined the fray. Reporter Blanche Evans called the latest Gomez
survey of home-buying sites ``a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans quoted sources as saying employees worked under one-week
deadlines to produce the ratings. In some cases, she wrote, Gomez
analysts fell short of researching the more than 150 criteria
points that consumers were promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site also seems confused by its own grading criteria,
nit-picking over the inclusion of 800 numbers for some sites while
overlooking glaring feature omissions such as listings,'' Evans
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Stein, an executive vice president at Gomez, said Web sites
sometimes do not have features such as 800 numbers before Gomez's
cut-off date _ though they may have added them at a later date.
Gomez does not have one-week deadlines and ``we do take into
account the number of listings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stein suggested that that Gomez has been attacked more than
rivals because of its rigorous reviews of thousands of sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ratings matter,'' Stein said. ``They matter to consumers.
They matter to the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet surfers click first on search engines such as
AltaVista and Lycos to help them locate Web sites and data on
subjects ranging from illnesses to appliances.
</P>
<P>
   But they often don't look past the first few pages of matches,
forcing Web site managers to scramble for position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not found in the Top 30 to 50 matches, you have
built a billboard in the woods,'' said Fredrick Marckini, chief
executive of Iprospect.com in Arlington, Mass. ``No one will find
you. No one will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Marckini's company has emerged as a sort of real estate broker
in the search-engine world, helping clients such as Sharp
Electronics and Carpartsonsale.com scale the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Iprospect.com employees know major search engines have varying
ways to determine a site's relevance based on keywords. They make
sure that keywords used to describe a client's site are the same
ones that Web surfers type on search engines. In Sharp's case, the
retailer had not moved fast enough to secure the sharp.com address
on the World Wide Web. And at the search engines, Internet users
had trouble locating the company's sharp-usa.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a Web user can type ``Sharp'' and ``microwave'' in
Lycos's search box _ and the first listing pops up as Sharp
Electronics. ``Seriously, that did not happen before,'' said Mark
Pusateri, Sharp's interactive marketing manager.

AUDIOMINING: COMING INTO ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BURLINGTON, Mass. _ If you're among the millions of Americans
whose work calls for attending industry conferences and
conventions, you may have noticed recently that a vast number of
sessions and speeches get recorded or videotaped.
</P>
<P>
   But did you ever wonder who, beyond desperate insomniacs, ever
goes back to watch or listen to executives droning on about some
obscure new realm of the profession or the technology?
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a faster way. Imagine you didn't get to attend the
Potato Processing International Exposition but were eager to find
out if anyone had insights into how, say, the wireless Net is
expected to affect the production of French fries.
</P>
<P>
   With a new service developed by the former Dragon Systems unit
of Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, you could go to the potato processors' Web
site and search conference video clips posted there to see if any
speaker uttered the phrase ``wireless Internet'' during the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Up would pop a graphic showing, let's say, the five occasions on
which three different speakers mentioned the vaunted wireless Net.
With a point and click and the right RealPlayer version installed,
you could play back those video segments on your computer, starting
about five seconds before the actual phrase so you understood the
context.
</P>
<P>
   After years of development and promises, speech recognition
technology has finally emerged as viable, aided by ever more
powerful computer chips to decode spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   Exemplifying the trend was last week's initial public offering
for SpeechWorks International of Boston that valued the company at
a dizzying $1.6 billion. SpeechWorks makes voice-prompt systems
that allow you to do things like use your voice to order 100 shares
of a stock, or ask the arrival time of an airline flight and hear
the answer spoken back to you.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase-searching product offered by Lernout, the Belgian
speech-recognition company with North American headquarters in
Burlington, is part of a new application for speech technology
called ``audiomining,'' or using speech recognition to index video
and audio tapes and glean facts from them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Lernout offers the product only as a service where you
pay the company as little as $300 per hour of tape to convert it
into a searchable database, plus the cost of hosting it on a Web
page so people can log in and search it.
</P>
<P>
   Lernout's main customer to date is PlexisNet Broadcasting, which
uses the technology for clients such as trade-show organizers and a
company that tapes every hearing on Capitol Hill. Some trade show
and conference organizers, in fact, have found there is a huge new
revenue source in selling search access to conference proceedings
for people who couldn't attend.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, said Robin Gaynor, the product line manager,
Lernout hopes to have an off-the-shelf product people could buy and
use themselves to put searchable video and audio tapes on their Web
sites. In the current version, it takes about two hours to process
one hour of videotape into a searchable archive, basically by
playing it back on a recorder hooked up to a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Right now it is pretty remarkable technology, with some obvious
limitations. It works off a vocabulary of only about 60,000 words,
so if you want to be able to search a tape for people's names or
obscure technological jargon, you have to give Lernout a list of
those special index words before it processes the tape.
</P>
<P>
   (In one recent trial, for example, the system decided the name
of Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was actually ``to read
disease.'')
</P>
<P>
   In our own playing with it, we found the system also does much
better at finding a phrase such as ``manufacturing inventory'' than
``big heart'' _ although it did find occurrences of the admittedly
obscure word ``recusal'' in a soporific congressional hearing we
scanned.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to bear in mind that a videotape of a trade-show
speech will be much lower quality than, say, an ABC News broadcast,
and thus it may be much harder to precisely identify a word or
phrase and find it in a search.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lernout's few competitors in this market, Silicon Valley
streaming-video provider Virage, which uses IBM speech technology,
has done several video-indexing deals with TV networks including
ABC and CNN. But Lernout thinks there's still a big unserved market
for services aimed at sub-broadcast-quality video or audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never know what we are going to get here for recording
quality, so it's been developed to be speech recognition that you
can really pound on,'' Gaynor said.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology behind the video product is being applied by
Lernout for what is called ``phonemining,'' or processing thousands
of hours of calls into a customer care center to glean information
such as product popularity. And coming soon could be a Lernout
product where you could record, transcribe, and index your
company's conference calls.

WAL-MART WANTS NEW WEB LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne Jackson brought a lusterless Banana Republic back into
fashion. And she pushed Banana Republic and its parent company, Gap
Inc., to Internet success.
</P>
<P>
   But can she wave that magic wand a third time to turn unwieldly
Wal-Mart.com into the real Wal-Mart of the Web before Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have a lot of work to do,'' acknowledged Jackson,
chief executive of Wal-Mart.com Inc., which has tapped Sapient
Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. to help it revamp its clunky Web site.
</P>
<P>
   After disappointing sales online, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the
world's largest retailer, announced early this year that it would
set up a separate company for its Web site. The Internet operation
in Palo Alto, Calif., is jointly owned by Wal-Mart and Accel
Partners, a venture capital firm in the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Wal-Mart.com hired Jackson, former chief executive of
Banana Republic, to add some pizazz and Internet savvy to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jackson, the company purchased Homewarehouse.com, a robust
site that will serve as Wal-Mart.com's platform. The company also
has been quietly working with Sapient, a technology consulting firm
and systems integrator, to improve its Web site design and
navigational tools.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Wal-Mart redesigned its site, it worked with
consultant Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. and several other
technology firms. But Wal-Mart executives were unhappy with the
site's debut in January, and the retailer is no longer working with
Cambridge Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Sapient ranks among the top companies now building
Web sites. And so far, it has avoided having its name attached to
Web disasters by making sure its clients understand ``when
something makes sense _ and when it doesn't,'' said Christine
Overby, an analyst with Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wal-Mart.com and Sapient have their work cut out for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The site has received harsh reviews from both consumers and
analysts who complain that it's hard to navigate and contains scant
product information. Wal-Mart.com did not even make Media Metrix's
Top 25 e-commerce sites in June, the latest rankings available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, we do not believe we are giving our customers the
level of service that they deserve'' online, said Melissa
Berryhill, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Berryhill said Wal-Mart.com also needs to improve its
fulfillment operations. Fingerhut Companies Inc. now fills orders
for the site. But Wal-Mart.com appears to be exerting more control
over its back-end operations. Last week, Wal-Mart announced plans
to build a distribution center in Georgia to handle Internet
orders.
</P>
<P>
   While Wal-Mart has struggled, its rivals have taken the lead.
Amazon.com Inc. has emerged as the Internet's biggest retailer,
selling books, music, dishwashers, and tools.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Wal-Mart.com and other stragglers will be playing
catch-up at a time when the rate of consumers coming online is
slowing. ``The chances to acquire new consumers and dictate their
buying patterns are getting fewer and fewer,'' said Jon Frey, a
Sapient manager who works with the firm's retail clients. ``This is
a big holiday season to get that customer base established so you
have a critical mass of consumers going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem with Wal-Mart.com and other online sites is that
they were designed for men, Frey said. Now that women are taking
over many online shopping decisions, much as they do on the ground,
Wal-Mart.com needs to tweak its Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that women prefer to browse stores and enjoy the
experience of shopping _ and the same trends have applied to
cyberspace. Men are surgical buyers. They want to make their
purchases and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart offers an impressive 600,000 items on its site. But
analysts say the retailer has had a tough time bringing its mantra
_ ``always low prices'' _ to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little reason to go back to their site,'' said Steve
Wolin, a principal with Mercer Management Consulting in Boston.
``They are stuck in the world of competing on price _ and they're
not terribly good at that online right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the items stocked on Wal-Mart.com's shelves seem
to belong in the big outlets _ not in the online store.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Jackson arrived at Wal-Mart.com, an employee informed
her of a 25-cent plastic glass offered on the Web site. Also for
sale on the site are felt-tip pens for a dollar each that cost
about $5 to ship. ``All you have to do is do the mathematics and it
doesn't make sense,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said she hopes to decrease the number of items sold on
the site, including merchandise that shoppers are more likely to
buy in stores than they are online.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap, for instance, discovered that leather clothing sold at
a surprisingly fast rate online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense,'' Jackson said. ``You're going to spend a
certain amount to ship the goods. And $7 to $8 to ship a $300
leather jacket makes a lot more sense than spending $7 to $8 to
ship a T-shirt.''

BANKS FIND PROFITS IN FILLING DEBT GAP FOR START-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; What's the first thing a start-up does when it lands a big
chunk of money from venture capitalists?
</P>
<P>
   It hires a banker.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this age where equity is king, bankers are enjoying the
growth of a multimillion-dollar debt business that's sprouted up
alongside high-tech deal flow. They manage venture assets, both for
venture firms and for entrepreneurs. And they lend money to
start-ups that have secured venture backing, to finance things such
as computers and real estate leases, and to bridge brief
stress-filled gaps between VC rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound risky, compared with lending to established
companies. But there's built-in protection you don't find in
typical loans: deep-pocketed VCs. And there's some equity upside,
in the form of warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``By traditional banking standards, these loans would be
considered high risk,'' says Diane Russell, a BankBoston leveraged
buyout chief in the mid-1980s who started a Boston lending office
for Los Angeles-based Imperial Bank five years ago. But there's
less speculation involved than you think, she says.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Imperial gets to keep a closer eye on its clients
than most banks do, because it typically manages their cash
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The bank earns fees for managing those millions of dollars in
cash. And when it makes loans (priced as other business loans,
based on the prime rate) it's first in line to be repaid. Sometimes
the bank can tap the venture capitalists if the start-up runs out
of money. There's also collateral in the form of computer equipment
or intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more successes than sob stories lately, despite
the difficulties some e-commerce companies have faced since April.
</P>
<P>
   Imperial recently feted one of its winners at the Van Gogh
exhibit at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. Variagenics Inc., a
Cambridge, Mass. company involved in genomics and drug
personalization, got $1.2 million in loans from the bank, on top of
about $51 million in venture capital. It went public two weeks ago
and its shares have surged 94 percent to $27.125.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of stock pop is part of what makes this business more
profitable than standard lending, Russell said. Imperial takes
warrants with certain loans, giving it the right to buy a percent
or two of a client's stock for as little as a penny per share. With
$7 billion of assets, Imperial has amassed warrants in several
hundred companies, Russell says.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs tap banks to avoid giving away more of their
company than they have to. Say the venture firms provide $5 million
and get a 25 percent ownership stake in a start-up in return. The
founder, by taking a $1 million loan, then has $6 million to put to
work without giving away a bigger slice of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you go out and get the cheaper money from the bank
instead of expensive money from venture capitalists,'' says Bob
Garrow, chief of Citizens Capital, the venture arm of Citizens
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, young unprofitable companies typically can't
get loans without venture backing. Garrow and other VCs often send
entrepreneurs to institutions like Imperial and Silicon Valley
Bank, a pioneer in the field with $5.4 billion of assets. Banks
such as FleetBoston tend to get involved at later stages.
</P>
<P>
   Staying close to the venture capitalists is key to the bankers,
Russell says. For one thing, the VCs deliver most of the business.
And if a venture firm is turning lukewarm on a portfolio company,
that's a warning sign for the bank, she says.
</P>
<P>
   She concedes some loans have been revisited since the stock
market plummeted in April and venture money in realms like
e-tailing dried up. But the flow of new deals is vast, she says,
and likely to continue as long as there's money to back new
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the industry's fears, activity did not slow in
the second quarter. According to the National Venture Capital
Association, a record 1,695 companies nationwide got funding in the
period, up from 1,627 deals in the first quarter. They received
$24.58 billion, down from the fourth-quarter peak of $25.17
billion, but up 96 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Says Russell: ``There are unlimited amounts of capital right now
feeding this community.''

RECORD LABELS, POST-NAPSTER? AN ICE-COLD VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Most people know Ice-T as the in-your-face
gangsta rapper who exploded on the American political and musical
scene in 1992 with his song ``Cop Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Less celebrated is the fact that he is a now a bona fide
Internet entrepreneur. Ice, as his friends like to call him, is
starting CoronerRecords.com, an online label for up-and-coming
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   In his new capacity, Ice, a.k.a. Tracy Morrow, last week sat on
a panel on ``The Future of Music,'' sponsored by Red Herring
magazine. Clad in a blue and red Hawaiian shirt, white sneakers and
a navel-length gold chain and matching pinkie ring, he looked out
of place next to his fellow music industry executives, who favored
sports jackets and loafers.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion inevitably gravitated towards Napster, the
Internet sensation that lets music fans swap songs for free and is
threatening the multibillion-dollar record industry. While other
panelists talked about ``bandwidth'' and ``portability,'' Ice took
a philosophical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of businesses get put out of business by other
businesses,'' he ruminated. ``It's about evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Ice sees it, Napster is stealing from the record
industry, which is stealing from artists like himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ice, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles after his parents
were killed in an auto accident, has an entirely pragmatic
philosophy based on survival.
</P>
<P>
   So while he compares major record labels to ``gangsters,'' he is
also among the musicians that have joined the record industry in a
copyright infringement lawsuit against Napster Inc., the San Mateo,
Calif., company that distributes the swapping software over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks the lawsuit is futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop technology,'' he said. ``Five years from now,
Napster will morph into something even more devastating. The world
is now an open book. There's a cyberwar coming. Technology is
coming in a mean way. The artist has to figure out a way to get
ahead of it, 'cause it's gonna get real crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   His solution? If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Over the past
year, he's been experimenting with the Internet, developing his own
Web site (MCIceT.com), producing music videos that can be viewed
only on the Internet, and selling his music through the online
music label, AtomicPop.com.
</P>
<P>
   His latest effort involves CoronerRecords.com, an online music
label he has launched with his own money. Like AtomicPop,
CoronerRecords seeks to represent artists who want to distribute
their music online. Because digital distribution and promotion is
viewed as much cheaper than the traditional model of selling
compact discs in stores, online labels can make money on smaller
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to create a business model where you can sell 3,000
records and get a check,'' he explained, adding that this is a way
for ``small cats'' to make money from selling mail-order CDs online
or from sales of downloaded music.
</P>
<P>
   These small cats are unlikely to make big-time money on
downloaded music, however, at least in the near future.
Notwithstanding that fans can get songs for free by using Napster,
selling digitally downloaded music has not caught on with consumers
because it's still hard for people to get the music out of their
computer and into their stereos, according to Ice-T, who said most
of his sales continue to be in the form of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardware needs to catch up to the software,'' he said.
That will happen, and when it does, the 40-year-old hip hop artist
said he plans to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice-T is one of those artists who get it,'' said P.J. McNealy,
senior analyst with the Gartner Group. ``CDs as we know it are
going away. The ability for music fans to sample tracks on the Web
is huge. It all leads to people downloading single tracks vs.
having to buy an entire album.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice's status as media executive is likely to beg the question
from fans: Is this the same musician whose persistently provocative
lyrics have earned the enmity of law enforcement activists,
feminists, and politicians? Has Ice lost his edge?
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely. The rap artist still sees himself as a hard-core
subverter. CoronerRecords gets its name because he thinks
traditional record labels will perish in the new digital
millennium. In the end, only the coroner survives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is where the action is,'' he said. ``If we can't
sell music there, we'll figure something else out. We go rob a bank
or something.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTFORD, Mass. _ One Friday afternoon almost exactly three
years ago, Rubin Gruber was eating a pizza with his cousin when he
finally got talked into pursuing an idea that has turned out to be
worth more than $12 billion: Sonus Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Sonus, which makes advanced voice and data telecommunications
switches for phone companies, has been one of the region's hottest
public offerings this year. It soared in value 900 percent in its
first 40 trading days before slipping, as of Friday evening to a
mere $195 over its $23-a-share offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in fact, there's a little skepticism among industry
analysts and short sellers who think that the 290-person business
may be a great new company _ but not possibly as great as Wall
Street's valuation suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Three summers ago, Gruber, one of the classic ``serial
entrepreneurs'' of the Interstate 495 belt, had taken what he
thought was going to be a wonderful early retirement at age 52. But
he came to two painful realizations: ``I found out I didn't like to
play golf, and serving on boards was the most boring thing in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruber, whose past companies include Videoserver (now Ezenia),
Davox, and Cambridge Telecommunications, was sitting at New London
Style Pizza in Concord talking over life with his cousin when he
got going about what he was convinced would be the next big thing
in telecommunications: transmitting voice calls by converting them
into Internet-style data packets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I have seen you
</P>
<P>
   really excited about doing something in a year,'' Gruber
recounts his cousin saying. ``Why don't you do this?''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next sounds too easy to be true. Gruber pulled out
his cell phone on the spot, called a venture capital friend at
Bessemer Venture Partners, and gave him a three-minute rundown of
the idea. The VC instantly agreed to fund it.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, partners at other local firms including Matrix
Partners and Charles River Ventures had persuaded Gruber to team up
with another area entrepreneur who had some similar ideas, Michael
Hluchjy (pronounced Ha-LOOG-ee), a data networking star who holds a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Sonus Networks, whose name comes from the Latin word for sound,
was born and funded in the fall 1997. A year later, it brought in
as chief executive Hassan M. Ahmed, a former top executive with
Cascade Communications, a now-legendary foundry of local telecom
talent. Alumni of Cascade, now a part of Lucent Technologies,
include the founders of Sycamore Networks in Chelmsford and a
passel of other area start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Sonus went public at $23 a share in late May of this year,
boosted by big product sales to Global Crossing and Williams
Communications and admiration for Sonus's management team.
</P>
<P>
   The stock doubled its first day and soared to over $250 a share
in late July, in part on the strength of more deal announcements,
including a $75 million pact with Time Warner Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sonus shares shot up $15.875 to close at $218,
attaching a value of more than $12.2 billion to a company that in
the first six months of this year had only $7.6 million in sales _
and losses of $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like a 23-year-old Rhodes Scholar, Sonus seems to face the
problem of what can it possibly do with the rest of its life beyond
merely living up to the world's daunting expectations.
</P>
<P>
   While the markets Sonus is serving are projected to be worth $20
billion to $60 billion globally within three years, Sonus faces
plenty of ``fast box'' rivals in converged voice and data. Its
competitors range from Cisco Systems down to emerging local
challengers such as Convergent Networks of Lowell, Unisphere
Solutions of Chelmsford, and Telica Inc. of Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Just to match the ratio of market value to revenues of Wall
Street darling Nortel Networks, Sonus would have to increase sales
to roughly 100 times current levels to support the current stock
price _ forgetting about profits.
</P>
<P>
   Already, many industry insiders fear Wall Street has bid up the
company's shares past rationality, even given the vast
opportunities the company has to rival Lucent Technologies and
Nortel Networks in supplying gear to help the world's telephone
networks cope with explosive Internet data traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products they have serve a hot market, and they are one of
the first vendors to go public in this market, but I don't think
the valuation that Sonus has is sustainable over the long term,''
said Christen Flynn, a Yankee Group analyst who follows and admires
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the revenues to support it,'' Flynn said. ``At
some point, it's got to become a more realistic valuation for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn's is a nice way of expressing some of the sharper opinions
of short sellers who, in recent weeks, have begun to attack Sonus
shares. Up to 1.5 million Sonus shares have been sold short at
times last month in expectation the price will plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price doesn't pass the silly test,'' one wrote on the
Sonus chat board at the Raging Bull financial Web site recently.
Chimed in another short seller: ``This is a big fat pig waiting to
be slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   But even at near current levels, Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs
has rated Sonus a market outperformer, crediting it with ``a
leading share of a rapidly growing market with huge barriers to
entry and unlimited market potential'' and citing ``a management
team clearly capable of growing this company into billion-dollar
revenue status.''
</P>
<P>
   And even companies that have not bought its gear see Sonus as
being right in the sweet spot of telecom. Stuart Elby, director of
network architecture for Verizon Communications, the former Bell
Atlantic, said: ``We're a great believer in voice over Internet
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's a place for . . . equipment like the Sonus
equipment,'' said Elby. ``In the long run, packet voice is going to
be the more cost-effective way to deliver voice, and we expect to
move in that direction,'' probably first in areas of the country
where Verizon is building new networks and later in areas where it
will replace ``legacy'' equipment from Lucent, Nortel, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber and Ahmed insist they are not ticker tape watchers and
are neither fazed nor deluded by the recent market moves that have
added several hundred million dollars to their and Hluchjy's
wealth. According to the most recent filings, Ahmed owns over 3
million shares, while Hluchjy owns 2.3 million and Gruber owns 1.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally don't pay much attention to the stock price,''
said Ahmed. ``They're kind of more buying the stock in terms of
what they think our potential is. I think what Wall Street is
looking at is, who's getting the traction? Who's making this
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ahmed: ``We're going to change the way the public network
is built. That's a very big opportunity. These things don't happen
every day. You have to swing for the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next two years, Ahmed said, ``the odds are pretty
good'' that Sonus will close megadeals with a Baby Bell or a big
long-distance carrier such as AT&AMP;T or WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed is a highflier in more ways than one. He owns a six-seater
Cessna 310 he often uses for business trips to Washington and New
Jersey _ or loads up with his wife and four children for quick
trips to see his family in Ottawa, where the Pakistan native moved
with his physicist father and family when he was 4. He also holds a
master's degree in aeronautics in addition to his Stanford
doctorate in electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   While Sonus makes devices known as ``voice over Internet
protocol'' switches, what they do is far different from the ham
radio-quality international calls many people have made from
computers over the Net. Sonus switches use the same system as
shooting data packets over the Net to transmit phone calls with
better-than-Bell-System quality on controlled private networks.
</P>
<P>
   That technology means several things. One is smaller boxes.
Sonus switches can handle thousands of phone calls in one-20th as
much space as equivalent voice-circuit gear made by an old-line
Lucent or Nortel, and at perhaps half the cost per line served.
</P>
<P>
   Those are powerful selling points given that some of the world's
most treasured real estate today is floor space inside windowless
old phone company central offices where carriers entering a local
market may have to spend $25,000 to $90,000 a month to rent 100
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Once a phone company has a Sonus box in place, adding new lines
and calling features to cope with rapid growth can be as simple as
slipping more cards into a box and tweaking software.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet age has flooded telephone networks with data
traffic, many carriers such as Global Crossing are migrating to
carrying voice calls over far more efficient data networks rather
than stuffing more data onto 20th century voice-circuit systems.
That conversion will require billions of dollars for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers have found they can install Sonus-type gear into their
networks far faster than traditional voice equipment. In April
1999, for example, Global Crossing had ordered a Sonus switch to
test.
</P>
<P>
   Just four hours after hooking the box up to their network,
Global executives placed a conference call from Denver to Sonus in
Westford. The call went through perfectly. ``We were perhaps even
more amazed than we should have been,'' Ahmed recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Another compelling sales point for Sonus and other ``packet
voice'' players is that, for phone companies, their technology
greatly simplifies adding features such as unified messaging
services combining voice mail and e-mail, or one-number plans that
ring people's office, home and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long haul, Ahmed said he thinks offering such services
will be as big a selling point for Sonus as the cost and size of
its products. Already, the company has signed up 40 businesses for
an ``open services partner alliance'' to spur development of new
communications features and services using IP systems.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa-based Williams Communications is using Sonus switches as
it builds a 33,000-mile, 125-city network that by next year is
expected to serve local and national carriers in Boston and several
southern New England cities. The company also has invested in
Sonus.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Saville, vice president of network planning for Williams,
said a key selling point for Williams was being able to offer
``amazing'' advanced calling services for its phone-company
customers to offer to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonus provided us with the best-balanced machine out there.''
He declined to comment on reports that Sonus beat out Cisco for the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the stock market runup may reflect speculation
that Sonus is a ripe takeover target, Ahmed and the cofounders
steadfastly insist they are all in for the long haul and want to
build what Ahmed calls ``a significant company.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruber speaks derisively of telecom start-ups some call
``burgers _ box companies that were made to flip'' to an acquirer.
``We're not going to be a burger,'' Gruber said.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming any names, Ahmed said Sonus may become an
acquirer. Besides being ``a financing event'' to raise money, he
said, the May IPO was intended to create ``a public currency so we
can be acquisitive'' and follow Lucent, Nortel, and Cisco in using
richly appreciated stock to buy up other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to provide more and more of the pieces of the
technology,'' Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean moving beyond providing switches for the heart
of a network to offer on-ramp devices supporting high-speed
Internet access, wireless services, and phone service over upgraded
cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   But while the spring slump in telecom shares may suggest to some
that Sonus should pounce while its shares are still high, Ahmed
said, ``I don't feel any pressure to go out and strike while the
iron is hot. At the point that we find a deal that makes sense,
we'll do it. We're not feeling any time pressure to make a bad
move.''

 &HT;    Payouts, ignored in boom times, are noticed now
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the stock market gets tippier, more Americans are
turning to an old-fashioned way of growing their portfolios:
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, before the memory of many current investors,
dividend yield was an important consideration in picking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That was before we all discovered that the stock market could go
up 20 percent or more, year after year. With appreciation like
that, who needed cash payments now?
</P>
<P>
   But the super-growth years are not a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get into a period of more modest returns, perhaps even a
down year, people are going to start paying attention to dividends
and thinking about getting that check,'' said Tom Huber, manager of
T. Rowe Price's Dividend Growth mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Dividends are cash payments, usually four times a year, to
owners of shares in a company. Historically they have accounted for
nearly half the growth in stock values.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first 102 years of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
prices of the 30 bellwether stocks have gone up 5.4 percent a year.
Add in dividends paid on those stocks and the growth rate leaps to
9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chart indicates the difference. Finance professor Meir
Statman of Santa Clara University puts it this way: With reinvested
dividends, the Dow would have grown 71 times higher.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second reason for liking dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to cushion the fall in a bad market,'' said Carol M.
Lippman, an equity strategist with the A.G. Edwards brokerage in
St. Louis. Like Huber, she specializes in identifying companies
that increase dividends regularly and can continue doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to have high-flying growth, that's fine,'' Lippman
said. ``But dividend-paying stocks can keep chugging along and can
support the value of your portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippman and others believe that dividends are important not just
to older investors who want the income to live on, but to younger
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can start early and put money into this kind of stock,
I think they will be pleased with the dividend checks they can
receive in retirement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman's master list includes 102 stocks which have growing
dividends and which can be expected to keep up the good work.
</P>
<P>
   She offers General Electric as an example. GE has increased its
dividends an average of 12.9 percent for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think GE can increase its dividends about 15 percent a
year,'' she said. ``If it can do that over a 10-year period, it
will be paying a $2.23 dividend.'' Right now the annual payout is
55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Dividends are not a magic bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no assurance that companies are going to be able to
continue increasing dividends,'' Lippman pointed out. Her studies
showed more than 1,000 companies met the test during the 1980s. But
only 490 made her list during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are another consideration. Dividends are taxed at ordinary
income tax rates, in the year they are paid. The alternative is
non-dividend stocks, which might well retain dividend money and
make the company grow faster.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't owe taxes until you sell the stock, and then it
would be at lower capital gains rates.
</P>
<P>
   That is why many investors put their dividend-paying stocks in
IRAs or other tax-deferred accounts, said Sue Stevens, director of
financial planning for investment researcher Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Investment style is another issue: Dividend-paying companies
tend to be slow, steady growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-growth companies rarely pay dividends, because then need
to reinvest all their profits,'' observed Laura Pavlenko Lutton, a
stock analyst at Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend yields have been going down steadily, as the chart
shows. The yield from S&AMP;P 500 companies sagged to 1.2 percent in
the last half of 1999. It's even lower this year: 0.8 percent at
the end of May, according to Lutton.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid increases in stock prices are one reason, Huber said. The
second reason is that technology companies like Cisco Systems and
Microsoft are a bigger slice of the market, and they typically do
not pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morningstar's database of 7,623 stocks includes 234
companies with yields of 8 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July, the highest average yields came from tobacco
companies, 7.6 percent; real estate investment trusts, 6.6 percent,
and electric utilities and construction companies, each at 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also near the top: forestry and wood products companies, savings
institutions and banks.
</P>
<P>
   How do you pick the good ones?
</P>
<P>
   One more thing to watch out for is implausibly high dividends.
Yields grow fast when a company's stock price plunges, and there is
often a good reason for such drops.
</P>
<P>
   The highest yield reported in Morningstar's database is 118.2
percent. The company still pays a dividend, but it is bobbing
around on the edge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do your homework, as you would with any
investment,'' Lutton said. ``We suggest looking at how fast the
company itself is growing, and how profitable it is. Is it
financially healthy? And does it have an attractive price?''
</P>
<P>
   Huber and Lippman work up lists of companies with growing
dividends, then whittle the list to the most promising ones.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some favorites from these experts:
</P>
<P>
   Lutton likes Philip Morris, Equity Office Properties Trust, Duke
Energy, TXU (formerly Texas Utilities).
</P>
<P>
   Lippman's list of 102 includes General Electric, Fannie Mae,
Gillette and Schering-Plough. The last three have increased
dividends at an annual rate of 15 percent or better over the last
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Huber's top three holdings are Pfizer, Citigroup and Waddell &AMP;
Reed Financial. He has been adding to those holdings since he took
over the fund at the first of the year.

 &HT;    Payouts, ignored in boom times, are noticed now
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the stock market gets tippier, more Americans are
turning to an old-fashioned way of growing their portfolios:
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, before the memory of many current investors,
dividend yield was an important consideration in picking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That was before we all discovered that the stock market could go
up 20 percent or more, year after year. With appreciation like
that, who needed cash payments now?
</P>
<P>
   But the super-growth years are not a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get into a period of more modest returns, perhaps even a
down year, people are going to start paying attention to dividends
and thinking about getting that check,'' said Tom Huber, manager of
T. Rowe Price's Dividend Growth mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Dividends are cash payments, usually four times a year, to
owners of shares in a company. Historically they have accounted for
nearly half the growth in stock values.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first 102 years of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
prices of the 30 bellwether stocks have gone up 5.4 percent a year.
Add in dividends paid on those stocks and the growth rate leaps to
9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chart indicates the difference. Finance professor Meir
Statman of Santa Clara University puts it this way: With reinvested
dividends, the Dow would have grown 71 times higher.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second reason for liking dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to cushion the fall in a bad market,'' said Carol M.
Lippman, an equity strategist with the A.G. Edwards brokerage in
St. Louis. Like Huber, she specializes in identifying companies
that increase dividends regularly and can continue doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to have high-flying growth, that's fine,'' Lippman
said. ``But dividend-paying stocks can keep chugging along and can
support the value of your portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippman and others believe that dividends are important not just
to older investors who want the income to live on, but to younger
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can start early and put money into this kind of stock,
I think they will be pleased with the dividend checks they can
receive in retirement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman's master list includes 102 stocks which have growing
dividends and which can be expected to keep up the good work.
</P>
<P>
   She offers General Electric as an example. GE has increased its
dividends an average of 12.9 percent for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think GE can increase its dividends about 15 percent a
year,'' she said. ``If it can do that over a 10-year period, it
will be paying a $2.23 dividend.'' Right now the annual payout is
55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Dividends are not a magic bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no assurance that companies are going to be able to
continue increasing dividends,'' Lippman pointed out. Her studies
showed more than 1,000 companies met the test during the 1980s. But
only 490 made her list during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are another consideration. Dividends are taxed at ordinary
income tax rates, in the year they are paid. The alternative is
non-dividend stocks, which might well retain dividend money and
make the company grow faster.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't owe taxes until you sell the stock, and then it
would be at lower capital gains rates.
</P>
<P>
   That is why many investors put their dividend-paying stocks in
IRAs or other tax-deferred accounts, said Sue Stevens, director of
financial planning for investment researcher Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Investment style is another issue: Dividend-paying companies
tend to be slow, steady growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-growth companies rarely pay dividends, because then need
to reinvest all their profits,'' observed Laura Pavlenko Lutton, a
stock analyst at Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend yields have been going down steadily, as the chart
shows. The yield from S&AMP;P 500 companies sagged to 1.2 percent in
the last half of 1999. It's even lower this year: 0.8 percent at
the end of May, according to Lutton.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid increases in stock prices are one reason, Huber said. The
second reason is that technology companies like Cisco Systems and
Microsoft are a bigger slice of the market, and they typically do
not pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morningstar's database of 7,623 stocks includes 234
companies with yields of 8 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July, the highest average yields came from tobacco
companies, 7.6 percent; real estate investment trusts, 6.6 percent,
and electric utilities and construction companies, each at 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also near the top: forestry and wood products companies, savings
institutions and banks.
</P>
<P>
   How do you pick the good ones?
</P>
<P>
   One more thing to watch out for is implausibly high dividends.
Yields grow fast when a company's stock price plunges, and there is
often a good reason for such drops.
</P>
<P>
   The highest yield reported in Morningstar's database is 118.2

around on the edge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do your homework, as you would with any

 &HT;    The empty nest full of memories
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My son, Kristofor, ran away from home in
1985. Since then, not much in his room has been changed. The same
comforters are folded across the foot of the same bunk beds he
moved into when he was two. His bears
</P>
<P>
   (Paddington, Pooh, and Twitchums) are still leaning against the
pillows, like maybe they're waiting for him to come home and crawl
in for a nap.
</P>
<P>
   His books still line the shelves over his desk and reflect a
growing boy's changing tastes. The National Geographic Society's
``Trails West'' is right next to a gory Stephen King. On the bottom
shelf, Ayn Rand's ``Atlas Shrugged'' leans against ``The Facts of
Love,'' a book I bought for him when he was 12, to help me with our
first official birds and bees talk. He thanked me for it, I
remember, but said he already knew all of that stuff. Keep it for
reference, I suggested. He promised to give it a look-see and get
back with me. I'm not sure we ever finished that conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom dresser drawer is jammed with his collection of rock
concert tee-shirts, now shrunken and warped out of shape from too
many tumbles in the dryer. I'd always thought they were ugly
things, but he chalked up my lack of
</P>
<P>
   appreciation to the probability that I was ``over the hill'' and
careening rapidly ``around the bend.''
</P>
<P>
   A boy's lifetime collection of Monster magazines fills the top
shelf in his closet, remnants of the years he spent fascinated by
the terrifying creatures that stalked the screen of the old Alamo
theater in the little Georgia town where he did most of his growing
up. Front row center, Kristofor and his best buddy, Chuck, would
spend hours scrunched down in their seats begging to be scared out
of their grubby sneakers by one of stop-motion animation genius Ray
Harryhausen's thrillers _ ``The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'' or
``Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger.'' A little boy thing, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   On the desk are pictures of him at various graduations _ high
school, college, grad school _ as he grew progressively more
handsome with each milestone. Soft, boyish features subtly chiseled
themselves in manhood.
</P>
<P>
   Shoved into a dark corner of the attic are three empty fish
tanks and something that looks like it used to be a sleeping bag _
maybe the clean one that went off to camp with him each summer and
came back mud-caked and smelling like he'd been sharing it with a
weasel in dirty socks.
</P>
<P>
   A long ago outgrown blazer hangs in the garment bag, all cleaned
and ready for him to slip into, if he could. It's a little boy size
12 _ his long ago school crest still on the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why don't you come back home now?'' I'm asking him this
morning while he munches on breakfast _ in Philadelphia. ``You've
been gone long enough. A boy belongs with his mother. I've saved
your crib and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor guffaws some grits into his cordless. I know how silly
I'm sounding but, for just this one moment, I'm deadly serious. I
want my kid back.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so he didn't really run away all those years ago _ he went
off to college. Then more college. And now he has a lovely wife,
and a job, and lives only a short plane ride away. He's where he
should be and doing just fine. I know that.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I think I have too much time on my hands.

 &HT;    No other options: we must draft lawmakers to classroom vacancies
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - The Berlin Wall down, no armies mounting against
us, one might say that in the last eight years our closest thing to
a war effort has been attending to schools. At least rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Whether on reading, writing or warding off student massacres,
this nation has never had so many verbs on the march. Every
civilian has an opinion, a plan.
</P>
<P>
   This on something _ schooling _ Americans used to hand off to
others somewhat like they did milk bottles. Leave the kids on the
curb. Fill 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no more. This is national security, domestic tranquillity.
Come on. Collect and donate your spare syllables to the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   With all the attention, you'd think schools were thriving _
thriving like, for instance, the rivet industry in the Roosevelt
years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the greatest nation on earth. When duty calls, we have
the resources and the will to accomplish whatever we must.
</P>
<P>
   So it must confuse many to find out that the great state of
Texas has 40,000 teaching vacancies, part of an ominous national
trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco Independent School District has 50 vacancies with the
start of school days away.
</P>
<P>
   This national emergency would appear to require one thing, and
one thing only: reinstating the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The details momentarily _ but first, more rhetoric. It seems
someone would be summoned into our war room on this huge manpower
gap, someone with charts and pointers. Press conferences would be
called. Wolf Blitzer's pager would sound.
</P>
<P>
   Instead _ well, we get sound, just no charts, no pointers.
Everyone talks about education. The Texas governor talks about it a
lot. Indeed, as his party convened last week, a party that eight
years ago wanted to abolish the Department of Education, George W.
Bush came close to sounding the cry for nationalizing schools. His
accountability system would tie federal funds to standards judged
by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It's fascinating to watch all the banter about accountability
while the human infrastructure that makes learning possible filters
away like a sand castle in foam.
</P>
<P>
   Forty thousand vacancies in Texas. It's like Fort Hood's 4th
Infantry Division turned up lost, and the 1st Calvary Division went
searching for it and vanished, too. In a war, we'd be frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the draft? Yes. Of course, we don't want to draft just
anyone to teach. It's only because states like ours have done such
a pitiful job replenishing the ranks, and holding on to the good
teachers it has, that it just seems we'll enlist anyone.
</P>
<P>
   We should be true to the name of the Selective Service and make
it that. The first people we draft: lawmakers, the ones who set the
salaries and benefits, who talk up ``accountability'' and
``standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a nationalized school system (this is war), governors no
longer would be needed on the policy front. They would be the first
to go to the classroom. Dealing with pouty and petulant lawmakers,
they would be a perfect fit, say, for second grade.
</P>
<P>
   And of course legislators would be next to go. Assign each in
his or her area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   You can say, ``But there are only 181 legislators in Texas, plus
one governor and one lieutenant governor. How can they make up for
40,000?''
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Once they feel the fires of perspiration, see the
challenges placed before them for the salaries and benefits
provided, face tasks according to the whims of politicians and
bottom-line school boards, they'll find a way as lawmakers. They'll
boost pay. They'll improve benefits, free teachers' hands to do
their jobs. They'll do whatever it takes to find 40,000 highly
qualified teachers. They'll make teaching rewarding. Oh, yes they
will. It's that or the trenches for them.

 (Two color slides are included.) 
 By GENE SANTORO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``We didn't really believe the stories until we went out
ourselves,'' Bart Mansi says. ``That's when it really hit us.''
 &HT;    Last fall, he and other lobstermen along the Connecticut shore
kept hearing about a great lobster die-off 30 miles to the west _
one that began around the time that New York City started spraying
malathion to prevent an epidemic of West Nile encephalitis.
 &HT;    Then in early October, as they plowed into the frigid waters of
Long Island Sound, they found disastrous proof of the rumors: pot
after pot of dead lobsters, and others so weak they died a day or
two after arriving on land.
 &HT;    Worried and baffled, Mansi hooked up with biologist Mike
Loughlin, now at the National Marine Fisheries Service. During the
next couple of weeks, Loughlin examined dead lobsters up and down
the coast and took hundreds of blood samples.
 &HT;    His diagnosis: The lobsters were killed by paramoebic and
bacterial infections, but only because something had broken down
the animals' immune systems first.
 &HT;    Altogether, some 10 million pounds of lobsters died of unnatural
causes off the Connecticut and New York shores last season, and the
losses are expected to continue for several years.
 &HT;    Suggestive, disturbing and maddeningly inconclusive, the lobster
fatalities typify the environmental incidents that observers have
linked to malathion.
 &HT;    The lobstermen quickly blamed the pesticide, but sewage runoff
and other pesticides could just as easily have been the culprits.
True, the timing of the dieoff was suspicious _ malathion has been
known to kill crustaceans, and the spraying had already killed
hundreds of fish on Staten Island.
 &HT;    But it's hard to imagine that, after being diluted in millions
of gallons of water, enough of the pesticide could have drifted or
flowed into the Sound to kill the lobsters.
 &HT;    As for the pesticide's effect on people, the evidence is just as
ambiguous. Biologists say the human body can break down malathion
much faster than mosquitoes can, and most agree that the spraying
in New York was too light to cause harm.
 &HT;    Yet U.S. Poison Control Centers have a database of more than
10,000 incidents involving malathion, some of them fatal. This
spring, after a four-year review, the EPA declared that there is
``suggestive evidence'' that malathion can cause cancer. Yet an
agency representative described the danger as ``below our level of
concern.''
 &HT;    How to weigh such risks? When does paranoia become reasonable
suspicion? When does the long-term danger of spraying a mild
neurotoxin outweigh the short-term danger of a crop infestation or
a mosquito-borne disease?
 &HT;    This summer, city officials across America may ask themselves
those questions as they face the same agonizing choice that New
Yorkers faced.
 &HT;    West Nile encephalitis _ a cousin to St. Louis encephalitis _
was never seen in North America before last year and is probably
here to stay, most epidemiologists say. The next likely target is
the Southeast, with its sweltering temperatures and plentiful
mosquitoes, but no one knows when an epidemic will come or what
toll it will take.
 &HT;    In 1975, when St. Louis encephalitis struck Chicago, more than
500 people contracted the disease and 47 died; the next year only a
handful were infected.
 &HT;    Last year, when New Yorkers began dying of the disease, the city
ordered a fleet of helicopters, trucks and an airplane to spray
malathion and other pesticides for weeks. The potential epidemic
was eventually contained (with the help of cold fall temperatures),
but the long-term costs of the victory may never be known. &HT;    This year, the city isn't taking any chances. In March,
mosquitoes in Queens were found to contain West Nile viral RNA, so
the city launched an unprecedented campaign to keep mosquitoes from
breeding and hatching. Spraying pesticides such as malathion,
officials say, will remain an option.
 &HT;    In the meantime, hardware stores still sell malathion, and the
EPA can only assure that it's ``one of the least risky of the
riskiest class of pesticides.''
 &HT;    Before health officials decide to spray it over cities again,
perhaps they ought to take a look at malathion's
less-than-reassuring history _ remembering that DDT, too, once
seemed like humanity's last, best defense against mosquito-borne
diseases.
 &HT;    Better yet, as a faint buzzing begins to fill the air, officials
might want to go talk to a few lobstermen.
 &HT;    ``We're holding on by a couple of shoestrings,'' Bart Mansi
says. ``Females with eggs were killed, as well as juveniles, so we
could be looking at a seven- to 10-year cycle with a serious
downturn. The guys farther west, closer to New York _ somewhere
around 99 percent of their catch is dead, so they're not even going
out any more. And the people that sprayed this stuff are pretending
nothing's happened.''

 (Two color and three B&AMP;W slides are included.) 
 By PATRICIA GADSBY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A group of us, some scientists but mostly not, have just had
dinner together at the New York Academy of Sciences. We've eaten
well and settled down for the evening's lecture.
 &HT;    The speaker, from Yale University, is Linda Bartoshuk, a
specialist in human taste. She hands us each a small packet
containing a piece of filter paper saturated with a compound called
propylthiouracil, known in taste circles as PROP.
 &HT;    We're instructed to put the papers in our mouths. As my saliva
wets it, a nasty bitterness blooms. Then Bartoshuk asks for a show
of hands. How many of us tasted something? How many of us didn't?
 &HT;    Of course, Bartoshuk knows the punch line: Typically, a quarter
of the audience tastes nothing. This routine never fails to impress
an audience. Jaws go slack as hands shoot up in answer to both
questions.
 &HT;    The bottom line: We don't all live in the same taste world.
 &HT;    Researchers began suspecting as much in the 1930s, after a
chemist who was making a batch of a compound called
phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) let a puff of the crystals fly into the
air.
 &HT;    A lab colleague, who must have swallowed some of the airborne
crystals, noted how bitter they were. The astonished chemist, who
tasted nothing himself, became the first to describe ``taste
blindness'' to the bitter compound.
 &HT;    As it turned out, nontasters respond to all types of bitterness
less intensely than tasters, and the degree to which people taste
PROP can serve as a general indicator of their overall taste
capacity.
 &HT;    The inability to taste PROP is genetic and most likely due to a
recessive gene. That would fit rather nicely with Bartoshuk's
finding that there exists a subset of PROP-tasters supersensitive
to bitterness. She calls them super-tasters.
 &HT;    Looking at the three groups, you see just the sort of patterns
you'd expect for a recessive gene. Roughly 25 percent of people
tested with PROP don't taste it, consistent with two recessive
genes; 50 percent are tasters, consistent with one recessive and
one dominant gene; and 25 percent are super-tasters, consistent
with two dominant gene copies, one from each parent.
 &HT;    The distribution is slightly sex-skewed. More women than men are
super-tasters, perhaps because bitter is the skull and crossbones
of the natural world, and evolution once favored mothers with
superior poison-detecting systems.
 &HT;    What's fascinating, Bartoshuk says, is that tongue anatomy
spells out the differences among these groups. Tasters have more
taste buds than nontasters, and super-tasters have the most.
Because taste buds are surrounded by nerve endings that sense not
only taste but pain and touch, super-tasters, perhaps not
surprisingly, have a more sensational taste repertoire. Bitter
tastes bitterer, some sweets taste sweeter. Fat feels fattier, and
alcohol and chili burn more fiercely.
 &HT;    Intrigued by her discoveries, I persuaded Bartoshuk to let me
visit her lab in the Yale University School of Medicine for a
two-day immersion in taste.
 &HT;    First, Bartoshuk performs a checkup _ a spatial test of my
tongue _ by painting tastes on it one section at a time. Using
cotton swabs as brushes, she dips into various concentrations of
sodium chloride, paints the salt solutions on my tongue and asks me
to rate their intensity on a scale of zero to 100.
 &HT;    Then she brushes on sucrose to test my sense of sweet, citric
acid to test sour, and quinine to test bitter. She's aiming for
little bumps called papillae on the tongue's front, sides and back.
Those on the front are the so-called fungiforms, because they look
like button mushrooms. The foliates, supposedly leaflike, show up
as a reddish series of folds on each edge near the back.
 &HT;    Way, way back, practically down the throats of some people, lie
the circumvallates, which stand like round moated towers across the
tongue's surface in an inverted V.
 &HT;    We call the bumps of our papillae taste buds, but they're more
like Xs marking taste-bud spots: Our taste buds, for the most part,
are nested into them and much too minuscule to see.
 &HT;    Special receptor cells poke out of these tiny organs to catch
the sweet, salty, sour and bitter molecules that land in the mouth.
When tasty molecules stimulate the receptors, they in turn
stimulate nerve endings inside the tongue, and the messages
ricochet along nerves to the brain.
 &HT;    ``So this is essentially a neurological test for nerves in your
mouth,'' Bartoshuk explains. ``I'm putting solutions on areas of
the tongue where I know which nerve is innervating the tissue, and
I want you to evaluate what you're perceiving.''
 &HT;    The nerves to which she's referring are the two main cranial
nerves for taste that run from the brain to the tongue's front and
back. When she dabs sweet onto the fungiform papillae, she knows
she's stimulating the taste nerve at the front: the chorda tympani.
When she puts sweet onto the circumvallates, she's testing the
taste nerve at the tongue's back: the glossopharyngeal.
 &HT;    In addition, by dabbing on pure alcohol or capsaicin, the fiery
chemical in chilies, she can test the nerve for touch, called the
trigeminal, which sends little, pain-sensitive fibers to the
papillae.
 &HT;    Judging from the way I rate tastes, especially bitter tastes,
I'm a relatively ``strong responder,'' Bartoshuk says. ``You're not
going to have a nontaster tongue, that's for sure. The question is
just how many fungiform papillae you have.''
 &HT;    A typical nontaster's tongue has few fungiforms, a
super-taster's tongue packs loads of them, and a medium-taster's
tongue falls somewhere in between.
 &HT;    After staining my tongue blue with vegetable dye (it delineates
the fungiforms, which stay pink, from other tongue tissue),
Bartoshuk tells me there is an area of my tongue where the
fungiform papillae are missing.
 &HT;    ``Now, no big deal,'' she says. ``It suggests some trigeminal
damage.''
 &HT;    The nerves going to the mouth are vulnerable to many kinds of
insults: dental work and common viral infections among them. For
anatomic reasons, the taste nerve serving the front of the tongue,
the chorda tympani, takes the brunt of viral hits. As the nerve
travels between the brain and the tongue, it passes right under the
eardrum, the tympanic membrane. So during an ear infection, or an
upper respiratory infection affecting the ears, a virus sometimes
infiltrates this taste nerve and knocks it temporarily _ or even
permanently _ out of commission.
 &HT;    Lucky for us, our sense of taste has a system of compensation.
Normally the nerves of the tongue inhibit one another. The taste
nerve in the front, for instance, inhibits the taste nerve at the
back, and vice versa. Injure the front nerve, and there's a release
of inhibition on the signals from the back nerve, which makes up
for the deficit.
 &HT;    ``So when taste in the front goes down, taste in the back goes
up,'' Bartoshuk says.
 &HT;    But sometimes there's a cost. A loss in one nerve can lead to
exaggerated responses in the disinhibited nerve, or even conjure up
sensations that seem to have no real-world cause.
 &HT;    These ``taste phantoms,'' Bartoshuk says, ``are sensations in
the absence of stimulation.'' They come in all four of the classic
tastes, as we might expect, as well as the sour-mineral taste we
interpret as metallic.
 &HT;    The most common ``release-of-inhibition'' phantoms turn up at
the back of the tongue when the taste nerve up front sustains some
type of damage. I myself have a metallic visitor that tends to make
an appearance when I have a stuffy cold or flu, probably because
the invading virus has made it into the chorda tympani.
 &HT;    Much of what we commonly refer to as taste, of course, consists
of smell, the aroma of food in our mouths. It's not sweetness that
makes a banana banana-y; it's the scent.
 &HT;    When we're eating a banana, however, we're not aware of smelling
its scent up the back chimney of our noses. It feels as though
we're sensing it inside the cavernous laboratory of our mouths, as
part and parcel of an overall flavor. Again the brain appears at
work here, referring food-aroma to the mouth by the sensations of
touch and taste.
 &HT;    But when we eat, the brain isn't just melding taste, smell and
touch to give us the intricately flavored and textured experience
of food. It recalls the pleasures, and displeasures, associated
with the foods we're eating.
 &HT;    ``Sweetness is a deep biological pleasure,'' Bartoshuk says. It
signals safe calories in nature, and the pleasure's probably
hardwired. But most of the pleasures of eating are conditioned,
learned by experience.
 &HT;    ``Does a gourmet enjoy his expensive chocolate mousse more than
I enjoy my Hershey's bar? I don't think so. I like my Hershey's bar
a lot,'' Bartoshuk says with a big, infectious laugh.
 &HT;    So when it comes to pleasure, it probably doesn't matter much
whether we are super-tasters, medium-tasters or nontasters. Our
brains will work to calibrate pleasure to our particular sets of
chemical senses, because it wants to keep those calories coming in
so we'll survive.
 &HT;    Our noggins will make sure we enjoy our food to the max _ our
max.

 By GENE SANTORO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``We didn't really believe the stories until we went out
ourselves,'' Bart Mansi says. ``That's when it really hit us.''
 &HT;    Last fall, he and other lobstermen along the Connecticut shore
kept hearing about a great lobster die-off 30 miles to the west _
one that began around the time that New York City started spraying
malathion to prevent an epidemic of West Nile encephalitis.
 &HT;    Then in early October, as they plowed into the frigid waters of
Long Island Sound, they found disastrous proof of the rumors: pot
after pot of dead lobsters, and others so weak they died a day or
two after arriving on land.
 &HT;    Worried and baffled, Mansi hooked up with biologist Mike
Loughlin, now at the National Marine Fisheries Service. During the
next couple of weeks, Loughlin examined dead lobsters up and down
the coast and took hundreds of blood samples.
 &HT;    His diagnosis: The lobsters were killed by paramoebic and
bacterial infections, but only because something had broken down
the animals' immune systems first.
 &HT;    Altogether, some 10 million pounds of lobsters died of unnatural
causes off the Connecticut and New York shores last season, and the
losses are expected to continue for several years.
 &HT;    Suggestive, disturbing and maddeningly inconclusive, the lobster
fatalities typify the environmental incidents that observers have
linked to malathion.
 &HT;    The lobstermen quickly blamed the pesticide, but sewage runoff
and other pesticides could just as easily have been the culprits.
True, the timing of the dieoff was suspicious _ malathion has been
known to kill crustaceans, and the spraying had already killed
hundreds of fish on Staten Island.
 &HT;    But it's hard to imagine that, after being diluted in millions
of gallons of water, enough of the pesticide could have drifted or
flowed into the Sound to kill the lobsters.
 &HT;    As for the pesticide's effect on people, the evidence is just as
ambiguous. Biologists say the human body can break down malathion
much faster than mosquitoes can, and most agree that the spraying
in New York was too light to cause harm.
 &HT;    Yet U.S. Poison Control Centers have a database of more than
10,000 incidents involving malathion, some of them fatal. This
spring, after a four-year review, the EPA declared that there is
``suggestive evidence'' that malathion can cause cancer. Yet an
agency representative described the danger as ``below our level of
concern.''
 &HT;    How to weigh such risks? When does paranoia become reasonable
suspicion? When does the long-term danger of spraying a mild
neurotoxin outweigh the short-term danger of a crop infestation or
a mosquito-borne disease?
 &HT;    This summer, city officials across America may ask themselves
those questions as they face the same agonizing choice that New
Yorkers faced.
 &HT;    West Nile encephalitis _ a cousin to St. Louis encephalitis _
was never seen in North America before last year and is probably
here to stay, most epidemiologists say. The next likely target is
the Southeast, with its sweltering temperatures and plentiful
mosquitoes, but no one knows when an epidemic will come or what
toll it will take.
 &HT;    In 1975, when St. Louis encephalitis struck Chicago, more than
500 people contracted the disease and 47 died; the next year only a
handful were infected.
 &HT;    Last year, when New Yorkers began dying of the disease, the city
ordered a fleet of helicopters, trucks and an airplane to spray
malathion and other pesticides for weeks. The potential epidemic
was eventually contained (with the help of cold fall temperatures),
but the long-term costs of the victory may never be known. &HT;    This year, the city isn't taking any chances. In March,
mosquitoes in Queens were found to contain West Nile viral RNA, so
the city launched an unprecedented campaign to keep mosquitoes from
breeding and hatching. Spraying pesticides such as malathion,
officials say, will remain an option.
 &HT;    In the meantime, hardware stores still sell malathion, and the
EPA can only assure that it's ``one of the least risky of the
riskiest class of pesticides.''
 &HT;    Before health officials decide to spray it over cities again,
perhaps they ought to take a look at malathion's
less-than-reassuring history _ remembering that DDT, too, once
seemed like humanity's last, best defense against mosquito-borne
diseases.
 &HT;    Better yet, as a faint buzzing begins to fill the air, officials
might want to go talk to a few lobstermen.
 &HT;    ``We're holding on by a couple of shoestrings,'' Bart Mansi
says. ``Females with eggs were killed, as well as juveniles, so we
could be looking at a seven- to 10-year cycle with a serious
downturn. The guys farther west, closer to New York _ somewhere
around 99 percent of their catch is dead, so they're not even going
out any more. And the people that sprayed this stuff are pretending
nothing's happened.''

 (Two color and three B&AMP;W slides are included.) 
 By PATRICIA GADSBY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A group of us, some scientists but mostly not, have just had
dinner together at the New York Academy of Sciences. We've eaten
well and settled down for the evening's lecture.
 &HT;    The speaker, from Yale University, is Linda Bartoshuk, a
specialist in human taste. She hands us each a small packet
containing a piece of filter paper saturated with a compound called
propylthiouracil, known in taste circles as PROP.
 &HT;    We're instructed to put the papers in our mouths. As my saliva
wets it, a nasty bitterness blooms. Then Bartoshuk asks for a show
of hands. How many of us tasted something? How many of us didn't?
 &HT;    Of course, Bartoshuk knows the punch line: Typically, a quarter
of the audience tastes nothing. This routine never fails to impress
an audience. Jaws go slack as hands shoot up in answer to both
questions.
 &HT;    The bottom line: We don't all live in the same taste world.
 &HT;    Researchers began suspecting as much in the 1930s, after a
chemist who was making a batch of a compound called
phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) let a puff of the crystals fly into the
air.
 &HT;    A lab colleague, who must have swallowed some of the airborne
crystals, noted how bitter they were. The astonished chemist, who
tasted nothing himself, became the first to describe ``taste
blindness'' to the bitter compound.
 &HT;    As it turned out, nontasters respond to all types of bitterness
less intensely than tasters, and the degree to which people taste
PROP can serve as a general indicator of their overall taste
capacity.
 &HT;    The inability to taste PROP is genetic and most likely due to a
recessive gene. That would fit rather nicely with Bartoshuk's
finding that there exists a subset of PROP-tasters supersensitive
to bitterness. She calls them super-tasters.
 &HT;    Looking at the three groups, you see just the sort of patterns
you'd expect for a recessive gene. Roughly 25 percent of people
tested with PROP don't taste it, consistent with two recessive
genes; 50 percent are tasters, consistent with one recessive and
one dominant gene; and 25 percent are super-tasters, consistent
with two dominant gene copies, one from each parent.
 &HT;    The distribution is slightly sex-skewed. More women than men are
super-tasters, perhaps because bitter is the skull and crossbones
of the natural world, and evolution once favored mothers with
superior poison-detecting systems.
 &HT;    What's fascinating, Bartoshuk says, is that tongue anatomy
spells out the differences among these groups. Tasters have more
taste buds than nontasters, and super-tasters have the most.
Because taste buds are surrounded by nerve endings that sense not
only taste but pain and touch, super-tasters, perhaps not
surprisingly, have a more sensational taste repertoire. Bitter
tastes bitterer, some sweets taste sweeter. Fat feels fattier, and
alcohol and chili burn more fiercely.
 &HT;    Intrigued by her discoveries, I persuaded Bartoshuk to let me
visit her lab in the Yale University School of Medicine for a
two-day immersion in taste.
 &HT;    First, Bartoshuk performs a checkup _ a spatial test of my
tongue _ by painting tastes on it one section at a time. Using
cotton swabs as brushes, she dips into various concentrations of
sodium chloride, paints the salt solutions on my tongue and asks me
to rate their intensity on a scale of zero to 100.
 &HT;    Then she brushes on sucrose to test my sense of sweet, citric
acid to test sour, and quinine to test bitter. She's aiming for
little bumps called papillae on the tongue's front, sides and back.
Those on the front are the so-called fungiforms, because they look
like button mushrooms. The foliates, supposedly leaflike, show up
as a reddish series of folds on each edge near the back.
 &HT;    Way, way back, practically down the throats of some people, lie
the circumvallates, which stand like round moated towers across the
tongue's surface in an inverted V.
 &HT;    We call the bumps of our papillae taste buds, but they're more
like Xs marking taste-bud spots: Our taste buds, for the most part,
are nested into them and much too minuscule to see.
 &HT;    Special receptor cells poke out of these tiny organs to catch
the sweet, salty, sour and bitter molecules that land in the mouth.
When tasty molecules stimulate the receptors, they in turn
stimulate nerve endings inside the tongue, and the messages
ricochet along nerves to the brain.
 &HT;    ``So this is essentially a neurological test for nerves in your
mouth,'' Bartoshuk explains. ``I'm putting solutions on areas of
the tongue where I know which nerve is innervating the tissue, and
I want you to evaluate what you're perceiving.''
 &HT;    The nerves to which she's referring are the two main cranial
nerves for taste that run from the brain to the tongue's front and
back. When she dabs sweet onto the fungiform papillae, she knows
she's stimulating the taste nerve at the front: the chorda tympani.
When she puts sweet onto the circumvallates, she's testing the
taste nerve at the tongue's back: the glossopharyngeal.
 &HT;    In addition, by dabbing on pure alcohol or capsaicin, the fiery
chemical in chilies, she can test the nerve for touch, called the
trigeminal, which sends little, pain-sensitive fibers to the
papillae.
 &HT;    Judging from the way I rate tastes, especially bitter tastes,
I'm a relatively ``strong responder,'' Bartoshuk says. ``You're not
going to have a nontaster tongue, that's for sure. The question is
just how many fungiform papillae you have.''
 &HT;    A typical nontaster's tongue has few fungiforms, a
super-taster's tongue packs loads of them, and a medium-taster's
tongue falls somewhere in between.
 &HT;    After staining my tongue blue with vegetable dye (it delineates
the fungiforms, which stay pink, from other tongue tissue),
Bartoshuk tells me there is an area of my tongue where the
fungiform papillae are missing.
 &HT;    ``Now, no big deal,'' she says. ``It suggests some trigeminal
damage.''
 &HT;    The nerves going to the mouth are vulnerable to many kinds of
insults: dental work and common viral infections among them. For
anatomic reasons, the taste nerve serving the front of the tongue,
the chorda tympani, takes the brunt of viral hits. As the nerve
travels between the brain and the tongue, it passes right under the
eardrum, the tympanic membrane. So during an ear infection, or an
upper respiratory infection affecting the ears, a virus sometimes
infiltrates this taste nerve and knocks it temporarily _ or even
permanently _ out of commission.
 &HT;    Lucky for us, our sense of taste has a system of compensation.
Normally the nerves of the tongue inhibit one another. The taste
nerve in the front, for instance, inhibits the taste nerve at the
back, and vice versa. Injure the front nerve, and there's a release
of inhibition on the signals from the back nerve, which makes up
for the deficit.
 &HT;    ``So when taste in the front goes down, taste in the back goes
up,'' Bartoshuk says.
 &HT;    But sometimes there's a cost. A loss in one nerve can lead to
exaggerated responses in the disinhibited nerve, or even conjure up
sensations that seem to have no real-world cause.
 &HT;    These ``taste phantoms,'' Bartoshuk says, ``are sensations in
the absence of stimulation.'' They come in all four of the classic
tastes, as we might expect, as well as the sour-mineral taste we
interpret as metallic.
 &HT;    The most common ``release-of-inhibition'' phantoms turn up at
the back of the tongue when the taste nerve up front sustains some
type of damage. I myself have a metallic visitor that tends to make
an appearance when I have a stuffy cold or flu, probably because
the invading virus has made it into the chorda tympani.
 &HT;    Much of what we commonly refer to as taste, of course, consists
of smell, the aroma of food in our mouths. It's not sweetness that
makes a banana banana-y; it's the scent.
 &HT;    When we're eating a banana, however, we're not aware of smelling
its scent up the back chimney of our noses. It feels as though
we're sensing it inside the cavernous laboratory of our mouths, as
part and parcel of an overall flavor. Again the brain appears at
work here, referring food-aroma to the mouth by the sensations of
touch and taste.
 &HT;    But when we eat, the brain isn't just melding taste, smell and
touch to give us the intricately flavored and textured experience
of food. It recalls the pleasures, and displeasures, associated
with the foods we're eating.
 &HT;    ``Sweetness is a deep biological pleasure,'' Bartoshuk says. It
signals safe calories in nature, and the pleasure's probably
hardwired. But most of the pleasures of eating are conditioned,
learned by experience.
 &HT;    ``Does a gourmet enjoy his expensive chocolate mousse more than
I enjoy my Hershey's bar? I don't think so. I like my Hershey's bar
a lot,'' Bartoshuk says with a big, infectious laugh.
 &HT;    So when it comes to pleasure, it probably doesn't matter much
whether we are super-tasters, medium-tasters or nontasters. Our
brains will work to calibrate pleasure to our particular sets of
chemical senses, because it wants to keep those calories coming in
so we'll survive.
 &HT;    Our noggins will make sure we enjoy our food to the max _ our
max.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By CHRISTOPHER HALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Leiden, a walkable city on two small branches of the Rhine
River, is something more than a nice little Dutch town, as it was
once described to me by a friend who lived there.
 &HT;    Although unmistakably Dutch in appearance _ with quiet
neighborhoods of gabled, canalside houses and a small open-air
market selling North Sea herring and wax-covered wheels of Gouda _
Leiden's window on the world is larger than its population of
117,000 would indicate.
 &HT;    Almost since the founding of its university in 1575, the city
has attracted some of the brightest minds in Europe, and these days
scholars from around the world go there to teach and conduct
research. The 11,000 students who attend the University of Leiden
and fill the city's dark, smoky coffeehouses keep things from
getting too fusty.
 &HT;    Perhaps because of its academic tradition and the Netherlands'
historic role as a crossroads of international commerce, Leiden is
a city of museums. With the exception of Amsterdam, which is 35
minutes northeast by train and has a population nearly seven times
that of Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad
range of museums _ a dozen, large and small, covering everything
from classical antiquities to the history of medicine, to
windmills.
 &HT;    And for its size, Leiden is unusually rich in historic sites.
Rembrandt was born there; the city was an early center of
publishing and medicine; and the first tulips in Holland were
planted in the university's botanical garden. In the 17th century
America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before leaving for
the New World via Plymouth, England.
 &HT;    Given our brief two days there in March, my partner, Mac, and I
decided to limit our museumgoing to three or four institutions and
our historic sites to those we could see on a leisurely walk around
Leiden's compact city center. It proved to be a good plan, although
we had to make several adjustments when confronted with unexpected
closures and renovations.
 &HT;    Knowing that many of the museums are closed on Mondays, we
arrived on a Tuesday. It was a cold and gray morning on the cusp of
spring at the city's modern glass-and-steel train station.
 &HT;    Exiting through a sea of bicycles parked outside the station, we
walked 10 minutes to the Rapenburg, a handsome tree-lined canal
along which some of Leiden's most prosperous citizens built stately
homes in the 17th century, when the city was flush with money from
the production of woolen cloth.
 &HT;    We stopped briefly to leave our bags at the Hotel De Doelen, a
converted 1638 neoclassical mansion where we were spending the
night, and then continued to the university and its botanical
garden.
 &HT;    The origins of the university and of Leiden's eventual
prominence lie in a Spanish siege of the city in 1574 during the
Protestant Dutch revolt against the iron rule of Catholic Spain.
Thousands of its citizens died of starvation and disease during the
siege, and popular belief has it that the mayor, one Van der Werf,
convinced a ravenous mob not to surrender only by offering his own
body as food.
 &HT;    A nice story, but as noted with admirable candor in a booklet I
picked up at Leiden's tourist office, ``its accuracy is dubious,
since the annals show that Van der Werf had to be dissuaded from
opening the gates to the Spaniards on more than one occasion.''
 &HT;    The booklet also casts doubt on another popular belief, that the
university was a gift from William of Orange in appreciation for
Leiden's successful resistance. Instead, it appears, the Protestant
Low Countries simply needed their own university, and Leiden made
sense because it was freed early on from Spain.
 &HT;    The main ceremonial building of the university, the Academy
(Academiegebouw), occupies a former Dominican convent on the
Rapenburg. A dignified, two-story brick structure with a steep
slate roof and a domed bell tower, the Academy still resembles a
church, although it is now used for lectures and official
university functions.
 &HT;    Behind the Academy is the university's Hortus Botanicus, a
botanical garden originally laid out in 1590 as a place to grow and
study medicinal and poisonous plants. In the 16th century such
gardens were common at universities with medical schools, but the
first curator of Leiden's garden, the Flemish botanist Carolus
Clusius, eventually had the novel idea of creating a place where
all known plants would be collected and studied.
 &HT;    As a result, imports from the New World _ such as the tomato,
the potato, tobacco and corn _ were introduced into Northern Europe
through the Leiden garden. Clusius also introduced tulips to
Holland (they were originally from Turkey), first planting them in
the Hortus in 1594.
 &HT;    Over the centuries, Clusius' garden has grown into a large oasis
of old trees, flowers and thousands of plant species from around
the world, although on the day we visited the entrance was torn up
by the construction of a new winter garden (which opened in May),
and the garden still had its bare, winter look.
 &HT;    As we walked around, however, we did come across a few signs of
spring _ several beds of crocus, swelling nodes on an ancient
wisteria, and a scattering of solitary daffodils, whose yellow
blooms looked particularly vibrant under the steely sky.
 &HT;    A light drizzle eventually drove us into the garden's extensive
greenhouses, where we happily wandered through the heavy, warm air,
passing under towering tree ferns and stopping to examine a
carnivorous plant from Borneo or cerise-colored blooms sprouting
like miniature feather boas from the branches of a New Guinea
euphorbia.
 &HT;    Back outside, we retraced our steps along the Rapenburg to the
National Museum of Antiquities (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden). It's the
principal archaeological museum in the Netherlands, and we'd been
looking forward to seeing its outstanding collection of Egyptian
and Classical Greek and Roman artifacts.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, we found the museum in the midst of a major
renovation (scheduled to be completed next spring), and most of its
permanent collection was on loan or in storage. What we did see
whetted our appetites _ papyrus manuscripts, beautifully
proportioned Greek vases, translucent alabaster cups and solemn,
marble busts of eminent Romans.
 &HT;    We both enjoyed a small display devoted to the ancient Egyptian
love of beer, and also managed to peek into the museum's most
dramatic gallery (which was closed): a covered courtyard filled
with heroic-sized statuary and an entire temple of Isis rescued
from the rising waters behind the Aswan Dam.
 &HT;    We ate a light lunch at Camino Real, a cozy, two-level
restaurant that occupies a former stable just around the corner
from the Academy. Surrounded by an animated university crowd of
professorial types in worn tweed jackets and students in jeans and
T-shirts, we split a bowl of flavorful celery-onion soup and a
sandwich of cheese, smoked salmon, avocado and mixed greens on
Italian flatbread.
 &HT;    By the time we finished, the overcast sky had yielded to
brilliant blue with billowing white clouds, so we spent the rest of
the afternoon walking around Leiden's center, stopping frequently
to investigate a shop or a historic building, or to admire spring
blooms placed in the front window of a house. Here and there were
mural-sized poems painted on the sides of buildings.
 &HT;    At Pieterskerk, a large old church a block off the Rapenburg,
now used for concerts and other nonreligious functions, we saw a
memorial plaque dedicated to John Robinson, the Pilgrims' spiritual
leader.
 &HT;    The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609 and left for America in
1620, in part because they feared that cosmopolitan Leiden would
corrupt their morals. Robinson intended to join them later but
never made it, dying in Leiden in 1625.
 &HT;    We weren't able to see inside the church since it was closed,
but on a nearby pedestrian lane of pleasant shops and restaurants
(Pieterskerk-Choorsteeg) we did spot a plaque marking the site of
the Pilgrims' printing press.
 &HT;    Across from the church, at Kloksteeg 21, we sat for a while in
the quiet, grassy courtyard of the 1683 almshouse that replaced
Robinson's residence. During Leiden's golden era, well-to-do
individuals _ some getting on in years and worried about the
salvation of their souls _ built small houses where elderly poor
people could live for free.
 &HT;    The almshouses are known in Dutch as ``hofjes,'' or ``little
courtyards,'' because they were traditionally built around a common
court that had a single opening onto the street. While many of
Leiden's 35 existing hofjes are now private residences, some
courtyards are open to the public; the visitors center has a
brochure outlining a walking tour.
 &HT;    The next day we arrived at the National Museum of the History of
Science and Medicine, known as the Boerhaave Museum, just as it was
opening. It had not been high on our list of museums, but our
friend Oliver Moore, who had recently moved to the city, had
convinced us that it had more to offer than pickled brains and
scary old surgical implements. It is housed in a beautifully
renovated building where Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), an innovator
in clinical medicine, founded one of the first teaching hospitals
in the world.
 &HT;    The collection is quirky _ ranging from exquisitely crafted
microscopes of polished brass to an amusing display of antique
apothecary shop signs from Amsterdam, each depicting a human head
with mouth agape.
 &HT;    I was particularly fascinated by a reconstruction of Leiden's
Theatrum Anatomicum, a steeply raked anatomical theater where
Boerhaave and others performed human dissections while skeletons
and other memento mori loomed overhead.
 &HT;    Later that day we toured a collection of old Dutch tile,
household furnishings and paintings at the Lakenhal Municipal
Museum (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal), which occupies the city's
1640 cloth hall. In the galleries we saw one of Rembrandt's
earliest dated paintings, ``An Unidentified Historical Subject,'' a
fussy mythological scene from 1625 that is far more detailed and
far less striking than his mature works.
 &HT;    Although Rembrandt first studied painting in Leiden, he became
famous only after settling in Amsterdam in 1631. His boyhood home
no longer exists, but other sites connected with his youth in
Leiden _ such as the street (Weddesteeg) where he grew up and the
Latin School on Lokhorststraat where he studied _ still survive.
 &HT;    Toward the end of the day, while on our way to the train
station, we stopped at the restored 18th-century windmill that now
houses the Valk Municipal Windmill Museum (Stedelijk Molenmuseum De
Valk). The Valk is one of about 950 windmills left in the
Netherlands, down from 10,000 about 100 years ago.
 &HT;    Oliver's wife, Ts'ai Ch'in, had encouraged us to visit the Valk,
and once inside I could see why. After a brief look at the
informative historical displays, we clambered up ladder-like steps,
passed the massive grinding wheels and stepped onto the outside
platform, where the mill's huge sails swooped precariously close to
our heads.
 &HT;    Although we had a train to catch, we lingered a few minutes,
enjoying a bird's-eye view of Leiden and the bracing feel of North
Sea wind on our faces.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By E. CLINTON HOTALING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    This has been the Whitney century at Saratoga Springs.
 &HT;    In 1900, William C. Whitney, who made millions in New York City
street railways, took over Saratoga Race Course, expanded it and
reinvigorated the whole town. Soon his cronies, notably Reggie
Vanderbilt and John Bet-a-Million Gates, were dropping hundreds of
thousands of dollars at Richard A. Canfield's casino, and Victor
Herbert and John Philip Sousa were playing the Springs.
 &HT;    In 2000, Whitney's Victorian grandstand is still the town's
symbol, and the racing season is by far the best in the country.
The high-rollers' ghosts pad about the Casino museum. The New York
City Ballet, the Philadelphia Orchestra and Britney Spears, among
others, play the Performing Arts Center. And most amazing, although
she has lowered her public profile a bit, a Whitney towers over the
resort.
 &HT;    Marylou Whitney's wealth has been a royal force in preserving
Saratoga, and when she arrives for the Whitney Gala on Friday at
the Casino in Congress Park, it will launch the season in earnest.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    A who's who of thoroughbreds and jockeys stars at Saratoga Race
Course, America's oldest major sports venue. The 36-day program was
scheduled to open on Wednesday and runs through Labor Day. After
attracting 900,000-plus fans last season, a record, the New York
Racing Association has poured more millions into this year's
purses, bringing them to $8.7 million, another record.
 &HT;    The $1 million Travers Stakes on Aug. 26 is the highlight of the
season. The $750,000 Whitney Handicap will be run next Sunday and
the $750,000 Alabama Stakes on Aug. 19.
 &HT;    The original track, now in a stable area across Union Avenue,
dates from 1847 and today's main course from 1864. The races start
at 1 p.m. every day except Tuesday, when the track is closed, and
Aug. 26, when the first post time is 12:30 p.m. General admission,
$2; $4 for the clubhouse (no short-shorts, cut-offs, tank tops).
 &HT;    Breakfast at the track from 7 to 9:30 a.m. allows you to see
workouts, the barn area, a paddock show and a starting-gate
demonstration. No reservations are required (first come first
served), though the lines are often long on nice days. Information:
(518) 584-6200.
 &HT;    The resort's other great show is at the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center on Route 50 just outside town. It seats 5,000 in the
amphitheater, with room for 20,000 more on the lawn. Among the
stars: ``Lord of the Dance'' (Aug. 13), Counting Crows and Live
with Galactic (Aug. 14), Pearl Jam (Aug. 27), the Dave Matthews
Band (Aug. 29) and Britney Spears (Aug. 30). Ticket prices for
special events range from $8 on the lawn for the Boys Choir of
Harlem to $48 for the best seats in the amphitheater for Counting
Crows and Live with Galactic. For information, call (518) 587-3330.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In the spectacular new wing of the National Museum of Racing and
Hall of Fame, at 191 Union Ave. (www.racingmuseum.org), you can see
saddles used by Julie Krone and Bill Shoemaker, the Triple Crown
trophies won by Whirlaway, the gold-plated diamond-encrusted whip
presented to the jockey Jerry Bailey for Cigar's victory in the
Dubai World Cup in 1996, and the whip Ron Turcotte did not have to
use as Secretariat passed the eighth pole on the way to his
unforgettable 1973 Belmont Stakes triumph (the pole itself is on
the front lawn). It's all in the new Hall of Fame Heroes room, part
of an $8 million renovation.
 &HT;    The exhibits are by turns memory-jogging (the silks Steve
Cauthen wore in navigating Affirmed to his narrow triumphs over
Alydar), delightful (the mail sent to Kelso) and really odd (a
photograph of a crowd staring at Man o' War's corpse). The museum
is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through the racing season, then 10
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 4:30 p.m.
Sunday. Admission is $7; (518) 584-0400.
 &HT;    Visitors can design their own sightseeing strolls past
Saratoga's lovely old homes (for a guide, you can stop by the Urban
Heritage Area visitor center across from Congress Park on Broadway
or the Chamber of Commerce booth in front of the park). One of the
most eye-opening would take in Greek revival homes from the 1820's
onward. Walk from Broadway up Division Street for three blocks to
find five examples: Nos. 1, 3 and 4 Franklin Square and Nos. 59 and
63 Franklin Street.
 &HT;    Another walk would introduce you to Congress Park and its
circa-1900 Florentine marble Tritons in a pool. Vandalized last
year, they are now repaired and furiously blowing water at each
other again.
 &HT;    Or you can drive past the racecourse on Union Avenue and through
the entrance to the wooded Yaddo artists retreat, now celebrating
its centennial, and walk through classical Italian rose and
Anglo-American rock gardens, graced with pools and century-old
statuary. Guided garden tours at 11 a.m. Tuesdays (until Labor
Day), Saturdays and Sundays are $2; (518) 584-0746.
 &HT;    Early birds can catch one of Saratoga's loveliest sights, the
thoroughbreds working out in the morning mist (from 5:30 to 10:30)
at the Oklahoma training track. The public is not allowed through
the gate but you can still get a nice view through the fence along
East Avenue, between Fifth and Union avenues. (The National Museum
of Racing offers tours that take groups inside the gate during
training; $10, which includes museum admission.)
 &HT;    The Adelphi Hotel, 365 Broadway, is a downtown landmark, its
luscious antique lobby a good place to stop for a drink. Cross the
street for a view of the hotel's glorious raised piazza, with
pierced spandrel openings, thin three-story columns, high Victorian
windows, and Renaissance and Italianate motifs. It's from 1877,
when they got the most out of a stoop.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Hotel reservations can be hard to come by through Labor Day,
especially on weekends.
 &HT;    Now into its first full racing season, the 112-room Hilton
Garden Inn, 125 South Broadway, (518) 587-1500, fax (518) 587-7800,
has an indoor pool, exercise room and business center. The price is
middle range, considering that this town's rates assume everybody
has hit an exacta. Rooms are spacious and loaded with amenities,
including high-speed Internet access, microwave, hair dryer,
refrigerator and a safe big enough for a laptop; from $189 through
Labor Day, then $99 to $179.
 &HT;    At the 42-room Downtowner Motel, (888) 480-6160, fax (518)
584-2907, under new management, I was happy to step around four
cast members of ``Grease,'' starring at the Performing Arts Center
but just then doing situps on the floor around the indoor pool.
Rooms have been nicely redone, are cheerful and very up to date;
from $137 through Labor Day, then $75. It's smack in the middle of
everything at 413 Broadway.
 &HT;    Budget: At the southern end of Broadway, but within a healthy
walk of downtown, is the 18-room St. Charles Motel, 188 Broadway,
(518) 584-2050, fax (518) 584-6216, with cozy rooms starting at
$125 through Labor Day, then $55.
 &HT;    The Locust Grove Motel is actually in a locust grove about three
and a half miles south of town, at 2838 Route 9, Malta; (888)
256-2878, fax (518) 580-1817. It has two 16-unit buildings and two
cabin units. Rooms have kitchenettes, at $99 through Labor Day,
then $50.
 &HT;    Luxury: In its second season, the Saratoga Arms, 495-497
Broadway, (518) 584-1775, fax (518) 581-4064, is a magnificently
restored Second Empire brick hotel dating from 1870, the year Henry
James visited Saratoga. He would have loved this 16-room hotel
rescued from demolition by Kathleen and Noel Smith. Rooms have
antique furnishings and high ceilings; several have fireplaces and
clawfoot tubs; all have voice mail, data ports, cable TV and CD
players; a full Irish breakfast is served. Rooms from $275 through
Labor Day, then from $150.
 &HT;    The 168-room Holiday Inn, at 232 Broadway, (518) 584-4550, fax
(518) 584-4417, is the perfect starting gate for walks into
Congress Park or past the period homes on and off Circular Street.
It has a full-scale restaurant and bar and a heated outdoor pool.
Many of the newly appointed rooms have views of the park or town.
Room prices range from $219 through Labor Day, then $150.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Chez Sophie Bistro, 2853 Route 9, Malta, (518) 583-3538, is like
a trip to France, serving memorable fare that belies its setting: a
converted diner in Malta, three and a half miles south of town. It
is run by Sophie Parker, the French-born chef, and her husband,
Joseph, a sculptor, assisted by their son, Paul. A recent meal
included chanterelles in a reduction of chicken stock and sherry; a
salad of baby field greens and organic lettuces, and swordfish
pan-sauteed with a sherry wine vinegar vinaigrette, sweet red
peppers and shallots. The cheese plate included St. Agur, Reblochon
and crottin de Chavignol. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of
wine: $110 to $120.
 &HT;    The hottest place in town is Chianti, 208 South Broadway, (518)
580-0025, with an open kitchen and glowing burnt-sienna decor.
Owned by the irrepressible David Zecchini, from Rome, and his wife,
Maria, it features the bold tastes of their 31-year-old chef,
Fabrizio Bazzani, from Verona. Popular specialties: an appetizer of
carpaccio in truffle oil with a Gorgonzola sauce, porcini risotto
and a white chocolate gelato requiring a week of penance. Dinner
for two with wine: $100.
 &HT;    Out Union Avenue, just before you hit Saratoga Lake, is the
comfortable Longfellows Inn and Restaurant, 500 Union Ave., (518)
587-0108, created from two dairy barns. High on many diners' lists:
the bourbon-glazed salmon and pan-seared tournedos. Dinner for two
with wine comes to about $100.
 &HT;    Joseph DeVivo, talented scion of a well-known Saratoga family,
is the maestro of Maestro's, 371 Broadway, (518) 580-0312, where
you dine to the accompaniment of recorded jazz and blues in the
heart of town. Specialties include osso bucco, crab cakes and
freshly made pastas. Dinner and wine for two: $70.
 &HT;    With its Southern fried chicken, such Louisiana specialties as
Creole jambalaya, and red snapper Provencal, Hattie's, 45 Phila
St., (518) 584-4790, is the real deal for bargain hunters. At this
convivial down-home restaurant, two can dine with a bottle of wine
for $50; there is also a late menu, with many items under $7, from
10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.
 &HT;    At Ashleigh's, 506 Broadway, (518) 580-0329, you can get a fine
breakfast, such as a sausage-potato-cheese omelet, for under $7. Or
a lunch of grilled chicken with bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce on
a roll, under $7. Or, starting this season, a steak, seafood or
pasta dinner for two with wine for less than $40. It's a pleasant,
airy spot, and this being Saratoga, it's in a corner of a
magnificent Romanesque revival building.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARIALISA CALTA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every year, as my husband and I pack the car for our August
vacation, we look around at the impossibly green, impossibly
beautiful Vermont landscape and ask each other if we are crazy.
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave Vermont in the summer, when there are so
many swimming holes to splash in, so many country fairs to visit,
so many trails to hike?
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave during the time of year when our
down-country friends would trade in their theater tickets to stay
even in the sagging old farmhouse we live in, and a chance to watch
the sun set over the mountains and hear the crickets at night?
 &HT;    One of my closest friends comes to Vermont from the Upper West
Side of Manhattan each summer with her husband and two children,
renting a house not far from ours. She delights in going fishing
and canoeing, taking walks and shopping at the local farmers'
market. She and her family love Vermont, and every year Dirk and I
have the opportunity to see our home state anew through their eyes.
 &HT;    I realize once again how lucky we are to live within walking
distance of a pond that features both good swimming and excellent
boating, and a general store where the owners not only know our
names but also extend credit.
 &HT;    In summer, the night sky offers northern lights and shooting
stars, swooping bats and symphony-quality thunderstorms. There are
farms to visit and potters' studios and small gallery shows by
wonderful artists. There are mountains to climb and, in nearly
every village, a Vermont institution: the ``creemee'' stand,
offering soft-serve ice cream in vanilla, chocolate and maple.
 &HT;    So why, come August, do we pack our two children and our dog and
way, way too much stuff into our Subaru wagon and take a grueling,
16-hour drive north? Prince Edward Island, our destination, is,
after all, not that much different from Vermont. Cows graze in
pastures that slope to the water's edge. Towns are small and
manageable, and people are reserved but friendly. ``Vermont with
ocean'' is how we describe Prince Edward to our stay-home friends.
 &HT;    While others may seek cultural stimulation on their vacations,
my husband and I see our few weeks off as an opportunity to get
some much-needed exercise and simplify our lives. We live in a
place that offers plenty of opportunity for both.
 &HT;    But whether or not we've brought it on ourselves, we have
certainly managed to complicate our lives. We spend many more hours
driving our kids to sports and school events than contemplating
nature, and much more time absorbed in our work than working out on
country roads.
 &HT;    Our lives are cluttered with the trappings of contemporary
America _ computers and portable phones, TV and videos, stores
offering way too much stuff and credit cards offering way too much
money to buy it with.
 &HT;    The main reason anyone who lives in a vacation destination
leaves it for another is simple: we live here. We're not on
vacation.
 &HT;    While my New York friends Pam and Carl may spend their Vermont
days splashing with their kids, I spend mine e-mailing, faxing and
phoning _ not to mention laundering, shopping, cooking and
cleaning.
 &HT;    I can't remember the last time I went fishing with my daughters
(who, at 15 and 12, would now regard me as demented if I were to
suggest it), or did much of anything else with them except drop
them at the pond or _ more to their liking _ at the nearest mall.
 &HT;    I know people who take ``at home'' vacations, visiting all the
attractions they never get a chance to see, but I don't think I
could manage it. My home is my workplace, and it's hard to get out
the door to go recreate while the phones are ringing.
 &HT;    So each summer we drive north to impose our fantasies of a
slower paced life on the Prince Edward Islanders. We do almost
nothing for days on end and marvel at how laid-back the islanders
are.
 &HT;    The friends we have made there do seem to have more time for
music and visiting, but that's probably because we are the ones who
are dropping by, urging them to pick up their fiddles.
 &HT;    Surely they have just as much laundry to do, and I often hear
their children clamoring to go to ``town'' (as the capital city,
Charlottetown, is called) and shop the malls. I've noticed a
proliferation of cell phones since we first started going there
about 10 summers ago.
 &HT;    Last August the carpenter who built the cabin we own gave us his
pager number. The rest of the year we communicate with him by fax
and e-mail.
 &HT;    For two or three weeks, we fancy ourselves part of something a
little purer, somewhat less materialistic and more genteel than
what we experience at home _ just as, I think, Pam feels when she
leaves the hubbub of her neighborhood.
 &HT;    And it works. Our life on vacation is less crazy and
materialistic, and more genteel. I go biking and berry-picking with
my daughters, and the four of us sleep outside some nights and
watch northern lights and meteor showers even more spectacular than
we see at home in darkness that, since we are miles from an
electric light, seems more absolute than in Vermont.
 &HT;    The weekly trip to the Laundromat seems like a pleasant outing
compared with the daily load or two I do routinely at home. Even a
trip to the carwash is a maritime adventure: The one in Souris _
the town closest to our cabin _ offers a ridiculously spectacular
ocean view. I can count fishing boats and sea gulls while vacuuming
the red island clay from the floor mats.
 &HT;    Food shopping is a treat: we delight in seeking out fishermen
and local gardeners to sell us some of what we will eat each
evening. And cooking on the tiny propane stove or over a campfire
at our cabin is much more fun than it is at home, where the
microwave and the food processor make the chore more mechanical. We
play hearts by candlelight and read big fat books that we have no
time for back in Vermont.
 &HT;    Most important for me is the fact that I get to spend several
weeks without hearing a phone ring or a fax beep, or checking any
sort of mail whatsoever.
 &HT;    We leave our home, in fact, for the same reason people in New
York or Paris or any other world-class vacation destination leave
theirs: for a change of scenery and a change of pace.
 &HT;    Travelers often indulge in the fantasy that the people in the
places they visit lead lives that are more civilized, or more down
to earth, or more ``spiritual'' than their own workaday existences.
In truth it is the travelers themselves _ separated from familiar
rooms and belongings _ who are forced to focus more on who they are
and what is important to them.
 &HT;    We return, of course, to stacks of mail and desks full of the
work that piled up while we were away. But if time and distance
have worked their magic, we return also with a renewed appreciation
for where we live, and a sense of pride that people ``from away''
will travel long distances to gaze at the views we take for
granted.
 &HT;    Recently, some of our friends from Prince Edward Island, who
usually stick very close to home, sent us an e-mail message that
said they were contemplating a vacation this year. They are
thinking of coming to Vermont. We can't wait to show them how
laid-back we are.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to London. We want to be treated
like royalty, but we don't have a king's ransom to spend. Are we
dreaming or does a hotel exist that can wow us?
 &HT;     Q:  The Rubens at The Palace will treat you and your wife like
a king and queen without breaking your wallet. This hotel is
perfectly located opposite Buckingham Palace in the heart of London
and is within easy reach of St. James' Park, historic sites, the
financial district and West End theaters
 &HT;    The Rubens provides guests with outstanding personal service,
thanks to the congenial general manager, Jonathan Raggett. Every
modern business and leisure convenience has been provided here, yet
the owner, the innovative Bea Tollman, has furnished The Rubens in
a luxurious residential fashion with rich fabrics and antiques. I
know of no other hotel that so thoughtfully fills their room desks
with essential office supplies.
 &HT;    The Rubens' assets include the popular Cavalry Bar done in a
classic British military theme; The Palace Lounge for tea and a
quiet read overlooking the historic Royal Mews; The Library
Restaurant for the finest British and international cuisine; and
The Carvery for traditional roasts and more.
 &HT;    Be it a business or vacation stay, The Rubens, a member of the
Red Carnation Hotel Collection, is truly a memorable experience run
by snappy, kind people who pride themselves on the fact that no
detail is overlooked and no request is too large. Rates start at
$250 a night, double occupancy. For more information, call (800)
858-8471, or visit www.redcarnationhotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q: . My girlfriend and I are planning a vacation to Mexico and
are searching for several intimate, high-quality hotels. We want to
stay away from chain hotels. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Mexico Boutique Hotels is a collection of member properties
that are characterized by uniqueness and their high level of
service.
 &HT;    The hotels in the Mexico Boutique Hotel group have less than 50
rooms. Style of accommodation varies and often includes villas,
casitas and bungalows. Some play on a sense of grandeur, while
others return to the basics of palm-thatched cottages.
 &HT;    To see the complete selection of Mexico Boutiques Hotels, visit
www.mexicoboutiquehotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I really enjoy being in the great outdoors,
and for his birthday I would love to give him something we could
both use when we go hiking or biking.
 &HT;     A:  For the latest outdoor gadgets and toys, turn to Motorola.
They have just released their latest line of two-way radios, the
Talkabout T6300 series.
 &HT;    These new two-way radios feature just about everything an
adventure enthusiast could want _ current weather reports; audible
storm-warning alerts; a built-in clock, alarm and stopwatch; a
noise filter to protect against unwanted noise in the surrounding
environment; and the radios are dust and shock resistant. They
provide 532 signals so you can be sure to find an unused channel.
 &HT;    With a range of up to two miles (depending upon terrain), these
gadgets are great for rural and urban settings alike. For the
city-dweller, these gadgets are useful at concerts and the mall and
are an excellent way for parents to stay in contact with their
families. With a retail price between $129 to $179 per radio, the
T6300 series is quite affordable.
 &HT;    Motorola also offers a wide range of extras such as
voice-activated headsets and a wall-mountable battery-charging
station, which allows the radios to be used as an intercom system.
 &HT;    Overall, the Motorola Talkabouts are at the top of today's
market in terms of quality, versatility and functionality. The
T6300 series will become available nationwide in September.
 &HT;     Q:  My family has strong Italian roots, but I've never
experienced any of the legendary neighborhoods in American cities
that I've often heard about. Trips to New York and San Francisco
felt too touristy. Are there any legitimate Italian neighborhoods
left to explore?
 &HT;     A:  A lively one can be found in Boston's North End. Visit on a
late Saturday afternoon in summer, when the air is warm and
fragrant with the lingering aromas of lunch, and the whole
neighborhood seems to pause before the rigors of the evening meal.
 &HT;    Wander around and explore the side streets. You might find a
sweet old lady with a lemonade stand, or a strolling parish priest
saying buona sera to the locals.
 &HT;    To purchase olive oils and foodstuffs, visit Salumeria Italiano
at 151 Richmond St., a few blocks from the Old North Church and
Paul Revere's home.
 &HT;    For a truly authentic touch, head to Salem Street and Polcari's
Coffee, a spice store that's really a catch-all grocery for the
locals. Engineers who miss their old neighborhood work weekends as
clerks. Enjoy the banter as folks drop in to buy chestnut flour or
flavorings for homemade liqueurs. Tape a dollar to the collection
poster for the saint whose festival is coming up. If you're lucky,
there will be a miniparade to collect all the offerings.
 &HT;    With its narrow streets, the North End is best reached by cab or
subway _ anything to avoid parking and the epic nuisance of the Big
Dig, Boston's traffic nightmare. Visitor information is available
at www.northendboston.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I will be traveling to Southern France and would like to
see some ancient sites. Do you have any suggestions that will put
me in the heart of ancient France?
 &HT;     A:  The recently renovated Hotel de la Cite near Carcassonne is
now giving historical, cultural and lifestyle tours of their area
in the legendary Southwest region of Languedoc-Roussillon.
 &HT;    Carcassonne is Europe's largest and most perfectly preserved
medieval city. Among the highlights of the escorted tours are Roman
ruins, a 13th-century dungeon, a 14th-century palace, an
11th-century abbey and famous castles. Cities visited include
Arques, Castelnou, Limoux, Narbonnes and Toulouse.
 &HT;    The fully escorted half-day tours range in price from $14 to $70
per person, and full-day tours are approximately $88 to $103 per
person, including all transportation and entrance fees.
 &HT;    Renovated in 1999, the Hotel de la Cite was formerly an
Episcopal palace and today is a member of Orient-Express hotels. It
combines magnificent neo-gothic stained-glass windows and mosaic
floors with five-star amenities.
 &HT;    The hotel features fine gourmet cuisine plus less-formal dining
options to accommodate a wide variety of tastes. For more
information or reservations, call (800) 223-6800, or visit
www.hoteldelacite.com on the Web.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the

 PLEASE NOTE: Optional-trim indicators are included in this

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises offer some of the best values in the
travel business. And the fall cruise season _ a time when cruise
lines begin moving their ships to new locations _ is a good
opportunity to try one.
 &HT;    The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) cites these
advantages for repositioning cruises:
 &HT;     _ ONE-OF-A-KIND ITINERARIES.  Because ships are moving from one
part of the world to another, the combination of ports visited is
unique. Often these itineraries include ocean or Panama Canal
crossings as well as ports not usually visited on other sailings.
 &HT;     _ VALUE.  Two-for-one fares, air-inclusive offers and a variety
of off-season promotional rates make cruise prices very attractive.
 &HT;     _ SPECIAL ENTERTAINMENT.  Cruise lines may enhance their
repositioning cruises with entertainment that isn't always offered
on other cruises.
 &HT;     _ EXTRA DAYS.  Longer itineraries allow more time at sea.
 &HT;    However, you should be aware that cruise lines may use
repositioning voyages to train new staff or to try new shore trips,
giving an experimental flavor to the cruise.
 &HT;    Contact your travel agent about these repositioning cruises or
others that will be offered this fall:
 &HT;    _ America Cruise Lines, which sails the waterways of the U.S.
East Coast year-round, will be in Baltimore on Nov. 4 before
heading to Jacksonville, Fla., for the winter months.
 &HT;    _ Costa Cruises Lines leaves Europe from Genoa to head for the
Caribbean Nov. 3 and 17. Ports of call: the Bahamas, British Virgin
Islands, Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Leeward Island, Madeira,
Morocco and Spain.
 &HT;    _ Holland America Line moves five vessels from Alaska to the
Caribbean on trips ranging from 17 to 22 days. Departures are in
September and October with 17- or 22-day cruises that pass through
the Panama Canal.
 &HT;    _ Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Wind leaves Vancouver Sept.
18 to sail a special 11-day Hawaiian Island itinerary before moving
on to the Caribbean.
 &HT;    _ After its inaugural season in Bermuda, the Pacific Princess
leaves New York on Oct. 29 to move to the Holy Land. There will be
16 days at sea with port calls in Ponta Delgada and Lisbon,
Portugal; Gibraltar; Barcelona; Cannes; Laverno; and Rome.
 &HT;    _ Royal Olympic moves its Stella Solaris from the Mediterranean
to the Caribbean with a Dec. 1 sailing from Piraeus, Greece. Ports
include Naples, Capri and Civitavecchia in Italy; Nice, France;
Cartagena, Spain; Tangier, Morocco; Lisbon and Madeira, Portugal;
San Juan; and Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    _ Seabourn Cruise Line has a Three Continent Discovery on its
Legend beginning Oct. 20 in Lisbon. Available in segments of six,
13 or 19 days, the itinerary has stops in Funchal, Madeira; Dakar,
Senegal; Bridgetown, Barbados; Virgin Gorda, BVI; San Juan; and
Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    
 BETTER BREATHING CARIBBEAN CRUISE  
 &HT;    The Better Breathing Club of Norwalk Hospital, in Norwalk,
Conn., is offering a cruise through the Eastern Caribbean for
travelers with chronic pulmonary diseases. Arrangements will be
made for those needing supplemental oxygen in flight and during the
cruise.
 &HT;    The cruise is aboard Celebrity's The Century, which leaves from
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Nov. 4 for a week's cruise with stops in San
Juan, St. Maarten, St. Thomas and Nassau.
 &HT;    Traveling with the group will be a pulmonary physician, nurses
and respiratory therapists. Prices start at $1,018, including port
charges. Air, insurance, oxygen and special equipment is extra. For
more information, call (800) 536-9383.
 &HT;    
 $1,000 SAVINGS  
 &HT;    First European Cruises is offering a $1,000 savings per person
on September and October sailings aboard the Mistral in the Eastern
Mediterranean. It sails round trip from Venice on seven-day cruises
to Dubrovnik, Katakolon, Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes and Piraeus
(Athens). Discounted departure dates are Sept. 2, 9, 16, 23 and
Oct. 7, 14, 21 and 28.
 &HT;    The cruise-only promotional rates start at $1,250/double for an
outside cabin. Round-trip airfare add-ons from Venice are available
from 50 gateways and for $950 from the East Coast, $1,200 West
Coast. For more information, call (888) 983-8767, or visit

 &HT;    
 NEW HAWAIIAN SHIP

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By CHRISTOPHER HALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Leiden, a walkable city on two small branches of the Rhine
River, is something more than a nice little Dutch town, as it was
once described to me by a friend who lived there.
 &HT;    Although unmistakably Dutch in appearance _ with quiet
neighborhoods of gabled, canalside houses and a small open-air
market selling North Sea herring and wax-covered wheels of Gouda _
Leiden's window on the world is larger than its population of
117,000 would indicate.
 &HT;    Almost since the founding of its university in 1575, the city
has attracted some of the brightest minds in Europe, and these days
scholars from around the world go there to teach and conduct
research. The 11,000 students who attend the University of Leiden
and fill the city's dark, smoky coffeehouses keep things from
getting too fusty.
 &HT;    Perhaps because of its academic tradition and the Netherlands'
historic role as a crossroads of international commerce, Leiden is
a city of museums. With the exception of Amsterdam, which is 35
minutes northeast by train and has a population nearly seven times
that of Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad
range of museums _ a dozen, large and small, covering everything
from classical antiquities to the history of medicine, to
windmills.
 &HT;    And for its size, Leiden is unusually rich in historic sites.
Rembrandt was born there; the city was an early center of
publishing and medicine; and the first tulips in Holland were
planted in the university's botanical garden. In the 17th century
America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before leaving for
the New World via Plymouth, England.
 &HT;    Given our brief two days there in March, my partner, Mac, and I
decided to limit our museumgoing to three or four institutions and
our historic sites to those we could see on a leisurely walk around
Leiden's compact city center. It proved to be a good plan, although
we had to make several adjustments when confronted with unexpected
closures and renovations.
 &HT;    Knowing that many of the museums are closed on Mondays, we
arrived on a Tuesday. It was a cold and gray morning on the cusp of
spring at the city's modern glass-and-steel train station.
 &HT;    Exiting through a sea of bicycles parked outside the station, we
walked 10 minutes to the Rapenburg, a handsome tree-lined canal
along which some of Leiden's most prosperous citizens built stately
homes in the 17th century, when the city was flush with money from
the production of woolen cloth.
 &HT;    We stopped briefly to leave our bags at the Hotel De Doelen, a
converted 1638 neoclassical mansion where we were spending the
night, and then continued to the university and its botanical
garden.
 &HT;    The origins of the university and of Leiden's eventual
prominence lie in a Spanish siege of the city in 1574 during the
Protestant Dutch revolt against the iron rule of Catholic Spain.
Thousands of its citizens died of starvation and disease during the
siege, and popular belief has it that the mayor, one Van der Werf,
convinced a ravenous mob not to surrender only by offering his own
body as food.
 &HT;    A nice story, but as noted with admirable candor in a booklet I
picked up at Leiden's tourist office, ``its accuracy is dubious,
since the annals show that Van der Werf had to be dissuaded from
opening the gates to the Spaniards on more than one occasion.''
 &HT;    The booklet also casts doubt on another popular belief, that the
university was a gift from William of Orange in appreciation for
Leiden's successful resistance. Instead, it appears, the Protestant
Low Countries simply needed their own university, and Leiden made
sense because it was freed early on from Spain.
 &HT;    The main ceremonial building of the university, the Academy
(Academiegebouw), occupies a former Dominican convent on the
Rapenburg. A dignified, two-story brick structure with a steep
slate roof and a domed bell tower, the Academy still resembles a
church, although it is now used for lectures and official
university functions.
 &HT;    Behind the Academy is the university's Hortus Botanicus, a
botanical garden originally laid out in 1590 as a place to grow and
study medicinal and poisonous plants. In the 16th century such
gardens were common at universities with medical schools, but the
first curator of Leiden's garden, the Flemish botanist Carolus
Clusius, eventually had the novel idea of creating a place where
all known plants would be collected and studied.
 &HT;    As a result, imports from the New World _ such as the tomato,
the potato, tobacco and corn _ were introduced into Northern Europe
through the Leiden garden. Clusius also introduced tulips to
Holland (they were originally from Turkey), first planting them in
the Hortus in 1594.
 &HT;    Over the centuries, Clusius' garden has grown into a large oasis
of old trees, flowers and thousands of plant species from around
the world, although on the day we visited the entrance was torn up
by the construction of a new winter garden (which opened in May),
and the garden still had its bare, winter look.
 &HT;    As we walked around, however, we did come across a few signs of
spring _ several beds of crocus, swelling nodes on an ancient
wisteria, and a scattering of solitary daffodils, whose yellow
blooms looked particularly vibrant under the steely sky.
 &HT;    A light drizzle eventually drove us into the garden's extensive
greenhouses, where we happily wandered through the heavy, warm air,
passing under towering tree ferns and stopping to examine a
carnivorous plant from Borneo or cerise-colored blooms sprouting
like miniature feather boas from the branches of a New Guinea
euphorbia.
 &HT;    Back outside, we retraced our steps along the Rapenburg to the
National Museum of Antiquities (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden). It's the
principal archaeological museum in the Netherlands, and we'd been
looking forward to seeing its outstanding collection of Egyptian
and Classical Greek and Roman artifacts.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, we found the museum in the midst of a major
renovation (scheduled to be completed next spring), and most of its
permanent collection was on loan or in storage. What we did see
whetted our appetites _ papyrus manuscripts, beautifully
proportioned Greek vases, translucent alabaster cups and solemn,
marble busts of eminent Romans.
 &HT;    We both enjoyed a small display devoted to the ancient Egyptian
love of beer, and also managed to peek into the museum's most
dramatic gallery (which was closed): a covered courtyard filled
with heroic-sized statuary and an entire temple of Isis rescued
from the rising waters behind the Aswan Dam.
 &HT;    We ate a light lunch at Camino Real, a cozy, two-level
restaurant that occupies a former stable just around the corner
from the Academy. Surrounded by an animated university crowd of
professorial types in worn tweed jackets and students in jeans and
T-shirts, we split a bowl of flavorful celery-onion soup and a
sandwich of cheese, smoked salmon, avocado and mixed greens on
Italian flatbread.
 &HT;    By the time we finished, the overcast sky had yielded to
brilliant blue with billowing white clouds, so we spent the rest of
the afternoon walking around Leiden's center, stopping frequently
to investigate a shop or a historic building, or to admire spring
blooms placed in the front window of a house. Here and there were
mural-sized poems painted on the sides of buildings.
 &HT;    At Pieterskerk, a large old church a block off the Rapenburg,
now used for concerts and other nonreligious functions, we saw a
memorial plaque dedicated to John Robinson, the Pilgrims' spiritual
leader.
 &HT;    The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609 and left for America in
1620, in part because they feared that cosmopolitan Leiden would
corrupt their morals. Robinson intended to join them later but
never made it, dying in Leiden in 1625.
 &HT;    We weren't able to see inside the church since it was closed,
but on a nearby pedestrian lane of pleasant shops and restaurants
(Pieterskerk-Choorsteeg) we did spot a plaque marking the site of
the Pilgrims' printing press.
 &HT;    Across from the church, at Kloksteeg 21, we sat for a while in
the quiet, grassy courtyard of the 1683 almshouse that replaced
Robinson's residence. During Leiden's golden era, well-to-do
individuals _ some getting on in years and worried about the
salvation of their souls _ built small houses where elderly poor
people could live for free.
 &HT;    The almshouses are known in Dutch as ``hofjes,'' or ``little
courtyards,'' because they were traditionally built around a common
court that had a single opening onto the street. While many of
Leiden's 35 existing hofjes are now private residences, some
courtyards are open to the public; the visitors center has a
brochure outlining a walking tour.
 &HT;    The next day we arrived at the National Museum of the History of
Science and Medicine, known as the Boerhaave Museum, just as it was
opening. It had not been high on our list of museums, but our
friend Oliver Moore, who had recently moved to the city, had
convinced us that it had more to offer than pickled brains and
scary old surgical implements. It is housed in a beautifully
renovated building where Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), an innovator
in clinical medicine, founded one of the first teaching hospitals
in the world.
 &HT;    The collection is quirky _ ranging from exquisitely crafted
microscopes of polished brass to an amusing display of antique
apothecary shop signs from Amsterdam, each depicting a human head
with mouth agape.
 &HT;    I was particularly fascinated by a reconstruction of Leiden's
Theatrum Anatomicum, a steeply raked anatomical theater where
Boerhaave and others performed human dissections while skeletons
and other memento mori loomed overhead.
 &HT;    Later that day we toured a collection of old Dutch tile,
household furnishings and paintings at the Lakenhal Municipal
Museum (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal), which occupies the city's
1640 cloth hall. In the galleries we saw one of Rembrandt's
earliest dated paintings, ``An Unidentified Historical Subject,'' a
fussy mythological scene from 1625 that is far more detailed and
far less striking than his mature works.
 &HT;    Although Rembrandt first studied painting in Leiden, he became
famous only after settling in Amsterdam in 1631. His boyhood home
no longer exists, but other sites connected with his youth in
Leiden _ such as the street (Weddesteeg) where he grew up and the
Latin School on Lokhorststraat where he studied _ still survive.
 &HT;    Toward the end of the day, while on our way to the train
station, we stopped at the restored 18th-century windmill that now
houses the Valk Municipal Windmill Museum (Stedelijk Molenmuseum De
Valk). The Valk is one of about 950 windmills left in the
Netherlands, down from 10,000 about 100 years ago.
 &HT;    Oliver's wife, Ts'ai Ch'in, had encouraged us to visit the Valk,
and once inside I could see why. After a brief look at the
informative historical displays, we clambered up ladder-like steps,
passed the massive grinding wheels and stepped onto the outside
platform, where the mill's huge sails swooped precariously close to
our heads.
 &HT;    Although we had a train to catch, we lingered a few minutes,
enjoying a bird's-eye view of Leiden and the bracing feel of North
Sea wind on our faces.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By E. CLINTON HOTALING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    This has been the Whitney century at Saratoga Springs.
 &HT;    In 1900, William C. Whitney, who made millions in New York City
street railways, took over Saratoga Race Course, expanded it and
reinvigorated the whole town. Soon his cronies, notably Reggie
Vanderbilt and John Bet-a-Million Gates, were dropping hundreds of
thousands of dollars at Richard A. Canfield's casino, and Victor
Herbert and John Philip Sousa were playing the Springs.
 &HT;    In 2000, Whitney's Victorian grandstand is still the town's
symbol, and the racing season is by far the best in the country.
The high-rollers' ghosts pad about the Casino museum. The New York
City Ballet, the Philadelphia Orchestra and Britney Spears, among
others, play the Performing Arts Center. And most amazing, although
she has lowered her public profile a bit, a Whitney towers over the
resort.
 &HT;    Marylou Whitney's wealth has been a royal force in preserving
Saratoga, and when she arrives for the Whitney Gala on Friday at
the Casino in Congress Park, it will launch the season in earnest.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    A who's who of thoroughbreds and jockeys stars at Saratoga Race
Course, America's oldest major sports venue. The 36-day program was
scheduled to open on Wednesday and runs through Labor Day. After
attracting 900,000-plus fans last season, a record, the New York
Racing Association has poured more millions into this year's
purses, bringing them to $8.7 million, another record.
 &HT;    The $1 million Travers Stakes on Aug. 26 is the highlight of the
season. The $750,000 Whitney Handicap will be run next Sunday and
the $750,000 Alabama Stakes on Aug. 19.
 &HT;    The original track, now in a stable area across Union Avenue,
dates from 1847 and today's main course from 1864. The races start
at 1 p.m. every day except Tuesday, when the track is closed, and
Aug. 26, when the first post time is 12:30 p.m. General admission,
$2; $4 for the clubhouse (no short-shorts, cut-offs, tank tops).
 &HT;    Breakfast at the track from 7 to 9:30 a.m. allows you to see
workouts, the barn area, a paddock show and a starting-gate
demonstration. No reservations are required (first come first
served), though the lines are often long on nice days. Information:
(518) 584-6200.
 &HT;    The resort's other great show is at the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center on Route 50 just outside town. It seats 5,000 in the
amphitheater, with room for 20,000 more on the lawn. Among the
stars: ``Lord of the Dance'' (Aug. 13), Counting Crows and Live
with Galactic (Aug. 14), Pearl Jam (Aug. 27), the Dave Matthews
Band (Aug. 29) and Britney Spears (Aug. 30). Ticket prices for
special events range from $8 on the lawn for the Boys Choir of
Harlem to $48 for the best seats in the amphitheater for Counting
Crows and Live with Galactic. For information, call (518) 587-3330.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In the spectacular new wing of the National Museum of Racing and
Hall of Fame, at 191 Union Ave. (www.racingmuseum.org), you can see
saddles used by Julie Krone and Bill Shoemaker, the Triple Crown
trophies won by Whirlaway, the gold-plated diamond-encrusted whip
presented to the jockey Jerry Bailey for Cigar's victory in the
Dubai World Cup in 1996, and the whip Ron Turcotte did not have to
use as Secretariat passed the eighth pole on the way to his
unforgettable 1973 Belmont Stakes triumph (the pole itself is on
the front lawn). It's all in the new Hall of Fame Heroes room, part
of an $8 million renovation.
 &HT;    The exhibits are by turns memory-jogging (the silks Steve
Cauthen wore in navigating Affirmed to his narrow triumphs over
Alydar), delightful (the mail sent to Kelso) and really odd (a
photograph of a crowd staring at Man o' War's corpse). The museum
is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through the racing season, then 10
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 4:30 p.m.
Sunday. Admission is $7; (518) 584-0400.
 &HT;    Visitors can design their own sightseeing strolls past
Saratoga's lovely old homes (for a guide, you can stop by the Urban
Heritage Area visitor center across from Congress Park on Broadway
or the Chamber of Commerce booth in front of the park). One of the
most eye-opening would take in Greek revival homes from the 1820's
onward. Walk from Broadway up Division Street for three blocks to
find five examples: Nos. 1, 3 and 4 Franklin Square and Nos. 59 and
63 Franklin Street.
 &HT;    Another walk would introduce you to Congress Park and its
circa-1900 Florentine marble Tritons in a pool. Vandalized last
year, they are now repaired and furiously blowing water at each
other again.
 &HT;    Or you can drive past the racecourse on Union Avenue and through
the entrance to the wooded Yaddo artists retreat, now celebrating
its centennial, and walk through classical Italian rose and
Anglo-American rock gardens, graced with pools and century-old
statuary. Guided garden tours at 11 a.m. Tuesdays (until Labor
Day), Saturdays and Sundays are $2; (518) 584-0746.
 &HT;    Early birds can catch one of Saratoga's loveliest sights, the
thoroughbreds working out in the morning mist (from 5:30 to 10:30)
at the Oklahoma training track. The public is not allowed through
the gate but you can still get a nice view through the fence along
East Avenue, between Fifth and Union avenues. (The National Museum
of Racing offers tours that take groups inside the gate during
training; $10, which includes museum admission.)
 &HT;    The Adelphi Hotel, 365 Broadway, is a downtown landmark, its
luscious antique lobby a good place to stop for a drink. Cross the
street for a view of the hotel's glorious raised piazza, with
pierced spandrel openings, thin three-story columns, high Victorian
windows, and Renaissance and Italianate motifs. It's from 1877,
when they got the most out of a stoop.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Hotel reservations can be hard to come by through Labor Day,
especially on weekends.
 &HT;    Now into its first full racing season, the 112-room Hilton
Garden Inn, 125 South Broadway, (518) 587-1500, fax (518) 587-7800,
has an indoor pool, exercise room and business center. The price is
middle range, considering that this town's rates assume everybody
has hit an exacta. Rooms are spacious and loaded with amenities,
including high-speed Internet access, microwave, hair dryer,
refrigerator and a safe big enough for a laptop; from $189 through
Labor Day, then $99 to $179.
 &HT;    At the 42-room Downtowner Motel, (888) 480-6160, fax (518)
584-2907, under new management, I was happy to step around four
cast members of ``Grease,'' starring at the Performing Arts Center
but just then doing situps on the floor around the indoor pool.
Rooms have been nicely redone, are cheerful and very up to date;
from $137 through Labor Day, then $75. It's smack in the middle of
everything at 413 Broadway.
 &HT;    Budget: At the southern end of Broadway, but within a healthy
walk of downtown, is the 18-room St. Charles Motel, 188 Broadway,
(518) 584-2050, fax (518) 584-6216, with cozy rooms starting at
$125 through Labor Day, then $55.
 &HT;    The Locust Grove Motel is actually in a locust grove about three
and a half miles south of town, at 2838 Route 9, Malta; (888)
256-2878, fax (518) 580-1817. It has two 16-unit buildings and two
cabin units. Rooms have kitchenettes, at $99 through Labor Day,
then $50.
 &HT;    Luxury: In its second season, the Saratoga Arms, 495-497
Broadway, (518) 584-1775, fax (518) 581-4064, is a magnificently
restored Second Empire brick hotel dating from 1870, the year Henry
James visited Saratoga. He would have loved this 16-room hotel
rescued from demolition by Kathleen and Noel Smith. Rooms have
antique furnishings and high ceilings; several have fireplaces and
clawfoot tubs; all have voice mail, data ports, cable TV and CD
players; a full Irish breakfast is served. Rooms from $275 through
Labor Day, then from $150.
 &HT;    The 168-room Holiday Inn, at 232 Broadway, (518) 584-4550, fax
(518) 584-4417, is the perfect starting gate for walks into
Congress Park or past the period homes on and off Circular Street.
It has a full-scale restaurant and bar and a heated outdoor pool.
Many of the newly appointed rooms have views of the park or town.
Room prices range from $219 through Labor Day, then $150.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Chez Sophie Bistro, 2853 Route 9, Malta, (518) 583-3538, is like
a trip to France, serving memorable fare that belies its setting: a
converted diner in Malta, three and a half miles south of town. It
is run by Sophie Parker, the French-born chef, and her husband,
Joseph, a sculptor, assisted by their son, Paul. A recent meal
included chanterelles in a reduction of chicken stock and sherry; a
salad of baby field greens and organic lettuces, and swordfish
pan-sauteed with a sherry wine vinegar vinaigrette, sweet red
peppers and shallots. The cheese plate included St. Agur, Reblochon
and crottin de Chavignol. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of
wine: $110 to $120.
 &HT;    The hottest place in town is Chianti, 208 South Broadway, (518)
580-0025, with an open kitchen and glowing burnt-sienna decor.
Owned by the irrepressible David Zecchini, from Rome, and his wife,
Maria, it features the bold tastes of their 31-year-old chef,
Fabrizio Bazzani, from Verona. Popular specialties: an appetizer of
carpaccio in truffle oil with a Gorgonzola sauce, porcini risotto
and a white chocolate gelato requiring a week of penance. Dinner
for two with wine: $100.
 &HT;    Out Union Avenue, just before you hit Saratoga Lake, is the
comfortable Longfellows Inn and Restaurant, 500 Union Ave., (518)
587-0108, created from two dairy barns. High on many diners' lists:
the bourbon-glazed salmon and pan-seared tournedos. Dinner for two
with wine comes to about $100.
 &HT;    Joseph DeVivo, talented scion of a well-known Saratoga family,
is the maestro of Maestro's, 371 Broadway, (518) 580-0312, where
you dine to the accompaniment of recorded jazz and blues in the
heart of town. Specialties include osso bucco, crab cakes and
freshly made pastas. Dinner and wine for two: $70.
 &HT;    With its Southern fried chicken, such Louisiana specialties as
Creole jambalaya, and red snapper Provencal, Hattie's, 45 Phila
St., (518) 584-4790, is the real deal for bargain hunters. At this
convivial down-home restaurant, two can dine with a bottle of wine
for $50; there is also a late menu, with many items under $7, from
10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.
 &HT;    At Ashleigh's, 506 Broadway, (518) 580-0329, you can get a fine
breakfast, such as a sausage-potato-cheese omelet, for under $7. Or
a lunch of grilled chicken with bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce on
a roll, under $7. Or, starting this season, a steak, seafood or
pasta dinner for two with wine for less than $40. It's a pleasant,
airy spot, and this being Saratoga, it's in a corner of a
magnificent Romanesque revival building.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARIALISA CALTA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every year, as my husband and I pack the car for our August
vacation, we look around at the impossibly green, impossibly
beautiful Vermont landscape and ask each other if we are crazy.
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave Vermont in the summer, when there are so
many swimming holes to splash in, so many country fairs to visit,
so many trails to hike?
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave during the time of year when our
down-country friends would trade in their theater tickets to stay
even in the sagging old farmhouse we live in, and a chance to watch
the sun set over the mountains and hear the crickets at night?
 &HT;    One of my closest friends comes to Vermont from the Upper West
Side of Manhattan each summer with her husband and two children,
renting a house not far from ours. She delights in going fishing
and canoeing, taking walks and shopping at the local farmers'
market. She and her family love Vermont, and every year Dirk and I
have the opportunity to see our home state anew through their eyes.
 &HT;    I realize once again how lucky we are to live within walking
distance of a pond that features both good swimming and excellent
boating, and a general store where the owners not only know our
names but also extend credit.
 &HT;    In summer, the night sky offers northern lights and shooting
stars, swooping bats and symphony-quality thunderstorms. There are
farms to visit and potters' studios and small gallery shows by
wonderful artists. There are mountains to climb and, in nearly
every village, a Vermont institution: the ``creemee'' stand,
offering soft-serve ice cream in vanilla, chocolate and maple.
 &HT;    So why, come August, do we pack our two children and our dog and
way, way too much stuff into our Subaru wagon and take a grueling,
16-hour drive north? Prince Edward Island, our destination, is,
after all, not that much different from Vermont. Cows graze in
pastures that slope to the water's edge. Towns are small and
manageable, and people are reserved but friendly. ``Vermont with
ocean'' is how we describe Prince Edward to our stay-home friends.
 &HT;    While others may seek cultural stimulation on their vacations,
my husband and I see our few weeks off as an opportunity to get
some much-needed exercise and simplify our lives. We live in a
place that offers plenty of opportunity for both.
 &HT;    But whether or not we've brought it on ourselves, we have
certainly managed to complicate our lives. We spend many more hours
driving our kids to sports and school events than contemplating
nature, and much more time absorbed in our work than working out on
country roads.
 &HT;    Our lives are cluttered with the trappings of contemporary
America _ computers and portable phones, TV and videos, stores
offering way too much stuff and credit cards offering way too much
money to buy it with.
 &HT;    The main reason anyone who lives in a vacation destination
leaves it for another is simple: we live here. We're not on
vacation.
 &HT;    While my New York friends Pam and Carl may spend their Vermont
days splashing with their kids, I spend mine e-mailing, faxing and
phoning _ not to mention laundering, shopping, cooking and
cleaning.
 &HT;    I can't remember the last time I went fishing with my daughters
(who, at 15 and 12, would now regard me as demented if I were to
suggest it), or did much of anything else with them except drop
them at the pond or _ more to their liking _ at the nearest mall.
 &HT;    I know people who take ``at home'' vacations, visiting all the
attractions they never get a chance to see, but I don't think I
could manage it. My home is my workplace, and it's hard to get out
the door to go recreate while the phones are ringing.
 &HT;    So each summer we drive north to impose our fantasies of a
slower paced life on the Prince Edward Islanders. We do almost
nothing for days on end and marvel at how laid-back the islanders
are.
 &HT;    The friends we have made there do seem to have more time for
music and visiting, but that's probably because we are the ones who
are dropping by, urging them to pick up their fiddles.
 &HT;    Surely they have just as much laundry to do, and I often hear
their children clamoring to go to ``town'' (as the capital city,
Charlottetown, is called) and shop the malls. I've noticed a
proliferation of cell phones since we first started going there
about 10 summers ago.
 &HT;    Last August the carpenter who built the cabin we own gave us his
pager number. The rest of the year we communicate with him by fax
and e-mail.
 &HT;    For two or three weeks, we fancy ourselves part of something a
little purer, somewhat less materialistic and more genteel than
what we experience at home _ just as, I think, Pam feels when she
leaves the hubbub of her neighborhood.
 &HT;    And it works. Our life on vacation is less crazy and
materialistic, and more genteel. I go biking and berry-picking with
my daughters, and the four of us sleep outside some nights and
watch northern lights and meteor showers even more spectacular than
we see at home in darkness that, since we are miles from an
electric light, seems more absolute than in Vermont.
 &HT;    The weekly trip to the Laundromat seems like a pleasant outing
compared with the daily load or two I do routinely at home. Even a
trip to the carwash is a maritime adventure: The one in Souris _
the town closest to our cabin _ offers a ridiculously spectacular
ocean view. I can count fishing boats and sea gulls while vacuuming
the red island clay from the floor mats.
 &HT;    Food shopping is a treat: we delight in seeking out fishermen
and local gardeners to sell us some of what we will eat each
evening. And cooking on the tiny propane stove or over a campfire
at our cabin is much more fun than it is at home, where the
microwave and the food processor make the chore more mechanical. We
play hearts by candlelight and read big fat books that we have no
time for back in Vermont.
 &HT;    Most important for me is the fact that I get to spend several
weeks without hearing a phone ring or a fax beep, or checking any
sort of mail whatsoever.
 &HT;    We leave our home, in fact, for the same reason people in New
York or Paris or any other world-class vacation destination leave
theirs: for a change of scenery and a change of pace.
 &HT;    Travelers often indulge in the fantasy that the people in the
places they visit lead lives that are more civilized, or more down
to earth, or more ``spiritual'' than their own workaday existences.
In truth it is the travelers themselves _ separated from familiar
rooms and belongings _ who are forced to focus more on who they are
and what is important to them.
 &HT;    We return, of course, to stacks of mail and desks full of the
work that piled up while we were away. But if time and distance
have worked their magic, we return also with a renewed appreciation
for where we live, and a sense of pride that people ``from away''
will travel long distances to gaze at the views we take for
granted.
 &HT;    Recently, some of our friends from Prince Edward Island, who
usually stick very close to home, sent us an e-mail message that
said they were contemplating a vacation this year. They are
thinking of coming to Vermont. We can't wait to show them how
laid-back we are.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to London. We want to be treated
like royalty, but we don't have a king's ransom to spend. Are we
dreaming or does a hotel exist that can wow us?
 &HT;     Q:  The Rubens at The Palace will treat you and your wife like
a king and queen without breaking your wallet. This hotel is
perfectly located opposite Buckingham Palace in the heart of London
and is within easy reach of St. James' Park, historic sites, the
financial district and West End theaters
 &HT;    The Rubens provides guests with outstanding personal service,
thanks to the congenial general manager, Jonathan Raggett. Every
modern business and leisure convenience has been provided here, yet
the owner, the innovative Bea Tollman, has furnished The Rubens in
a luxurious residential fashion with rich fabrics and antiques. I
know of no other hotel that so thoughtfully fills their room desks
with essential office supplies.
 &HT;    The Rubens' assets include the popular Cavalry Bar done in a
classic British military theme; The Palace Lounge for tea and a
quiet read overlooking the historic Royal Mews; The Library
Restaurant for the finest British and international cuisine; and
The Carvery for traditional roasts and more.
 &HT;    Be it a business or vacation stay, The Rubens, a member of the
Red Carnation Hotel Collection, is truly a memorable experience run
by snappy, kind people who pride themselves on the fact that no
detail is overlooked and no request is too large. Rates start at
$250 a night, double occupancy. For more information, call (800)
858-8471, or visit www.redcarnationhotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q: . My girlfriend and I are planning a vacation to Mexico and
are searching for several intimate, high-quality hotels. We want to
stay away from chain hotels. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Mexico Boutique Hotels is a collection of member properties
that are characterized by uniqueness and their high level of
service.
 &HT;    The hotels in the Mexico Boutique Hotel group have less than 50
rooms. Style of accommodation varies and often includes villas,
casitas and bungalows. Some play on a sense of grandeur, while
others return to the basics of palm-thatched cottages.
 &HT;    To see the complete selection of Mexico Boutiques Hotels, visit
www.mexicoboutiquehotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I really enjoy being in the great outdoors,
and for his birthday I would love to give him something we could
both use when we go hiking or biking.
 &HT;     A:  For the latest outdoor gadgets and toys, turn to Motorola.
They have just released their latest line of two-way radios, the
Talkabout T6300 series.
 &HT;    These new two-way radios feature just about everything an
adventure enthusiast could want _ current weather reports; audible
storm-warning alerts; a built-in clock, alarm and stopwatch; a
noise filter to protect against unwanted noise in the surrounding
environment; and the radios are dust and shock resistant. They
provide 532 signals so you can be sure to find an unused channel.
 &HT;    With a range of up to two miles (depending upon terrain), these
gadgets are great for rural and urban settings alike. For the
city-dweller, these gadgets are useful at concerts and the mall and
are an excellent way for parents to stay in contact with their
families. With a retail price between $129 to $179 per radio, the
T6300 series is quite affordable.
 &HT;    Motorola also offers a wide range of extras such as
voice-activated headsets and a wall-mountable battery-charging
station, which allows the radios to be used as an intercom system.
 &HT;    Overall, the Motorola Talkabouts are at the top of today's
market in terms of quality, versatility and functionality. The
T6300 series will become available nationwide in September.
 &HT;     Q:  My family has strong Italian roots, but I've never
experienced any of the legendary neighborhoods in American cities
that I've often heard about. Trips to New York and San Francisco
felt too touristy. Are there any legitimate Italian neighborhoods
left to explore?
 &HT;     A:  A lively one can be found in Boston's North End. Visit on a
late Saturday afternoon in summer, when the air is warm and
fragrant with the lingering aromas of lunch, and the whole
neighborhood seems to pause before the rigors of the evening meal.
 &HT;    Wander around and explore the side streets. You might find a
sweet old lady with a lemonade stand, or a strolling parish priest
saying buona sera to the locals.
 &HT;    To purchase olive oils and foodstuffs, visit Salumeria Italiano
at 151 Richmond St., a few blocks from the Old North Church and
Paul Revere's home.
 &HT;    For a truly authentic touch, head to Salem Street and Polcari's
Coffee, a spice store that's really a catch-all grocery for the
locals. Engineers who miss their old neighborhood work weekends as
clerks. Enjoy the banter as folks drop in to buy chestnut flour or
flavorings for homemade liqueurs. Tape a dollar to the collection
poster for the saint whose festival is coming up. If you're lucky,
there will be a miniparade to collect all the offerings.
 &HT;    With its narrow streets, the North End is best reached by cab or
subway _ anything to avoid parking and the epic nuisance of the Big
Dig, Boston's traffic nightmare. Visitor information is available
at www.northendboston.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I will be traveling to Southern France and would like to
see some ancient sites. Do you have any suggestions that will put
me in the heart of ancient France?
 &HT;     A:  The recently renovated Hotel de la Cite near Carcassonne is
now giving historical, cultural and lifestyle tours of their area
in the legendary Southwest region of Languedoc-Roussillon.
 &HT;    Carcassonne is Europe's largest and most perfectly preserved
medieval city. Among the highlights of the escorted tours are Roman
ruins, a 13th-century dungeon, a 14th-century palace, an
11th-century abbey and famous castles. Cities visited include
Arques, Castelnou, Limoux, Narbonnes and Toulouse.
 &HT;    The fully escorted half-day tours range in price from $14 to $70
per person, and full-day tours are approximately $88 to $103 per
person, including all transportation and entrance fees.
 &HT;    Renovated in 1999, the Hotel de la Cite was formerly an
Episcopal palace and today is a member of Orient-Express hotels. It
combines magnificent neo-gothic stained-glass windows and mosaic
floors with five-star amenities.
 &HT;    The hotel features fine gourmet cuisine plus less-formal dining
options to accommodate a wide variety of tastes. For more
information or reservations, call (800) 223-6800, or visit
www.hoteldelacite.com on the Web.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 PLEASE NOTE: Optional-trim indicators are included in this
article. 
 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises offer some of the best values in the
travel business. And the fall cruise season _ a time when cruise
lines begin moving their ships to new locations _ is a good
opportunity to try one.
 &HT;    The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) cites these
advantages for repositioning cruises:
 &HT;     _ ONE-OF-A-KIND ITINERARIES.  Because ships are moving from one
part of the world to another, the combination of ports visited is
unique. Often these itineraries include ocean or Panama Canal
crossings as well as ports not usually visited on other sailings.
 &HT;     _ VALUE.  Two-for-one fares, air-inclusive offers and a variety
of off-season promotional rates make cruise prices very attractive.
 &HT;     _ SPECIAL ENTERTAINMENT.  Cruise lines may enhance their
repositioning cruises with entertainment that isn't always offered
on other cruises.
 &HT;     _ EXTRA DAYS.  Longer itineraries allow more time at sea.
 &HT;    However, you should be aware that cruise lines may use
repositioning voyages to train new staff or to try new shore trips,
giving an experimental flavor to the cruise.
 &HT;    Contact your travel agent about these repositioning cruises or
others that will be offered this fall:
 &HT;    _ America Cruise Lines, which sails the waterways of the U.S.
East Coast year-round, will be in Baltimore on Nov. 4 before
heading to Jacksonville, Fla., for the winter months.
 &HT;    _ Costa Cruises Lines leaves Europe from Genoa to head for the
Caribbean Nov. 3 and 17. Ports of call: the Bahamas, British Virgin
Islands, Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Leeward Island, Madeira,
Morocco and Spain.
 &HT;    _ Holland America Line moves five vessels from Alaska to the
Caribbean on trips ranging from 17 to 22 days. Departures are in
September and October with 17- or 22-day cruises that pass through
the Panama Canal.
 &HT;    _ Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Wind leaves Vancouver Sept.
18 to sail a special 11-day Hawaiian Island itinerary before moving
on to the Caribbean.
 &HT;    _ After its inaugural season in Bermuda, the Pacific Princess
leaves New York on Oct. 29 to move to the Holy Land. There will be
16 days at sea with port calls in Ponta Delgada and Lisbon,
Portugal; Gibraltar; Barcelona; Cannes; Laverno; and Rome.
 &HT;    _ Royal Olympic moves its Stella Solaris from the Mediterranean
to the Caribbean with a Dec. 1 sailing from Piraeus, Greece. Ports
include Naples, Capri and Civitavecchia in Italy; Nice, France;
Cartagena, Spain; Tangier, Morocco; Lisbon and Madeira, Portugal;
San Juan; and Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    _ Seabourn Cruise Line has a Three Continent Discovery on its
Legend beginning Oct. 20 in Lisbon. Available in segments of six,
13 or 19 days, the itinerary has stops in Funchal, Madeira; Dakar,
Senegal; Bridgetown, Barbados; Virgin Gorda, BVI; San Juan; and
Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    
 BETTER BREATHING CARIBBEAN CRUISE  
 &HT;    The Better Breathing Club of Norwalk Hospital, in Norwalk,
Conn., is offering a cruise through the Eastern Caribbean for
travelers with chronic pulmonary diseases. Arrangements will be
made for those needing supplemental oxygen in flight and during the
cruise.
 &HT;    The cruise is aboard Celebrity's The Century, which leaves from
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Nov. 4 for a week's cruise with stops in San
Juan, St. Maarten, St. Thomas and Nassau.
 &HT;    Traveling with the group will be a pulmonary physician, nurses
and respiratory therapists. Prices start at $1,018, including port
charges. Air, insurance, oxygen and special equipment is extra. For
more information, call (800) 536-9383.
 &HT;    
 $1,000 SAVINGS  
 &HT;    First European Cruises is offering a $1,000 savings per person
on September and October sailings aboard the Mistral in the Eastern
Mediterranean. It sails round trip from Venice on seven-day cruises
to Dubrovnik, Katakolon, Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes and Piraeus
(Athens). Discounted departure dates are Sept. 2, 9, 16, 23 and
Oct. 7, 14, 21 and 28.
 &HT;    The cruise-only promotional rates start at $1,250/double for an
outside cabin. Round-trip airfare add-ons from Venice are available
from 50 gateways and for $950 from the East Coast, $1,200 West
Coast. For more information, call (888) 983-8767, or visit
www.first-european.com.
 &HT;    
 NEW HAWAIIAN SHIP  
 &HT;    Starting Dec. 9, the United States Lines' first ship, the ms
Patriot (formerly Holland America Line's Nieuw Amsterdam), will
begin cruise vacations to four Hawaiian islands on a seven-night
itinerary. The ms Patriot leaves each Saturday. Fares start at
$1,599/double in value season; airfares cost $399 from most Western
gateways; $699 from the East Coast. For more information, call

 &HT;    
 RAIL/CRUISE COMBO  
 &HT;    America West Steamboat Co. is adding 10-night departures to its
seven-night programs that blend rail travel on the Amtrak Coast
Starlight with overnight cruises on the Queen of the West on the
Columbia, Snake and Willamette rivers. The Queen of the West is an
overnight paddlewheel cruise ship that travels the Pacific
Northwest.
 &HT;    All departures include two nights on Amtrak between California
and Portland, Ore., with travelers boarding the Coast Starlight at
any of its regular stops between San Diego and Sacramento.
Departures on the 10-night programs start Nov. 9, while seven-night
itineraries start Dec. 28.
 &HT;    Prices vary, but the seven-night program that leaves from
Sacramento starts at $1,409/double; while the 10-night prices start
at $1,878. For more information, call (800) 434-1232, or visit
www.columbiarivercruise.com on the Web.

<P>
   Who hasn't heard the mantra: change or perish? It's a corporate
cliche by now. And like many cliches, it happens to be true. But
so, too, is its unhappy corollary: many companies change and
perish. Change is so disruptive it can tear organizations apart.
</P>
<P>
   To change successfully, companies should stop changing all the
time. Instead, they should intersperse major initiatives among
carefully paced periods of smaller, organic change. By doing so,
overall change can be managed with an approach called dynamic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving dynamic stability is more difficult than ramming big,
hairy, audacious changes through an organization, in much the same
way that it is more difficult to end a war with negotiations than
with an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But dynamic stability has the great advantage of leaving
survivors. It allows change without fatal pain.
</P>
<P>
   Change, as it is usually orchestrated, creates initiative
overload and organizational chaos, both of which provoke strong
resistance from the people most affected.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic change programs _ programs that have been all the rage
since the 1970s _ typically involve drastic measures as CEOs seek
to maximize growth or economic value as quickly as possible. In
dynamic stability, though, the goal is change that can be sustained
over both the short and long term.
</P>
<P>
   In its drive to become a global competitor, Finley, Kumble,
Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &AMP; Casey, a law firm based
in New York City, speedily added partners and associates throughout
the 1980s. But the firm's pace wasn't sustainable. Finley Kumble
collapsed in 1988 amid huge debts, vicious infighting and many
legal improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, by contrast, wanted rapid change, but it also
knew when to slow down. Throughout the 1980s GE engaged in creative
_ most people would say brutal _ destruction involving massive
layoffs, restructuring and divestitures. But GE's changes in the
1990s were far less disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   GE's acquisitions in the last decade _ companies such as
Employers Reinsurance and Kidder, Peabody _ have tended to be in
areas like financial services where GE had already carved out
niches. They were thus less disruptive to the organization. By
alternating radical change with more organic modifications, Jack
Welch carefully buttressed the organization's stability, thereby
making major changes more feasible. That's dynamic stability.
</P>
<P>
   At its essence, dynamic stability is a process of continual but
relatively small change efforts that involve existing practices and
business models rather than new ones. Besides ``tinkering'' and
``kludging,'' which differ from each other mainly in scale, dynamic
stability requires that the pace of big and small changes must be
implemented at the right intervals.
</P>
<P>
   We all know a Mr. Fixit, someone who is always making things
from odd nuts and bolts. Similarly, some of the greatest change
masters _ companies such as 3M and Hewlett-Packard _ are
world-class tinkerers. They go into the corporate basement, so to
speak, where they rapidly pull together inspired solutions to
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical, for example, developed Saran Wrap for an
industrial-coating application. With a little tinkering _ and a lot
of expertise in marketing and branded consumer products _ Dow
successfully aimed the product at consumers, an entirely different
market.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering, of course, does not guarantee successful change. But
it is less costly, less destabilizing, and quicker than creative
destruction and invention.
</P>
<P>
   Kludging is tinkering, but with a college education. It takes
place on a larger scale and involves many more parts. Some parts
can come from outside a company's existing portfolio as in mergers
and acquisitions, but usually the components of a kludge are assets
lying around an organization's backyard, such as particular skill
functions or standard technologies or models.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so large, kludges can result in the creation of
a division or an entire business. Consider the case of GKN, a
British industrial conglomerate. Starting in the early 1980s, the
organization would often land contracts and then find engineers to
staff the projects. But sometimes contracts would get postponed or
canceled, leaving engineers idle.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with this recurrent situation, GKN's units began to rent
out their idle engineers for short assignments elsewhere, pulling
them back into the organization as needed. The units started the
practice on an informal basis, but it proved so successful that GKN
created a new company, CEDU, to manage hiring out its own engineers
_ and those of other companies _ on short-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the status quo has been almost painless. The
business model had been known in the organization for years. To
make more money from it, all GKN had to do was formalize the
practice in a new company.
</P>
<P>
   Most proponents of change management argue that you have to
change as much as you can as quickly as you can to stay ahead of
the competition. That advice is not so much wrong as
overgeneralized.
</P>
<P>
   Like individuals, organizations have different needs for change.
Those that have consistently avoided change may need to undergo
rapid, destructive change. Companies that already have been
changing rapidly face a different challenge _ they must learn to
shift down from highly destabilizing, disruptive change to
tinkering and kludging.
</P>
<P>
   One business leader who understands the value of pacing is Lou
Gerstner. At IBM and, before that, at American Express Travel
Related Services and RJR Nabisco, his initial impact was pure
creative destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In his first nine months at Travel Related Services, for
example, Gerstner began a major reorganization of the card and
traveler's check businesses, accompanied by a widespread shift of
managers across those units. A rash of new product introductions
followed quickly. The nine-month transformation was, in Gerstner's
words, like ``breaking the four-minute mile.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gerstner had a genius for knowing when it was time to rest.
He was alert to early signs of change fatigue: cynicism and
burnout. He recognized that the success of his overall change
campaign depended on the stability of the units involved, and he
was very thoughtful about how and when to intersperse the small
changes among the big.
</P>
<P>
   At Travel Related Services, no new products were launched and no
new executives were brought in from outside for 18 months after
Gerstner's initial blitz. But he tinkered constantly to prevent the
company from drifting into inertia; he played with the structure,
with the compensation system, with product offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The unthreatening nature of the interim changes allowed the
company to better absorb a second wave of product introductions and
restructurings when it arrived.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL SIDEBAR)
</P>
<P>
   FOUR OPERATING GUIDELINES
</P>
<P>
   Like many managerial practices, dynamic stability is as much art
as science. But companies that successfully tinker and kludge use
these four operating guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   REWARD SHAMELESS BORROWING: The first rule of dynamic stability
is that companies must be willing to noodle with what already
exists _ and invent from scratch only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   APPOINT A CHIEF MEMORY OFFICER: Only by remembering the past as
we tinker and kludge can we avoid making the same old mistakes _
and take advantage of valuable opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   TINKER AND KLUDGE INTERNALLY FIRST: Dynamic stability is much
easier to manage if you stay inside the organization. Just as the
body is more likely to reject a foreign organ than its own, an
organization has greater difficulty reconfiguring imported parts.
</P>
<P>
   HIRE GENERALISTS: A company dedicated to dynamic stability needs
generalists. Generalists are often derided as jacks-of-all-trades
and masters of none. But their range of skills lets them combine
disparate ideas, techniques, processes and cultures. In other
words, they can tinker and kludge. What's more, generalists are
typically more open-minded and less biased than specialists are.

 By WILFRIED R. VANHONACKER  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The vast Chinese market has always attracted foreign companies,
but very few have been able to capitalize on the opportunities the
country affords. That failure can be attributed in large part to
the traditional investment vehicles available to foreign companies,
all of which create complexities and conflicts that hamstring
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one company, Eastman Kodak, is pioneering a new corporate
structure in China _ one that looks very similar to Western
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the uniqueness of Kodak's approach, consider how
most foreign companies operate in China. The most common corporate
structure is the joint venture, in which companies share day-to-day
operational control with a local partner. But doing so can paralyze
decision making, a fatal flaw in today's rapidly changing markets.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, for example, has seen its share of the market for
optical-fiber transmission equipment in China slide from 70 percent
to 30 percent because it must negotiate each technological change
in a product with a local partner.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of local partners also exacerbates the effect of
China's narrow business licenses. Because Chinese regulations
restrict companies' geographic reach as well as the range of goods
they can manufacture and distribute, realizing economies of scale
and scope is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, for example, recently had six joint ventures in
Shanghai making soap, ice cream, skin cream and laundry detergent.
Theoretically, a foreign company could consolidate the distribution
of its various joint-venture products, but it would have to get
consent from all its Chinese partners. That seldom happens, because
the partners fear that the products from their individual joint
ventures would end up at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such complicated management issues, some companies have
established wholly owned foreign enterprises, so-called WOFEs, but
they, too, have limitations, among them difficulty winning
contracts and forging local alliances. China's local governments
have routinely favored state-owned enterprises over foreign
ventures, especially since 1999, when the industrial ministries in
Beijing were abolished.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better way for companies to compete in China. Since
1994, businesses have been able to register as joint-stock
companies _ a familiar corporate structure in the West. All of
China's state-owned enterprises listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges have adopted this structure. But so far, only one
foreign multinational has taken this route: Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's joint-stock companies, which I call foreign investor
shareholding corporations, or FISCs, have allowed the company to
achieve a high degree of operational control. The FISCs eliminate
the trade-off between management control and market access by
granting local partners minority stakes in return for their
business assets, such as factories and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Because local partners lose direct ownership of those assets,
they can be excluded from the day-to-day management. But as part
owners, they remain interested in helping the FISCs perform, which
motivates them to help the venture secure access to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   The FISC structure also mitigates the economic impact of narrow
business licenses. For example, Kodak doesn't have to get its local
partners' consent to consolidate distribution of products from its
different operations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kodak has created two FISCs: Kodak (China), in which it
holds an 80 percent share, and Kodak (Wuxi), in which it holds a 70
percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak (China) purchased the assets of two domestic photofilm
manufacturers, Xiamen Fuda and Shantou Era, in return for 10
percent stakes and the right to appoint one board member each;
Kodak named the remaining eight directors. Because there must be at
least five shareholders, the Guangdong and Fujian international
trust and investment corporations also took nominal stakes in Kodak
(China). For its part, Kodak put up $380 million in cash. Kodak
(Wuxi) worked out a similar arrangement with different
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear why the shareholding structure works for Kodak. But
it's important to realize that it works for China as well. It gives
Chinese authorities a face-saving way to allow industrial reform
through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the photo industry had been almost entirely closed
off to foreign corporations because the government wanted to
develop a domestic photofilm industry. Foreign companies such as
Kodak were restricted to licensing agreements or direct imports,
which attracted heavy duties. But domestic manufacturers could not
keep up with the industry's rapid technological innovations, and
all but one were technically bankrupt by the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's proposal to create FISCs was therefore considered a good
solution by Beijing authorities. No less than five central
government organizations, including three ministries, cooperated
with Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   China's State Development Planning Commission, which had been
involved in creating Kodak's FISCs, last year released a research
report supporting the ``Kodak model.'' And, in theory, the
regulatory framework already lets foreign corporations convert
existing joint ventures and WOFEs into FISCs, provided they have
been profitable for three years.
</P>
<P>
   If foreign corporations move in this direction on their own, it
will save Chinese authorities from having to embark on a wholesale
restructuring of the legal infrastructure of business.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the FISCs are well placed to obtain quick listings
on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges, making it easier for
them to raise new capital. For all these reasons, many companies
will probably follow Kodak's lead.
</P>

camp, which is probably one too many. Starting quarterback Jeff
Garcia hasn't shown much yet. Giovanni Carmazzi, the team's
third-round draft pick, has been slow to adjust to the 49ers
system. And the two that have played the best _ eighth year

 By MERLE GINSBERG 
 (One color slide is available) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When director Harold Ramis was looking for someone to play
opposite Brendan Fraser in his new farce, ``Bedazzled,'' the
casting director said she was sending a very talented Australian
actress to meet him.
 &HT;    ``She told me this actress was youthful but still had a kind of
maturity,'' Ramis remembers. ``That she was really skillful as an
actress, tons of technique. Anyway, I was auditioning this lovely
actress, thinking, `Too bad this isn't her,' until I realized _ it
was. I said, `Where's the accent?' And she said, `Oh, I'm speaking
American for the role.'''
 &HT;    That actress was Frances O'Connor, and yes, she got the part.
 &HT;    ``I knew everything about Harold Ramis, and he knew nothing
about me,'' O'Connor says gleefully. ``It's quite fun in L.A.,
because no one knows who I am.''
 &HT;    Needless to say, that's about to change _ fast. The 30-year-old
Australian _ following in the footsteps of compatriots Nicole
Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Russell Crowe _ has come seemingly from
nowhere to snag the lead not just in ``Bedazzled'' but also in
Steven Spielberg's upcoming science-fiction epic ``A.I.,'' opposite
Jude Law. She also stars in ``About Adam,'' a small Miramax comedy.
 &HT;    Before this latest blitz, O'Connor had made several
well-received but small films, including ``Kiss or Kill'' and last
year's adaptation of Jane Austen's ``Mansfield Park.'' For the
latter, she had gone in to audition for a small part and came out
with the lead.
 &HT;    After that film, O'Connor landed the title role in the BBC's
``Madame Bovary,'' which aired on PBS last winter. Now Hollywood
types are comparing her to Blanchett, Kidman and Kate Winslet.
 &HT;    But sitting in one of Beverly Hills' hottest lunch spots, Il
Fornaio, O'Connor _ with no makeup and the most casual of pants and
T-shirt _ scoffs at her new hype.
 &HT;    ``Oh, that's just a thing people do,'' she says dismissively.
``That's just noise. At least they're flattering comparisons.''
 &HT;    In ``Bedazzled,'' a remake of the Dudley Moore/Peter Cook '60s
classic, Fraser is a Northern California computer nerd who can't
get anywhere with the popular girl at work, Allison (O'Connor). But
when he's visited by the Devil _ played tongue-in-cheek by
Elizabeth Hurley _ he sells his soul for eight opportunities to
show Allison what a great man he could be.
 &HT;    Together, he and O'Connor play out the imaginary scenarios: He's
a Colombian drug lord and she's his mistress; he's a rock star and
she's a groupie; he's a Pulitizer prize-winning author and she's a
'50s intellectual, etc.
 &HT;    Fraser says O'Connor's transitions from character to character
were seamless.
 &HT;    ``That's how scary good she is with dialects,'' he says, ``not
to mention her chameleon-like talent for playing characters wildly
different from each other.''
 &HT;    For O'Connor, going from period to contemporary _ in this case,
all in one movie _ is just part of the gig.
 &HT;    ``Any actor should be able to do all of those things,'' she
says.
 &HT;    But playing the object of Brendan Fraser's overwhelming longing?
That was the hard part.
 &HT;    ``It's hilarious to play `the beautiful girl,''' she says,
``totally not who I am at all.''
 &HT;    No matter what she thinks, Spielberg was determined to cast her
in ``A.I.'' _ which he co-wrote with Stanley Kubrick _ just after
her CAA agent, Kevin Huvane, slipped him a tape of ``Madame
Bovary.''
 &HT;    ``I think if Steven gets an instinct about someone, he trusts
it,'' says O'Connor, who's steeling herself for the attention that
will inevitably accompany the role. ``My agents keep saying I don't
realize how big this is. And I keep saying, `I think I do.'''

 By THE EDITORS OF WWD, DNR AND W MAGAZINE 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From WWD, DNR and W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 THE POM-POM CLUB  
 &HT;    ``I wasn't born to be a cheerleader, and I'm not a giant fan of
the color pink,'' Natasha Lyonne said on July 23 at the Los Angeles
premiere of ``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
 &HT;    Clea DuVall, Lyonne's co-star and friend, laughed as she
recalled the shoot.
 &HT;    ``I just remember watching Natasha sitting there, getting her
hair done, smoking and saying, `I don't want to do this anymore.'''
 &HT;    Those who weren't in the film had a rosier view of the baton
arts.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to be a cheerleader, actually,'' said Jennifer Jason
Leigh, who popped into the prescreen cocktails with Alan Cumming.
``As long as I could be in the center.''
 &HT;    ``I saw a documentary on cheerleading once,'' Cumming said. ``I
love to see people trying really hard at something that's so
meaningless.''
 &HT;    A few nights later, the troops came out to toast Harrison Ford's
latest bone-chiller, ``What Lies Beneath.''
 &HT;    ``Even I got scared,'' said his co-star, Michelle Pfeiffer.
``There were parts I forgot about that made me jump.''
 &HT;    Amber Valletta, who makes her screen debut as the ghost that
haunts a married couple played by Ford and Pfeiffer, said the movie
posed a challenge altogether different from shooting a Versace
campaign.
 &HT;    ``For one thing, I was made to look scary instead of pretty,''
she said. ``I've made four movies this year, though I'm now
preparing for the biggest role of my life,'' she said, rubbing her
pregnant belly.
 &HT;    
 KOBE PUTS ON A REALLY BIG SHOE  
 &HT;    Although he's just 21, L.A. Lakers star guard Kobe Bryant
already has an NBA championship ring; a 50 percent stake in famed
Italian basketball team Olympia Milano; an equity stake in
Broadband Sports/Athlete Direct, a company that manages fan Web
sites for professional athletes; an album titled ``Visions''
that'll debut later this year; and more endorsements and corporate
sponsors than one can imagine.
 &HT;    Who could ask for anything more?
 &HT;    Bryant can _ and he's getting it: a basketball shoe named after
him, made by Adidas, his apparel endorser, and car manufacturer
Audi.
 &HT;    ``It's always been a dream of mine to have my own shoe,'' Bryant
said recently at the Hilton in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., during the
ABCD Camp, a basketball training camp where top college recruiters
go. ``All the basketball stars I grew up with, like Magic Johnson
and Michael Jordan, had them. But I wanted a sneaker that was
different, a concept in and of itself that hasn't been done
before.''
 &HT;    The Kobe will debut Nov. 3 at sporting-goods stores and
specialty stores and will retail for $125. Tuxedo (black) will be
the first color wave to launch, followed by white, silver and
yellow in each of the next three months.
 &HT;    Bryant, who wears a size 14, wanted a sneaker that would best
represent his personality: ``simple _ something that's not going to
steal the show.'' Adidas didn't have to look any further for
inspiration than Bryant's own backyard, Southern California.
 &HT;    In determining what defines that part of the country, the
athletic maker came up with its car culture. Specifically, the Audi
TT Roadster, designed in part and influenced by Southern
California, which became the model for the sneaker.
 &HT;    At a glance, the TT Roadster has three main features: a
continuous line, a clean surface body side and a bullet-nosed
front. These elements are reflected in The Kobe, as well as in
Adidas' longstanding grooved shell-toe.
 &HT;    The main shoulder line continues around the arches and through
the bottom of the shoe, just as the Audi TT's continuous loop runs
from the side of the vehicle around the wheel arches and under the
car.
 &HT;    ``I don't think people realize how complex the logistics are in
designing a car,'' said Derek Jenkins, assistant chief of the Audi
design studio in California. ``There are so many parameters to
follow: whether it's crash safety, manufacturing techniques, cost
or aerodynamics, as well as the need to stay true to your company's
identity and history. But with a shoe, at the end of the day it's
really about a style first, then function.''
 &HT;    
 YAHOO BALLYHOO  
 &HT;    David Bowie, Lauren Hutton, Betsey Johnson and a few other
survivors of the '70s were there _ but it was a long way from the
heyday of Studio 54.
 &HT;    The legendary disco-turned-theater was the site of the 3rd
Annual Yahoo! Internet Life Online Music Awards on July 24. No
go-go boys, no cocaine on the dance floor (actually, no dance
floor) and an audience who had be to told that Steve meant Rubell.
 &HT;    Although 21st-century music and technology were the order of the
day, major awards went to two 1980s favorites, Prince (Best
Internet Only Single) and Aimee Mann (Best Internet Only Album),
and grand old man Sir Paul McCartney (Best Live Event Online).
 &HT;    Leading the award pack was Bowie, who won the Online Pioneer of
the Year Award and Best Official Artist Site. The 50-plus-year-old
rocker also led the sartorial pack, accepting his first award in a
stunning black suit and white shirt, then changing to an equally
attractive gray suit for his magnificent performance and acceptance
of the Pioneer Award.
 &HT;    Also dressing up were host John Leguizamo, ``Late Show With
David Letterman'' bandleader Paul Shaffer and MTV's Kurt Loder.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, presenter/performer Isaac Hayes _ whom Leguizamo
dubbed rightly ``the coolest man in the world'' _ took the middle
ground with a black sport jacket over a T-shirt with his own
likeness.
 &HT;    On the more casual front, Phat Farm's Russell Simmons and singer
Duncan Sheik went for the shirt-only look, and presenters Chuck D
and film director Doug Liman (Swingers) decided a T-shirt was just
fine to face the public.
 &HT;    
 EMMYS GET ONLINE  
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ A 360-degree red-carpet camera view, live ratings
of arrivals' looks and a Nokia-sponsored contest with a $100,000
cash prize are set for the Primetime Emmy Awards Webcasts planned
by ABC.com and iCast.com, a fledgling entertainment Web site allied
with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
 &HT;    ABC.com, the official Webcaster of the 52nd Annual Primetime
Emmy Awards, is aiming for a humorous, gritty behind-the-scenes
look at the Emmys with features such as ``Diary of a Nominee.''
 &HT;    The diary will follow an Emmy nominee through the preparations
leading up to the Sept. 10 show, from dress fittings to beauty
appointments. As of press time, the featured nominee had not been
named. Nor has the comedic talent who will host the live
commentary.
 &HT;    ``It'll be someone young, a fresh face,'' said Brian Bowman,
ABC.com's vice president and general manager.
 &HT;    ABC.com is also planning preshow fashion coverage, including
pictorial fashion do's and don'ts, the buzz on show-night baubles,
interviews and tours of top designers' showrooms. Site visitors
will also have an opportunity to vote on which gown a nominee
should wear to the Emmys.
 &HT;    During the show, a roving Webcam will go backstage to interview
caterers, security guards and assorted extras, said Bowman. Webcams
will also be posted at the red carpet, as well as where the winners
are being interviewed.
 &HT;    Web viewers can vote for Emmy winners and, if they hit six
winners in six categories, will become eligible for Nokia's
$100,000 cash grand prize.
 &HT;    Like ABC.com, iCast.com, the official content provider for the
the ATAS, was also hurrying to hammer out the details of its
Webcast at press time. Preliminary plans, according to iCast.com's
marketing director Terri Henry, will include a 360-degree Webcam
view on the red carpet and live interactive rating by viewers of
what attendees are wearing.
 &HT;    ``Instead of only Joan Rivers-type commentary, we can see what
Main Street America thinks of the looks,'' Henry said. She added
that the site is in talks with fashion journalists to provide
preshow fashion and beauty coverage.
 &HT;    Emmys.org, the official site of ATAS, will link to both
Webcasts, as well as post a list of winners.

 By KARYN MONGET 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ At first glance, the female figures on the computer
screen look like cyber Stepford Wives.
 &HT;    In virtual reality _ through a cutting-edge 3D application
called C-Me _ the figures can be shaped, coiffed and styled into
whatever look a consumer wants, whether it's a flawless,
image-perfect figure, or a realistic simulation of a consumer's
actual measurements, including height, bra cup and the size of a
woman's hips and waistline.
 &HT;    The applications can also zero in on skin tone, hair color and
eye color, in addition to customizing facial features such as the
nose and the shape of the eyes.
 &HT;    The male representations have the clone-like quality of a Ken
doll.
 &HT;    The concept, though, isn't a game. Yanir Farber, president of
Tel Aviv-based Browzwear, and his brother Avihay Feld, were here
this spring on a mission to sell their e-commerce concept to a
number of U.S. retailers. They said they expected to launch it
first in Europe _ primarily Germany, Belgium and England _ this
fall.
 &HT;    Browzwear, which was founded in Israel in January by Farber and
Feld, is being financed by Delta Galil Industries, a diversified
apparel manufacturer that specializes in seamless products, and Dr.
Yossi Vardi, an Israeli high-tech guru.
 &HT;    The company has its sights set on becoming a leading provider of
real-time personalized services to online retailers, including
major click-and-mortar department stores and specialty chains, as
well as catalogers and independent e-tail sites.
 &HT;    The company's signature product, C-Me, will provide consumers
with a virtual fitting room based on a personal 3D figure called
Avatar, which is a 3D model representation of the user's image.
 &HT;    Online shoppers can visit an apparel e-tailer's site to dress
their virtual 3D image with items that have been merchandised by
Browzwear. When someone decides to purchase an item, Browzwear will
link the shopper to the e-tailer's site, where the transaction can
be completed.
 &HT;    The consumer can make her decision by rotating an Avatar figure
dressed in that clothing, on a 3D form, to get a full-rounded view,
and can zoom in to inspect a fabric's texture. A consumer will also
be able to determine the drapability of a fabric on petite, average
and plus-size figures.
 &HT;    ``The service will be free to consumers,'' said Farber, noting
the company has invested close to $1 million in the technology.
``Retailers in the U.S. have been very interested. Some are even
interested in investing in the company.''
 &HT;    Other than to say Browzwear will ``make a commission'' from
participating retailers, Farber would not elaborate. He did say,
however, that ``It will be up to the retailers to push this idea.''
 &HT;    Interestingly, Feld said he did not believe the concept would
take with a specialty retailer such as Victoria's Secret.
 &HT;    ``Victoria's Secret deals with fantasy. Everybody wants to look
sexy like their supermodels,'' Feld said. He added, though, that
the company will eventually develop an application for lingerie _
most likely shapewear _ this year. So far, apparel categories
include men's and women's sportswear and ready-to-wear and
swimwear. Children's wear also is planned for next year.
 &HT;    ``We won't do lingerie until the third or fourth generation of
this application,'' Feld said. ``When we do, a woman will literally
be able to see how a dress will fit by wearing a certain shaper.''
 &HT;    Feld further noted that the concept is based on Israeli
technology that was originally created for educational studies of
``space and the universe. It showed students how to navigate in
space and interact with the stars.''
 &HT;    Added Farber, ``One of the most important aspects of this
technology is the privacy we are offering. Nobody will be able to
see a person as they are trying on clothes in their virtual fitting
room.''
 &HT;    The technology also can aid shopping the international
marketplace, Farber noted, saying, ``If I liked some clothing at a
retailer in New York, and I wanted my mother in Israel to see what
the garments would look like on me, all I have to do is invite her
to visit my virtual closet.''

 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the

Amendment commentary. His email address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   When you buy a book, you don't expect to have a law enforcement
agent searching through the store's records at some later date to
see what books you have purchased. Such an action offends America's
sense of privacy. It smacks of a police state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that is precisely what a drug task force in Denver wants to
do.
</P>
<P>
   They want to look through the purchase records of Denver's
Tattered Cover Book Store, one of the nation's largest independent
bookstores, to see if a suspect in a drug case purchased two books
on how to make methamphetamine. They want to tie this suspect to an
alleged meth lab.
</P>
<P>
   The books on methamphetamine are not contraband. They are legal.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a right to read these books without government
agents looking through their purchase records and taking down their
names. But the North Metro Task Force doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, in trying to build a case against a suspect, law
enforcement officers first attempted to serve a subpoena on the
Tattered Cover for information regarding one of its customers. An
agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, who is part of
the Metro Task Force, served an administrative subpoena on the
owner of Tattered Cover, Joyce Meskis. The subpoena requested
information about books shipped to a particular customer under a
specific invoice and, further, ``information regarding any other
orders placed by this customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Tattered Cover, Dan Recht, told the DEA agent
that the bookstore treated the records of its customers as private
and confidential _ and that the release of these records would
violate its customers' First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Recht told the DEA agent that the administrative subpoena was
insufficient and that if the DEA wanted to continue its quest for
the customer's records, the agent needed to obtain a subpoena from
a federal district court. At that point, Recht told the DEA agent,
the bookstore would file a motion to quash to subpoena. The DEA
agent, according to Recht, then told him that ``it wasn't important
to them'' and they would drop it.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. Less than a month later, Adams County Deputy
District Attorney Fran Wasserman called Recht to say that the task
force had come to him with a request for a search warrant on the
bookstore _ to obtain, basically, the same information requested by
the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Informed about the First Amendment implications, Wasserman said
he would call Recht by the end of the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not happy with Wasserman's approach, the task force
went to the Denver District Attorney's Office. Task force members
didn't tell Denver Deputy District Attorney Brian Allen that they
had previously dealt with the Adams County District Attorney's
Office. Allen OK'd the search warrant and Denver County Court Judge
Celeste de Baca signed it.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, five members of the Metro Task Force went to the
Tattered Cover with the search warrant. Fortunately, Meskis was
able to reach Recht and he immediately called Allen and told him
about the First Amendment implications of the search and about the
task force first dealing with Adams County District Attorney's
Office. Allen asked the police officers to leave the premises
without executing the search warrant. The officers agreed not to
execute the search warrant for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, it is impossible to stop the execution of a search
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The week delay, however, gave the bookstore an opportunity to
seek a temporary restraining order against the drug task force and
the execution of the warrant.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, state district court judge Martin F. Engelhoff
issued a temporary restraining order that prohibits the execution
of the search warrant for now.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary restraining order is in effect until after the
court hears arguments in a motion for a preliminary injunction. If
the court grants the preliminary injunction, the drug task force
will not be able to serve the search warrant on the bookstore _ and
customer records will continue to be safe from police inspection.
</P>
<P>
   After several requests for delays, the new date set for the
hearing on the preliminary injunction is Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Much more than customer privacy is at stake here. The First
Amendment right of a free press presupposes the fundamental right
to read. One without the other would be an empty promise. What good
is a free press if the police can intimidate you for what you read?
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 2 interview, bookstore owner Meskis said, ``We hope
and expect that the judge will look at this as a First Amendment
issue beyond the privacy issue. If the judge doesn't stop this
warrant, people are going to be very fearful of what they read and
buy. I think it will chill the freedom to read. One needs to be
constantly mindful that the First Amendment is one of the dearest
things in a democratic society _ the protection of the freedom to
read. It's so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have an expectation of privacy when they come
into the bookstore to purchase a book. If they feel that is
compromised, they may not read what is constitutionally protected
for them to read because of the concern that something may come up
where their records would be open to police scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Meskis, one of Tattered Cover's customers explained
that just because he likes to read murder mysteries doesn't mean
he's a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   If controversial books can cause the police to search bookstore
records of sales to customers of those books, few will end up
buying them. As a consequence, those books will no longer be
available, because without sales publishers won't be able to afford
to publish them. When controversial ideas disappear from the public
dialogue, democracy is much, much poorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Tattered Cover should win this battle. The U.S. Supreme
Court has generally prohibited the kind of searches that implicate
the First Amendment unless the government has a compelling reason.
There is no compelling reason in this situation. The Metro Task
Force didn't even interview the suspects or try other means to tie
the particular suspect to the alleged meth lab.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary injunction hearing is being held in a state
district court. The state of Colorado has a very strong tradition
of protecting its residents' freedom of speech and freedom to read.
Some attorneys contend that the Colorado Constitution protects the
state's residents' First Amendment rights better than the federal
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case of a few misguided law enforcement officials who
thought they could ride roughshod over a legitimate business and
its customers and ignore the First Amendment implications of their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   It is fortunate that the Denver District Attorney's Office
delayed the execution of the search warrant, so that the matter
ended up in the courts where both sides and the First Amendment can
have a fair hearing.

   La gira del Presidente-Electo Vicente Fox al extranjero en
agosto marca un hito en la historia moderna de Mexico. Es la
primera vez que un lider mexicano recien elegido visite al Cono
Sur.
</P>
<P>
   Si, se llevaron a cabo breves visitas a algunos paises cercanos,
otros que Estados Unidos, por los predecesores de Fox durante el
interminable interregno mexicano. Pero fueron visitas realizadas
para procurarse salvar las apariencias y evitar ir primero a
``chercher l'investiture a Washington,'' como se decia en Francia
durante la Cuarta Republica.
</P>
<P>
   Con su primer periplo al extranjero, Fox en cambio, empleara
esta temprana oportunidad para escuchar, estudiar y, mas
importante, mandar un claro mensaje _ interno y externo.
</P>
<P>
   La primera senal, interna, es cristalina en su transparencia:
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Lagos de Chile y Fernando de la Rua, de la Argentina,
pertenecen a la nueva horneada de mandatarios latinoamericanos
recien electos con programas de centro-izquierda. Sus plataformas
fueron formadas en respuesta a una exigencia de humanizar las
reformas economicas del ``Consenso de Washington,'' a imprimirles
un sello social y una mejor distribucion del ingreso y de las
oportunidades. Asi mismo a combatir la percepcion _ y en muchos
casos la realidad _ de una estrecha vinculacion entre dichas
reformas y una corrupcion creciente.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Henrique Cardoso de Brasil fue electo en 1994 y de
nuevo en 1998 con un programa y una coalicion mas centristas, o de
centro-derecha. Pero a la vez le ha otorgado una alta prioridad a
la politica social, en particular educativa y de salud, y, a raiz
de su propio pasado, es visto como un gobernante de
centro-izquierda.
</P>
<P>
   En los tres casos nos hallamos ante regimenes respetuosos de la
ortodoxia economica imperante pero a la vez comprometidos con la
lucha frontal y explicita contra la desigualdad y la pobreza.
</P>
<P>
   En los tres casos se trata de gobiernos de coalicion, carentes
de mayorias amplias y automaticas en el poder legislativo, y que
por tanto se ven obligados a negociar, a pactar, y a trabajar con
aliados estrategicos o efemeros en las camaras.
</P>
<P>
   En los tres casos, por ultimo, aunque en dosis diferentes, se ha
seguido adelante con el ajuste de cuentas frente al pasado, en
estricto apego a derecho pero con una voluntad persistente de
saber, si no de vigilar y castigar.
</P>
<P>
   El mensaje que Vicente Fox envia a la sociedad mexicana a traves
de su primer viaje al exterior consiste entonces en corroborar,
ahora ya en los hechos, lo anunciado durante su campana: mientras
dependa de el, su gobierno se inspirara, en muchos de los rasgos
inscritos, en los procesos en curso en el Cono Sur.
</P>
<P>
   La otra senal es, obviamente, de naturaleza externa:
</P>
<P>
   El segundo recorrido, que podramos llamar ``el paquete NAFTA,''
a finales de agosto, incluira encuentros con el Premier Jean
Chretien de Canada, con el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Bill
Clinton y con los dos aspirantes a sucederlo _ Al Gore y George W.
Bush. A nadie escapa que este viaje refleja claramente la enorme
importancia, el significado primordial, que reviste para Mexico la
relacion con Norteamerica.
</P>
<P>
   Desde hace decadas, y sobre todo a partir de la firma del
Tratado de Libre Comercio (TLC o NAFTA) con Estados Unidos y
Canada, Mexico forma parte de ese bloque economico y dicha
pertenencia constituye una realidad incontrovertible e inamovible
de los coordenados de Mexico en el mundo. Pero ello no impide
buscar regiones o temas que permitan una relativa diversificacion o
relaciones privilegiadas con ciertos paises en ciertos ambitos. Es
el caso, justamente, del Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   Lo primero es iniciar la negociacion de un acuerdo de libre
comercio con el Mercosur como entidad y no con los paises
individuales. Asi se lo han propuesto los cuatro paises a Mexico. Y
el regimen de Ernesto Zedillo o el de Vicente Fox deberan
pronunciarse al respecto.
</P>
<P>
   Si bien tal acuerdo no necesariamente provocara una enorme
expansion del comercio, permitira destrabar litigios comerciales
espinosos con Brasil. Abrira, tambien, espacios para que afloren
complementaridades latentes de comercio e inversiones. Y, a la vez,
sentara las bases para que, en caso de revitalizarse la iniciativa
americana de la Zona de Libre Comercio de las Americas, Mexico y el
Mercosur negocien en bloque y ya no por separado. No resultara
facil reducir las brechas que siguen separando a Mexico y a Brasil,
en particular, pero es indispensable intentarlo nuevamente y con un
renovado animo de buscar convergencias.
</P>
<P>
   La segunda vertiente es la busqueda de posturas comunes de los
miembros del Mercosur en las negociaciones economicas
internacionales en curso. Estas incluyen la construccion de una
nueva arquitectura financiera internacional y la nueva ronda de la
Organizacion Mundial de Comercio (OMC), iniciada y abortada en
Seattle el ano pasado.
</P>
<P>
   Como lo ha dicho Ricardo Lagos, America Latina dificilmente
podra incidir en estos procesos y muchos otros _ como la reforma de
la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y la implementacion de los acuerdos
de Rio y de Kyoto en materia ambiental _ si no habla con una sola
voz.
</P>
<P>
   El tercer renglon de el acercamiento Mexico-Mercosur es
evidentemente el de la cultura: como la traduccion de obras en
portugues y espanol, apertura de institutos culturales, intercambio
de exposiciones, muestras de cine, expansion editorial e
intercambios academicos.
</P>
<P>
   Pero antes que nada, Vicente Fox ira a America del Sur a
escuchar, a indagar las posibilidades existentes de negocios, de
convergencias, de acuerdos y de iniciativas _ y desarrollar la
solida relacion personal que ya tiene con quienes seran, a partir
del 1 de diciembre, sus colegas latinoamericanos.
</P>
<P>
   La senal de Fox muy clara: el ``premio o bono democracia'' para
la alternancia mexicana, que se busca en los mercados y en la
relacion con Estados Unidos, se puede alcanzar tambien en America
Latina.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's trip abroad in early August marks a milestone in
modern Mexican history. It will be the first time a president-elect
from Mexico visits Latin America's Southern Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Fox's predecessors journeyed briefly to nearby
countries other than the United States, during the endless Mexican
interregnum, but in large part, for appearances' sake, those visits
were made to avoid going first to ``chercher l'investiture a
Washington,'' as it was said in France during its Fourth Republic.
</P>
<P>
   With this first foreign excursion, and departing from tradition,
Fox will use this early opportunity to listen, study and, most
importantly, to send clear messages _ internal and external.
</P>
<P>
   The first signal, internal, is crystal clear:
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Lagos, of Chile, and Fernando de la Rua, from Argentina,
are among the new wave of Latin American presidents recently
elected with center-left programs. Their platforms were influenced
by a need to humanize the economic reforms spelled out by the
``Washington Consensus,'' to give the reforms a social stamp and
promote a fairer distribution of income and opportunities. They
were also designed to counter the perception _ and in many cases
the reality _ of a close connection between reforms and growing
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was first elected
in 1994 and once again in 1998 with a more centrist, or rather
center-right, program and coalition. But he has also given a high
priority to social policy, especially education and health care,
and so now, based on this political record, he's seen as a
center-left president.
</P>
<P>
   In these three cases we see governments that respect the
prevailing economic orthodoxy but that are, at the same time,
dedicated to the fight against inequality and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In the three cases, we also see coalition governments that do
not have and cannot depend on a clear congressional majority, who
are obliged to negotiate and work with both strategic and marginal
allies.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, in the three cases, though in different degrees, we
see governments that have embarked on settling accounts from the
past _ to the letter of the law _ with a tenacious will to study,
to face and to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of this first trip abroad, Fox's message to Mexicans,
thus, corroborates a statement he made during his campaign: his
government, while it depends on his leadership, will lok for
inspiration in the many features of current changes taking place in
the Southern Cone.
</P>
<P>
   The second signal, external, is equally clear:
</P>
<P>
   The next excursion, that could be called ``the NAFTA package,''
at the end of August, will include meetings with Prime Minister
Jean Chretien of Canada, President Bill Clinton and the two U.S.
presidential candidates _ Al Gore and George W. Bush. It is
patently clear to everyone that this trip reflects the enormous
importance, the fundamental significance that Mexico places on its
relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, and above all since signing the North American Free
Trade Accord (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, Mexico has
formed part of that economic bloc, and that membership represents
an irrefutable reality for its relations with the rest of the
world. This doesn't prevent Mexico, however, from looking further
afield for diversification or special ties. Such is exactly the
case with Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's first step, then, is to negotiate a free trade
agreement with Mercosur as an entity rather than with each
individual nation. The current member counties have already
proposed this to Mexico. So it is now for the Zedillo or Fox
administration to go on record in this respect.
</P>
<P>
   While such a pact may not necessarily give rise to a dramatic
increase in trade, it will clear away thorny commercial disputes
with Brazil to make room for commerce and investment opportunity to
flourish. At the same time, it will serve as a basis for Mexico and
Mercosur to negotiate as a bloc when talks are reopened on
establishing a North and South American Free Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Mercosur member countries and Mexico must next work on finding
common ground from which to negotiate new international trade pacts
and financial structures, and to participate in the new round of
World Trade Organization talks that was stalled in Seattle last
year.
</P>
<P>
   As Ricardo Lagos says, Latin America will never be able to
influence international processes _ including reforming the U.N.
Charter, or implementing the Rio and Kyoto Accords on the
Environment _ if it cannot speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   The third obvious aspect of a Mexico-Mercosur partnership is a
cultural one: Portuguese/Spanish book translation, establishment of
cultural institutes, exhibition and movie exchanges, editorial
expansion and academic interchange.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, Vicente Fox will go to South America to
listen, to study the possibilities for business, converging ideas,
agreements and initiatives _ and to affirm the solid personal
relationships he already enjoys with his Latin American colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   So, Vicente Fox's second, important message is unambiguous:
</P>
<P>
   The ``democracy prize or bond'' for Mexico, that is sought in
relations with the United States and its markets, can also be
pursued in Latin America.
</P>
<P>

 c.2000 New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aunque el escritor Jorge Luis Borges escribio _ o dijo _ que
todos los grandes maestros de la humanidad han sido maestros
orales, los hombres siguen buscando en los libros esa suspension de
la sabiduria. Ese aliento de la eternidad no pareciera estar en
ninguna otra cosa, ni en las navegaciones virtuales del Internet ni
en el fugitivo cine.
</P>
<P>
   Las librerias son un muestrario infinito de ladrones, lectores
de solapas, estudiantes sin dinero, buscadores de perlas, mirones,
conversadores, ciegos, aspirantes al Parnaso. En las librerias
gigantescas, el zoologico se multiplica en proporcion geometrica,
porque los sotanos, los anaqueles escondidos, los rincones y los
entrepisos son propicios para que los visitantes, sintiendose a
cubierto, se desnuden.
</P>
<P>
   En Nueva York coinciden por lo menos dos de las librerias mas
grandes del mundo. El Guinness Book of Records adjudica el primer
lugar a la Barnes &AMP; Noble de la Avenida 5 y la Calle 18, que tiene
20 kilometros de estantes. Sin embargo, hay en esa inmensidad tal
acumulacion de `best sellers' marchitos, tantas paginas muertasde
diccionarios y recetas de cocina (a un promedio de 50 ejemplares
por titulo), que los 20 kilometros se recorren en media hora.
</P>
<P>
   El verdadero eden de los bibliomanos, sin embargo, es Strand,
que se precia de tener cualquier titulo, que a uno se le venga a la
memoria, en los polvorientos afluentes de su casa central, situada
en Broadway y la Calle 12.
</P>
<P>
   La propaganda de Strand es modesta. Alude a un caudal de 2
millones de libros. Son tres. Supone que hay 13 kilometros de
estantes. Son 16, sin contar el medio kilometro de ejemplares raros
o unicos que se guardan en el edificio de al lado y los 2
kilometros del anexo de Wall Street, en la Calle John.
</P>
<P>
   El encanto de Strand no esta en su vetustez ni en la pasmosa
erudicion de sus 160 empleados, capaces de indicar en que recodo
del subsuelo estan los catalogos de la joyeria Tiffany o en que
area de la Seccion Ciencia se pueden encontrar las 10 a 12
enciclopedias sobre peces exoticos o extintos atesorados en los
ultimos tres anos. No. La gracia esta en que todo cuesta la mitad.
</P>
<P>
   Ante las mesas proximas a la entrada, donde carteles escuetos
pregonan que los libros recien aparecidos se venden a mitad de
precio, se atropellan muchachos languidos como algas y matronas de
manos desesperadas, con mas fervor del que se advierte en las
liquidaciones de Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   La primera vez que fui, una dama de aspecto severo se dejo
llevar por la emocion y exclamo en tono tan alto que los de las
mesas vecinas se sobresaltaron: ``Vean lo que encontre! Dios mio!
El Hearst de Nasaw por $8 dolares! Hoy es mi dia de suerte,
decididamente.'' Aludia a ``The Chief'' (``El Jefe''), la admirable
biografia del magnate del periodismo William Randolph Hearst
escrita por David Nasaw. Es una obra que nadie pone en las mesas de
saldos y que los libreros mas generosos venden a $30 dolares, con
un descuento del 20 por ciento.
</P>
<P>
   Las manadas se precipitan para descubrir si quedan otras copias
de la ganga portentosa, pero fracasan: en Strand, rara vez sucede
dos veces el mismo milagro.
</P>
<P>
   Hace tres o cuatro anos hubo, si, una historia que aun todos
recuerdan, pero no le paso a un cliente sino a Fred Bass, hijo del
fundador, Benjamin Bass, y oraculo insoslayable para todas las
preguntas dificiles de la libreria. En una vieja casa del East Side
de Manhattan, Bass compro 100 ejemplares de primeras ediciones para
su red de coleccionistas: el conjunto incluia una copia de ``El
Gran Gatsby,'' otra de ``Adios a las Armas,'' alguna mas de ``La
Muerte de Virgilio'' de Hermann Broch.
</P>
<P>
   La joya de la coleccion era una caja que nunca habia sido
abierta, y que contenia, al parecer, uno de los 100 ejemplares
numerados del ``Ulises'' de James Joyce publicados en 1922 por
Shakespeare and Co. en Paris, y distribuidos solo entre los amigos
del autor y de la editora Sylvia Beach. Como no se sabia en que
condiciones estaba el libro, Bass acepto pagar $3,000 dolares a
ciegas.
</P>
<P>
   Era invierno, visperas de Navidad, y el cielo estaba rojo,
saturado de nieve. A las 9:30 de la noche, poco despues de que la
libreria cerro las puertas, Bass abrio la caja, flanqueado por su
hija Nancy, de 20 anos, y por Marvin Mondlin, el experto de la
seccion de Libros Raros. Uno de los bordes de la caja estaba
sellado con lacre. En el extremo opuesto se notaba el doloroso
rastro de una larva de polilla. Nadie respiro. Bajo un papel de
seda, Bass encontro no uno sino dos ejemplares flamantes de aquella
primera edicion mitica, encuadernados en cuero marron y firmados,
ambos, por el propio Joyce. En el colofon estaban sus numeros de
origen: 66 y 67.
</P>
<P>
   El primer Strand fue abierto por Benjamin Bass en 1929. Era un
pequeno local de la Calle 8, cerca de la New York University, que
al principio servia para intercambiar libros usados.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando Benjamin se traslado a la Avenida 4, siempre en los
aledanos del Greenwich Village, descubrio que algunas grandes casas
editoriales aceptaban desprenderse de lo que llamaban ``excesos de
impresion'' a bajo precio. Bass se quedaba con un margen estrecho
de ganancia, y los vendia 50 a 60 por ciento mas baratos que sus
competidores. En 1955 habia crecido tanto que debio mudarse. De esa
epoca data el Strand de Broadway y la Calle 12.
</P>
<P>
   Contra lo que cualquiera podria imaginar, los 3 millones de
libros estan ordenados alfabeticamente. Pasean entre los anaqueles
12 a 14 empleados devolviendo a su sitio los ejemplares revueltos
por los curiosos.
</P>
<P>
   Algunas de las secciones situadas en el fondo del local _
Religion, Ciencias Politicas y Ciencias _ equivalen, por si solas,
a una libreria completa.
</P>
<P>
   Hay mesas que ofrecen libros a 48 centavos o cinco por $2
dolares que en modo alguno son basura. En una de esas mesas
estaban, a la vez, una edicion de ``Suspense'' de Joseph Conrad,
fechada en 1925 (acaso la primera), una ``Teoria de la Semiotica''
de Umberto Eco lanzada por la Universidad de Bloomington, y ``The
Bluest Eye'' (``Los Ojos Mas Azules'') de Toni Morrison en una de
las copias destinadas a la critica.
</P>
<P>
   En la vereda, mas alla de las estanterias moviles que desafian
el viento del invierno, Nueva York parece una ciudad civilizada y
hasta benevola. A la vuelta de Strand, frente a Union Square, se
yergue la desvencijada torre de la editorial Farrar Straus &AMP;
Giroux, abriendose paso a duras penas entre los vendedores de
castanas calientes y de pretzels untados con mostaza.
</P>
<P>
   Mas al sur, entre los gallardetes violetas de la New York
University, aletean las estudiantes de cine y de literatura
comparada mientras, en las cantinas de nombres irlandeses, algunos
profesionales de la conversacion tratan de cambiar el mundo entre
torrentes de cerveza.
</P>
<P>
   Al caer la noche, las parejas llegan abrazadas a los cines o se
detienen en las tiendas de musica, hamacandose al compas de
cadencias que solo ellas escuchan. Strand cierra a las 9:30, tras
12 horas de trajin, y sus escaparates oscuros se eclipsan como
pajaros.

   The writer Jorge Luis Borges once said that history's greatest
teachers were oral teachers. But man still searches in books for
visionary wisdom and that breath of eternity that seems
unattainable anywhere else: not in the fleeting images of movies,
nor in the virtual navigation of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores are an infinite breeding ground of thieves,
dust-jacket readers, penniless students, people searching for
pearls of wisdom, conversationalists, the idle, the handicapped and
those who aspire to Parnassus. In mammoth bookstores this wildlife
increases proportionately and the cellars, the hidden shelves and
corners become ideal places for these visitors to confidently
reveal their true selves.
</P>
<P>
   New York has the honor of being home to two of the largest
bookstores in the world. ``The Guiness Book of Records'' confers
first place to Barnes &AMP; Noble, at the corner of 5th Avenue and 18th
Street, with its 12.5 miles of shelves. In this enormous space,
however, there is such an immense quantity of old best sellers, so
many dead pages of dictionaries and kitchen recipes (an average of
50 copies for each title) that those 12.5 miles can be reviewed in
half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The real paradise of bibliophiles, though, is The Strand
Bookstore which boasts that in the dusty corridors of its central
building at Broadway and 12th Street you can find any title you
desire. The Strand's publicity is modest. It mentions an inventory
of 2 million books. In fact, it is 3 million. There's reputed to be
8 miles of shelves. But actually, there are nearly 10, plus another
one-third mile of rare books kept in the building next-door and of
course the one-and-a-quarter miles of shelves at the Wall Street
Annex, at John Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Strand's charm is not in its quaint and ancient image nor in
its 160 incredibly erudite employees, who can tell you which shelf
in the cellar will proffer a collection of Tiffany's catalogs or
which area of the Science Section is home to the 10 to 12
encyclopedias of exotic or extinct fish that the bookstore has
acquired over the last three years. No. The real attraction is the
fact that everything is half price.
</P>
<P>
   Several signs advertise recently published books at half price
over the tables near the entrance, where boys, languid as algae,
and frenetic matrons with busy hands battle each other with more
passion than at a Macy's sale.
</P>
<P>
   On my first visit, a very severe looking lady who, losing her
self-control and startling those nearby, screamed: ``Look what I
found! My God! Nasaw's Hearst for only $8! This is definitely my
lucky day.'' She was talking about ``The Chief,'' David Nasaw's
excellent biography of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, a
book nobody'd dare put on a bargain table and that even the
cheapest bookstore would not sell for less than $30.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in the bookstore converged on the table to see if they
could find another copy, but in vain; the same miracle rarely
occurs twice at The Strand.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four years ago a miracle, still talked about today, did
happen to Fred Bass, son of the founder and the bookstore's oracle
of last resort for obscure inquiries. Bass bought from an old house
on Manhattan's East Side a collection of 100 volumes of first
editions, knowing that many customers looked for such books. The
collection included a copy of ``The Great Gatsby,'' another of
Hemingway's ``A Farewell to Arms,'' and also of ``Virgil's Death,''
by Hermann Broch.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of the collection was a box that had never been
opened. Inside was supposed to be one of the 100 numbered volumes
of ``Ulysses,'' by James Joyce _ published in 1922 by Shakespeare
and Co. in Paris _ that were distributed only among the writer's
friends and editor, Sylvia Beach. Since nobody knew what kind of
condition the book was in, Bass agreed to pay $3,000, sight unseen,
for the contents of the box.
</P>
<P>
   It was winter, Christmas Eve, and the sky was red and full of
snow. When the bookstore closed its doors that night a little after
9:30, Bass, his 20-year-old daughter Nancy and Marvin Mondlin, the
Rare Books Section's expert, tackled the box, sealed on one side
with sealing wax. On the other side they could detect the dolorous
tracks of moths. The three held their breath. Opening it, Bass
found in perfect condition not one, but two volumes of that
mythical edition, each bound in brown leather and signed by Joyce
himself. Inscribed in the colophons were their numbers of origin:
66 and 67.
</P>
<P>
   The first Strand Bookstore, founded by Benjamin Bass in 1929,
was a little store _ originally a used-books exchange _ on 8th
Street, in Greenwich Village near New York University. When
Benjamin moved to 4th Avenue, again close to Greenwich Village, he
discovered that big editorial houses occasionally sold what they
called ``printing overruns'' at very low prices. Bass, keeping a
narrow margin of profit for himself, would sell those books at 50
or 60 percent less than his competitors. By 1955 his store had
grown so much that he had to move again, opening The Strand at
Broadway and 12th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The 3 million books there today are arranged in alphabetical
order. Between 12 and 14 employees constantly glide along the
corridors, returning books to their correct places after customers
glance at them. Some of the sections in the furthest corners of the
bookstore _ ``Religion,'' ``Political Sciences'' and ``Science'' _
are in themselves complete bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   There are tables full of volumes for 48 cents or five for $2,
that in no way can be considered trash. Once, on one of those
tables, I found an edition of ``Suspense,'' by Joseph Conrad, dated
1925 (maybe a first edition), a ``Theory of Semiotics'' by Umberto
Eco edited by Bloomington University Press and a critic's copy of
Toni Morrison's ``The Bluest Eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, several steps beyond the mobile bookstands that defy
the biting winter wind, New York seems a civilized and almost
benevolent city. Round the corner from The Strand, in front of
Union Square, the office building of publishers Farrar Straus &AMP;
Giroux towers over the many street vendors peddling roasted
chestnuts and pretzels with mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, cinematography or comparative literature students
flutter along the sidewalks among New York University's violet
pennants. And in the local Irish pubs, more serious types, fueled
by torrents of beer, talk of changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, couples, arms about each other, approach movie
theaters or music stores to window-shop while they sway to a music
only they can hear. The Strand closes at 9:30, after 12 hours of
bustle, and its shelves, now darkened, disappear like birds in the
night.

&HT;     GORE PICKS UP A FEW SYLLABLES OF CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore picked Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman as his running mate, and the media were off to the
races _ make that religions and moralisms.
</P>
<P>
   Has Gore deflected Republican moral attacks by choosing the
senator who made Bill Clinton say he was sorry for lying about his
affair with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Can a Jew be elected vice president, especially an Orthodox Jew
who doesn't work on the Sabbath? Never mind the fact that vice
presidents don't work any day of the week. Never mind that Ronald
Reagan quit working at sundown every day.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman himself has called for religion to be part of public
life, and now it is in a big way, at least on the talk shows. But
forget religion. This is the age of superficiality in politics, as
Reagan, Clinton and George W. Bush all have proved. A politically
astute friend raises the biggest problem of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does `Gore-Lieberman' look like on a bumper sticker?''
she said. ``How do you fit it on a button? How can you say it?''
</P>
<P>
   That's it. The question isn't one of potential anti-Semitism but
of anti-syllabicism.
</P>
<P>
   In the last century, there have been only three presidents with
one-syllable names, Taft, Ford and Bush. Only one had a vice
president with more than two syllables in his last name.
</P>
<P>
   That was Gerald Ford's vice president Nelson Rockefeller.
``Ford'' and ``Rockefeller'' never had to be squeezed on a button
because the two weren't elected, but took office after Nixon
resigned. And when Ford ran against Jimmy Carter, he had Bob Dole
as a running mate. It was a nice pairing for a button, but hardly
for excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush-Cheney'' are two short names with a pleasant ring, as
long as you don't hear what they stand for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore-Lieberman'' trips off the tongue about as fluidly as,
well, Gore gives a speech. It won't work on a button at all.
</P>
<P>
   Either you make Gore's name very small, which Democratic
strategists probably would like to do. Or you put Gore's name in
the middle and run Lieberman's around it like the defensive shield
it is.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there's only one thing for the Democrats to do. They have
to print ``Al and Joe'' on all their buttons.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like two guys who run a diner or an auto parts store.
It sounds down to earth, which is just what the Democrats need
right now.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Lieberman, Gore has hit the Republicans with a big
barrel of Shut Up. Shut up about diversity and big tents. Shut up
about the need for morality and religion in government. Shut up
about Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, as everyone has heard in the last two days, once
called Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter ``sad'' and
``sordid.'' For some reason, telling the truth about Clinton's not
telling the truth won Lieberman lots of points.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is part of a morality tag-team with Republican
moralist William Bennett. He also served on the Council of Civil
Society, made up mostly of conservatives, which issued a report on
``why democracy needs moral truths.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said America is in a moral decline that should be
stopped by strengthening obstacles to divorce, reducing sex and
violence in the media and increasing the role of religion in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   This week, religious questions are everywhere. Some of the
questions about Lieberman's Orthodox Jewish religion seem relevant,
too.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if Lieberman becomes president and the Russians
launch a nuclear attack between sundown on a Friday and sundown on
a Saturday? Will he bring in Al Haig as a Shabbas goy?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been called a right-wing Democrat by some members
of his party. Why?
</P>
<P>
   One: In 1995, when California voters were asked by then-Gov.
Pete Wilson to ban affirmative action, Lieberman said he opposed
racially based affirmative action, saying that ``America's about
individuals, not averages or groups.''
</P>
<P>
   So what? Affirmative action turned out to be a loser among
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Lieberman has worked ceaselessly to get the entertainment
industry to quit producing violent and sexually explicit rap music,
movies, television shows and video games.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Players of Doom don't vote.
</P>
<P>
   Three: Lieberman and values pal Bennett created ``The Silver
Sewer Award,'' which has been given to Fox TV, Jerry Springer and
CBS for putting Howard Stern on the air.
</P>
<P>
   So what? All Americans like to pretend they hate Springer and
obscenity in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman may be a bluenose censor and he may want to see more
religion in the public sphere, but he's also a strong supporter of
labor unions, environmental protection, campaign finance reform,
abortion rights and gay rights. These are the kind of moral issues
liberals really care about.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether anything can help Gore. Has he shown
courage by picking a man of apparent integrity who happens to be
Jewish? Or is picking a man of integrity a cynical Gore move?
</P>
<P>
   At least now we have a race and a clear choice of moralistic,
boring guys. Bush and Cheney, or Al and Joe? They're as different
as day and night, and not just on Friday.

 By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm warning you at the top: Don't complain to me if you buy this
CD and you find it juvenile and stupid.
</P>
<P>
   I did too. But I also laughed out loud at least a dozen times,
and that's twice as many guffaws as I got from ``Scary Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD is titled ``Hey, You Called Me!'' (available at
www.heyyoucalledme.com) and it's the homemade creation of Chris,
27, who works for a Chicago advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Note that I'm not using Chris' last name. That's because he
doesn't want to be removed from lists used by telemarketers. That's
right, he hopes to be disturbed at home by jargon-spewing
terrorists who are capable of delivering 500-word sales pitches
without coming up for breath.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that's where the comedy is born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, You Called Me!'' is a collection of 17 conversations
between Chris and various cubicle-dwelling drones who were
unfortunate enough to draw his name from their roster of cold
calls. Whereas the Jerky Boys had astonishing success (gold
records, tons of press, even a feature film) with prank calls they
made to businesses and individuals, Chris waits for his dupes to
reach out to him before he tries on his comedy hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started over a year ago,'' he told me. ``In the
beginning of 1999, I started receiving these telemarketing calls
constantly. Finally I got fed up. I started messing with these
people _ and they took it!''
</P>
<P>
   Well yes. Imagine the lot of the telemarketer _ getting three
instant hang-ups, four ``F--- you's'' and five ``Sorry, not
interested'' responses for every hint of a nibble. If someone
sounds interested or just stays on the line, you'll keep talking to
him even if you suspect he's nuts and/or a clown.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens on a track called ``Obsessive Compulsive.''
The telemarketer wants to send Chris ``a free, brand new pager'' _
even if that means he has to tailor the pitch to Chris' obsessive
compulsive tics.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ``I have to wash my hands. I really want to hear what
you're saying, saying. I don't know if you've ever heard of
obsessive compulsive, compulsive. I want to hear what your offer
is, but I have to repeat the last word of a sentence, so please
don't feel offended, offended. I gotta wash my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   TELEMARKETER: ``I understand your hesitation sir.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ``I'm very long on habits, habits. I want to hear what
you have to say, but just bear with me, me. So it would really put
me at ease if the last word of your sentence _ just repeat it, OK?
OK? I gotta wash my hands. Hands.''
</P>
<P>
   TELEMARKETER: ``OK. ... We're sending you a full-service pager,
service pager. A value of $79.95 for no charge whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ``You didn't say it.''
</P>
<P>
   TELEMARKETER: ``Whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   On and on it goes, like a 21st century Abbott and Costello
routine, with the pitchman desperately saying, ``Do you want to get
a free pager, we can set this up for you!'' even as Chris is
wailing, ``I gotta wash my hands!''
</P>
<P>
   Another tele-seller is victimized by the grade-schooler's
favorite taunting trick: Repeating whatever somebody says in a
sing-song voice.
</P>
<P>
   SALESWOMAN: ``And we'd like to send you a free gift.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ''...like to send you a free gift.''
</P>
<P>
   SALESWOMAN: ``Hello?''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ``Hello?''
</P>
<P>
   SALESWOMAN: ``Can you hear me?''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ``Can you hear me?''
</P>
<P>
   SALESWOMAN: ``May I continue, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS: ''...continue sir?''
</P>
<P>
   Click.
</P>
<P>
   They want to sell him things. He wants to pretend he's in the
bathroom, or that he believes he's talking to his bookie's
enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   They want to offer him a better deal. He wants to act like a
lonely soul: ``You have my number, perhaps you'd like to get
together on a social basis ...''
</P>
<P>
   It's all very Adam Sandler-esque. There are times when you feel
sorry for the persistent, polite caller who, after all, didn't grow
up dreaming of becoming a telemarketer some day and is just trying
to scrape out a living _ but then you remember how much you HATE IT
when those people call you at home, and you cackle at the
silliness. (The names of the callers and their companies have been
edited out of the tapes.)
</P>
<P>
   My apologies to the ambitious authors, fine musicians, comedic
hopefuls and indie filmmakers who send me their stuff each month,
looking for a plug, a mention, a column, something. No doubt your
material is more worthy.
</P>
<P>
   But cheap laughs have to count for something in this deadpan
world.

 By KEN HAMBLIN  
 c.2000 Ken Hamblin   
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to a dispatch from the Washington Post a couple weeks
ago, our government's export-finance agency has succumbed to
political pressure and the politics of AIDS by lending up to $1
billion a year over the next five years to governments and private
health care groups in sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
   I understand the do-gooders hope that, by distributing
AIDS-related drugs and services provided by U.S. businesses, they
may help check the spread of HIV and AIDS before black Africa is
essentially depopulated of its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not about to suggest that the United States turn a deaf ear
and a blind eye to the HIV and AIDS ravaged nations of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But still, I wonder whether this is the best and most efficient
way to help, in many cases literally save, the poor souls looking
to the western world for medical relief from HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   I have doubts because of the rampant cultural, political and
moral corruption that is rife among African businessmen, political
dictators and military despots who historically have grabbed with
both hands every grain of rice or farthing that the caring nations
of the world have shipped their way.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering billions of U.S. dollars into the seemingly
bottomless pit of black African corruption may satisfy those among
us in search of an emotional placebo, but it could well be a cruel
trick to play on the men, women and children who are wasting away
from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers, of course, are enormous and I have written of
this atrocity on numerous occasions. According to statistics
provided by the World Health Organization and the United Nations,
AIDS is so rampant in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe that
one fifth to a quarter of the adult population is infected. Medical
authorities predict that AIDS may claim the lives of about half of
all 15-year-olds in those nations.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, one in three adults are already HIV-positive _ the
highest infection rate in the world _ and two-thirds of all
15-year-old boys will fall to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent U.N. report:
</P>
<P>
   ``The current trends in HIV infection will increasingly have an
impact on rates of infant, child and adult mortality, life
expectancy and economic growth in many (black African) countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Piot, Executive Director of UNAIDS, has warned that:
</P>
<P>
   ``The AIDS toll in hard-hit countries is altering the economic
and social fabric of society. HIV will kill more than one-third of
the young adults of countries where it has its firmest hold, yet
the global response is still just a fraction of what it could be.
We need to respond to this crisis on a massively different scale
from what has been done so far.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't agree more. Something massively different must be
done.
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt that the United States is sincere about its
willingness to help the HIV/AIDS infected nations of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But I believe that it would be wiser, and certainly in the best
interest of Africa's AIDS victims, if the United States and other
participating governments were to establish a credit fund from
which pharmaceutical companies, medical doctors and researchers
involved in trying to stem the disease would be paid for services
rendered.
</P>
<P>
   The cold truth is, that if African leaders are not circumvented
from getting their hands on that cash, black people will continue
to fall like autumn leaves.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, however, the best interests of the HIV and AIDS
infected people of sub-Sahara Africa is not the primary
consideration. That would disrupt the way business is conducted
among the fat cats in countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the world is busy weeping for Africa's most recent
wave of victims, I feel certain that the continent's politicians
and generals have already begun to contemplate salting away a good
portion of those U.S. dollars for that political rainy day when
every black African leader is compelled to run for his life.

   WHITEFISH, Mont. _ I live in Whitefish. Although the nearest
major fire is at least a hundred miles away, I can smell smoke.
It's all over the news. Even my Dad in New York called me the other
night to ask me what the hell is going on out West.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to find out is hitting the National Interagency
Fire Center's fascinating Web site (www.nifc.gov) tracking large
(over 100 acres each) wildland fire activity. Please take a look:
There are maps, links to regional fire centers, press releases,
toll-free phone numbers for fire information, and lots of
background material available.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, as of Sunday, NFIC reported 64 ``large'' wildland
fires (over 100 acres each) totaling 941,771 acres.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been 63,242 fire events burning
3,979,033 acres. By comparison, the 10-year average _ for the
entire year _ is 54,138 fires scorching 2,168,083 acres. Wow. Not
only are we looking at nearly twice the acreage burned, but we have
at least six weeks to go in a ``fire season'' that has barely
started.
</P>
<P>
   Average fire size is also up. The 10-year average is 40 acres
per fire, while the year 2000 average fire size is running at about
63 acres, 57 percent bigger. We are now facing more and bigger
fires that are obviously more difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   So how bad will the fire season of 2000 be? In 1988, the year of
the Yellowstone fire, 7.4 million acres burned. This year may be
far worse. As of Aug. 6, 1988, 2,691,442 acres had burned, while
this year we are already at nearly 4 million. We could then expect
nearly 11 million acres to go up _ and it might be more.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service is predicting dry lightning for
areas of the Pacific Northwest, which has been fairly quiet
fire-wise. Firefighting resources are already stretched tight, with
all available airborne assets at full utilization, with Marines and
Army troops on the fire lines, with deals being made to bring in
Australian and Mexican firefighters, and plans being made to fight
only fires that threaten human life. Some property, perhaps a lot
of private property, will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress specially appropriated $240 million in the wake
of the Los Alamos fire fiasco, Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck
told reporters his agency is running through $15 million per day _
that's 16 days worth at current levels, and remember, in hot, dry
years the fire season often runs into October.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, $845 million was spent by federal agencies on 4.7
million acres, or $178 per acre.
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolating that out over 11 million acres of fires this year
and you get just short of $2 billion _ not adjusted for inflation,
property losses, pollution, destruction of selected critical
wildlife habitats, and not counting the utter waste of wood.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, NIFC also posts data on fire acreage since
World War I, and in the 1930s, the average number of fires per year
was over 167,000 fires, torching a shocking 39 million acres each
year. As late as 1953, over 10 million acres a year burned. After
World War II, of course, demand for commercial timber combined with
more sophisticated firefighting methods and equipment reduced the
acreage burned.
</P>
<P>
   Losing 11 million acres to wildfires today, however, makes it
clear that we are losing the ability to control wildfires despite
massive applications of skilled manpower and sophisticated
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Why? As forests busily grow, they grow fuel. If that fuel isn't
removed, either through timber harvest or prescribed burns, it will
eventually and inevitably remove itself in a spectacular and deadly
manner, such as we are now witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   Can we burn safely in a tinderbox? It's obvious we can't. We
simply must conduct appropriate timber harvests alongside
appropriate burning programs, and do it as soon as we possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   If we do not _ if we simply run away _ someday we won't be able
to run fast enough.
</P>

HEDGE FUNDS TRYING TO EDGE CLOSER TO PENSION CHIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ MFS Investment Management is quietly rolling out a
hedge fund for pension managers and endowments, and several other
local firms best known for their prowess in mutual funds are
expected to follow suit, according to people in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   MFS, the nation's oldest fund group, is still raising money for
its hedge fund, which was launched July 1. The effort is shrouded
in the secrecy that typically surrounds these funds _ unregulated
portfolios with broad leeway to buy exotic securities and make big
bets on stocks rising or falling.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as large institutions look to expose some of
their assets to the lucrative returns hedge funds have provided to
the wealthy for years. But pension managers say they need to break
through the mysteries and risks of hedge funds first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in looking at hedge funds,'' said Scott
Henderson, executive director of the $31 billion Massachusetts
state pension fund. But he wants the same disclosure from them that
he would have from any other portfolio manager. ``Do they own 50
stocks or five? That's very important information for me, or I
don't know if the return I'm making is worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A private meeting of hedge fund managers and institutions was
held in Boston July 7 to discuss this very issue, industry sources
said. It was a kind of risk summit and a first effort to forge a
compromise on the privacy hedge fund managers say they need but
that pension managers decry.
</P>
<P>
   Massive losses in a few high-profile hedge funds in recent years
have made many pension managers nervous about diving into
the &UR;  &LR; sector.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Long Term Capital Management debacle sparked a global
furor over the dangers of powerful hedge funds operating in nearly
total secrecy and surprising clients with poor results.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Robertson shut down his renowned Tiger Management hedge
fund this year due to flagging performance, while heads rolled in
the shop of currency maven George Soros amid double-digit losses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hedge fund business is booming, as investors keep
looking for aggressive returns from managers who are paid
handsomely for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Assets in the sector worldwide have more than doubled since 1995
to about $450 billion at the end of last year, according to Van
Hedge Fund Advisors Inc., a Nashville, Tenn., research and
consulting firm. A decade ago, $94 billion was invested in hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Firms like MFS want a share of this booming market, not least
because they can reap larger-than-normal fees. A firm might earn
0.2 to 0.4 percent of assets for managing an institutional account,
but can charge 1 to 2 percent on a hedge fund. It's also standard
for managers to pocket 20 percent of the investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   Customers expect large returns, in the realm of 20 percent to 25
percent a year, for the leap of faith they take when they hand
money over to a hedge fund. The fund managers relish the privacy
with which they are able to run money, even if their approach is as
mainstream as buying and selling hot technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds operate with little oversight because they don't
have small investors as customers. They don't have to disclose
their moves to regulators or clients and typically show investors
their results only quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   MFS's fund is expected to use leverage, or to borrow to make
bets on stocks. The company declined to comment on its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some pension managers are particularly interested in considering
hedge funds because they worry about the bull market petering out.
With a long-short strategy, for example, a manager could bet that
some stocks would rise while simultaneously betting that others
would fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the fears persist. Said Tony Ryan, chief of corporate
pension-fund sales for State Street Global Advisors in Boston,
``Few pension execs want to wake up and find out they lost a
significant amount of money because of a series of trades a hedge
fund has made.''
</P>
<P>
   State Street already offers hedge funds to institutions,
particularly to endowment funds. For fund firms like MFS, which
have seen key managers leave to start their own hedge funds, the
vehicle offers an attractive carrot to employees. More established
hedge funds like institutional money because it tends to stick with
a manager longer than do the assets of wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Putnam Investments, through its T.H. Lee, Putnam
Capital arm, is planning to introduce hedge funds. Fidelity
Investments may be mulling such a product as well.
</P>
<P>
   Maarten Nederlof, chief of Deutsche Banc Securities' pension
strategies group, said the disagreement between institutions and
hedge fund managers could linger: ``The institutions really are
interested,'' he said. But ``there's definitely more talk than
there is action.''

`FRANCHISING GURU' STRUGGLES IN OFF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLS STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some days you get the chicken, some days the chicken gets you.
</P>
<P>
   George Naddaff, the entrepreneur who became famous by building
Boston Chicken into a national fast-food phenomenon, is struggling
through a year he'd probably prefer to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Corners Inc., the Framingham, Mass. picture-framing company in
which Naddaff invested both time and money, recently filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company, once called Frame
King Express, and Naddaff parted ways about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage.com, a Florida company that counts Naddaff as its vice
chairman and a major shareholder, has seen its stock tumble from a
high of $17.50 last fall to just over a buck per share.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Naddaff has been forced to suspend other business
interests and jump in as acting chief executive of Ranch 1 Chicken
Inc., another fast-food chain that specializes in grilled, skinless
chicken breast sandwiches for the health-conscious crowd. He had
been a big investor since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch 1 had already shelved plans for an IPO when its former
chief executive and vice chairman were indicted two months ago with
more than 100 other people in a huge federal case targeting
organized crime involvement in the stock market. The company itself
was never charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Naddaff, 70, of Newton, Mass., has a long history of working an
entire portfolio of budding business prospects at the same time.
He'd be happy to rattle off a few current prospects without getting
into details: companies in the candy business, the concierge
business, and even one bundling energy services.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no getting around the fact that this year already
has held more than its share of very visible disappointments.
Naddaff will tell you that, in so many words.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an investor in companies, you win some and you lose some.
What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Like baseball players, serial entrepreneurs aim for a solid
batting average and suffer the occasional whiff, but they can
become immortalized with a single swing in just the right
situation.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this is the story of Naddaff and Boston Chicken, a
concept created by Arthur Cores and Kip Kolow. Cores and Kolow
eventually sold the franchising rights to Naddaff, who rolled the
concept out through the Northeast and built the company into a
high-profile success.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Chicken eventually changed its name and, later, went
belly up, but that was long past Naddaff's watch. He had sold the
company in 1992 to two former Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.
executives, and it went public the following year. The company
filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998 and most of its business
was liquidated this year in a sale to McDonald's Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But Naddaff became sort of a small-business cult hero because of
his Boston Chicken experience and has been described as a
``franchising guru.''
</P>
<P>
   Naddaff is known for his boundless enthusiasm, so it was no
surprise when he popped up in the press last year talking about big
expansion plans and a possible IPO for Corners, the custom framing
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid expansion appeared to be the main problem when the company
filed for Chapter 11 protection in US Bankruptcy Court July 28. The
chain had already cut the number of its stores by 10 to a total of
31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company had grown probably too quickly and was not able to
keep up with its debt,'' said chief executive Stuart Needleman, who
joined the company about four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Needleman said Corners needed time to regroup, but he was
confident it could regain its health while the stores continue to
operate. ``Everything is business as usual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Naddaff had invested in Corners and joined the board at a time
when several venture capital firms also were sinking money into the
business. ``I was just one of the investors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Naddaff investment, Mortgage
</P>
<P>
   .com Inc., fits the profile of any number of Internet-oriented
public companies. And that isn't good news for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which went public nearly a year ago, has a track
record of operating losses and even suffered declining revenues as
it refashioned itself into a business-to-business model. The stock,
which went public at $8 per share and more than doubled by last
fall, has been sinking steadily ever since. It finished at $1.03
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything `dot-com' is having a tough time,'' said Naddaff, who
has owned or held options to a total of 1.6 million shares.
``Internally, they're doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Naddaff seemed to have another chance for a public stock score
at Ranch 1, one of his many food-oriented ventures with a growing
following.
</P>
<P>
   The company put its IPO on hold early this year, saying the
timing was not right. But by May, Naddaff and chief executive
Sebastian Rametta were still named finalists for Ernst &AMP; Young's
Entrepreneur of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   Then the roof fell in. Rametta and James Chickara, the company's
vice chairman, were accused of being associates of the Colombo
crime family in the FBI's sweeping stock market investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Naddaff, who had been the company's chairman, stepped in as
interim CEO and still serves in that role. With the IPO off the
table for now, Naddaff said he is trying to secure financing for
Ranch 1 before finding a permanent chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Naddaff has put other business interests on the shelf, including
1RoofRealty.com of Cambridge, Mass., where he is chairman.
``Clearly my energies were needed (on Ranch 1) and that's where I
put them,'' he said. ``I'm in New York four days a week and, at age
70, I don't want to feel like I'm jumping on planes back and
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the setbacks, Naddaff continues to talk
optimistically about solving problems and, of course, the chance to
find new companies for investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate is still out there,'' he said. ``It's a question
of how many deals can you pay attention to.''

 EMBRYOS ON ICE: A TROUBLING NEW FORM OF ADOPTION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are the microscopic carriers of the chromosomes of the
couples who created them, the children-to-be of infertile men and
women to whom they provide a hope of biological parenthood. But
they also are the ultimate orphans of new technology, the vast
majority stored indefinitely in liquid nitrogen without any
prospect for being implanted in anyone's womb.
</P>
<P>
   Medical clinics nationwide are increasingly using these frozen
embryos _ left over from in-vitro fertilization treatments _ in
what has essentially become a new form of adoption. Infertile
patients who provided neither the eggs nor the sperm used to
produce them are receiving this surplus of embryos, raising
provocative questions about family relationships and genetic
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the process is taking place in the absence of state
and federal laws, professional oversight, or thorough examination
of the long-term impact on the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   Child-welfare specialists and medical ethicists worry about
where this may lead. Unscrupulous practitioners, they warn, could
sell frozen embryos, a practice that may or may not be legal since
state statutes prohibit the sale of human beings, but don't address
the thorny question of whether fertilized eggs fall into that
category. And even well-intentioned clinicians could inadvertently
coerce poor patients into ``donating'' their frozen embryos in
exchange for fertility treatments, which can cost tens of thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to know . . . but I'd be very surprised if some
of this weren't going on already,'' said Madelyn Freundlich,
executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute in
New York and the author of a new study on the parallels between
adoption and assisted reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cooper, a psychologist at the Reproductive Science Center
in Waltham and a nationally recognized expert on the subject,
agreed. ``There already are clinics doing donation in a very
cavalier manner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After helping a few clients provide their unused embryos to
other infertile couples, officials at the Waltham clinic held a
retreat several years ago to reassess what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us, including me, came to the conclusion that we were
crossing the line from medical assistance for the person who came
to us for treatment . . . to effectively facilitating a new form of
adoption,'' Cooper said. ``We're not social workers or adoption
professionals trained to do that. So we stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   No governmental or medical group tracks how many embryos are
stored in cryogenic states by the more than 300 clinics in the
United States that offer in-vitro fertilization, but experts
estimate that the count has doubled, to about 200,000, in just the
past three years. A spot check of the 10 in-vitro fertilization
clinics in Massachusetts indicated there are 15,000 to 20,000
frozen embryos in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors produce as many as a dozen embryos at a time by using
fertility drugs to stimulate the creation of eggs in a woman and
then mixing them with sperm. Just two or three embryos are
typically implanted in a woman for any one cycle, however, and the
rest are placed in liquid nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority are retained for use by the couples whose
genes they contain. A minority are donated for research, and a
small percentage are contributed anonymously for use by people
without the physical capability _ or, sometimes, the money _ to
attempt in-vitro fertilization on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sheryl Kingsbert of Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland conducted a survey in which she found that 40 of the 96
facilities that responded had facilitated one or more transfers of
frozen embryos, resulting in at least 53 babies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, hundreds, if not thousands, more donated embryos
have been implanted, specialists say, and probably have led to
scores of additional births. Because the success rates of such
procedures are steadily rising, the percentage of women who get
pregnant in this manner seems certain to keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Most clinics are believed to abide by guidelines for embryo
donation issued by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
in 1998. Among other things, these call for screening to determine
whether the donated embryos might carry any diseases, for
recipients to release donors from any liability, and for donors to
relinquish all their rights to the embryos and to any children they
might produce.
</P>
<P>
   Adherence to the guidelines is voluntary, however, and there is
no mechanism for determining compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no rules and no one is watching, as far as I can
tell,'' said George Annas, chairman of the law department at Boston
University's School of Public Health, and one of the country's
leading medical ethicists. ``So, we're taking a giant step forward,
in terms of the technology itself, without having resolved even the
most basic issues that it raises.''
</P>
<P>
   Even doctors who say infractions are rare acknowledge that some
clinics avail themselves so routinely of the medical technologies
available to them that they do not always consider potential
problems _ or provide couples with sufficient counseling about the
long-term consequences of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from adoption's lessons, for instance, child-development
professionals say most children benefit from knowing about their
biological backgrounds as they get older and often want to
communicate with their genetic parents or siblings. In addition,
most genetic mothers, and sometimes fathers, decide later in life
that they want information about or contact with the children they
placed for adoption, which many specialists believe will be the
case for embryo donors as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is that nobody is learning from either
adoption's past or from the similar problems we've already
encountered with anonymous sperm and egg donation,'' said Susan
Crockin, a lawyer based in Newton and a member of an American Bar
Association panel that is formulating a model act it hopes states
will use to pass laws on the ethical use of frozen embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have to realize that they are now doing much more than
just providing medical treatment to individual patients,'' Crockin
added. ``They have crossed the bridge into the uncharted waters of
family formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan S. Penzias, director of the egg-donor program at Boston
IVF, the largest infertility clinic in the country, said such
questions are a principal reason his facility and many others
around the nation don't offer embryo donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people who do it are almost always trying to do
good,'' he said. ``But it's not being done in an organized fashion
where people are sitting down and saying, `Let's talk about this
before we do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Existing programs are usually small, Penzias added, because a
vast majority of couples decide not to contribute their embryos
once they are informed of all the ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   The considerations are generally far different at the receiving
end. Many infertile people are so eager to become pregnant that
they are willing to cope with whatever consequences may arise _
such as telling their children why they have little knowledge about
their backgrounds _ and feel less threatened if they can get
embryos from unidentified donors.
</P>
<P>
   It was this combination of low supply and high demand that led
Mark Sauer, director of reproductive technology at Columbia
University, to take a daring step several years ago: Doctors at his
clinic began implanting embryos that the clinic had created itself
using eggs and sperm from people who did not donate as couples and
who typically didn't know each other.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including other fertility specialists, decried the
practice as a step toward ``designer'' babies, children with
specific traits picked by designating whose sperm and eggs would be
used. A state task force formed to study the issue also raised
concerns that Sauer's work could lead to the formation of large
banks of human embryos from which doctors or their patients could
effectively shop for their selections.
</P>
<P>
   Sauer halted the procedure after the task force issued its
report, and his clinic now creates embryos with donor eggs only if
the recipients choose the sperm provider. Specialists, however, say
some other facilities around the country are still using the
controversial technique of creating and implanting embryos that the
clinics, rather than the egg and sperm donors together, have
decided to create.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, most clinics appear to be proceeding
cautiously. Dr. Mark D. Hornstein, clinical director of the Center
for Reproductive Medicine at Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital in Boston,
said his facility offers embryo donation only under narrow
conditions: It does not advertise its program, so as not to
stimulate demand; donors and recipients are identified, usually
know each other already, and agree to their matches among
themselves; and everyone receives intensive counseling.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Hornstein said, the program has performed only a
``small number'' of implants during its two years in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Most specialists believe demand for donated embryos will
continue to grow, mainly because many people want the experience
the raising of a baby from birth rather than, say, adopting an
older child. But money is also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   A single in-vitro fertilization cycle at a typical Massachusetts
clinic costs about $5,600 if no supplementary procedures are used
and up to $8,000 if they are. Massachusetts is one of only seven
states in which insurance firms pay nearly all the costs of
reproductive procedures; in other states, the corresponding prices
range from $8,000 to double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Implantation of a frozen embryo, by contrast, costs as little as
$1,200 anywhere, although the process does not guarantee either a
pregnancy or a live birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this field continues, there will be mounting pressure for
this, not only because of rising demand, but because we keep
producing more and more embryos,'' said Michael Lee, laboratory
director at the Fertility Center of New England in Reading, Mass.
``Something's going to have to be done with them.''

THOSE UNUSUAL SIGHTS ON THE GROUND BELOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your plane is coming in for a landing. You look down at the
fields and the roads and then the buildings, and you ask yourself:
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck is that?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to well-known sights, some cities have unusual
buildings or other structures that leave airborne travelers
wondering just what they are looking at. Consider the structures in
these cities:
</P>
<P>
   --Nashville. The tall building sports twin spires and a sloped
roof, a look that has earned it the nickname ``The Batman
Building'' because of its resemblance to the Caped Crusader. It's
actually Tennessee headquarters of Bell South.
</P>
<P>
   --Chicago. That white, domed building is the Baha'i House of
Worship, a nine-sided temple that comes together at the apex of a
dome.
</P>
<P>
   --Dallas/Fort Worth. The large, square building is emblazoned
with the words ``Grapevine Mills.'' But this is no factory or
processing plant; it's a shopping-entertainment complex that is one
of the most-visited attractions in the area. (Grapevine Mills is
also the source for the information on these buildings, not that we
weren't familiar with most of them. Well, some of them.)
</P>
<P>
   --Boston. That new building on the waterfront, which even some
Bostonians aren't yet familiar with, is not a modern lighthouse, as
it might appear to be when illuminated. It's the Hyatt Harborside,
with its distinctive Lighthouse Tower.
</P>
<P>
   --Miami. There's a huge outline of an airplane atop this round
facility. It's the new American Airlines Arena, and the airplane
design was added specifically for overhead travelers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Which major US city has the lowest average relative
humidity? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: There is a town in Texas called Ding Dong. (With thanks
to faithful contributor Mike Schuster of Foxborough.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``American tourists like to arrive in a place with no
knowledge about where they have landed. They bring with them their
misconceptions, an amazing lack of geographic knowledge and, best
of all, wallets full of American money'' _ Sandra Porteous, in a
column titled ``Welcome to Canada'' in The Daily News of Halifax,
Nova Scotia. (She's exaggerating about everything but the money . .
. isn't she?) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Massachusetts forbids allowing gorillas to ride
in the back seat of a car. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The pause that costs: A Coca-Cola costs about $14.50 at the Westin
Tokyo. But the hotel is so attractive you almost don't mind paying.
Almost. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sign of the times: A sign at Dinosaur World in Ossineke, Mich.,
informs you: ``Open Everyday except when closed.'' (With thanks to
the offbeat quarterly Two Lane Roads.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Patriots galore: Captain Samuel Cherry's Company, of the New
Hampshire 2d Infantry Regiment, is ready to re-fight the
Revolutionary War. The reenactment group will pitch camp alongside
the Franklin Pierce Homestead in Hillsborough, N.H., Saturday and
Sunday, Aug. 19-20, from 10 a.m to 5 p.m. There will be military
drills, including one for children, musket firing, period cooking
and crafts, marching, the ``punishing'' of a deserter, and a
military fashion show. Also featured will be campfire songs,
demonstration battles, 18th-century weapons, and moving tales of
Hillsborough area men who fought for freedom. Admission is $4 for
adults, $2 for children, and $9 per family; children under 5 are
free. For more information, call the Hillsborough Historical
Society at 603-478-3165. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Las Vegas, with 31 percent average relative
humidity, according to the National Climatic Data Center. &QL;

AN ADVENTURE INTO THE UNEXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES BALL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perfect, trouble-free vacations tend to be dull.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion my wife and I have come to, perhaps as a
hedge against expectations gone awry or, more likely, unexpected
travails (notice how closely the word resembles ``travels'') such
as illness or even the unsettling news of a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   For example, picture yourself miserable with fever in a lodge in
the remote interior of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not Dr.-Livingston-I-presume remote, but surely, we
thought, there would not be a doctor within miles of our cloud
forest. Aha, but just as surely the hotel manager located a
physician from San Jose, the capital, who was serving a clinic in a
nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, looking young enough to have graduated from
medical school the day before and carrying his medical supplies in
what appears to be a fishing tackle box, we were less than
confident but nevertheless glad to see him. Anyway, he was
central-casting handsome and Harriet immediately fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   He asked my age, probably wondering whether I was worth saving,
and began his examination.
</P>
<P>
   His effort to peer into my ears ended in failure because the
batteries were dead in the instrument he used. No matter, he said,
as he announced my temperature in Celsius and was unable to convert
it into Fahrenheit. Not much fever, he said, in halting English,
dismissing it with a wave of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   I was not surprised. I had begun to feel better, perhaps
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   After checking my lungs with a stethoscope that presumably did
work, he said I ought to have an antibiotic and a shot that would
make me feel better for 24 hours, allowing us to continue our trip.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of shot, we asked. Something along the lines of an
anti-inflammatory, he replied. (We later learned it was a steroid.)
We had never heard of such a shot for what appeared to be an
upper-respiratory infection. But we told him to go ahead _ the
promise of a full day of wellness was too good to pass up _ as long
as a reaction was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   He had never seen a reaction, he said, but we did not get the
sense that he had been practicing long enough to have seen many
reactions, bad or good.
</P>
<P>
   He retrieved antibiotics, a vial of medicine, and a syringe from
his box and glanced at his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I have to go,'' he nearly shouted. ``My girlfriend has
come by bus from San Jose and she is waiting for me in the rain.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He dashed from the room as my wife and I looked at each other in
bemusement, and managed our first good laugh of an otherwise
difficult day.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, he knocked on the door and entered with a
drop-dead gorgeous woman and, by now, I was feeling much, much
better.
</P>
<P>
   In an aside, he told my wife that he brought his girlfriend to
the room to prove to her that he was indeed with a patient. She
introduced herself as a pharmacy student from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   We made a cozy group as he filled the syringe and plunged it
into my backside.
</P>
<P>
   I paid him $100 ($60 for the visit and $40 for the medicines)
and a day later considered it money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   I felt terrific.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, I found there are times you just have to
deceive your wife.
</P>
<P>
   We were checking out of the lodge before driving back to San
Jose, where we would stay overnight before flying on a local
airline to Quepos, a resort area on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper lay on the counter, its front page filled with the
photograph of a plane that had crashed into a building. My limited
Spanish told me it was the same carrier we were to fly the next day
and that four people had been killed. The plane had left San Jose
on a flight to a resort on the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   As my wife approached the checkout desk, I turned the paper over
and went about my business.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet is a resolute traveler, but she does not suffer planes
gladly, particularly the small variety. And the plane we were
flying on the next day was a puddle-jumper with room for about six
passengers, including the empty copilot's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if she were to decide not to fly from San Jose to Quepos, a
20-minute flight over mountains, we would be facing a four- or
five-hour drive over roads that inspire T-shirt messages in Costa
Rica along the lines of ``I survived the drive to Monteverde.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was time for some mild deception.
</P>
<P>
   In our hotel room in San Jose, I flicked on the television but
quickly turned it off when the crash appeared on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with my wife in the bathroom, I placed a call to one of
our children to tell him, in case he or the others read of the
crash in the newspaper (and they did), that we were OK.
</P>
<P>
   As I was saying goodbye, Harriet reappeared in the room and
heard me mention my son's name.
</P>
<P>
   I hung up, but she wanted to know why I had called home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, because of the change in our plans I wanted him to know
where we'd be staying,'' I lied.
</P>
<P>
   We had, in fact, altered our plans slightly, and she accepted
the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, as we took a hotel shuttle van to the airline
terminal, the driver chatted with us in fluent English and I
worried that he might mention the crash. At the terminal, just a
tiny waiting area really, a small television near the ticket
counter was on, repeatedly showing newscasts of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crowded, rather chaotic area, and Harriet settled in to
read a book while we waited, never glancing at the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Five of us finally boarded the plane, including an American
couple who seemed exceedingly edgy. I wondered if they knew about
the crash and, if so, hoped they wouldn't mention it, at least
until we were in the air. My own feelings at this point were that
the law of averages was working very much in our favor, in that two
crashes in as many days weren't a likely event. I don't know if
Harriet would have taken comfort from that observation.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was uneventful except for a few down currents over
the mountains and before you could say, ``There's nothing to be
worried about,'' we were on our final approach to the airport
outside Quepos.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch the word ``airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Peering out the window, I could see nothing but jungle below as
the plane descended ever lower, until finally a narrow, unpaved
strip appeared, slicing through the vegetation. We landed with
barely a bump and taxied to the terminal, again something of a
misnomer since it consisted of an enlarged hut that fit in rather
well with the leafy surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet, perhaps more resolute that I gave her credit for (she
is an uncomplaining traveling companion), hopped off the plane and
into the van taking us to our hotel without complaint or comment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we had to return to San Jose several days later, so I
decided to keep my secret to save her any unnecessary worry.
</P>
<P>
   My effort ended in the hotel lobby when an American tourist
pointedly asked if we had heard about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to shush him, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to let go of my deception and hope that Harriet
would forgive me (and, more importantly, be willing to fly back to
San Jose).
</P>
<P>
   As I confessed, she gave me instant absolution, saying she would
have flown on a kite to avoid another torturous trip on unpaved
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The return flight was particularly smooth, unburdened by the
weight of my guilt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are times when misadventure can convey better
than anything else the nature of the people you are visiting.
</P>
<P>
   When I became seasick on a coastal cruise in a small sailboat,
the captain, without our asking, waved down a charter fishing boat
returning to port and asked its captain if he would take Harriet
and me aboard.
</P>
<P>
   We made the transfer and found that the owner was on an outing
with his family, all of whom greeted us warmly as we came on board.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful _ like
virtually all the Costa Ricans we met.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence, still, that when bad things happen on a trip,
they can produce memories rich in understanding and, yes, laughter.

&HT;     49ERS WEIGHING HOW TO PLAY ITS QUARTERBACK QUARTET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Coach Steve Mariucci of the San Francisco
49ers puts the best spin on the situation, calling it ``healthy''
and ``good for everybody.'' But the fact is, he has a bit of a
problem on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have four quarterbacks in camp _ starting quarterback
Jeff Garcia, third-round draft pick Giovanni Carmazzi, eighth-year
vagabond Rick Mirer and seventh-round pick Tim Rattay.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to give. Mariucci said it was possible that the
team could keep four quarterbacks during the regular season, though
he has hinted he would prefer to go with three. With three
exhibition games remaining, and a need to give more practice time
to quarterbacks who will play the most in games, now and in the
regular season, the clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they came from and how they got here doesn't have as
much to do with it as how ready they are,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to continue to evaluate four guys, some
in games, some team work, seven-on-seven drills, individual drills,
and after practice and in tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci is firm on one point. Garcia remains his starting
quarterback, even though he hasn't been able to sustain drives or
get the ball into the hands of the 49ers talented wide receivers in
two exhibition appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Jeff is getting better and better,'' Mariucci
said Monday in a conference call with reporters. ``Whether that has
showed up statistically or not is another thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Garcia's evaluation would not be based just on
his relatively brief appearances in two games. ``He has learned and
he has improved,'' Mariucci said. ``He has a better understanding
now of what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer, with his fifth team in five years, relieved Garcia in
Saturday's 23-20 exhibition loss to the San Diego Chargers and in
the second half led two touchdown drives _ the team's first two of
the young exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He graded out fairly well,'' Mariucci said. ``There were some
plays he'd like to have back. There were things he did that were
good decisions. He showed some athleticism, he showed some poise,
he showed some veteran qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattay came into the game later and came close to putting
together a scoring drive, with the team a foot short of the end
zone, and the winning touchdown, as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all show potential and they all show good things,''
Mariucci said. That's especially true of Mirer, who on Saturday had
clearly the best effort by a 49er quarterback to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he showed that he's worth continuing to look at
because he did some good things,'' Mariucci said. ``Does that
complicate it a bit? Well, good. That's a good problem to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said coaches would be meeting soon to determine where
the team will go from here with the four quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to consider how well they've been playing, not only
in games but in practice as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One solution would be to keep four quarterbacks on the roster,
with one taking a slot on the practice squad. ``It's not out of the
question,'' the coach said. ``It's a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In two exhibition games, Garcia has completed 11 passes in 14
attempts for 76 yards. He has been sacked four times and
intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   Rattay, also in two games, is 14-for-31, for 170 yards. He has
been sacked four times.
</P>
<P>
   Carmazzi is 3-for-7 for 19 yards, with two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer is 12-for-23, for 103 yards, with one sack.

LIEBERMAN A POLITICIAN WHO ISN'T EASY TO PIGEONHOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joseph I. Lieberman supposedly had no chance. It
was July 1988, and Lieberman, then Connecticut's attorney general,
was trying to unseat an icon. US Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a
Republican, was up 17 points in the polls. Moreover, many Jewish
voters, while attracted to Lieberman as an Orthodox Jew, stood by
Weicker, whose pro-Israel record was unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman won in a race still considered a stunning upset.
His religion proved of little consequence. Instead, Lieberman won
partly by running an ad that satirized his opponent as a sleeping
bear who missed too many votes. The ad was produced by the same
consultant, Carter Eskew, who now is Al Gore's message maven and
advised Gore on the vice presidential selection.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Gore's running mate, Lieberman has been thrust into
another uphill race, with Republican George W. Bush up 17 points in
some polls. No sooner had Lieberman's selection become known Monday
than he was quickly tagged with two labels _ devoutly religious and
politically moderate. But the enduring truths about Lieberman are
that he cannot be easily labeled, and that his political skills
should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, Lieberman could accurately be described as a
liberal or a conservative. For example, he supports abortion rights
but also has spoken against affirmative action. He supported pilot
programs for private school vouchers while most in the Democratic
Party oppose them.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman and Gore occupy the same broad middle ground within
the Democratic Party, they arrived at that point from opposite
directions: Gore is a former conservative who has become more
liberal. Lieberman got his start in antiwar politics and once
opposed the death penalty. He is now one of most vocal hawks among
Senate Democrats and supports the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image is often out of sync with the reality,'' said Howard
L. Reiter, a professor of political science at the University of
Connecticut who has long watched Lieberman's career. ``He is a hard
man to pigeonhole.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman dreamed of a career in politics while growing up in
what he describes as a lower-income neighborhood in Stamford, Conn.
Lieberman's father, Henry, ran a liquor store and never went to
college. Lieberman recalls that his family was educated and
spiritual in ways that deeply affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised in a religiously observant family, which gave me
the clear answers of faith to life's most difficult questions,''
Lieberman wrote in a recently published autobiography, ``In Praise
of Public Life,'' which extols public service and excoriates
immorality in politics and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing his spirituality, Lieberman writes: ``My parents and
my rabbi . . . taught me that our lives were a gift from God, the
Creator, and with it came a covenantal obligation to serve God with
gladness by living as best we could, according to the laws and
values that God gave Moses on Mount Sinai. The summary of our
aspirations was in the Hebrew phrase `tikkun olam,' which is
translated, `to improve the world,' or `to repair the world,' or,
more boldly, `to complete the Creation which God began.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman envisioned his future clearly at Yale University,
where his nickname was ``Senator'' because of his ceaseless
interest in politics. While at Yale, he wrote a thesis, later
turned into a book called ``The Power Broker,'' about the
Connecticut Democratic Party boss, John Bailey, who also was
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Lieberman studied
Bailey, interviewed him, watched him organize campaigns. Then he
used the Bailey method for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman won his first political race, a 1970 campaign for a
state Senate seat, with the help of a fellow Yale alumnus named
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman quickly rose in the Democratic ranks in Connecticut,
becoming Senate majority leader. But in 1980, he ran for the US
House but blew a 19-point lead in the polls and suffered what he
later called a ``simply stunning'' defeat. After the election,
Lieberman and his first wife, Betty Haas, with whom he had two
children, were divorced. Lieberman called it ``the most difficult
and painful decision I had ever made.'' Lieberman wrote in his
recent book that his divorce was never used against him politically
until he gave his speech on the Senate floor denouncing Clinton's
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were letters to the editor in various newspapers asking
what gave a divorced man the right to be so morally
self-righteous,'' Lieberman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, after the divorce, Lieberman met Hadassah Freilich, the
daughter of Holocaust survivors who had settled in Gardner, Mass.,
and married her a year later. Lieberman also plunged back into
politics, winning a race for Connecticut attorney general.
Lieberman calls his six years in that post as ``some of the
happiest and most satisfying of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a fateful phone call from Senator John F. Kerry, the
Massachusetts Democrat who later would be one of Lieberman's rivals
for the vice presidential slot. It was 1988, and Kerry was the
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Kerry had
gone to Yale with Lieberman and had a proposal for his old school
chum: Would Lieberman be interested in running for the US Senate
against Weicker?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman most certainly was and launched a tough campaign.
Acting on a suggestion from Lieberman, Eskew, the consultant,
produced the ad portraying Weicker as a sleeping bear. That made
the difference and Lieberman won by 10,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew, Gore's top media adviser, said he ``couldn't claim
credit'' for persuading Gore to pick Lieberman, adding that he left
a meeting with the vice president on Sunday night not knowing who
would be picked. Asked what role he played in Gore's decision,
Eskew said he is such a well-known Lieberman fan that ``I didn't
have to communicate that to the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's 12-year Senate career sometimes defies
classification.
</P>
<P>
   He created a minor stir in 1995 as he was taking over the
chairmanship of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council by
saying policies that reward people based on race or gender are
unfair. ``You can't defend policies that are based on group
preferences as opposed to individual opportunity,'' Lieberman said.
Subsequently, Lieberman supported a California ballot initiative
that would prohibit racial preferences, but he also has resisted
Republican-led attempts in the Senate to pare down affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Lieberman announced he would vote for Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas after initial Senate hearings on his views.
But after allegations that Thomas sexually harassed Anita Hill were
aired, Lieberman changed sides and voted against confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   On some major issues, he is at odds with the man who picked him
for the ticket. Gore opposes the use of private school vouchers,
while Lieberman has supported pilot projects for them. Many
interest groups that dominate Democratic politics expressed support
Monday for Lieberman, though not without words of caution in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enjoyed Senator Lieberman's support on a number of
issues. School vouchers is not one of them,'' said Kathleen Lyons,
the spokeswoman for the National Education Association. ``However,
we are confident that Senator Lieberman will follow the lead of
Vice President Gore on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also offended organized labor at times because he,
like Gore, supports free-trade bills that many unions oppose.
</P>
<P>
   But in Hartford Monday, Lieberman's first appearance after word
leaked that he was Gore's choice was before an AFL-CIO meeting. And
he was warmly received.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman differs with Connecticut labor leaders on issues
like vouchers and trade, Leo Canty, executive vice president of the
Connecticut Federation of Education and Professional Employees,
said, ``There's no question that his commitment to working people
far exceeds that of Dick Cheney and George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   A hallmark of Lieberman's career is his ability alternately to
collaborate with conservatives and liberals. For example, Lieberman
has worked with former education secretary William Bennett to
criticize what they call gratuitous Hollywood violence and sex,
handing out ``Silver Sewer'' awards to ``cultural polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's most famous moment on the Senate floor took place on
Sept. 3, 1998, when he became the first Democratic senator publicly
to condemn his old friend, Clinton, about an Oval Office affair
with an intern. ``Such behavior is not only inappropriate, it is
immoral and it is harmful,'' Lieberman said. He did not vote to
convict the president on the impeachment charges, but his addition
to the Democratic ticket sends a strong signal that Gore wants to
distance himself from Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat, said Lieberman
would help attract independents. ``The ticket will be very
competitive with mainstream, moderate voters,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Lieberman's religion will help or
hurt the Democratic ticket. Gore was already counting on winning
two states with significant Jewish populations, New York and
California. Lieberman's religion might also help in New Jersey and
Florida, according to Lieberman's longtime friend, former
Democratic National Committee chairman Steven Grossman. Bush is
counting on winning Florida, where his brother, Jeb, is governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, this helps Gore in Florida,'' said Grossman, who
is Jewish and plans to run for governor of Massachusetts in 2002.
``The turnout will be in record levels in the condo communities. If
Florida is within 5 points, this could be a defining characteristic
of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Orthodox Jew, Lieberman observes the Sabbath, which runs
from Friday sundown to Saturday at sundown, by not working if
possible. Typically, Lieberman spends the Sabbath with his family,
walking to temple, attending services, praying and thinking. But he
has occasionally voted in the Senate on Saturday when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked me repeatedly, `How can he perform an office
like the vice presidency when he essentially doesn't work one day a
week?' '' Grossman said. ``Well, he may not ride in a car, ride in
a plane, or work at his desk, but so much about Joe Lieberman is he
uses that day to think, to refresh himself, to be with his family.
He is reminding us what the quality of life used to be in
America.''

<HEADLINE>
SENATOR, WIFE DISAPPOINTED, RELIEVED AT THE SAME TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Senator John F. Kerry, Monday was the second
personal setback in a little more than a week, but far from the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   For his wife, Teresa Heinz, there was pain in seeing her spouse
passed over for a job he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for both of them, Al Gore's decision to choose Senator
Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut instead of Kerry as this year's
Democratic vice presidential candidate brought an unexpectedly
liberating end to a three-month selection process.
</P>
<P>
   To Kerry, the end seemed less a setback to his political career,
even a mortal blow, as some speculated, but perhaps the beginning
of the next phase. He said he will not feel the constraints of
being a vice presidential nominee as he speaks out about education,
health care and the environment, and as he ponders his own possible
bid for the White House should the Gore-Lieberman ticket falter.
</P>
<P>
   For Heinz, who agonized by her husband's side all weekend inside
their Georgetown home, there will be no ``10-fold'' repeat of the
scrutiny she and her husband faced in his 1996 reelection campaign
against former governor William F. Weld. Instead, she is free of
the rigors of the campaign trail and able to pursue the
all-important job of doting over her first granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sort of liberated in a sense,'' said Kerry, arm wrapped
around his wife's waist, after Gore's selection was leaked to the
media. ``I think it's always good to be the master of your own
destiny, and there are mixed blessings in being part of something
else that you don't have that kind of control over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had just missed his best chance to one day be
president, the 57-year-old laughed and replied: ``I consider myself
a young man. I've got a lot of energy and a lot of passion about
the issues and I intend to fight for the election of Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman. If that doesn't pan out for us as a party, I will
regret it because I think it's important to us as a party, but if
it doesn't, after that I'll consider where I am and what options
are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinz, meanwhile, dispensed her views as she poured peach iced
tea to reporters waiting on the stoop for reaction to Gore's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in Portugese, there's a very good saying. It says,
`God writes straight on crooked lines.' So there's a meaning for
everything. .. . . You just have to write your own fortunes, and I
certainly know in my life there's been a lot of unexplained things
. . . and you just roll with it,'' she said. Her first husband,
Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz, was killed in a 1991 midair
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Then, flashing an impish grin, Heinz added: ``I told you, I was
going to see my granddaughter today, which I would have not been
able to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In public comments and a private interview over lunch after
Monday's decision, Kerry talked about regaining control of his
political future while Heinz talked about the freedom to return to
what she described as their full and happy lives.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he had given ``no thought about it, none
whatsoever'' to the prospect of running for governor in 2002. He
hedged, though, when asked if he might take an appointed position
in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the job I have tremendously; I've said that before this
consideration began. It would have to be pretty exciting and pretty
good arm-twisting to get me to leave what I'm doing right now,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he confessed that talk of running with Gore stoked
his White House ambitions, acknowledging that he had even started
writing notes for a possible acceptance speech at next week's
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a liar if I didn't say to you there's a little
disappointment in being able to follow through on that and do it,''
Kerry said as he dug through a lunch plate heaped with sesame
noodles, red potato salad, cayenne chicken, and a dessert of
chocolate mousse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invested in it in the last few days when things got a little
more serious. I'd say once the list came down to narrow
possibilities I began to think about message, things I wanted to
say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry termed the waiting process an unsettling ``kind of
limbo,'' a feeling quickly overwhelmed by grief at the July 29
death of his father, 85-year-old former diplomat Richard Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of obliterated the process,'' the senator said.
Preparing for the funeral and tending to his 87-year-old mother
Rosemary, ``made time indifferent, in a funny way, and it was just
such a preoccupation that I wasn't really thinking about the other
that much.''
</P>
<P>
   During the span, he played his guitar and immersed himself in
David Kennedy's book, ``Freedom from Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinz said her husband was actually quite anxious to team up
with Gore and campaign against the Republican ticket of George W.
Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband, he's a windsurfer, he loves everything that's
action, so being active for him is great. That just a personal
trait, can't keep him down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz said she was intrigued as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I was looking forward to and I think John McCain
mentioned that he hoped somebody would campaign on the issues, and
really focus on the issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, while wearing a tired expression, said the two slept
soundly as he waited for Gore's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to bed last night,'' he recalled. ``It was in fate's
hands and what was going to happen was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Heinz flew off to their home on Nantucket, both
oddly satisfied with the outcome of his flirtation with the vice
presidency.

FOR JAGGER'S EX, `GRADUATE' PERFORMANCE GETS HARSH LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Jerry Hall learned a hard lesson last week: Just about
anyone can take their clothes off in the West End, but the British
still expect them to be able to act.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the former supermodel and estranged wife of Rolling Stones
singer Mick Jagger, pulled off the former with aplomb, but by most
accounts did not account herself well of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a straight-talking Texan who left Jagger last year because
of his serial infidelity, is more popular in Britain than her ex,
who, while appreciated for being a rock 'n' roll legend, is seen by
more than a few Britons as something of a stingy, tax-dodging cad.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall's attempt to replace Kathleen Turner as the seductress
Mrs. Robinson in the stage production of ``The Graduate'' has
showed that fame and popularity will carry you only so far when you
have to bare it all on the floorboards of London's West End.
</P>
<P>
   The stage version of Mike Nichols's classic 1967 film has become
a phenomenon in London. Last spring, after Turner stripped naked in
the play's seduction scene during previews, the play's three-month
run sold out overnight. It was extended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   According to London's notoriously fickle critics, the play has
been more a triumph of marketing than theater, a reputation that
only grew when Hall was recently named to replace Turner.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Hall has a better figure than Turner. But by
those same accounts, Turner is an accomplished actress, while Hall
is still widely regarded as an accomplished model and mother who
suffered the repeated public humiliations of her perpetually
adolescent husband.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for accomplished models to become accomplished
film actresses. Andie MacDowell comes to mind, even if Ali MacGraw
does not. But there are far fewer examples of those who make their
living being photographed making a successful transition to live
theater.
</P>
<P>
   That precedent, however, has not deterred the unsinkable Hall,
who took the offensive against Jagger last year when he tried to
avoid alimony payments by claiming their 1990 marriage in Bali
wasn't a marriage at all.
</P>
<P>
   Hall eventually got her alimony, and all appears to be forgiven,
or at least accepted, as Jagger was in the opening-night crowd when
Hall began a week of preview performances before the official
opening night last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger said his ex was wonderful. Critics thought otherwise.
Under a headline that read, ``Enter Jerry Hall, barely acting,''
the Times savaged her performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clothes horse she still is, and she looks undeniably
magnificent for a woman of 44,'' the Times opined. ``But the
trouble with having endless legs and almost equally extendible arms
would seem to be that you do have to have some idea what to do with
them between delivering the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hall's philandering character describes her husband as ``so
boring,'' some in the audience at the Gielgud Theatre could not
help glancing toward Jagger. But according to the couple's friends,
Jagger helped Hall memorize her lines, evidence that the estranged
couple have agreed to disagree with each other's lifestyles but
remain friends.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Hall, who eschewed nudity even in her
supermodel days, is less revealing than Turner was, choosing to
drop her towel for about 20 seconds in very dim lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Billington, the Guardian's acerbic critic, suggested
that ``anyone seeking erotic satisfaction out of the moment would
either have to be pretty desperate or in possession of cats'
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Turner's and Hall's performances, Billington was
characteristically cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turner brought to the alcoholic, sex-hungry Mrs. Robinson a
mocking stillness, a gin-smoked voice and Mae West timing, all
derived from a lengthy film and stage career,'' he said. ``Hall,
having appeared on stage once before in `Bus Stop,' brings only a
wealth of inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   But then wealth is a relative thing. Some theater critics
suggest that Hall is pocketing $15,000 a week for the role.
</P>
<P>
   The sellouts at the Gielgud, meanwhile, have cemented a trend
here in which famous, attractive women put bums in the seats by
baring their bums. Nicole Kidman started the trend last year with
her nude performance in ``The Blue Room.'' Turner continued the
trend, while Hall has made it bankable. There are now more more
than 20 productions of the play planned internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the critics say, Hall will not be the last famous woman
to take her clothes off in the West End this year, or next.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Bennett, a columnist for the Guardian, said she was
tired of listening to critics debate whether the phenomenal success
of ``The Graduate'' is because of its dramatic content or the fact
that the female lead has a nude scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as our sexual infantilism endures,'' Bennett sighed,
``there need be no theatrical flops.''

AGING `COWBOYS' GIVE YOUTH A RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us now praise older men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' earned $17.6 million in its opening weekend,
good enough for a third-place finish behind ``Hollow Man'' and
``Nutty Professor II.'' In a summer where a handful of films have
enjoyed debut weekends above $30 million, it's a respectable, if
unspectacular, box office take. That is, unless you consider that
the film's four stars range in age from 53 to 72.
</P>
<P>
   With so much emphasis in popular culture on all things youthful
_ how else to explain the careers of Freddie Prinze Jr., Carson
Daly, and Jessica Simpson? _ there's something remarkable about a
successful film starring, in age order, James Garner, 72; Clint
Eastwood, 70; Donald Sutherland, 65; and Tommy Lee Jones, 53. The
Washington Post's Rita Kempley called the cast ``the most geriatric
payload since a community of retirees lifted off in `Cocoon.' ''
And with an average age of 65, who can argue.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy-drama, ``Space Cowboys'' concerns a group of retired
astronauts who missed their chance to go into space in 1958, but
are recalled into service more than 40 years later after an
obsolete Russian communications satellite goes haywire. Not
surprisingly, the movie finds much of its humor with the notion of
these craggy, creaky codgers enduring the rigors of NASA's fitness
program, and the teasing of the younger astronauts. But they never
back down, and ultimately prove that advanced age has nothing to do
with ability.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, youth and beauty ain't got nothing on age and
experience _ old people rule.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the message the movie sends to Hollywood as well.
</P>
<P>
   From Paul Newman, 75, to Anthony Hopkins, 62, to Morgan Freeman,
63, to Michael Caine, 67, some of our best actors may be eligible
for AARP membership, but they still have oh-so-much to offer. (The
treatment of older actresses, however, is appalling, but that's
another rant for another day.)
</P>
<P>
   See, acting ability isn't like athletic ability. It doesn't
erode and diminish simply because actors age. In fact, it often
ripens and deepens into something more meaningful. It's the sheer
talents of Eastwood, Garner, Jones, and Sutherland, four of our
wiliest actors, who keep ``Space Cowboys'' afloat.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly shallow culture, youth and beauty are
wonderful accessories. They open doors and instantly garner
attention whether it's deserved or not. These days it seems having
actual talent is a distant second _ if it is considered at all _ to
the allure of good looks and a hot bod.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps because all those controlling, self-involved baby
boomers are now sliding (kicking and screaming, of course) into
their golden years, there's an effort to portray senior citizens as
strong, capable, and valuable, not as doddering old folks shuffling
off to the grave. Consider one of the more entertaining commercials
on the air these days that comes from the ``Got Milk?'' folks _ a
group of geezers whip the living daylights out of a bunch of young
beefy thugs terrorizing people in a diner. It's not only amusing
but offers hope that, even in old age, we won't take any guff from
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Will the success of ``Space Cowboys'' change Hollywood's
obsession with youth? Probably not, but there are at least two
major films due in theaters soon, which also feature other members
of acting's group of elder statesmen. At the end of the month, Burt
Reynolds, 64, and Seymour Cassel, 65, will star with relative
youngsters Richard Dreyfuss, 53, and Dan Hedaya, 60, as retired
mobsters in ``The Crew.'' And Gene Hackman, 70, and Morgan Freeman,
63 (Give him an Academy Award. Now.), will soon be seen in the
thriller ``Under Suspicion.'' All of these actors continue working
because they're just plain good at what they do _ not because
they're gracing the covers of magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it _ will anyone really flock to see Tom Cruise
movies after those floppy bangs have receded, or Brad Pitt films
after those abs melt into flab? Come to think of it, judging from
the box office numbers for such recent duds as ``Meet Joe Black''
and ``Fight Club,'' Mr. Jennifer Aniston might not have to wait
that long to find out.

GORE IS RECLAIMING THE MORAL GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the moment, it's about character, not about ideology.
</P>
<P>
   To beat George W. Bush, Vice President Gore must first beat the
morality issue raised by Bill and Monica. That's why he picked
Joseph Lieberman as his running mate. In August 1998, the
Democratic senator from Connecticut used language everyone could
understand to describe President Clinton's behavior. He called it
``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats know far too well, Bill Clinton hugely disappointed
those who actually believed he ``embodied the potential of a
generation,'' as Bush put it in Philadelphia. Over the course of
his presidency, voters forgave Clinton his repeated Mulligans in
golf and in life. But he went too far when he squandered the
dignity of the Oval Office on a very undignified sexual
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal turned off men; in Monica Lewinsky they saw their
own daughters gone Beverly Hills dysfunctional. Women were more
sympathetic, but they still saw the affair as something pitiful: a
powerful man using a foolish young woman to fill some kind of
pathetic emotional void.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republicans see Monicagate as a way to make Bill Clinton's
character the issue in Campaign 2000. Bush's speech in Philadephia
was filled with indirect references that show a clear intent to
hang Clinton's indiscretions around Gore's neck:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values _
to show we have grown up before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Greatness is found when American character and American
courage overcome American challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must give our children a spirit of moral courage, because
their character is our destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An era of tarnished ideals is giving way to a responsibility
era.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All vice presidents really have only one political obligation,
and that is to remain loyal to the president. Indeed, the elder
George Bush was so loyal to Ronald Reagan he was derided as a lap
dog during his tenure as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, therefore, will argue it is unfair for Gore to pay
for his loyalty to Clinton in the face of irrefutable
irresponsibility. But in politics, fairness is never the point. A
candidate needs an antidote, not an alibi. If Lieberman can
innoculate the ticket against Republican attacks on Clinton's
character, or at least deflect them, he will get Gore closer to
where he needs to be _ reminding voters of ideological differences
between the Republicans and the Democrats and of ideological flaws
in the Bush platform.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Philadelphia, ``compassionate conservatism'' is still more
of a mystery than a mantra that makes intellectual sense.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cutbacks don't compute with lofty goals like renewing ``the
promise of America's schools''; never mind with strengthening
Social Security and repairing Medicare, as Bush is also pledging.
</P>
<P>
   Bush equates ``the next bold step of welfare reform'' with
supporting homeless shelters, hospices, food pantries, and crisis
pregnancy centers. That sounds suspiciously like the starry-eyed
volunteerism urged by another Bush who ran for president. Instead
of the ``thousand points of light'' discussed by his father, the
younger Bush talks about 1,000 meals a week served by a woman
running a homeless shelter, after _ or maybe it's before _ she
washes the feet of the people who call the shelter home.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains hard to sell a party of inclusion when it
includes members of a Texas delegation who doff their ten-gallon
hats and bow their heads to protest a gay congressman who is
talking about trade, not his sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore will never get to any of that if he doesn't first
defuse the character issue. Fairly or unfairly, they the
Republicans are ready to exploit what is at the heart of voters'
unease about voting Democratic in November: their disappointment in
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could help his legacy and his vice president if he
stated the obvious: Each one of us is responsible for our actions.
It would also be nice if he admitted how much he dashed the hopes
of those who voted for him. Unfortunately, he did stop thinking
about tomorrow and thought only of himself.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for Campaign 2000: If it's about character,
Clinton-Gore loses. If it's about ideology, Gore-Lieberman has a
chance to win.

BREAKING A BARRIER OF BIGOTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Dick Cheney's selection to be George W. Bush's
running mate is proving to have been a good move for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman's selection by Al Gore is great for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking a barrier of bigotry that has stood for all of American
history, despite gigantic contributions by Jewish Americans at
every stage of that history, is a triumph, period.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Al Gore's choice _ which in the final hours
was literally a victory over more narrowly political options _
brings to mind Robert Kennedy's famous words while he was in racist
South Africa in 1966, still among the best human rights words every
spoken:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the
lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends a tiny
ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different
centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which
can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Joe Lieberman, up from poverty as well as bigotry, put it
Monday in Connecticut, ``What a great country this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. The United States is still struggling with the
bigotry and racism that have been in its system from the beginning.
It is a struggle that will never end. And in politics, it is
dispiriting that the few breakthroughs that have occurred at the
national level have never been repeated. John Kennedy was the first
and only Catholic president. Geraldine Ferraro was the first and
only female to have been nominated for major party national office.
Guy stuff pollutes politics at all levels; Bob Jones IIIs vicious
bigotry during this year's South Carolina primary is a reminder
that Catholics still face real prejudice; and no racial minority
has yet come close to national office.
</P>
<P>
   Now another big tree in the forest has fallen. The initial
reaction has been strongly positive, a good sign. The Gallup Poll
people, with lineage back to the America of the 1930s, can trace
the country's gradual maturation, noting that only 46 percent of
respondents in 1937 said they would vote for a presidential
candidate who was Jewish, but that 92 percent say so now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is an undercurrent of concern about what will
happen in the privacy of voting booths.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy mentioned more than once was to the race for
governor of California in the strong Democratic year of 1982.
Leading by healthy margins throughout was the African-American
mayor of Los Angeles, the late Tom Bradley. But a six-point lead on
election day disappeared in what analysts later interpreted as a
white backlash that built up below the radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   These concerns are misplaced today, as evidenced by the fact
that during the entire selection process Lieberman's Orthodox faith
was not considered at all. But that doesn't mean that the country
shouldn't be on guard against ugliness and shouldn't be prepared to
pounce on it in whatever form it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to George W. Bush, who hasn't got a bigoted cell
in his body. He has nonetheless regularly exhibited the kind of
insensitivity that is a factor in making major minorities in
American feel excluded from the mainstream. It began with a comment
at the time of his first campaign for governor of Texas when he
opined that only people who have accepted Jesus Christ as their
savior can enter heaven. And traces of it continued into this
year's campaign, with his pander at Bob Jones University, his
remark in Iowa that Christ is the most important influence on his
thinking, and just this month when he signed legislation
proclaiming June 10 as Jesus Day in the state.
</P>
<P>
   What is behind all this is a religious conservatism that has
more than once sought to spread the notion that the United States
is a ``Christian'' nation. It is pure bunk. The whole idea of the
establishment clause in the First Amendment is to encourage all
religions, not designate one. That inclusive philosophy was also
fervently believed in by our Jefferson-influenced founders who were
almost truculently anti-establishment if not anti-clerical.
</P>
<P>
   What the selection of Lieberman means is that the simplest
expression of American optimism there is _ my kid can grow up to be
president _now includes several million more Americans than it did
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be time for the centrist voting record, the dramatic
rebuke of President Clinton, the occasional conservative vote for
school choice experiments, the battle with Bill Bennett against the
entertainment business, the moderate stance on Medicare and Social
Security reform, and the leadership of the New Democrats via the
Democratic Leadership Council. There will also be time for the
important reminders that Joe Lieberman is unlikely in the end to
make much difference in the Bush-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's enough that Gore has made the right kind of
history by knocking down a barrier that should never have existed.
Now the rest of us have to make sure it stays down.

<P>
   WELLS, Maine _ The building that houses Doug Harding's used-book
store was built in 1888 as a private railway depot for the
president of the Boston &AMP; Maine Railroad, who had a summer home
nearby. At the time, the station was described admiringly as
``standing amid pastoral tranquillity.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Route 1 in southern Maine is pretty much nonstop road
rash and it's the bookstore that is tranquil. Other things,
however, haven't changed much in the last 112 years. ``We have
customers whose families have been vacationing in Maine for
generations,'' says Harding, ``and they're looking for the same
sort of books people who come to Maine have always looked for.'' In
other words, books about Maine and interesting and entertaining
books to read at the beach, on a cottage porch, or in a hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Superstores such as Barnes &AMP; Noble and Internet booksellers like
Amazon.com and its used and rare book subsidiary, Bibliofind.com,
are transforming readers' buying habits. But traditions die hard
Down East, and for many visitors to coastal Maine, leisurely
browsing through book barns and antique bookstores remains as much
a part of the Pine Tree State experience as a bracing dip in the
Atlantic Ocean or eating lobster in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, for instance, which has a resident population of about
10,000, boasts four large antiquarian bookstores, more than many
good-sized American cities can claim. The steady stream of
potential book buyers driving up and down Route 1 _ also known as
the Post Road and, in effect, the town's main street _ is probably
a prime reason for the unusual concentration of book dealers here.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has another attraction for those buyers and sellers: its
long stretches of sandy beach. Browsing for used books or antiques
on cold or rainy non-beach days is an old coastal Maine custom, and
in Wells, beaches and bookstores are practically next to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to live by the ocean,'' says Harding, who
moved here 20 years ago from Nashua and opened Douglas N. Harding
Rare Books, now the largest antiquarian bookshop in southern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious old depot contains about 90,000 volumes, ranging
from paperback novels to hard-to-find books on specialized
subjects, including 19th-century guidebooks, antique children's
books, town and family histories, and first editions of works by
Maine authors. He also stocks a large selection of maps and prints,
the latter mostly of New England maritime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The sign outside the nearby Book Barn, located at the
intersection of Route 1 and South Street, advertises: ``Books Rare,
Medium, and Well Done.'' The Book Barn, operated by Harry and Ann
Polizzi, delivers on the boast with an eclectic collection of
roughly 40,000 volumes. Most are general interest fiction or
nonfiction, including paperback books ideal for beach blanket
reading. Stephen King fans will not leave empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The Book Barn also sells autographs and comic books and has a
good collection of works by Maine writers, particularly those who
lived in the immediate area and wrote about it. ``There is a lot of
interest now in writers like Sarah Orne Jewett and Kenneth
Roberts,'' Ann Polizzi says. Jewett wrote the classic ``The Country
of the Pointed Fir,'' an evocative collection of short stories
about late-19th-century coastal Maine. Roberts titled one of his
bestsellers ``Arundel,'' the original name of Wells's neighbor
Kennebunk.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast Books and Art, owned by Merv and KayeSlotnick, is on
Depot Street (Route 109), just east of Route 1. Housed in a
two-story, 1840s farmhouse, it has a varied collection of about
20,000 books, but is particularly strong on American history and
art books. The store also sells paintings by artists from Maine and
around the country, and letters and autographs. Another sideline is
ephemera, printed items intended to be used only once such as
wedding invitations, theater programs, and posters advertising
concerts or sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War is very hot these days,'' Kaye Slotnick reports.
``There is a great demand for letters written during it that
mention historical events, and it doesn't matter if they're not
written by famous people.'' There is always steady demand, she
adds, for first editions of works by Jewitt, Roberts, and King, as
well as other nationally known Maine writers like Ruth Moore
(``Spoonhandle'') and Gladys Hastings Carroll (``As the Earth
Turns'').
</P>
<P>
   The literary Holy Grail sought by many Maine book browsers, by
the way, is a first edition, now quite rare, of Stephen King's
first published novel, ``Carrie,'' set in the high school of a
small Maine town. When he wrote it, King was an impoverished
schoolteacher living in a trailer with his young family.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth antiquarian bookstore in town is The Arringtons, run
by George and Eleanor Arrington and occupying a 19th-century
building on Route 1 that once housed a general store. The
Arringtons has some general books and vintage paperbacks, as well
as antique postcards, but most of the nearly 20,000 volumes on its
shelves are on military subjects. ``I have hard-to-find unit
histories and British military books,'' George Arrington says,
``and a lot of both nonfiction and fiction about the Vietnam War,
World Wars I and II, and the Civil and Revolutionary wars.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington is one bookseller who believes the Internet is more
blessing than curse for a small niche bookstore like his. ``I think
it's great, because now I can locate books all over the world,'' he
says. ``I just bought a bunch of stuff from Latvia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibliophiles may have trouble leaving Wells, but there are good
used-book stores all along the Maine coast, some of them a Maine
experience all by themselves. For instance, the states's
self-proclaimed ``largest antiquarian book dealer'' is _ and this
is not a joke _ Big Chicken Barn Books and Antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Located on the south side of Route 3 between Bucksport and
Ellsworth, just south of Bar Harbor, Big Chicken _ which occupies
the cleaned-up cavernous main building of a defunct poultry
breeding company _ is more book coop than book barn. Into its
21,000 square feet of space are packed some 100,000 books on
assorted subjects as well as a variety of antiques and
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Where chickens used to nest and lay and cluck, book buffs and
antiquers now happily browse.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's good news for the 7 million people expected to apply for
a passport this year. In many cities there is a new automated
telephone appointment system that makes getting a last-minute
passport easy. And for those not in a rush, the passport agency has
added more local post offices to obtain or renew a passport.
</P>
<P>
   Passport agencies that have installed the automated appointment
system include New York, Boston, Miami, Los Angeles, Washington,
Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you are traveling internationally within the next 14 days, or
need a passport quickly for visa purposes, you'll be able to
schedule an appointment 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Appointments will be verified upon arrival at the Passport
Agency. Travelers must present acceptable evidence of their US
citizenship such as a certified birth certificate, previous US
passport, or naturalization certificate, and valid identification
such as a driver's license.
</P>

   Memories are an important part of any vacation. And one of the
best souvenirs of a visit can be a video of the area. Offering a
very positive and colorful image of this region is ``New England: A
Tribute.'' This 49-minute video covers the region from the Pilgrim
landing at Plymouth to the fall foliage in Vermont and New
Hampshire. It's a great video for those who haven't been to the
area as it highlights the history, beauty, foods, and attractions.
Besides Pilgrims, you'll learn about witches, the sea, lobsters,
and famous authors. The video is part of the Tribute Series, which
includes Tuscany and Umbria, Mexico, California, St. Petersburg,
and Indiana. The videos are produced by Jim and John Hilgendorf.
``My idea was to begin a series of beautiful films that would build
bridges of understanding and appreciation between different peoples
of the world,'' said Jim Hilgendorf. The videos are $24.95 each
plus $3 shipping from The Tribute Series, PO Box 641056, Los
Angeles, CA 90064; telephone 310-444-9255 or visit

RULES HAVE CHANGED IN THE CLUBHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Not so long ago, Mo Vaughn was the Red Sox'
best everyday player and club leader. Playing for the Anaheim
Angels, 3,000 miles from Fenway, he is removed from the inner
workings of the Red Sox clubhouse, but he knows what would have
happened if a teammate disrespected manager Jimy Williams when he
was around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want that to happen,'' said Vaughn, who homered
his first time up against the Red Sox Monay night. ``You have to
try to put those fires out. We've had situations here, you put the
fire out. In my clubhouse, we don't need any of that. That's just
the way I would handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett's apologists _ and they are legion, because this
guy can really play _ invent excuses for most of his tirades, but
it's hard to find anyone who'll condone what Everett did after his
Saturday morning shouting match with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Jurassic Carl stormed out of the manager's
office, walked through the Sox clubhouse, and yelled, ``I never
liked that guy in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   There. This time, it wasn't a sportswriter or an umpire. It was
Everett's own manager. And Everett blurted out the remark in the
presence of several reporters and a good number of teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, I have to respect my manager,'' said Vaughn. ``I
don't know what transpired there this year, but I know Jimy. We had
a great relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox went to the World Series 14 years ago, Don
Baylor was the team leader and matters were handled firmly and
internally. Certain behavior was not tolerated. Actions had
consequences. It was the same when Vaughn was around. Ballplayers
policed themselves. There was accountability. It's different now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know him but he's too good a player to be
getting in those type of situations,'' Vaughn said of Everett. ``As
much as you can, in Boston you want the fans and media on your side
because even when things are going well, it's tough over there.
Just go play your game and leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clubhouse leadership, like clubhouse karma, is probably
overrated, but the Sox seemed more cohesive when Vaughn and Mike
Stanley were around. Pedro Martinez and Nomar Garciaparra are the
two best players, but Pedro plays only once every five days and
Nomar keeps to himself and leads by example _ playing 100 percent
every second of every game. This will have to do. Perhaps it is
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Williams continues to take the high road, but what
kind of a team allows this stuff to go unchecked? Everett plays
every day, shows up when he wants to show up, blames the media for
his tantrums, and Sox management continues to give him the double
thumbs-up. Just Carl being competitive, you know. It's the media
that makes him into a monster, right?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a deal has been struck. Everett has emerged as the new
Albert Belle, but as long as he can put up Triple Crown-type
numbers, he will be tolerated and applauded by Dan Duquette and
most fans at ``Friendly Fenway.'' And the Sox will pledge to keep
things ``in house.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Carl took it out of the house and put it on
national television when he went after umpire Ronald Kulpa. And how
he has publicly ripped his manager, who is forced to act as if he
doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were there claim Jimy cared quite a bit Saturday when
he was giving it right back to Everett behind closed doors. This
should help the manager's already high stock in the clubhouse. But
where's the backing from Duquette, who actually joked that maybe
Carl ought to yell at Jimy every day if he can follow it up with a
3-for-5 performance?
</P>
<P>
   Also, where was the ``in house'' attitude when the Sox asked Mo
to undergo alcohol evaluation? Why was Vaughn a bad guy who had to
go, while Carl is emerging as top candidate for BoSox Club ``Man of
the Year''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Times were different,'' Vaughn said. ``I don't know what
happened with me or what reason. I haven't been over there, but one
thing I do know, it's a tough enough job to play over there without
any extracurricular activity.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sox fans the good news is that the Duke is being careful
about who is worthy of wearing the Sox uniform. Boston passed on
Jose Canseco, allowing the Yankees to grab the goofy, aging, and
oft-injured slugger. The Sox don't want Jose's type polluting the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Carl? He's OK. The guy is hitting .319 with 27 homers and 76
RBIs, for gosh sake.

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, notes from the wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rumors citing the demise of every top boss in World Championship
Wrestling are everywhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Siegel, Eric Bischoff, Vince Russo and a host of wrestlers
have all been fired, quit or been moved, according to reports on
the Internet. What WCW is saying? Nothing. No comment. But Vince
Russo's interview on Monday's `Nitro' did shed some light on his
activity with WCW over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously didn't understand how political WCW was or at least
did not understand his position and did not have the backing he
expected from management. The most interesting thing from the
interview was that Russo would like to get John Rocker in the ring
in Long Island, N.Y., for ``Starcade.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect that, but here are some things you can expect:
</P>
<P>
   1. Goodbye Lex Luger and Roddy Piper. You haven't seen him on
televion and you won't see him back with WCW unless they take a
major pay cut. Piper's dismissal may be a bad move as he is still
good for getting the younger wrestlers over, but no one will miss
the stiff working Luger. WCW needs to trim payroll desperately.
</P>
<P>
   2. No more television for Bischoff and Russo. Bischoff has been
off the air since Kimberly Page left the fold. His role behind the
camera will continue to be a vacant as his role in front of the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   3. No more Hulk Hogan ... at least in 2000. Hogan's contract
makes it difficult for WCW to make money on pay-per-views given he
must have a percentage. So, don't expect Hogan at any more
pay-per-views and therefore any television.
</P>
<P>
   4. More Booker T, Lance Storm, Shane Douglas, Mike Awesome,
Billy Kidman, etc. The new, cheaper wrestlers will be the
foundation for the WCW in 2001. But if WCW thinks Booker T is the
man, they need to think again. When he tagged with Sting and Kronic
last week, Sting was the one who the fans cheered loudest. WCW
should be hanging its hat on Lance Storm, who should be the
second-coming of Bret Hart.
</P>
<P>
   5. Speaking of Hart, it seems his career is over. It is fast
approaching one year since he stepped in the ring and the
concussion that has kept him from wrestling does not seem to be
improving. With his WCW deal set to expire soon, both sides may
quietly choose to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   6. Whoo!! One last time. Ric Flair will begin a farewell tour
when he returns from shoulder surgery sometime in October. Expect
the 15-time champion to get the gold one last time before he hangs
it up next year when his autobiography is expect to hit the
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Love has been in the air at the World Wrestling Federation.
Both the Undertaker and Chris Jericho were part of injury angles so
they could take some time off for their honeymoons. Undertaker was
married on July 21st and was ``injured'' on the ``Raw'' show on the
24th. Jericho was married on July 30 and was ``injured'' on
``Smackdown'' which taped on the 25th. Jericho's wedding was huge
news in Winnipeg, where it was held. The Winnipeg Sun ran a front
page story on the marriage of Manitoba's sexiest man to long-time
girlfriend Jessica Lockhart. In attendance were Don Callis
(Gangrel), Billy Kidman, Lance Storm, Edge, Christian and Disco
Inferno.
</P>
<P>
   _ The WWF will be filling your newsstand in the coming months.
September's WWF The Magazine features Edge and Christian on the
cover. And also has articles on Kane, X-Pac and Trish Stratus. The
WWF is also planning on releasing a special magazine on The Rock.
The magazine is scheduled for release on Sept. 18. Finally the WWF
King of The Ring video will be in stores on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   _ With Raven expected to join the WWF in September, the former
ECW and WCW star should have another similar gimmick to the Raven's
Flock. How will fill out the list of followers? A good guess at
this point would be demoted WWF wrestlers Gangrel and Viscera,
Perry Saturn (who is in desperate need for a good gimmick) and
maybe recent signee Sickboy, who was with Raven at WCW. Expect the
trimmed (he's lost over 50 pounds) Paul Bearer to be the
mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   _ The weekly ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin return watch is saying
the Rattlesnake may have a role as a referee or enforcer at
``SummerSlam.'' It's doubtful, a late fall return is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   _ The latest news on Billy Gunn has the former DXer returning to
the ring from rotator cuff surgery Sept. 24.

SENIORS ARE TRAVELING MORE, TAKING MORE ACTIVE VACATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life begins at 50. Sure, many fear turning the Big Five-Oh, but
for travelers 50 is nifty and 60 is even better.
</P>
<P>
   If 50 is so good, why is 60 even better? Simple, that's when the
discounts begin, and for growing numbers when early retirement
begins allowing more time to hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   In the travel world, senior or ``mature,'' as some tour
companies like to say, now begins as early as age 50. The best
deals, though, begin at 60, 62, or 65. So, accept your senior
status and realize your travel power as more and more tour firms,
and destinations, court you with deals. And don't think just
because you've reached senior status, you're over the hill. Active
or adventure travel is the fastest growing senior travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators are redefining their programs to cater to this
growing market. According to the National Tour Association, the
mature travel market is more independent, leans toward cruising,
has special interests, and is fitness-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Another growing area for mature travelers is ``grandtravel'' _
grandparents taking their grandchildren. There's even a travel
agency, Grandtravel, in Maryland (800-247-7651 or
www.grandtravel.com) that offers trips with grandchildren that
range from national parks to African safaris.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Hotels, recognizing the growing trend of grandparents
traveling with grandchildren, has just introduced a new package at
14 of its hotels in the United States and Canada. Loews offers a
``Generation G'' program with features such as an adjoining room at
reduced rates, a take-home memory album, a phone card (to call
parents and others), an ``In Grand Style Package'' designed for
teens with behind-the-scenes sports and cultural tours, and even a
Grand Adventure Package with customized adventures for those 10 and
older. (Also included is a goodie bag with helpful ``Tips for
Successful Grandparent Travel.'') For more information, call
800-23-LOEWS or visit www.loewshotels.com.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott says it will have a grand destination for grandtravel
beginning Sept. 22 when its Marriott Village at Little Lake Bryan
near Orlando, Fla., opens. Located near Disney World, the village
includes three Marriott hotels under one roof (Courtyard, Fairfield
Inn, and SpringHill Suites). Among amenities are refrigerators in
all rooms, a food court, a 24-hour convenience store, free
transportation to Disney parks, and guest laundry. Pre-opening
rates begin at $69 a room. Mariott notes a recent survey rated
Orlando the number one destination for grandparents to take
grandchildren. (For a copy of the Orlando Visitors Guide and Mature
Travel Discount Brochure, call 800-972-3308.) For Marriott
information, call 877-682-8552 or visit www.marriott-village.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even seniors traveling alone find Disney World a place for the
young at heart. Walt Disney once said that Disney World was
designed for those from ``3 to 93,'' which still appears true.
``I've noticed that seniors are more willing to take the time
visiting our parks to breathe in the total experience,'' said Greg
Emmer, vice president of the Magic Kingdom. ``They enjoy the
storytelling we do through architecture, music, background sound,
and aromas.'' Disney officials note that seniors seem to appreciate
attractions like River Country, which reminds many of places they
knew growing up, and activities ranging from tennis and fishing to
dancing to the sounds of top bands. And for seniors for whom the
spirit is willing but the feet aren't, motorized self-drive
vehicles may be rented.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors 55 and older can also join the Magic Kingdom Club and
obtain discounted admission prices to Disney parks and reduced
rates at Disney resort hotels. Call 800-89-DISNEY for information.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Circle Travel, a Boston-based firm that has been in
business for more than 40 years catering to senior travel, also
owns Overseas Adventure Travel, a 20-year veteran in adventure
tours, and Vermont Bicycle Touring, a 27-year-old pioneer in bike
tours in New England and elsewhere. These purchases by Grand Circle
reflect the changing interests of the ``mature'' travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Travel has become a passion for many 50-plus travelers. One
senior wrote to Grand Circle saying ,``Never mind that I have spent
my children's inheritance. I have seen the Great Wall, viewed the
Taj Mahal, and rode a camel to the pyramids. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to break the bank or mortgage the future to
enjoy travel. Many seniors are finding their disposable income is
up, and the cost of travel is down. Elderhostel, a nonprofit
organization, which specializes in learning tours around the world,
has proved that a great tour doesn't have to cost a fortune. While
learning is a key part of the tours, no prior formal knowledge of
the program is required. Elderhostel says, ``All that is required
is an open, inquisitive, mature mind.'' Most programs in North
America are a week long, and elsewhere last up to four weeks with
weeklong stays at one or more sites.
</P>
<P>
   Interhostel, another international study/travel program
sponsored by the University of New Hampshire, utilizes colleges and
their facilities around the world to help cut costs. ``Our major
concern is the educational component. We try to provide a good
overview of the host country: its history, culture, and what makes
the local people tick,'' said Carol Bense, Interhostel manager.
``We want every person who participates to say, `Wow, I never knew
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers, even those just 50 years old, will find discounts on
accommodations, dining, entrance fees, rental cars, and more if
they ask. While most discounts are for those 60 or older, it still
pays to ask. Seniors, and others, should also take advantage of
savings offered by organizations such as AAA or the American
Association of Retired Persons. There are publications keyed to the
older traveler: The Mature Traveler is a newsletter that has been
around for some time, and is filled with deals and information. A
recent issue mentioned joining Servas (212-267-0252), which
promotes peace through visiting and offers stays with members
around the world. Travel 50 &AMP; Beyond is a quarterly magazine with
information ranging from deals to health matters. Arthur Frommer's
Budget Travel is a monthly magazine with good deals for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Many airlines offer discounts of 10 percent or special fares for
those 62 and older on many flights (companions can be any age on
most lines). Some airlines such as Virgin, British Air, Air Canada,
and Canadian have lower fares for those 60 and older. Amtrak offers
those 62 and older 15 percent discounts on most trains; Rail Europe
offers seniors 60 and older various discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another way seniors save is to stay in one place. Untours, a
Pennsylvania company, has been specializing in two-week stays in
private homes or apartments in Europe and elsewhere for years. The
company makes all the arrangements, even has a local representative
to help in touring and any problems. Collette Tours, a Pawtucket,
R.I. , firm that has been in business 80 years, now features ``hub
and spoke'' programs, which focus on a smaller area and longer
stays at one or two places in the region rather than covering a lot
of ground and moving from hotel to hotel daily.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises are a growing area for seniors, and are definitely no
longer just for the sedentary crowd. Saga Holidays, another
Boston-based firm that specializes in travel for those 50 and
older, has its own cruise ship, the Saga Rose, the former Cunard
Sagafjord, and carries 583 passengers at least 50 years of age. The
company specializes in packages for mature travelers who ``want to
venture off the beaten path without sacrificing comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Another idea for senior travel is to volunteer your time in
service projects. Elderhostel now features service programs where
hostelers ``learn by doing'' with organizations such as Global
Volunteers, which has programs just about everywhere.

THIS `MILLENNIUM' HAS AN ABRUPT FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is most unfortunate that racing fans in the United States
never got the chance to see Dubai Millennium race in the flesh.
Considered the fastest horse in the world, Dubai Millennium
fractured his right rear cannon bone while working out at Newmarket
Saturday, and has been retired to stud following surgery to insert
three screws in his leg.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old son of Seeking The Gold, Dubai Millennium won 9 of
10 starts for the Godolphin Stable of Sheik Mohammed of Dubai.
Dubai Millennium was originally named Yaazar, but Mohammed was so
confident the horse would capture the Dubai World Cup in March that
he changed his name for the occasion. Dubai Millennium came through
with a breathtaking front-running score of 6 lengths to justify the
faith of his owner.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Dubai Millennium tasted defeat, he could not
handle the 1 1/2 miles of last year's Epsom Derby, finishing ninth.
However, he had been impressive in all of his other starts, most
recently in another eye-catching tally as he romped home by 8
lengths in the Prince Of Wales at Ascot June 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can wait 20 years and never get a horse like this,'' said
Mohammed. ``I have never seen or owned a horse like him with the
way he trains and the way he looks. He is quite outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember him as the best horse I've ridden,'' said
regular jockey Frankie Dettori. ``Hopefully, his offspring will be
as good as him.''
</P>
<P>
   The American audience lost out, because the sheik's major goal
was to win the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs
Nov. 4. In fact, the situation was really heating up, as Mohammed
had challenged Michael Tabor to a $6 million match race, Dubai
Millennium vs. Tabor's Montjeu. The challenge was issued the day
before Dubai Millennium was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Montjeu, who won last year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, had
scored an easy victory in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth
Diamond Stakes July 29, and Tabor had suggested that the horses
meet in the Irish Championship Stakes at the Curragh Sept. 9,
saying, ``It's what the public would like to see.'' Mohammed
responded by saying that he had already planned two other prep
races for Dubai Millennium, adding, ``Why didn't Montjeu come to
Ascot last month (for the Prince Of Wales)? He is most welcome to
take us on in the Breeders' Cup, and I will even pay his entry
fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed was criticized in the press for not accepting Tabor's
invitation, and the sheik is not fond of criticism. He then
suggested the match race, to be run at 1 1/4 miles, with each side
putting up $6 million, the purse of the Dubai World Cup, under
winner-take-all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Dubai Millennium's injury put an end to all that. So now we'll
just have to wait until the Breeders' Cup to find out who really is
the fastest horse in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Lemon Drop' was sweet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The events of the weekend clarified the handicap picture, with
Lemon Drop Kid emerging as the undisputed leader of the pack via
his victory in the Whitney at Saratoga, but further muddied the
already murky 3-year-old scene, as there were upsets in the Haskell
at Monmouth and the Jim Dandy at The Spa.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, who has turned into a monster since blinkers
were added to his equipment, defeated Behrens and Golden Missile,
his two top challengers for postseason honors, in the Whitney. The
4-year-old son of Kingmombo, who has now won the Brooklyn, the
Suburban, and the Whitney since trainer Scotty Schulhofer put the
blinkers on him, has become a legitimate candidate for Horse of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he's at the top of his game, and all we have to
do is keep him healthy and strong,'' said Schulhofer. ``There is a
month to the Woodward, then a month to the Jockey Club Gold Cup,
and three weeks to the Breeders' Cup. He's the best horse I've ever
trained. I've had a lot of good ones, but he's the best.''

   The Whitney made Lemon Drop Kid the winner of the ``NTRA
Champions on Fox'' series, which earned his connections $230,000.
Lemon Drop Kid received a flat $100,000 bonus for best performance
in the 20-race series, and another $130,000 based on his
accumulated points.

   While Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Preakness winner Red
Bullet remain in hiding, Dixie Union won Sunday's $1 million
Haskell, paying $11.40, and Graeme Hall took Saturday's Jim Dandy,
the prep for the $1 million Travers Aug. 26, at $13.80.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union has made a recovery from knee chips that he suffered
in last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile. If he has fully returned to
his 2-year-old form, look out. Graeme Hall, who flipped his palate
and had to be eased in the Kentucky Derby, is an in-and-outer, but
when he's on, he's very strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the best 2-year-old around last year, but
then he chipped his knee in the Breeders' Cup,'' said Richard
Mandella, trainer of Dixie Union. ``We're looking at the Travers,
but that depends on how he comes out of the Jim Dandy. If the race
sets him back, we wouldn't go. If he's OK, we'd love to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give the horse credit, he ran every step of the
way,'' said Todd Pletcher, trainer of Graeme Hall. ``Obviously,
when you win the Jim Dandy, the Travers is the race you're pointing
for. As long as he comes out of this in good shape, that's where
we're heading.''

SUN SETS ON WEST'S NBA CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As testament to the impact Jerry West made before his 40-year
NBA career concluded Monday, unrestrained praise came from
colleagues and former bitter rivals alike. Their comments added to
a list of accomplishments that already spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry West was the best player to ever become a general
manager,'' said Red Auerbach, who faced West as coach of the
Celtics' championship run during the 1960s. ``He's a good friend of
mine and a great player. He was very persistent. He's always kind
of been a winner. I always liked him because he's a hard worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the old saying, `If you want something done right, do
it yourself.' He would do it himself. He took the blame. I think
the league's going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   West, 62, retired from his position as head of basketball
operations for the Los Angeles Lakers, leaving behind an impressive
legacy that includes seven NBA titles (one as a player, two as a
consultant, four as GM), Hall of Fame enshrinement, and 14 All-Star
appearances. Since becoming the Lakers' No. 1 draft pick (second
overall) in 1960, West has been one of the pillars of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Earning the nickname ``Mr. Clutch'' as an indomitable guard,
West led Los Angeles to nine NBA finals and the 1971-72 league
title. During three seasons as a coach, West compiled a 145-101
record. As general manager since 1982 and executive vice president
of basketball operations since 1995, he constructed teams that
appeared in the postseason 17 times, won four championships, and
posted a 972-472 record, and he earned 1995 Executive of the Year
honors.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter released by the Lakers, West addressed fans and
thanked them for their support over the past four decades: ``This
is a difficult yet happy time for me personally as I retire my
position with the Los Angeles Lakers and enter another period of my
life, one that will allow me more freedom to enjoy my friends and
particularly my family, unburdened with the pressures of
professional athletic business . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been blessed with the privilege to play for and work
for the best athletic franchise in all of sports, and I will always
treasure the experience. As I watch their progress with great
interest and pride, I will remain their biggest fan.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Mitch Kupchak will succeed West, and Kurt Rambis
will serve as assistant general manager. Owner Jerry Buss, however,
recognized that the retirement leaves a large void in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Jerry West is irreplaceable,'' said Buss. ``What
he's meant to the Lakers' franchise over the past 40 years is
immeasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of rival Celtics teams, whose dominance in the 1960s
kept West from winning more than one championship ring as a player,
complimented his skill as a player and intelligence as an
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for an athlete to feel any compassion for an
opponent,'' said Celtics Hall of Famer Bob Cousy. ``But with Elgin
(Baylor) and Jerry, after we won four or five, I started to think
in my heart of hearts that those guys deserved one.''
</P>
<P>
   Said fellow Hall of Famer K.C. Jones, ``He's shown genius and
intelligence and high perfectionism being a general manager. I have
high praise for this man and great respect.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 2-guard with outstanding quickness and long arms, West was
a threat both offensively and defensively. His shooting prowess
puts him at or near the top in several NBA all-time scoring
categories. A career scoring average of 27.0 places West fourth in
NBA history. His playoff scoring average of 29.1 ranks second,
behind only Michael Jordan. With 25,192 points, he is the Lakers'
all-time leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you weren't ready to play, he just dominated,'' said
another Celtics great, Jo Jo White. ``When you played the Lakers,
you thought about it in the games leading up to it, knowing you had
to face this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear you might feel was when the game was on the line and
you were facing him. That's why they called him `Mr. Clutch' _
because he knew when to take a shot, what shot to take, plus he
could shoot. Jerry would shoot the high-percentage shot every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult move of West's career may have been his last
_ leaving the NBA behind.

SIMMONS TRYING HARD NOT TO DROP OUT OF SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ There was no shortage of candidates for
poster boy of the sadly underachieving 1999 Patriot offense, from
oft-predictable offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, to
oft-confused quarterback Drew Bledsoe, to slow tight ends who
seldom got open, to runners who didn't run and blockers who didn't
block.
</P>
<P>
   But wide receiver Tony Simmons seemed the perfect symbol of
everything that went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Simmons was not a key player, his breathtaking fall
from being a young player with high hopes and huge promise at the
start of the season to being a forgotten liability at the end was
symbolic of the entire offense.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons did not run precise routes. He at times would leisurely
run out of bounds inside the first-down marker instead of turning
upfield and fighting for extra yards, a la teammate Troy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Simmons dropped key passes, most notably in the
final two minutes against the Jets in Foxborough when Bledsoe hit
him with a perfect pass on a fourth-and-33. A week later, in Miami
against the Dolphins, Simmons dropped a long pass over the middle
in the second half that stalled another key drive that might have
turned a defeat into a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Like the offense in general, Simmons could not be trusted to
make the play that had to be made. So he was virtually banished,
catching only two passes in the final 10 games. Only a year
earlier, the speedy Simmons had been seen as the perfect complement
to deep threat Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot out of me,'' Simmons said Monday of his
banishment to special teams in the last half of the 1999 season.
``Last year I wasn't really prepared for playing that much on
special teams.'' Which Simmons quickly proved by fumbling the
opening kickoff in a ragged 24-9 loss to Philadelphia in December.
</P>
<P>
   But what had sent him to special teams were those earlier
dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never dropped a pass like that,'' Simmons said of the
drop against the Jets. ``It was the last play of the game (for the
Patriots' offense) and we were trying keep it going. I knew I
should have caught it. But I just didn't catch it. I did everything
fundamentally right, I looked it in and everything, but I just
didn't hold onto the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he was shocked by the drop, that ``in college (at
Wisconsin) I was always called on to make plays like that and I
never dropped a pass like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his confidence was shaken enough that he dropped the
next key pass to him, the following week against the Dolphins.
After that, Simmons seldom was sent onto the field in key
situations.
</P>
<P>
   In his rookie season of 1998, Simmons had caught 23 passes for 3
touchdowns and a gaudy 20.6 yards-per-catch average. He was seen as
a receiver with huge potential. Last season, though, his numbers
drooped to 19 catches for 2 TDs and a 14.5-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Zampese is gone, Simmons repeated words that defensive
backs in Miami, Buffalo, Indianapolis, and New York had said last
season about the Patriot pass offense: It was very predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most defenses knew what I was going to do _ that I was going
to go deep,'' said Simmons. ``They'd say, `That's his thing; he's
going deep.' So they'd have somebody play deep on me and stuff and
I'd run past them and we'd have somebody come up underneath me and
catch a nice flag route. That was the scheme, and (defenses)
schemed it perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   That Simmons dropped those passes, that he didn't catch a pass
at all in the final five games, that he no longer is looked upon as
a receiver with huge potential, is all beside the point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all in the past,'' said Simmons. ``And I don't really
want to look in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And the future? Can he regain the form of his rookie year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get back to that, but I don't really want to get back to
it,'' said Simmons. ``I want to be better than that. That's my
goal. I'm trying to look forward to something better than my rookie
year. OK, rookie year I had a good season because (other receivers)
got hurt, but I don't want to do that anymore. I want to be in the
offense before that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But before that can happen, Simmons must peel off the label that
was affixed to him after the 1999 season: that his speed cannot
hide a lack of focus and a lack of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can think he can be the NFL's best,'' said Simmons.
``But you've got to do it on the field. Thinking it gives you the
hope for it, but then you've got to do it on the field. And doing
it on the field gives you the confidence.''

FOXBORO STADIUM A BASTION OF PATRIOTISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Guatemala wants to increase its home-field advantage, it
schedules games at intimate stadia in remote locations at midday or
at an elevation that requires oxygen tanks for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The US strategy is similar. For must-win games, the US books a
moribund, concrete-and-steel bowl whose original construction costs
wouldn't pay for a luxury suite at a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Foxboro Stadium has been good to the US national team. The
US has a 4-0-3 record (8-0-4, including women's games) on Route 1.
And even though the US will be heavily favored in next Wednesday's
World Cup qualifier against Barbados, US Soccer Federation
officials want to use every advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They also are seeking a supportive venue for a tough-sell game.
The sense of qualifying drama seems premature since this is only
the third of a possible 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   The US is difficult to cast as an underdog in anything, but the
fact is the team is in last place in Group E and will likely have
to defeat Barbados, Guatemala (Sept. 3 at RFK Stadium), and Costa
Rica (Oct. 11 at Columbus Crew Stadium) to advance to the next
round for the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is hardly a marquee opponent, though the Bajan Rockets
are a potentially fascinating underdog story.
</P>
<P>
   With the Japan/Korea 2002 finals so far off, there is almost a
sense of unreality about these qualifying games. That should change
as the US' home campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Arena plans to make several changes.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Friedel will be the starting goalkeeper and Tony Meola the
backup. Kasey Keller will be allowed to remain with Rayo Vallecano
to ensure he has a chance to earn a starting position. This will
also help Friedel retain his work permit in England, where he is
expected to move from Liverpool to join Joe-Max Moore at crosstown
rival Everton, or rejoin former coach Graeme Souness at Blackburn
Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United's Jeff Agoos and Carlos Llamosa, and possibly
Chicago's C.J. Brown, will bolster the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McBride and Moore could be the starting strikers. McBride
is the leading US scorer at Foxboro Stadium with two goals, both in
a 4-2 win over El Salvador Nov. 16, 1997 _ the last time the US
men's team performed in Massachusetts. And Moore converted 21 goals
at Foxboro as a member of the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   What will the US do, however, when its favorite stadium is
demolished to make way for the new Patriots stadium in 2001?
Probably move right in.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, soccer plays an important part in the new stadium
design. The first event there will be a soccer game, likely a Major
League Soccer match though a better idea might be an exhibition
between, say, the Revolution and the US national team. And there
will be many more soccer games than any other events there,
including NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, atmosphere at soccer games is still created by the
fans themselves, and New England soccer supporters are probably the
most persistent (judging by Revolution crowds) and varied in the
country. They have been pro-US; in 12 dates involving national
teams, attendance has been 416,254. And they have also been
pro-Italy (the Azzurri are 3-0-0 at Foxboro), pro-Ireland (2-1-2 at
Foxboro), pro-Argentina and pro-Colombia (both 2-0-0 at Foxboro),
supportive of Portugal and its club teams, and even El Salvador,
Greece, Mexico, and Nigeria (combined 1-9-1 at Foxboro).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the new venue is completed, the US will be either in
the middle of the final qualifying round or in the midst of a major
crisis. And the old Foxboro Stadium could be remembered either as
the place that launched a three-game US rally or where its 2002
hopes ended.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Future shock
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US will not likely be a candidate for the World Cup soon,
despite setting attendance records in 1994. The principle of a
rotation system starting in 2010 was accepted during the FIFA
Congress, involving all but one of the 204 nations in Zurich last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The US would be relegated deep into that rotation, possibly not
until something like 2034, unless FIFA switches to a biennial
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In this hemisphere, the US would fall in line behind South
America _ probably Brazil _ and possibly Mexico. The rotation
system would be fairer than the current one, which caused such
rancor that South Africa, the 2010 host, called for arbitration
concerning the 2006 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Asian countries are feeling the effects of the 2006 vote, since
the Asians supported Germany over South Africa. The Africans have
vaguely threatened revenge.
</P>
<P>
   And FIFA must now clarify a controversy over the hosting of the
2001 Confederations Cup, envisioned as a trial run for the
Japan/Korea finals. The Japanese said the announcement was ``very
sudden, without any consultation beforehand, neglecting the
Japanese association's independence.''

THE GAP CLOSES: BRACES NOT ONLY FOR THE YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Betty DeSimone never laughed without covering her mouth. Her
overbite made her so self-conscious that she used her hands to
cover her teeth. Then, at age 38, she decided to get braces.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I smile now I know that what people see are beautiful,
straight teeth,'' said the Boston dental office manager, now 52.
</P>
<P>
   DeSimone is part of a revolution at orthodontists' offices, as
grown-ups join youngsters in getting braces _ ond often the
nickname ``metal mouth.'' According to the American Association of
Orthodontists, more than 1 million people over the age of 18 in the
United States and Canada wear braces or other orthodontic
``appliances,'' making up 20 percent of all orthodontia patients.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the young, who have embraced braces as a kind of fashion
statement, though, adults still have to swallow some pride when
they join the children in the waiting room. Even the explosion in
the number of celebrities who have worn braces _ from Brett Favre
of the Green Bay Packers to tennis player Zina Garrison and singers
Diana Ross and Cher _ makes many adults feel only slightly less
awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference between getting them when you're young and
old is that everyone has them when you're young, and it's not a big
deal,'' said Barbi Pecenco, 26, who endured taunts of ``jaws'' from
some co-workers when she wore braces a year ago. ``But when you're
older, people look at you twice.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of adults shelling out $3,500 to $5,500 for
orthodontic care underscores Americans' growing emphasis on health
and self-improvement. People want to look and feel better, and they
realize that a winning smile can mean better self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing orthodontics is like what women are going through with
cosmetic surgery,'' said Dr. Donald Feldman, an orthodontist in
East Boston. People ``want to feel better about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cutter, age 29, got his white, ceramic braces about four
weeks ago. He wanted them as a teenager, but didn't think his teeth
were bad enough. When his father offered to pay for them, he jumped
at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure vanity, I guess,'' said Cutter, who does public
relations in Framingham, Mass. ``I decided, why not close up the
gaps and straighten everything out?''
</P>
<P>
   Vanity is not the only reason that adults in their 30s, 40s and
50s are now so willing to endure the ``tinsel teeth'' look. Today's
braces are also less expensive (in relative terms, anyway), less
ugly and more effective than the braces of old.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cost of getting braces has gone up at least 50
percent since 1980 _ when the average treatment cost about $2,200 _
the price has not risen as swiftly as inflation. As a result, the
real cost of braces is actually declining as the robust economy is
giving people more money to spend on cosmetic procedures. Most
orthodontists are willing to stretch out payments, and insurance
plans sometimes help pay the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Age has never been a bar to getting braces, orthodontists say.
Although associated with young, growing mouths, braces can correct
underbites, close gaps and straighten teeth in people of any age.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the surrounding, supporting tissue is healthy, we
can move teeth in any way,'' said Feldman. ``The only limiting
factor is if someone has a tremendous amount of bone loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Morevoer, the braces and other appliances of today simply work
and look better than before. Because of advances in orthdontics,
adult patients can be treated in less time, with appliances that
are less obtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the traditional, metal mouth look,'' said Dr.
Richard Ulbrich, an orthodontist in Wellesley, Mass. ``Technology
has made it much more patient-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most adults choose to have small metal and ceramic,
tooth-colored brackets bonded to the front surface of the teeth, or
so-called ``invisible'' braces, called linguals, applied to the
back of the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   However, many orthodontists say that the lingual braces are not
as efficient or as easy to work with. More popular in Europe than
here, they can impede speech and cost up to twice as much as
regular braces.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice, nickel-titanium wires, made from an alloy
developed by NASA, are more elastic, which results in reduced
discomfort related to tooth movement and increased time (6-8 weeks)
between orthodontics appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The ceramic braces ``are smooth. They're not sharp. The new
wires they have move their teeth quicker, using a lighter, gentler
force,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   For adult patients who don't want brackets or wires, a procedure
called invisalign straightens teeth with a series of clear,
customized removable appliances called aligners. The procedure
costs slightly more than traditional braces, and the length of
treatment is virtually the same.
</P>
<P>
   But for adults who aren't shy about being temporary ``metal
mouths,'' many choose to wear the colorful, rubber bands favored by
children. Feldman said that in his office, after a couple of months
with ceramic braces, 40 percent of the adults opt for the colored
bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are no longer self conscious about wearing the
appliances,'' he said. ``They just want to end up with the best
possible results in the shortest period of time. How they look with
the appliances doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who want an instant, post-braces smile can see an esthetic
dentist for ``accelerated orthodontics,'' a technique that reshapes
and bonds the teeth, covering them with a thin, porcelain veneer.
The procedure can be completed in two to three visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the Hollywood stars and models, many times it
looks like they have perfectly natural teeth, but many times they
have porcelain veneers,'' said Dr. Thomas Orent of the Center for
Esthetic Dentistry in Framingham. ``The results are absolutely
gorgeous. In many cases, the results are better than braces.''
</P>
<P>
   But Orent is quick not to dismiss braces. He offers almost 95
percent of his patients braces first.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cosmetic benefits of a million-dollar smile, there
are major dental health benfits of straighter teeth, orthodontists
say. They are easier to clean, which decreases the chance of
periodontal disease, cavities and tooth loss. Correction of an
overbite decreases the risk of wearing down the teeth when chewing
and biting.
</P>
<P>
   Getting braces ``is the best thing I've ever done,'' said
Antonella Dalessio, 24. ``I actually smile now, and before I
didn't. Whether you get them when you're young or older, I'd say
they're very well worth it.''

<P>
   It had been dubbed the ``Holy Grail of genetics'' _ the gene
causing the horrendous inherited killer, Huntington's disease. And
in 1993, when scientists finally found the gene after an exhaustive
10-year effort, hopes soared among researchers and families.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the champagne flowed, some scientists believed that,
with the mutant gene in hand, new ways of stalling or curing the
disabling brain degeneration wouldn't be far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was huge excitement because everyone figured, `We have
the gene; we'll just crack it,' '' said Dr. Jang-Ho Cha, a
Huntington's disease researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital.
``But here we are in the year 2000, and we still haven't cracked
it.'' He added, ``I'm tired of saying to patients, `there's nothing
we can offer you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointed hopes of the victims of Huntington's disease
and their loved ones serve as a cautionary tale for the Age of
Genomics. As much as scientists have learned in the last decade
about the human genetic blueprint, they still face enormous
difficulty in curing even the simplest genetic disease: one caused
by a single defective gene.
</P>
<P>
   And it serves as an antidote to the euphoria surrounding the
announcement in July that scientists had mapped all 3.1 billion
biochemical ``letters'' of human DNA, the complete instructions for
operating a fully functional human being.
</P>
<P>
   The immense gene-mapping project was designed to make it easier
to locate disease-causing genes in DNA. But it is becoming
increasingly clear that going from finding the gene to devising a
treatment is a long, rough road.
</P>
<P>
   For example, mapping the gene that causes cystic fibrosis,
discovered in 1990, has failed so far to produce a treatment. Nor
has the finding of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in 1986
helped sufferers of that lethal malady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something may come from that, but I would be very surprised''
if biotech companies using genome information to find disease genes
``made a big killing in the next 10, 20 or 50 years,'' said Dr.
David Waltz, assistant director of the cystic fibrosis unit at
Children's Hospital. He noted that since the cystic fibrosis gene
was found, all efforts to treat the lung disease by transferring
new genes into lung cells have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 10 years to study (the mutant gene), and we know now
that there's more we don't know than we know,'' said Waltz.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the gene for a disease is a bit like tracing a glitch in
a car to a certain part. If you don't know what the part normally
does or why its malfunction makes the car fail to run, fixing it
can take a very long time. And with diseases like Huntington's, it
appears that the main disease gene is influenced by still other
genes whose roles are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Waltz and other researchers maintain they are
uncovering important clues about how the flawed genes do their
dirty work. They're confident that treatments do lie ahead. The
impatience, in cases like Huntington's, is because the diseases
cause so much suffering not only in the afflicted person but in
their families as well.
</P>
<P>
   Huntington's toll can be appreciated in a visit to SunBridge
Care and Rehabilitation in Lowell, one of the very few facilities
that specialize in caring for Huntington's disease patients.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is grim. The disease, whose symptoms don't usually
appear until the 30s or 40s, relentlessly progresses toward death
10 to 20 years after diagnosis. Dying brain cells _ caused by an
inherited mutant gene _ lead to dementia, mood swings, muddled
thinking, sometimes psychosis. Loss of balance and motor control
culminates in total disability _ like a man seen at the SunBridge
Care and Rehabilitation facility here, slumped in a wheelchair,
head flopping, tongue hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disease has just run rampant through our family,'' said
Connie Sullivan of Wellesley, the mother of two sons who have been
placed in the facility. Her former husband also had Huntington's,
and his angry behavior _ which wasn't recognized as Huntington's at
the time _ destroyed their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gieras, 49, used to work in a camera repair shop, but
now his only job, since coming to SunBridge six months ago, is
sorting popsicle sticks in a sheltered workshop. Even when he's
sitting, Michael's body ripples with tics and writhing movements _
a hallmark of Huntington's, along with unsteady balance, erratic or
aggressive behavior, depression, psychosis, dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is soft-spoken and optimistic, but his brother, Jesse,
is said to be belligerent and aggressive: he refuses to talk to his
brother or mother.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents are in advanced stages of HD: A number of
patients are equipped with white crash helmets to prevent injuries
in the inevitable falls.
</P>
<P>
   In the final stages, ``they can't do anything. They can't eat,
walk, talk. It's sad,'' said Dr. Walter Koroshetz, a neurologist at
Massachusetts General Hospital who has several patients at
SunBridge.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people in the United States are afflicted with
Huntington's. But researchers are also concerned about another
150,000 people who are at risk because a parent had Huntington's.
</P>
<P>
   Because the symptoms of Huntington's often don't appear until
adulthood or mid-life, many victims have already had children
before they are diagnosed. The child of a Huntington's sufferer has
a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease. It's not unusual for
SunBridge to have related residents: at present, three sisters from
one family are here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to SunBridge, where 63 of 160 residents are
Huntington's disease patients, Tewksbury State Hospital specializes
in their care. Massachusetts is known for these facilities, which
Koroshetz of Mass. General said provides some comfort, especially
for people who have been diagnosed but have not yet been disabled
by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they're in for, and if there's no place where
they can feel comfortable going to when they need to go, it's
frightful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts we have the best delivery of care for
Huntington's disease of anyplace in the world,'' added Cha, the
Mass. General researcher.
</P>
<P>
   While the Huntington's disease gene finding hasn't led to a
cure, it has drawn money and research talent into the pursuit of
many leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people working on this disease now than you
would believe,'' said James Gusella, the Mass. General
neurogeneticist who found the first clue to the location of the
Huntington's disease gene in 1983 and who headed the team that
finally plucked out the gene itself 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Having the gene in hand has provided enormous leverage to the
research because it enabled scientists to create strains of mice
that carry the gene _ even though they don't develop quite the same
symptoms as humans do.
</P>
<P>
   With an animal model, scientists can try to determine why the
abnormal protein, called huntingtin, made by the Huntington's
disease gene causes brain cell death. In an intriguing experiment,
researchers created a Huntington's mouse in which they could turn
the production of the mutant huntingtin protein on and off.
Astonishingly, when they turned the protein off, the mice improved,
suggesting that the brain damage might be to some extent reversible
if the protein could be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The animal version of Huntington's also lets scientists rapidly
test drugs in search of one that slows the damage. Two drugs are
now being tried in human Huntington's patients, the first
large-scale drug trials in the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a few patients have been treated with implants of
fetal brain tissue designed to supply some of the nerve signal
chemicals that are lost when Huntington's disease patients' brain
cells die. But Koroshetz said he hasn't seen much benefit from the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Boston scientists found that a common antibiotic,
minocycline, slowed the pace of the disease in mice, extending
their lives by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Friedlander, a neurosurgeon at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, led researchers who showed that minocycline blocked the
action of enzymes called caspaces that trigger premature brain cell
death in Huntingon's disease. He and other scientists are moving to
start a clinical trial this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington's disease community is cautiously excited about
the results, because minocycline is a drug that's already approved
for human use in treating arthritis and acne.
</P>
<P>
   Such a modest potential advance as minocycline might not seem
like a big payoff 10 years after researchers found ``the Holy Grail
of genetics,'' but researchers say they're learning to be humble
about how well they understand human genetics. And they're learning
to appreciate how far they've come.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the understanding my lab has gained has depended on
cloning the Huntington's gene,'' said Friedlander.

NEW ENGLANDERS UNEARTHING PAINFUL FAMILY TIES TO SLAVE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, R.I. _ There, laid out atop the antique table, were
pieces of Deborah Howe's family history that she had never seen
amid the portraits and place-settings of her upstanding New England
family: a coiled whip with a woven-hemp handle, and a thick, rusty
pair of iron leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Howe had heard the story of how her wealthy
ancestors, the Dewolfs, had helped build Bristol into a bustling
seaport. Now her cousin, who had found the whip and shackles in a
basement, was confirming the whisperings she had heard about the
source of the family's prominence: the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like the Dewolfs were saying `Please come to our New
World' _ it was brutal and horrible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When talk turns to slavery, New Englanders recall the
abolitionists who loudly pounded their lecterns until the force of
their objections reverberated throughout the country. But that's
just part of the story. Before the Civil War, merchants from the
North like the Dewolfs were so heavily involved that riches from
the slave trade shaped the region _ spawning textile mills,
building towns like Bristol, and founding institutions like Brown
University, which takes its name from a known slave trader.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new desire to strip back the curtains on an earlier, more
painful chapter in New England's racial history is laying bare a
truth that is still shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was most nervous about how the older generation was going to
react to my wanting to raise these issues,'' said Katrina Browne,
Howe's cousin, who is researching a documentary on the family's and
New England's deep ties to the slave trade. Some of them were
``questioning the value of looking toward the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of slavery went surprisingly deep in the North,
historians say.
</P>
<P>
   The slaves were headed to the plantations of the South, but many
of the ships that carried them were owned by Northern merchants
like the Dewolfs, and built in shipyards in Boston, Providence, and
other commercial centers. The slave trade also built entire
industries, from rum distilleries to insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North was probably more deeply involved in the trade than
the South,'' said Richard Newman of Harvard University's W.E.B
DuBois Institute of African-American Research. ``It's a critical
issue that has never been dealt with in the North.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, two longstanding New England
institutions, The Hartford Courant and Aetna, have publicly
disclosed their involvement in slavery. The Courant took money for
printing ads encouraging readers to return runaway slaves for large
cash awards. Aetna profited from insuring slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The region's institutions need to do more to make amends, argues
Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a 34-year-old New York lawyer who
discovered Aetna's slave connection. She plans to file a lawsuit on
behalf of African-Americans against a dozen Northern financial
institutions, many from New England, that she claims profited from
the slave trade and never made amends.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, a descendant of James Dewolf, began to look into her
family background three years ago. She was reading her
grandmother's account of their history when she was struck by one
paragraph. ``I haven't the stomach enough to describe the ensuing
slave trade,'' her grandmother wrote. ``Suffice to say that all of
Bristol was involved as everyone profited from these ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Revolutionary War, the American shipping industry
began to thrive. And nowhere did the slave-trading business
flourish more than in the seaports of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of Dewolfs took advantage of those golden
years, making 88 voyages and becoming the nation's leading slave
traders. The family would return from the slave voyages, spreading
their profits in gold on a table, according to historians.
</P>
<P>
   James Dewolf became one of the richest men in Rhode Island. He
had honed his seafaring skills on African voyages with John Brown
of Providence. Soon, he bought his own ship.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dewolfs flourished in the slave business, so did the
town. Shipbuilders and factory workers all had a hand in the
industry. The Dewolfs built businesses throughout Bristol. Even
today, streets and stores are still named after the family. A wharf
as well as a mansion they built still exist.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the slave trade legally ended in 1808, 402 Rhode
Island men had become ship owners or captains, and their ships
carried 93,400 African slaves along the so-called Middle Passage,
according to the DuBois institute.
</P>
<P>
   According to the author George Howe, who is a relative of
Katrina Browne and Deborah Howe, Bristol ``owed its wealth in this
golden age to the slave trade.''
</P>
<P>
   This wealth, of course, was built on suffering. It was a common
practice, writes George Howe, to cast ill slaves off the ship. One
legend claims a captain on one of Dewolf's ships cut off the hands
of Africans clinging with all their might to the edge of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The money would shape the region in complicated ways. Even the
blacksmiths who made the chains for the slaves and the barrels for
the rum made money from the voyages, say historians. The trade
ultimately spawned dozens of ancillary businesses such as the
turn-of-the-century cotton mills and iron foundries, said Joanne
Pope Melish, a visiting professor at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   James Dewolf later used his fortune to build a textile mill
called Arkwright Manufacturer in northern Rhode Island. The
business, renamed Arkwright Inc., is now owned by a Dutch company
and builds overhead transparencies, according to a company
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, financial institutions such as Providence Bank were
built by slave traders like Brown University's Johh Brown. The
now-defunct Hartford Life Insurance Co. reportedly also sold slave
policies. And, Boston insurance companies at the time made up the
majority of the underwriters for Rhode Island slave voyages, said
Browne.
</P>
<P>
   But the same trade that brought so much wealth and prominence to
New England families also helped split them: Moses Brown was an
abolitionist who fiercely fought his brother, John Brown, a
successful slave trader and congressman. The elaborate home of John
Brown, who later became a US senator, still stands on the edge of
the Brown University campus.
</P>
<P>
   As the abolitionists began to win victories in the slavery
debate, the repercussions were felt up and down the coast,
especially in Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   In 1825, with the slave trade over and money drying up, a Cuban
sugar plantation owned by another Dewolf family member, George
Dewolf, failed to deliver the cargo he had promised. The failure
took down the whole town, said Louis P. Cirillo, executive director
of Linden Place, the former home of George Dewolf, which is now a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the night, Dewolf gathered his wife, Charlotte,
and their children and quietly left, said Cirillo.
</P>
<P>
   News spread across the country that a Dewolf business deal had
failed. Soon, merchants were refusing to honor bank notes from
Bristol. And, in a town partially built on slavery, residents tried
to put the past behind them.

QUARTZ AND OBSIDIAN: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the difference between smoky quartz and obsidian,
both in technical and common terms? They seem so similar.
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Middleboro, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Quartz is a fairly transparent crystalline mineral made of
silicon and oxygen with two atoms of oxygen to each silicon.
Crystalline means that it is made of a regularly repeating pattern
of atoms, as opposed to a sort of amorphous blob, which is usually
called ``glass.'' Quartz can acquire color by having impurities _
for example, amethyst is quartz that contains traces of iron or
manganese, and has a purple color. Quartz can also be darkened by
exposure to radiation from radioactive minerals or from cosmic rays
that hit the Earth all the time. Radiation creates tiny defects in
quartz that can absorb light. When this happens to a piece of
quartz that started out clear, you end up with what is called
``smoky quartz.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsidians are natural volcanic glasses (not crystals) that form
from rapidly cooled lava. They flake quite easily, leaving sharp
edges, and thus are ideal for primitive societies to make cutting
implements, such as knives and arrowheads. Chemically, obsidians
vary widely, but to a large extent are similar to quartz, though
they often contain many other substances and can range in color
from clear to black to green, red, or brown.

<P>
   Elizabeth and her husband are like most adoptive parents in
almost every way. Except one.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first people in the country to have given birth to
a baby they adopted as an embryo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe with all my heart that this should happen more, and
will,'' said Elizabeth, who asked that her name and location in
Southern California not be disclosed because she believes it should
be her daughter's decision, once she's old enough, whether to share
her story with the world. ``What we did . . . is an ethical, moral
solution to a very difficult problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``problem,'' to a devout Christian like such as Elizabeth,
is that the 200,000 frozen embryos in this country are all living
beings who deserve a chance to grow up in loving homes.
</P>
<P>
   An undetermined number of these fertilized eggs are being
donated by their genetic parents to infertile couples. But many
mental-health specialists believe the anonymity usually involved
isn't healthy, particularly for the children, and Elizabeth agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ones who are going to have to explain this to our
daughter one day,'' she said. ``Are we going to tell her that she
was donated? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of Elizabeth's religious beliefs and her views
on openness in family relationships prompted the formation a few
years ago of the nation's only adoption agency for frozen embryos.
Then Elizabeth and her husband became the first clients of
Snowflakes Embryo Adoption Program, part of Christian Adoption &AMP;
Family Services in Fullerton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   This new phase in adoption and science history began while
Elizabeth and her husband were discussing their infertility with a
doctor in late 1996. As he explained the creation of embryos
through in-vitro fertilization, Elizabeth started crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't we adopt any embryos that are already there?'' she
recalled asking, without knowing at that time what such a process
might entail, or even if it were possible. The doctor did not seem
interested, but the notion seized her, so she called a friend who
put her in touch with a lawyer at Christian Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   He liked the suggestion and began talks within the agency about
providing such a service. Meanwhile, Elizabeth had contacted Focus
on the Family, a religious organization in Colorado, and told
officials there about her idea; they, too, were intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, a couple came to Focus on the Family saying they
had 20 frozen embryos remaining from their IVF treatments, didn't
want more children themselves, and were morally opposed to both the
embryos' destruction and their use for research. And they didn't
believe in secrecy, either.
</P>
<P>
   So, using the model of adoption as it is generally practiced,
the couple pored over letters and photos from several prospective
parents _ then chose Elizabeth and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 cryogenically stored embryos were shipped to a clinic in
Pasadena, where Elizabeth had arranged for implantation. Of the 12
thawed for her first attempt, just three turned out to be viable,
and none took hold to achieve a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three that survived a second thawing made it,
however, and Grace was born on New Year's Eve of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Davidson, the program director for Snowflakes, said that
her agency has matched embryos for 14 families since June 1997, and
that four women currently are pregnant as a result. Only Elizabeth
has given birth so far, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowflakes arranges only open adoptions for embryos. That is,
the two sets of parents make contact, reach an agreement, and stay
in touch to whatever degree they find comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to replay all the mistakes adoption made during
its secretive past,'' Davidson said. ``Now that we understand the
benefits of openness in traditional adoption, we also want to get
it right with what we're doing.''

   The doctor grew up in a suburb of Brussels, the son of a pencil
factory owner, but he feels his upbringing was not so far removed
from what he sees now in Angola. He pointedly notes billions of
dollars that have funded the war came from diamonds, and the
world's diamond-trading hub is his native Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am cutting off legs from mines paid for by diamonds,''

   ``Yes, son,'' said the father, moving the blanket over the boy,
leaving exposed only his wrapped left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, father, please cover me,'' the boy said again.
</P>
<P>
   The father moved the blanket over the arm. He has stayed at the

They both lie awake most nights, the boy from his pain, the father
from hearing the boy's pain.

<P>
   ``I ask God to heal my son,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled out a Bible and read from Psalm 8, speaking in a
forceful voice that bounced off the 14-foot ceilings of Infirmary
No. 4:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou whose glory above the heavens is chanted by the mouths of
babes and infants, Thou hast founded a bulwark.''
</P>
<P>
   Willpower and faith are the only weapons most people have.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, one might expect some sensitivity to
questions about last year's ranking of Angola as the worst place to
be a child. But there was none.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed to be accurate. The rankings were culled
from the under-5 mortality rate, the percent of children
underweight, the percent of children not attending school, whether
the country was at war, and the HIV/AIDS rate for 15- to
49-year-olds. Right behind Angola were Sierre Leone, Somalia,
Afghanistan, and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the places at the bottom of the list are war places,''
said Olara Otunnu, the UN special representative on children and
armed conflict. ``In every respect, there's a very direct link
between the deterioration of the quality of life and war. You see
it in the breaking up of families, the losing out on school, the
losing out on health, the girls being raped. All this dramatically
rises in war, and when war persists for decades as it has in
Angola, everything is broken in its path. And with that breakdown,
children are the most vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the UNICEF office in the capital of Luanda, Dr. Oscar
Castillo, UNICEF's project officer for health, said one simple way
to measure the war's impact on children was to ask a child his or
her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask a boy who is about this height, his age,'' said the
doctor, putting his hand about 3 1/2 feet from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `12.' You say, `No, wait, I said what is your age?'
He says, `12.' There is a whole generation of stunted children and
this from a people who are genetically tall. Then you wonder how it
is going to affect them psychologically, mentally. Even if the war
ended now, the country will take a generation to solve this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, you know,'' he said, ``for a child, tomorrow is too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too late for Candilo Quarasma, 15, who lost his right leg
six years ago. He was following his older brother in a field when
he stepped on a mine. His brother had the luck of a longer stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell down,'' Candilo said. ``I didn't feel anything. I saw
my leg was not there, so I started crying. My brother carried me,
and we got to the hospital. I stayed two months.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his favorite activities now are to spend time in a
nearby garden, to play soccer on his crutches, and to run. Asked if
he could remember what it was like to run with two legs, he said:
``I can't remember that at all. I can't run as before, and my
crutch hurts my arms, but I still like to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Jean Sao Paulo Genge, 58, listened to him. He said
Candilo often turns sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He starts to cry, and I tell him, `Don't cry. There are lots
of other children without legs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Neither father nor son expressed anger about the laying of the
mines. ``All the cities are surrounded by mines,'' the father said.
``We don't get upset. It's like a fate.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the fate is horrible to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with mines is that they are really dirty,'' said
Rijs, preparing to go once again into the operating room. ``All the
dust and dirt is blowing upward, sometimes going up really high
into the leg muscles. To prevent infection, you cannot close it for
the first few days. You leave it open and everything comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembered well the night of Feb. 14, when a truck from
Camacupa pulled up at dusk to the hospital. Inside the truck bed
was a bundle of moaning people, all victims of an antitank mine
that had exploded under their truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the MSF house, got a big solar lamp just to see what
was in the truck. There were open fractures, people lying over each
other, their luggage everywhere. It's almost night. There's no
electricity. A fuel shortage. We got a generator up and running. I
did triage. It was war surgery, from 7 that night until 3 the next
morning,'' he said. In that truck were 18 injured people and three
bodies. ``It was horrible, and it was exceptional how we worked
together. I went home and had a whiskey.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor began scrubbing his hands with soap in a sink and
walked into the operating room, where a nurse poured iodine over
his hands. The iodine, another precaution against the spread of
infection, spilled through his hands to the floor and onto his
sandals, staining them red. The doctor kept talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman that night, her name was Maria de Leudes, she's just
outside here,'' he pointed to the hallway, where five patients
waited on beds. ``Can you believe it? Maria de Leudes, named after
the place where miracles happen. She lost her brother, her husband,
her son, and her leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's incredible is that life goes on for her and for the
others after this. They keep going on. They are fantastic people.
They smile. They laugh. They are in the (expletive) war now for 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He told nurses to begin checking for infections in the wound of
his first patient, Luis Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   He had three amputated legs to look at, those belonging to
Manuel, Victorino Canhala, and Daniel Miguel. He also had to check
abscesses in the amputated legs of Maria de Leudes and Pelina
Chova.
</P>
<P>
   Rijs will leave his post Thursday. He will be replaced by
another Medecins Sans Frontieres surgeon. This morning he was in a
testy mood. Angola has been a trial, even after work in Cambodia,
Chad, South Africa, and southern Sudan. When he leaves, he said, he
will spend two months in the Alps, time to forget all the limbs
that he has cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nice,'' he kept repeating under his mask, as he cut
tendons, snipped out infected muscle, and then poked his index
finger inside a hole in Manuel's right leg only to find a
pinkie-sized piece of metal. He held the metal up to the light. It
was a piece of a mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not nice,'' he said of his work. ``But it has to be done.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUITO, Angola _ There was nothing sacred in the operating room,
not the thoughts of the doctor, not the body of the patient, not
the blood dripping off an operating table that was shaped like a
cross.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses tied the teenager's slender wrists with nylon rope to the
table. They didn't touch his leg, his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   A land mine had taken the right.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon, Dr. Jean Rijs, began unwrapping the sticky bandages
around Victorino Canhala's right stump. He kicked a blue bucket
under the table. The bucket rattled as the boy's blood spattered
inside it.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was fed up. This is what he had been doing for a year
_ one, two, three amputations a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nice surgery,'' he said through a mask that left only
his dark eyes visible. ``It's not surgery at all. This is what
war's about _ cutting legs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a lens through which to see Kuito, a city of hundreds
and hundreds of people with just one leg, and to see the whole of
Angola, maimed as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Angola is the worst place in the world to be a child, UNICEF
said. It has more amputees per capita than anywhere else. Its land
is believed to be sown with more land mines per square mile than
any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such depths of misery elicit only a few peeps of
response from outside powers. The war here keeps grinding on into
its fourth decade far from the view of the outside world, seen only
in the byproduct of the river of displaced people, who at last
count neared 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   They flee the fighting and banditry in the countryside for huts
in camps or urban warrens full of drunks, prostitutes, and
malnourished children wandering about with open wounds, scenes that
resemble the postnuclear horrors of a ``Mad Max'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Western governments and the diamond industry agreed
in Belgium to belated steps that will make it harder for the
Angolan and Sierra Leone rebels to sell diamonds and fund war
chests. But diplomats here say the impact in Angola may be at best
a slowing of the war, the application of a loose tourniquet, but
not enough to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   A UN plea last month for $8.4 million to help 300,000 recently
displaced people in disease-ridden camps received two quick
pledges: $2 million from the US State Department and $560,000 from
Sweden. Groups such as Oxfam, CARE, and Medecins Sans Frontieres,
or Doctors Without Borders, also have been active, making appeals
for private funding for operations here.
</P>
<P>
   But what is especially tragic about such emergency requests is
that without war, Angola could be extraordinarily wealthy. Not only
does it have huge diamond reserves, but it is also expected soon to
be Africa's leading oil producer. It now supplies 7 percent of US
oil imports, a figure that could double in five years.
</P>
<P>
   There is no end in sight to the war, said a Western diplomat who
noted that Angola's government and the UNITA rebels both have been
busy laying more mines, even as the British charity, the Halo
Trust, has been removing mines from fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked my bosses what they would consider a success from
my tenure here, they had no answer for me,'' the diplomat said.
``It means they have no agenda for Angola. They expect nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no UN forces here, and there are no plans to send
them, ever since they were pulled out 18 months ago when rebels
shot down two UN planes. And the government has rejected peace
feelers from the rebel chief, Jonas Savimbi, as untrustworthy
offerings. Savimbi has broken peace accords twice before.
</P>
<P>
   Angola is a glimpse into the beyond, where evil moves like a
parasitic disease, worming its way into the lives of innocents who
know of the dangers but still cannot avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   At the almost exact geographical center of Angola sits Kuito, a
city of nearly 1 million people that has swelled by 200,000 in
recent months with outlying villagers displaced by rural fighting
and new minefields.
</P>
<P>
   There is no safe way into the city on the ground. The airspace
outside city limits also is unsafe, and pilots flying UN World Food
Program planes enter the city at high altitudes and then pirouette
their aircraft in tight descending circles for landing, to avoid
the rebels' Stinger missiles.
</P>
<P>
   All supplies are flown in, even fuel. All international aid
workers are forbidden to travel outside city limits.
</P>
<P>
   The government controls the city, but that's all.
</P>
<P>
   The people here are not just cordoned off from the rest of the
world, they live in a place frozen in time. Government troops and
rebels shelled this city for nine months in 1993 and '94, killing
30,000 to 50,000 people and leaving behind the skeletons of
once-majestic buildings constructed by Portuguese colonials.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings, painted in disconcertingly tropical colors
reminiscent of Miami Beach _ bright yellow, pink, raspberry, azure,
and mauve _ look like jigsaw puzzles with hundreds of missing
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The police station lacks outer walls. The post office, long ago
shut down, has rows of metal boxes full of bullet holes. The Bank
of Angola's grand stairwell is still lined with Italian tiles, but
the roof's barrel tiles will blow off in a windstorm and the weeds
on the second floor have sprouted 2 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Today, evidence of war arrives more stealthily than the
onslaught several years ago. It arrives on foot, in the number of
wounded civilians appearing every morning at the doors of the
Provincial Hospital of Kuito, Dr. Rijs's lair.
</P>
<P>
   Rijs, a youthful 40, his shock of black hair standing almost on
edge and a stubble of whiskers covering his chin, is the only
surgeon at the 400-bed hospital. He works for Medecins Sans
Frontieres, last year's winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for its
healing work and its record of speaking out about zones of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're overcrowded,'' he said, starting his rounds one day
recently. ``It's because I had a lot of gunshots last week. We also
have a lot of people injured from mines.''
</P>
<P>
   In Infirmary No. 4, he stepped over a female patient lying on
the floor and stopped at bed 22, which held Silva Chivinda, 10.
</P>
<P>
   The boy whimpered softly.
</P>
<P>
   He had been cutting wood with a machete on June 16 _ UNICEF's
Day of the African Child _ when the machete struck a mine. Silva
was bent at the waist, and the mine tore into the entire front of
his body. In the bed, his legs and arms were wrapped in white
gauze, his left eye was an exposed socket and his right eye was
nearly shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's lost sight in both eyes,'' the doctor said softly in
English, as the boy's Umbundo-speaking father, Avalino da Silva,
tried to understand the words. ``I had to remove one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rijs moved on, pointing to each bed and giving one-phrase
explanations, ``gunshot in the leg,'' ``another gunshot,'' ``mine
victim,'' ``mine victim,'' ``gunshot.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally paused. ``You never get used to this. Never, never,
never,'' he said. ``For me, it's not surgery. It's _ what do you
call it _ it's butchery. When you see how these people come in to
the hospital, it's awful. That boy who lost his eyes. Oh, my God.
What's his future? Sure there are bad stories everywhere here. But
for what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a guy who was digging graves and a mine exploded on
him,'' the doctor said. ``He died after a week. But that small boy,
that's awful. There are no words for it.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: So, why not Lieberman?
 &HT;    For immediate release.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question for almost a decade now _ since Colin Powell
emerged exalted from the Gulf War -- has been this: ``Is America
ready for a black president?'' The general and his wife decided not
to try to force an answer to that just yet. Then there were the
female prospects beginning with Shirley Chisholm in the '70s and,
most recently, Elizabeth Dole. Not yet, the country seemed to say.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a new question: ``Is America ready for a Jewish vice
president, only a heartbeat away from the presidency?''
</P>
<P>
   And the answer needs to be a typical Jewish one, a return
question: ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   What is it about Joseph Lieberman that makes him a controversial
candidate? His Jewishness. Not his record, but his Jewishness.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question: ``What's Dick Cheney's religion?''
Yes, it's Christian, but what kind of Christian? Is it important?
Not to me. I voted at least three times for Southern Baptists even
though that religion's formal body decided that because of my
religion, I'm not going to get to heaven. I voted for the men, not
their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Since word leaked out early Monday that Al Gore was going to
select Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his vice-presidential
running mate, I've been monitoring the reaction on America Online's
selected message board. That's the place where the bigots get to
sound off anonymously. Unless John Rocker has a half-million
different screen names, he's not the only bigot in this country.
</P>
<P>
   That's sad, but I do not believe it represents the nation. And
judging by the spelling errors in those electronic reactions, the
administration that takes office next year needs to beef up
education spending.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, an issue was whether the Roman Catholic John F.
Kennedy would be representing the Vatican in the White House. It
took up the early part of his campaign but was quickly defused, and
he became the first Catholic elected to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also must undergo an early acid test. No matter his
position on abortion, school vouchers, Cuba or Bill Clinton,
Lieberman's religion takes center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The silliest concern, of course, is whether Lieberman, being an
Orthodox Jew, will be able to function when his Sabbath begins at
sundown Friday and continues to sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One needs only to check airline reservations out of Washington
D.C. on Friday afternoons, returning early Monday morning, to
recognize that no one -- not Jews, not Catholics, not
Presbyterians, not anyone -- puts in weekend work in the capital
unless there is a major crisis. Lieberman already has said, and
demonstrated, that his Sabbath will not deter him from critical
needs and decisions that day.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman would generally take Saturday off, he could be
working hard on Sunday while everyone else was playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   What Gore did with the selection of Lieberman was pull off a
political stunt. He's using Lieberman's centrist political beliefs
and recognized morality to buck the Clinton monkey from his back.
Gore didn't pick Lieberman because he was Jewish. He picked him for
what he represents.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lieberman's religion will play a role in how the Arab
states look at us, but that's only if he's elected. And what choice
do the Arabs have? George Bush already has said that if he's
elected, he'd move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
That's the last thing Arabs wanted to hear; Joe Lieberman couldn't
say or do anything that would more horrify them.
</P>
<P>
   To those who fear Lieberman as vice president of the United
States, here's a lighter observation: At least we'd have someone as
President of the Senate who would be cutting the pork out of the
federal budget.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    FAMILY HOLES UP IN BUNKER, EVADES COURT
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By JIM HENDERSON 
 c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   TRINIDAD, Texas _ By most accounts, John Joe Gray lived a quiet
life _ quiet except for the weekends when automatic rifle fire
signaled militia training exercises _ with his family on a remote
and wooded 47 acres fanning out from the Trinity River a few miles
north of here.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a living building houses and provided homes for his
six children and their spouses on what is now being called his
``compound.'' Except for occasionally commenting on his extremist
anti-government views, his neighbors paid little attention to him.
He rarely attracted the attention of local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 51-year-old Gray apparently is holed up in his
compound, which is surrounded by barbed wire and fortified by a
bunker ringed with sandbags, dodging two felony warrants stemming
from an altercation with state troopers. He has dared the
authorities to ``come and get me'' and warned them to ``bring body
bags.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Ruby Ridge and remember Waco,'' says Bill Clark, a
former city councilman in nearby Gun Barrel City who used to attend
militia meetings at Gray's house. ``Folks will just take so much.
They've been pushed and pushed, but they are basically damned good
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Gray a fugitive, but one of his daughters also has
arrest warrants outstanding against her, and the family is
harboring two of his grandchildren who were awarded to their father
in divorce court 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all, investigators believe 10 adults and six children are
living in the two houses on Gray's property. For that reason, they
have been hesitant to enforce the divorce court's custody order or
to serve the felony warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a serious situation here with some very serious
threats made,'' says Henderson County Sheriff Howard ``Slick''
Alfred, a former Texas Ranger. ``The children's safety is of
primary concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray could not be contacted for an interview. He has no
telephone service and did not come to the gate when a reporter
attempted to get his attention by honking a car horn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gray was a leader in the Texas Constitutional Militia
(he referred to himself as ``Col. Gray''), and he traveled to Fort
Davis in 1997 when the Republic of Texas separatist group was in a
standoff with state police, he apparently did not appear on law
enforcement radar screens until late in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the minor brushes with the law stemming from the
family's allegiance to a fringe, Oregon-based church called the
Embassy of Heaven. The sect does not recognize government
authority, even the authority to license drivers, register
automobiles, issue birth certificates and Social Security numbers
or to conduct civil courts.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, Gray's 24-year-old daughter, Racheal Dempsey,
was jailed in Tool on charges of driving without a license and
having ``fictitious'' tags on her car _ they were issued by the
Embassy of Heaven. She refused to answer questions or post bail and
fasted until she was released a few days later. When she later
refused to appear in court, three warrants were issued for her
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after that incident, Gray was stopped and cited for
driving without a license and having no proof of insurance. Like
his daughter, he refused to answer questions. He was released but
didn't show up for a court hearing. Warrants were issued, but he
was not exactly hunted down.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, some area residents say, the authorities simply
backed away from the cases. The Grays were not considered
dangerous. The family may have viewed the traffic confrontations as
a holy war, but the cops considered them little more than
nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Tarkington, Gray's former son-in-law, believes there is
another reason the authorities have taken no action. ``I think the
law is scared of him.''
</P>
<P>
   (SUBHEAD) Difference in beliefs
</P>
<P>
   Tarkington, 34, married into the Gray family in June 1995 and
divorced himself from it last summer.
</P>
<P>
   He and Lisa, now 30, had two sons and were happy, he says, even
though he did not subscribe to his father-in-law's beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to tell me, `You're either for us or you're against
us,''' Tarkington says. ``I would say, `No, I just don't believe
that stuff and I don't want any part of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he says, Gray's passion was the Embassy of Heaven
Church, organized in 1980 in Oregon by Craig Fleishman, a former
computer analyst who now uses the name Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   The group does not recognize government authority and believes
that secular government is in direct competition with God.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors
extremist organizations, the Embassy of Heaven has about 400
members, a few of them in Henderson County.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gray became involved with the militia and began wearing
camouflage fatigues and amassing an arsenal, including assault
rifles.
</P>
<P>
   When he could not convert Tarkington to his beliefs, the
son-in-law says, Gray began pressuring and ``brainwashing'' his
daughter to leave her husband and return home. Tarkington, who is
Catholic, believes his religion was also a problem for the Gray
family.
</P>
<P>
   On the gate to Gray's property is a sign that says, ``90% of
Catholic priest ARE child molesters.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa, by her own account, made the decision to move back into
the family compound April 9, 1999. Although she never formally
responded to Tarkington's divorce petition, she sent a long,
handwritten letter to the judge in which she wrote that ``God would
never let (Tarkington) see his children again'' and that ``it is
pathetic to be Catholic.''

   TRINIDAD, Texas: be Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her parents' home, she told the judge, on the
night of her 29th birthday. She and her husband and two children
had been to dinner and were stopped by a Tool police officer. Keith
Tarkington was arrested on warrants for three unpaid traffic
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Because she had no driver's license, Lisa called her sister and
brother-in-law to come and get her. They took her and the children
back to the Gray family home and Tarkington has seen his kids, Joe
Douglas, 4, and Samuel, 2{, only once since.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Gray's house the next morning to pick up his family,
but was not allowed through the gate. Lisa came out with the two
boys and told him she wasn't leaving.
</P>
<P>
   He went back a few days later, but his wife refused to let him
see his sons. A month later, Tarkington filed for divorce. Lisa did
not respond and, by default, he was granted the divorce and custody
of the two boys.
</P>
<P>
   After awarding custody to Tarkington, the judge issued a writ of
attachment, authorizing sheriff's deputies to remove the boys from
their mother's custody. The writ was never served and the court's
custody order never enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkington frequently drives past the Gray house and
occasionally observes it from a nearby plateau, hoping for a
glimpse of his children.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while he was driving along the dirt road, Tarkington says,
Gray stopped him and told him, ``If I ever see you on this road
again, I'll shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, one of Gray's sons jumped over the fence and
vandalized his pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tarkington believes, his children, like the others in the
compound, are in danger because of another of Gray's run-ins with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   (SUBHEAD) Felony charges filed
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas Eve, state troopers in Anderson County stopped a
car for speeding near Palestine. The driver obeyed the command to
get out of the car, but the passenger, identified as Gray, refused
and had to be forcibly removed from the vehicle. He was wearing a
gun in a shoulder holster and he scuffled with the two troopers,
biting one of them on the hand and grabbing an officer's pistol,
according to the troopers' report.
</P>
<P>
   The car contained several weapons, including high-caliber
pistols and assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was charged with two felonies _ assaulting an officer and
taking his weapon _ and was released on bond. He retreated to his
riverside home and failed to show for any of his court appearances.
Finally, in May, felony warrants were issued in Anderson County,
but by then, Gray had fortified his property with bunkers and was
prepared for a long standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkington says his former father-in-law had laid in large
supplies of food, fuel and ammunition in anticipation of the
dreaded societal meltdown that would occur when the new millennium
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to brag that he could provide for his family for two
years,'' Tarkington says.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and phone service to the house have been cut off
because of delinquent bills and, as if to further isolate himself,
Gray apparently removed the mailbox at the entrance to his
property. However, some residents of the area believe Gray and his
family are not completely isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet that he has all the (generator) power he needs,''
Clark says. ``And I imagine he has some form of communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends are delivering food to the house, some say, and others
claim some of Gray's children still make trips into town for
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen Lisa in Wal-Mart,'' says one neighbor, who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators doubt that members of the family are moving about
so freely. They are taciturn about their investigation, but some
hint that the house is being closely watched.
</P>
<P>
   Every few yards, a warning sign is posted on the barbed wire
fence beside a dusty county road that runs past the Gray property:
``Keep Out.'' ``No Trespassing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the gate, another sign, addressed to ``all public servants,''
warns that intruders will not be tolerated and that ``survivors
will be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers confirm that Gray sent a message to the
Anderson County district attorney telling him, ``If you come on my
property, bring plenty of body bags.''
</P>
<P>
   `This is a delicate situation'
</P>
<P>
   The bonding company, which stands to lose nearly $300,000, has
declined to send bounty hunters after Gray. The state Child
Protective Services agency has declined to intervene, Tarkington
was told, unless he has evidence that the children are being
abused. The Henderson County sheriff's office and the Department of
Public Safety have also declined to move against Gray, and the FBI
has told Tarkington it has no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand his frustrations,''Henderson County
investigator John Bell says of Tarkington. ``But this is a delicate
situation. We don't want to go in there gung-ho and get somebody
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he adds, the warrants will have to be served sooner or
later. ``We can't let him make a mockery of the law,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Steve Foster, who has worked with Bell, agrees that
the stalemate can't continue indefinitely, but ``this could turn
into another Waco ... we don't want to get into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarkington's parents, Emma and Doug Tarkington, who live in Gun
Barrel City, share their son's frustrations and impatience, but
they also fear the outcome of a police assault on the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got to be dangerous,'' Emma Tarkington says of Gray.
``He must be getting pretty desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's old friend, Bill Clark, who now lives in Oklahoma, argues
that the real danger is from outside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't condone everything they've done,'' he says, ``but
they're fine folks. They look after their own and they respect
God's commandments. They just really want to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, if challenged, they probably would fight. ``They
are good hands in night combat,'' he says. ``The women are, too.
They've had a lot of training.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson County District Attorney Doug Lowe, whose job it is to
prosecute Gray on the felony charges, acknowledged that the
authorities are ``walking on eggshells'' to avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to get him back before the courts and give him a
fair trial,'' he says. ``We would like to have a resolution, but
ultimately, the federal people probably will have to deal with
it.''

 &HT;    Setting up family priorities
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times it is necessary or desirable for both parents in the
family to work. The old idea that a women's place was only in the
home has been modified. Many women work outside the home to enhance
their self-esteem. They may find it desirable to be a full-time
homemaker when the children are young, but enjoy the economic and
psychological rewards of work outside the home when the children
are older.
</P>
<P>
   However, many family conflicts are the result of ineffective or
inappropriate ordering of priorities by both the father and the
mother. For either one, placing one's job before one's family will
almost always result in some sort of problem within the family.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps that can be taken to increase the likelihood of
successful parenting are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set aside regular and frequent times for the whole family to
sit down and spend time talking about how each person's needs are
being met, or unmet. Then use this information to modify each
family member's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try, if possible, to have one parent at home when the children
come in from school. Children are full of news about their day and
need someone to listen to them. This time, immediately after
school, gives a parent a chance to hear about successes or
failures, and take care of the inevitable cuts and scratches that
occur. By helping with, or supervising, a time for homework, the
parent can teach good study skills and habits. Having a relaxed
setting after school and in the evenings also is important for
healthy family development. Many businesses have flextime as an
option that can be considered.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Establish definite responsibilities and share these
responsibilities. When possible, each family member should
contribute to the family chores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set aside definite periods of time when the family can be
together as a unit, such as at dinnertime, or on weekends, and
learn to protect this time by resisting activities that interfere
with this time. A picnic, some family recreational activities, and
eating meals together can help promote family cohesiveness and
security.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Periodically examine the health of the family unit to see if
pressures are building because both parents are working. Try to be
objective. If signs of stress are occurring, consider seeking some
professional help before things get too bad and disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that setting priorities and frequently reviewing them
can help keep things in perspective. Both parents working outside
the home is not always a problem, but the psychological health of
the family should be monitored closely to watch for signs of
stress.

   &QR;  Set aside regular and frequent times for the whole family to
sit down and spend time talking about how each person's needs are
being met, or unmet. Then use this information to modify each
family member's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try, if possible, to have one parent at home when the children
come in from school. Children are full of news about their day and
need someone to listen to them. This time, immediately after
school, gives a parent a chance to hear about successes or
failures, and take care of the inevitable cuts and scratches that
occur. By helping with, or supervising, a time for homework, the
parent can teach good study skills and habits. Having a relaxed
setting after school and in the evenings also is important for
healthy family development. Many businesses have flextime as an
option that can be considered.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Establish definite responsibilities and share these
responsibilities. When possible, each family member should
contribute to the family chores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set aside definite periods of time when the family can be
together as a unit, such as at dinnertime, or on weekends, and
learn to protect this time by resisting activities that interfere
with this time. A picnic, some family recreational activities, and
eating meals together can help promote family cohesiveness and
security.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Periodically examine the health of the family unit to see if
pressures are building because both parents are working. Try to be
objective. If signs of stress are occurring, consider seeking some
professional help before things get too bad and disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that setting priorities and frequently reviewing them
can help keep things in perspective. Both parents working outside
the home is not always a problem, but the psychological health of
the family should be monitored closely to watch for signs of
stress.

&HT;     LAWYERS DISMISS PRISON BRUTALITY CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lawyers for guards at the troubled Pelican Bay
State Prison are disputing another brutality suit, telling a
federal court jury that a prisoner who claimed excessive force had
actually been the aggressor and had been treated properly.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate Thomas Brissette ``chose to fight, to resist every step
of the way,'' and was not attacked or set up by guards as he
claimed, Deputy Attorney General Susan Myster said in opening
statements Monday to a U.S. District Court jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Brissette's attorney, Michael Gevertz, said guards had
deliberately placed Brissette in a cell with a known gang member,
over his objections, then broken up their fight by beating him,
shooting him with rubber bullets and a stun gun, dropping him
face-first onto a litter and banging his head against the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A human does not cease to be a human being because he is a
prisoner,'' Gevertz told the eight-member jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were not told that Brissette was serving a life sentence
for murder.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is the latest court case involving allegations of
brutality and civil rights violations at the maximum-security
prison near Crescent City in far Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   One guard, David G. Lewis, was sentenced to more than seven
years in prison in May for shooting an inmate without provocation
in 1994. Two other guards have been indicted on federal charges of
conspiring to arrange attacks on prisoners from 1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ruled in 1995 that the
rights of Pelican Bay prisoners had been violated by systematic use
of excessive force as well as substandard medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Brissette's lawsuit dates from July 1991, when he was being held
in Pelican Bay's Security Housing Unit, where prisoners spend
nearly the entire day in their cells. He spent the first three
months in a cell by himself, but officers said they had run out of
room and ordered him to share a cell with a prisoner named Harvey
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Gevertz, Brissette's attorney, said prison documents showed that
Hill was known to be a gang member, had been violent in prison and
was considered a threat to other inmates. He said Brissette had
pleaded not to be put in Hill's cell, but guards ``responded with
threats of violence and racial slurs.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the seven guards sued by Brissette said he had
simply refused to move and had not said why. Myster, who represents
six of the guards, also said they had no conclusive evidence at the
time that Hill was a gang member _ but even if he was, it wasn't
considered dangerous to house him with a fellow black inmate like
Brissette who wasn't in a gang.
</P>
<P>
   Gevertz said guards had broken up an immediate fight between the
two men by shooting Brissette repeatedly with a 38mm gas gun, which
fires rubber pellets; shocking him with a taser gun; clubbing him
with a baton; then hogtying him and dropping him 3 feet onto a
litter that lay on the concrete floor. While wheeling Brissette to
an infirmary, a guard slammed his face into adjoining walls and
crowed that he ``got him good,'' Gevertz said.
</P>
<P>
   Myster's account differed sharply. She said the 6-foot-5,
240-pound Brissette had attacked the 5-foot-8, 170-pound Hill as
soon as Brissette's hands were uncuffed, requiring guards to use
force to rescue Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Brissette was not beaten up or hogtied, was lowered rather than
dropped onto the litter, and suffered only minor injuries, Myster
said. She also said guards might have used profanity, since ``this
is not kindergarten,'' but had never used racial slurs.

   NJ-BLUEBERRIES (Hammondton, N.J.) _ The inland heart of South
Jersey is a vast national preserve, a million acres of former ocean
bottom now a primeval terrain of craggy pines and impenetrable
forest scrub. It's strangely beautiful and fragrant flatland, but
not a first choice for those looking to reap great harvests. For
almost a century, however, farms large and small have done just
that. Sandwiched between showy Atlantic City and stately
Philadelphia, this part of South Jersey is prime blueberry country.
The lean, sandy and acidic soil here puts forth about 40 million
pounds of the tender fruit, enough to make the state second only to
Michigan in blueberry production. This summer's consistent,
merciful weather _ which was dismal for corn and tomatoes _ has
yielded the best harvest in recent memory here in Burlington
County. By Matt Lee and Ted Lee.

   JERUSALEM _ Their common enemies are microscopic. Their team
consists of both Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has long been one field that crossed lines between
Israelis and Palestinians. Building on that tradition, the Kuvin
Centre(CQ) for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, based
at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has projects ranging
from Israel to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't know these things go on,'' said Dr. Sanford
Kuvin, a Palm Beach, Fla. infectious disease specialist who founded
the center in 1976. His explanation for the teamwork is simple:
``Mosquitoes don't recognize borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuvin, 70, knows mosquitoes. In 1962, he helped develop an
antibody test for malaria, a major breakthrough in detecting the
mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
   He has testified before the U.S. Congress about AIDS and
Hepatitis B policy. And he was the medical advisor to Kimberly
Bergalis, a Florida woman who died after becoming the first
confirmed case of a patient contracting AIDS from her dentist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Kuvin came to Israel to meet with colleagues and saw
the potential for research in a country with high medical standards
in a region with many tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He set up the center in 1976. It became a lead agency in the
fight against the Rift Valley Fever, which killed thousands of
Egyptians and threatened to eliminate Egypt's cattle stock in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between Israeli and Egyptian health workers
coincided with the peace process between their two countries.
Together, they vaccinated every head of cattle in Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, with money from the U.S. Agency for
International Development, the European Union and the German
Science Foundation, the Kuvin Centre has worked in several
countries _ including Greece, Mali, Jordan and Brazil. It also
works on projects with countries where Israel does not have full
relations _ such as Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the focus is on leishmaniasis(CQ), a disease that
can cause disfiguring boils and, in a less common form, death. The
disease afflicts 400,000 people a year, mainly in the Mediterranean
region, Latin America and India.
</P>
<P>
   It is carried by parasites in sand flies. The flies bite
animals, including dogs, which are then infected and carry the
disease. Other flies spread it from the infected animals to humans.
There are cures, but they involve highly toxic drugs that can
damage organs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers collect sand fly larvae from the West Bank and
Israel, study the flies' behavior and genetic make-up. The goal is
to control the spread of the disease and find better cures.
</P>
<P>
   The project is based at the Kuvin Centre, but includes the
Palestinian Al-Quds University.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are applying for grant money to expand the
project, including a Palestinian clinic for treating and
researching the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abdeen, dean of research at Al-Quds and the Palestinian
coordinator on the project, said such cooperative projects used to
be frowned upon by other Palestinians. Now, with the school
involved in more than 52 joint projects, Palestinians recognize
that such efforts are ``good for Palestinians and good for the
peace process.''

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Home, heart and hearth in a
one-room house
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Orland L. Johnson
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   I do not remember Nov. 19, 1925. My birth certificate tells me
that I was issued to Imogene Clark Johnson and Roy Leonard Johnson
in the town of Hemphill, Texas, County of Sabine.
</P>
<P>
   My earliest recollection of life was trying to cut on a young
pear tree in the backyard of my grandfather Clark's house. The
knife turned backwards and split the middle finger of my left hand
up and through the fingernail. The scar is still with me.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my dad coming home from a hospital in a far off place
called Houston after he had been in an accident that broke his
back.
</P>
<P>
   Dad worked in the East Texas lumber industry. His job was to
load cut logs onto wagons with chains and mules. A chain broke and
whipped him in the back, breaking it in two places.
</P>
<P>
   His condition was sometimes good and sometimes bad. When it was
good he was like a normal person, but when the nerve pinched his
spinal cord he would fall down and every fiber in his body would
contort.
</P>
<P>
   The pain must have been more than he could bear, and I think the
doctors of today could have helped him. This condition existed
until his death at age 33. I was 13.
</P>
<P>
   When he came back from the hospital that first time, I was
probably about 3. It must have been just before Christmas because
Santa Claus brought me a little jar of mints and a wind-up toy that
did all sorts of jumps and flips.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was a school teacher. She'd walk to the two-room
school about a mile away, along a sandy wagon road through the deep
East Texas pineywoods.
</P>
<P>
   Once she took me with her, and I sat on the front steps until
dinnertime.
</P>
<P>
   We had been living with my grandmother Johnson at this time. My
dad had two younger brothers, the youngest only 7 years older than
I was. My grandfather Johnson had died soon after the youngest was
born.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we lived in a large house with several families.
Each family had a bedroom, but there was only one kitchen. Everyone
had kitchen privileges and there was a small individual table in
one large room.
</P>
<P>
   At breakfast time, I remember walking around the room to see who
I wanted to eat with.
</P>
<P>
   Later we built our own house on grandmother Johnson's 88 acres,
just down the hill from her house.
</P>
<P>
   Ours was a one-room house with a tarpaper roof, and we lived
there for the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   It had a front door and a back door and a little woodburning
stove. To the far side of the room was an open place in the floor
and wall. This is where we would build our mud fireplace and
chimney.
</P>
<P>
   A pine pole scaffold was erected next to the open hole in the
floor, and a mixture of mud and moss ``cats'' about the size of a
small loaf of bread were packed around the pole skeleton to form
the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside of the house a mud hearth replaced the hole in the
floor. I had my fourth birthday in this house.
</P>
<P>
   The winter of '29 was a bad one. Snow was up to the porch, maybe
15 inches high. Dad had to break the ice on the chicken troughs so
that they could get water.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard the expression ``ugly as a mud chimney.'' I have
often thought, ``Thank goodness for our ugly mud chimney.''
</P>
<P>
   It was here _ five miles south of Center, Texas, in this
one-room house with a tarpaper roof and a mud chimney, down the
hill from grandmother Johnson's log house, near a place called
Short -- that a beautiful baby girl came into this world on Oct. 6,
1929. My sister was given the name Wanda Jean. It rained all night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, on returning from the Navy after the big war was over,
I drove to the Short community and searched the pine and gum
thicket where the little house once stood.
</P>
<P>
   All I found was a three-foot high mound of clay that had been
our ugly mud chimney. As I stood there in the underbrush, tears
came into my eyes as I remembered the warmth and love that had
existed there for a little family of four, so very long ago.

   JERUSALEM _ Their common enemies are microscopic. Their team
consists of both Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has long been one field that crossed lines between
Israelis and Palestinians. Building on that tradition, the Kuvin
Centre(CQ) for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, based
at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has projects ranging
from Israel to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't know these things go on,'' said Dr. Sanford
Kuvin, a Palm Beach, Fla. infectious disease specialist who founded
the center in 1976. His explanation for the teamwork is simple:
``Mosquitoes don't recognize borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuvin, 70, knows mosquitoes. In 1962, he helped develop an
antibody test for malaria, a major breakthrough in detecting the
mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
   He has testified before the U.S. Congress about AIDS and
Hepatitis B policy. And he was the medical advisor to Kimberly
Bergalis, a Florida woman who died after becoming the first
confirmed case of a patient contracting AIDS from her dentist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Kuvin came to Israel to meet with colleagues and saw
the potential for research in a country with high medical standards
in a region with many tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He set up the center in 1976. It became a lead agency in the
fight against the Rift Valley Fever, which killed thousands of
Egyptians and threatened to eliminate Egypt's cattle stock in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between Israeli and Egyptian health workers
coincided with the peace process between their two countries.
Together, they vaccinated every head of cattle in Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, with money from the U.S. Agency for
International Development, the European Union and the German
Science Foundation, the Kuvin Centre has worked in several
countries e animals, including dogs, which are then infected and
carry the disease. Other flies spread it from the infected animals
to humans. There are cures, but they involve highly toxic drugs
that can damage organs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers collect sand fly larvae from the West Bank and
Israel, study the flies' behavior and genetic make-up. The goal is
to control the spread of the disease and find better cures.
</P>
<P>
   The project is based at the Kuvin Centre, but includes the
Palestinian Al-Quds University.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are applying for grant money to expand the
project, including a Palestinian clinic for treating and
researching the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abdeen, dean of research at Al-Quds and the Palestinian
coordinator on the project, said such cooperative projects used to
be frowned upon by other Palestinians. Now, with the school
involved in more than 52 joint projects, Palestinians recognize
that such efforts are ``good for Palestinians and good for the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all science,'' he said of his relations with his
Israeli peers. ``They get to know our attitudes, our culture.
Through collaboration you get to understanding, and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The skills Palestinians learn researching leishmaniasis can be
used on other diseases, improving the young crop of Palestinian
healthworkers in their new health system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel inferior. I have studied at some of the best
schools in the world. But, my system is inferior. We do not have
the facilities,'' Abdeen said.

   OLY-SWIMSUITS (Indianapolis) _ When the Olympic trials begin
here on Wednesday, American swimmers will make as much news for
what they are wearing as for what records they set in preparation
for the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia. A
bodysuit that fits athletes from neck to toe and comes with sleeves
has revolutionized the sport, reducing drag through the water. At
least 10 world records have been set worldwide this year in the new
swim suits. Speedo's versioon is called the Fastskin suit, which
contains tiny, v-shaped ridges that allow water to pass over the
swimmer more efficiently. The super-stretch fabric also compresses
a swimmer's muscles, therefore reducing the buildup of lactic acid
that causes fatigue. Swimmers also say the suit lifts them higher
in the water and makes it easier to stroke. By Jere Longman.

   NJ-BLUEBERRIES (Hammondton, N.J.) _ The inland heart of South
Jersey is a vast national preserve, a million acres of former ocean
bottom now a primeval terrain of craggy pines and impenetrable
forest scrub. It's strangely beautiful and fragrant flatland, but
not a first choice for those looking to reap great harvests. For
almost a century, however, farms large and small have done just
that. Sandwiched between showy Atlantic City and stately
Philadelphia, this part of South Jersey is prime blueberry country.
The lean, sandy and acidic soil here puts forth about 40 million
pounds of the tender fruit, enough to make the state second only to
Michigan in blueberry production. This summer's consistent,
merciful weather _ which was dismal for corn and tomatoes _ has
yielded the best harvest in recent memory here in Burlington
County. By Matt Lee and Ted Lee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sitting on a library shelf here is a 1977 report
by University of Texas researchers on ``colonias,'' the Spanish
name for the rural subdivisions near the Rio Grande where thousands
of people live in homes without drinking water or flush toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The picture the researchers painted is dramatic: isolated areas
marked by poverty, substandard housing and high rates of infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The colonias remain today. And the state government's failure to
eradicate them has become fodder for political battles, including
the current presidential race between Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the Republican nominee, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same things we found 25 years ago are still prevalent
today,'' said Jorge Garces, one of the researchers in 1977 who now
serves as the Texas secretary of state's border affairs manager.
``The same problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The endurance of the colonias, now home to an estimated 350,000
people, has plagued more than a generation of state politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Colonias began to proliferate in the 1950s on ``agriculturally
valueless'' property, such as land in floodplains, according to a
report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Developers sold small lots on land with little or no
infrastructure. The low-income buyers did not receive title to the
property until they made the final payment. They generally built
their own homes, many of which lacked electricity, plumbing and
other basics.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee recently produced a videotape
of the squalid conditions in colonias. The video challenges Bush's
claim to being a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record is more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of colonia residents have received water and sewer
connections during his five years in office, but most of the work
and funding was in place before he became governor. Bush has signed
legislation meant to prevent the proliferation of colonias, but has
not reached too deeply into the state treasury to finance the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He told his secretary of state to put a hard emphasis on the
issue, but waited four years into his term to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defends his record, pointing to projects under his watch to
hook up colonia residents to water and sewer lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is the first administration to aggressively pursue
hookups for the colonias,'' he said last month. ``We'll have
thousands of people (connected) who heretofore had no water or
sewer at their homes by the time my administration is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Secretary of State Elton Bomer threaded together $25
million in grants from the federal government and the North
American Development Bank to help low-income colonia residents pay
the $1,200 average cost for water and sewer connections.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1999, the program has brought potable water to 4,161 homes
and sewerage service to 7,948 homes, according to state
information.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Bush's predecessors who secured $600 million in bonds
to install water mains and sewer lines, and to build
water-treatment facilities. But the program stalled because
residents could not afford to pay for the final few feet of
3/4-inch pipe that would connect their homes to the water-delivery
system.
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing the country as a candidate for president, Bush has
made campaign stops in poor neighborhoods. But he never has toured
a colonia in his five years as governor, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's very unimportant,'' Bomer said. ``Governor Bush
is the only governor so far who has done anything for colonias in a
substantial way _ not just lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, state lawmakers created the Texas Bootstrap Loan
Program to assist low-income Texans who either are building new
homes or fixing existing ones. The state housing department
received $5.6 million over two years to fund the program. Bush has
promoted the plan as an important accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say he could have done more.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers originally proposed a $20 million program, which would
have passed if Bush aides had indicated the governor approved of
it, said John Henneberger, co-director of the nonprofit Texas Low
Income Housing Information Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a poor reflection on the state's commitment to do
anything with the colonias,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Bush dispute this and said the governor supported the
Bootstrap program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more case of trying to blame the governor,''
said Jane Dees, spokeswoman for Bomer.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush signed the pared-down bill into law in June 1999, the
program has sputtered. The first of five contracts with local
nonprofit agencies that will administer the loans was signed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we would love to have this done a lot faster,''
said Homero Cabello Jr., director of the state Office of Colonias
Initiatives. ``Because it was new, we did spend a little more time
than anticipated to get the contracts out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the agency has been accused of moving slowly on the loan
program, the Office of Colonias Initiatives received the federal
Hammer Award a year ago in recognition of ``government that works
better and costs less.'' A framed certificate sits in the reception
area outside Cabello's Austin office.
</P>
<P>
   It is signed by Gore.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's presidential race isn't the first time colonias have been
in the political spotlight. Bush used the plight of colonia
residents as an issue in his successful bid to unseat Democratic
Gov. Ann Richards in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years later, opponents are firing back at the
Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about compassion and turn your back on the
colonias,'' said Jenny Backus of the Democratic National Committee,
whose videotape shows shacks made of plywood and tin and lays out
the lack of electricity, running water and sewage systems in a
colonia in the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Bomer said Bush has done anything but turn his back on colonias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the border, or Appalachia, Tennessee?'' he said in
reference to a poverty-stricken area of Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is blaming him (Gore) for the poverty in Appalachia.
... You won't see us blaming him for that. It's ridiculous, just
like it's ridiculous to blame Bush for poverty along the border
we've had for the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers point out that Texas had a record budget surplus
in 1999, but very little of it went to colonias. Additionally, a
proposal to commit significant funds to the colonias _ a
constitutional amendment to sell $100 million in bonds to finance
affordable housing _ died in the Texas House.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., a Democrat from Brownsville, credits
Bush for supporting his bill to close loopholes that allowed
colonias to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   But referring to the $1.7 billion tax cut that bush pushed
through the Legislature, Lucio said: ``Should we have used those
resources to build schools or help colonias? I would rather do that
than get a $60 or $80 tax credit as a citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters say his achievements are in plain sight. ``If
someone is asserting the problem is solved, I would sure disagree
with that,'' said state Sen. David Sibley, a Republican from Waco.
``But if someone wants to assert that the governor has done
nothing, I would sure disagree with that also.''

 &HT;    Barbecue guru mixes up marinades, sauces
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - When Steven Raichlen came to my house to cook, he
whipped up a lovely lunch. Two kinds of grilled chicken, one with a
spicy rub that he basted with his impromptu mop sauce and a
barbecue sauce he fixed in a jiffy. But the best part of lunch was
the marinated chicken breast.
</P>
<P>
   For that he made a freehand version of a marinade that's a star
in his ``Barbecue! Bible: Sauces, Rubs and Marinades, Bastes,
Butters &AMP; Glazes'' (Workman, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   He used a different mixture of herbs he snipped from my garden
and more garlic than called for in the recipe. He substituted limes
that I had on hand for the lemons that I didn't. He also spooned in
some hot Thai chile garlic paste he found in my refrigerator. This
only goes to show that you can tinker with the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   I've used the marinade several times since _ it's as successful
on chicken seared on the kitchen stove as it is on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   As Raichlen says, the virtue of this marinade is its freshness;
use it within one or two hours of making it. Stir again before
using.
</P>
<P>
   THE ONLY MARINADE YOU'LL EVER NEED
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 cup
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon hot pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cracked black
</P>
<P>
   pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea salt)
</P>
<P>
   4 strips lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil, cilantro, dill or oregano,
or a mix
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Combine the lemon juice, hot pepper flakes, cracked pepper and
salt in a glass, ceramic or stainless steel bowl. Whisk until the
salt crystals are dissolved. Add the lemon zest, garlic, parsley
and basil. Stir or whisk in the olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Our mix included tarragon, lemon thyme, lemon basil and sage.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lemon marinade is best freshly made, rubs can be made
ahead and in quantity to have on hand. Raichlen's rubs range from a
sweet and smoky Kansas City rub to a steak rub without a lick of
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Figure on using 2 to 4 teaspoons rub per pound of meat. Let the
spices work their cure in boneless chicken breasts and fish fillets
for 30 to 90 minutes, steaks and chops for one to three hours and
on ribs or whole chickens four hours to overnight.
</P>
<P>
   This steak rub is also good on roasts, brisket, pork, chicken
and even seafood, Raichlen says.
</P>
<P>
   LONE STAR STEAK RUB
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 3/4 cups
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cracked or coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup paprika
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pure chile
</P>
<P>
   powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   Combine ingredients and store in a covered jar, away from light
and heat. It will keep for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Pure chile powder is not the same thing as supermarket chili
powder, which includes cumin and other ingredients. Look for pure
chile powder at specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   Mop sauces, so named because the pit jockeys actually use a
clean cotton floor mop to apply the sauce to large quantities of
ribs and pork shoulders, may be the holy water of the barbecue
religion. At home, barbecue cooks can use a spray bottle.

   Grill tips
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is going to grill can benefit from these tips from
Steven Raichlen:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Invest in an inexpensive chimney starter for your charcoal
grill. That lighter fluid, used by almost 50 percent of grillers,
smells up the neighborhood as well as your food. Who wants to eat
anything that tastes like petroleum?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Build a three-step fire, dividing the grill in thirds. Have a
deep bed of hot coals, at least two coals deep, and another shallow
bed of coals. Leave a third of the space open. This allows you to
sear meat over hot coals, then cook over medium heat or indirect
heat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wait until the coals are hot to add the grate. Let it heat.
That's the time to take a stiff wire brush to grate. Then fold
paper towel into a pad, hold it in tongs and dip it in oil; use the
pad to oil the grate. That not only lubricates the grate but takes
off the last smudges of residue from the last cookout. You'll be
surprised at what comes off on the towel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try a triple-flavoring approach to grilling meats and poultry.
First, use a rub. Put it on, rub it in and let it rest for a couple
hours. While cooking, baste with a mop sauce. In the last five
minutes, brush on a barbecue sauce.

 &HT;    Grill talk
 &HT;    Love the flavor, but leave the barbecuing for the boys
 &HT;    
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To: Steven Raichlen, author of ``Barbecue! Bible: Sauces, Ribs
and Marinades `` (Workman, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   From: Ann Heller, Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Dear Steven:
</P>
<P>
   Just a note to let you know that your chicken breasts were very
good _ well, as good as chicken breasts can be.
</P>
<P>
   And I appreciated your one-on-one backyard lesson in the art of
grilling. Although I'm a cook _ and a pretty good one, I think _ I
don't grill. Most women don't. Generally we pass the marinated meat
to the male sitting on the other side of the kitchen counter and
let him light the fire and man the grill (no pun intended).
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get into gender stereotyping here. Actually I
think the roles are a matter of function, not sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
   I know there are exceptions to the rule, but most home cooks are
women. And we don't have time to stand at the grill watching meat
sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   It's the cook in the house who does it all, from setting the
table and slicing the bread to cooking the potatoes and beans and
maybe making dessert and coffee and possibly pouring the wine. Not
to diminish your skills, but the grill cook generally does just one
thing. (You did impress me with the side dishes, the grilled corn
and roasted red pepper and bruschetta, but let's be honest _ you're
a professional at the grill.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you were an inspiration, so I gave it a try. First baby
back ribs, nicely seasoned with the extra rub you left in the
kitchen. I guess my fire was too hot, for they cooked much too
quickly. Your leftover Coca-Cola barbecue sauce helped mask the
result.
</P>
<P>
   The next night I tried chicken, just the way you fixed it, with
The Only Marinade You'll Ever Need. I'd forgotten I was supposed to
be going out for dinner, and when my friend arrived I told her I
was grilling and we'd have dinner at my house. She stopped dead in
her tracks. She also comes from the I-Don't-Grill-School. She
decided to make a couple business calls nearby and left me to
struggle on alone.
</P>
<P>
   I spread the coals, creating the three-tiered fire you suggest.
The fire was a bit too hot so I slipped back into the kitchen to
fix the basil pesto for the zucchini I was going to grill
alongside.
</P>
<P>
   I gathered the basil and got out the blender, and I admit, I did
get distracted and decided to set the table and peel the salad
tomatoes. By then the fire had burned down. I added more charcoal
and soon had another roaring fire. The dinner hour was roaring on,
too, so I hurried to grill the zucchini. They skittered across
theand get a crust you'd envy. Ditto the salmon, and sometimes I
give it the benefit of one of those rubs like you love. I can do it
while cooking three other things, and do it in air-conditioned
comfort while my downdraft exhaust takes care of the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll let anyone so inclined do their cooking on my grill.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes you the next time you're in town.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Ann

 &HT;    Kermit Lynch's life work makes him an importer extraordinaire
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Wine drinkers (wine writers, too) in these parts
tend to focus only about those who produce wines and rarely about
those who import them. Their names are usually tucked away on the
back of the bottles, in fine print, ignored by the vast majority
who choose a wine by the ``name'' on the front of the label.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should start turning those bottles around.
</P>
<P>
   One importer who has carved a name for himself above the others
is Kermit Lynch, a wine fanatic who spends half the year in France
and half in Berkeley, Calif., where he runs a retail shop. When not
running the shop, Lynch is tending to his import business, focusing
on French wines of character and breeding, many from relatively
obscure regions of France, and virtually all distinctive and
delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is an immensely talented wine writer: If his book,
``Adventures on the Wine Route'' (Noonday, $15), doesn't make you
want to drop everything and spend a year in France soaking up wine
and rustic food, then your heart is not beating. But his single
greatest accomplishment in the wine business _ at least from the
consumer standpoint _ lies in transportation. Lynch was a pioneer
in insisting that his wines be shipped from Europe in refrigerated
containers so they wouldn't get cooked and ruined while baking in
the hulls of ships as the vessels snaked through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever tasted an Alsatian white from Zind-Humbrecht, or
a Chateauneuf du Pape from Vieux Telegraphe or a Bandol rose or red
from Domaine Tempier, you have benefited from Lynch's life work.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lynch's regional sales director, W. Matthew Cain,
stopped in Dayton on a typically whirlwind tour, and the wines he
brought to sample illustrated why Lynch's name on the back of the
bottle is among the closest things to a quality guarantee as you'll
get in selecting French wines. Wines such as the 1998 Chateau
Graville Lacoste (a $14.69 dry white Bordeaux made from semillon
and sauvignon blanc), a super-rich 1996 Clos La Coutale Cahors
($11.99 dry red made of malbec, merlot and tannat), a Burgundylike
1998 Domaine Diochon Moulin-a-Vent from Beaujolais ($19.69) and the
finest dry (and I do mean dry) rose in the world, the 1999 Domaine
Tempier ($24.69), all represent the finest expressions of the wines
from their regions.
</P>
<P>
   There are other fine French-wine importers whose names on the
bottle usually translate into high quality _ Alain Junguenet,
Robert Kacher, Weygandt-Metzler. But Lynch seems to add an extra
dose of passion.
</P>
<P>
   Makes the back of the bottle worth reading.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wine of the week: 1998 Vega Sindoa Merlot ($9.99). Mmmm, a
ripe, rich, robust dry red from Spain that emphasizes the cherryike
fruit of merlot but has just enough tannin and other components to
keep it in balance. This simply blows away its precious few
American competitors in its price range. For merlot fanciers,
there's a lot to like here.

<P>
   Melon with port is a traditional combination in France, the wine
served in half a Cavaillon or other melon, but I always thought it
could be improved. The color is not appealing to me, because the
beautiful pastel shades of the melons are lost in the deep
red-purple of the wine. Port is also too strong, overwhelming the
taste of the fruit. To me, this wine goes better with chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   But I wanted to serve melon in the summer, so I thought of
matching it with Champagne. I was raised in the Champagne region
and love the wine's beautiful delicate color, bubbles and
celebratory feel.
</P>
<P>
   First, I made a simple melon soup by pureeing the flesh of
cantaloupe and honeydew, and adding lemon for a touch of acidity
and a little sugar to heighten the sweetness. I serve this in a
scooped-out cantaloupe half with melon balls and raspberry ice
cubes, which keep the melon cool without diluting the soup. The ice
cubes are actually ball-shaped, which makes them look like
watermelon. The cubes add color and another flavor dimension to the
soup, which is quite intense: they make it taste like a kir royale.
</P>
<P>
   The way we serve the soup is striking: after people are sitting
at the table and have the melon in front of them, we pour in the
Champagne. The aroma comes to your mouth and the bubbles make it
alive. The first taste is of Champagne; the second of almost
cassis, like a kir.
</P>
<P>
   The raspberry balls are made by freezing strained fresh
raspberry juice in decorative trays. I garnish them with julienne
mint sprinkled with sugar, which makes the leaves look iced.
</P>
<P>
   I keep raspberry cubes in the freezer for more than just this
soup. You can also drop them into a glass of Champagne or a
martini.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPAGNE MELON SOUP WITH RASPBERRY ICE BALLS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus freezing time
</P>
<P>
   2 cups raspberries
</P>
<P>
   Sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 ripe honeydew melon
</P>
<P>
   2 ripe cantaloupes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   12 large mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a blender, combine raspberries with 4 tablespoons water.
Puree until smooth. Line a strainer with cheesecloth, and set over
a bowl. Pour in puree, and twist cloth to squeeze out puree. Stir
in 4 teaspoons of sugar, or to taste. Spoon mixture into an ice
cube tray that makes round balls or another decorative shape.
Freeze until firm.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut honeydew melon in half, and remove seeds. Using a melon
baller, remove flesh from melon to within } inch of peel. Set aside
melon balls. Using a large spoon, scrape out and reserve remaining
flesh. Discard peels.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cut cantaloupe in half, using a straight cut or saw-toothed
design. Remove seeds. Using a melon baller, remove flesh to within
\ inch of peel; reserve any extra flesh. Cut off bottoms of
cantaloupes so they stand securely. In a large bowl, mix honeydew
and cantaloupe melon balls with lemon juice. Place an equal amount
of melon balls in each melon half, and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a blender, puree any honeydew or cantaloupe flesh that has
not been shaped into balls. Press through a fine strainer, and add
2 teaspoons of sugar. Refrigerate if desired.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, spoon 2 tablespoons of melon puree over melon balls
in each cantaloupe half. Allow to sit at room temperature for 30
minutes. Meanwhile, cut mint leaves into very thin strips, and dust
lightly with sugar. Arrange 4 raspberry balls in each melon half,
and sprinkle with mint. Set each melon half in a soup bowl. At the
table pour Champagne directly into cantaloupe halves, and allow to
fizz out and over cantaloupes.

OREGON STEPS OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCMINNVILLE, Ore. _ Every few years, I like to come here to the
Willamette Valley to check up on the Oregon wine business.
</P>
<P>
   I could do it in New York, I guess; tasting a lot of wines and
talking to the winemakers by phone. But it's not the same as being
here and, to be honest, it's certainly not as much fun. By staying
home, I'd miss the International Pinot Noir Celebration, a
free-spirited yearly gathering in this town in the heart of the
Oregon wine country.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the owners and winemakers of 34 Oregon wineries
turned up at the end of July for the three-day gathering on the
campus of Linfield College. Joining them were winemakers from
California, Burgundy, Alsace, Australia, New Zealand and British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Pinot noir, which is the red wine grape of Burgundy, is slowly
taking an honored place in the rest of the world. Over the last
three decades, it has become the principal red wine grape in
Oregon, too.
</P>
<P>
   When I first visited the Willamette Valley in the 1970s, there
was little more than a handful of wineries, most of them
underfinanced and overshadowed by their already glamorous
California colleagues. There were a few hundred acres of pinot noir
grapes. It is a frustratingly difficult grape to grow, and there
were plenty of experts around ready to write off the grape, and by
inference the Oregon wine industry as well.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Oregon, there are 150 wineries, ranging from modest,
artisanal producers Like Eyrie Vineyards, where it all started, to
big California-style wineries, like King Estate in Eugene, rivaling
in size and output almost anything in the Napa Valley. What's more,
business is thriving. For every new winery under construction,
dozens of investors are putting money into new vineyards. There are
10,000 acres of wine grapes in the state with thousands more
scheduled for planting, growers here say.
</P>
<P>
   Land prices have shot up, from around $4,000 an acre 10 years
ago to at least $20,000 an acre now. But that's still less than
half of what they would cost in the prime grape-growing areas of
California.
</P>
<P>
   What makes success particularly sweet for the Oregonians is the
fact that, rather quietly, the Californians are coming up to join
them. Recent arrivals include the dynamic Benziger family, who have
60 acres of Oregon land in pinot noir and expect to release their
first Oregon wines in a year or two. Tony Soter, one of the Napa
Valley's legendary winemakers at Spotteswood and more recently at
Etude, also has a vineyard here, producing 9,000 cases of Oregon
pinot noir a year. Benton Lane, founded by the veteran Napa Valley
winemaker Carl Doumani, is another acclaimed Oregon winery with a
California antecedent.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon winemakers _ the pioneers, anyway _ never let anyone
forget that when the famous Burgundy producer Joseph Drouhin
decided to invest in America, it was the red hills of Oregon rather
than the valleys of California that became home for Domaine Drouhin
Oregon. Many local winemakers believe it was the arrival of Drouhin
in 1988 that gave the budding Oregon industry the self-assurance
and the credibility it needed. The French winemaker is such a
fixture in the region that it has been afforded the nickname DDO,
much as the famed Domaine de la Romanee-Conti in Burgundy is called
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
   Like the region itself, the Oregon celebration is a militantly
informal gathering. Notebooks, furrowed brows and studious
expressions are discouraged. Which does not preclude the overall
impression that Oregon pinot noirs have come of age. Caught in such
a profusion of delicious wines, it would have been sheer
recklessness to announce that this one was obviously from Oregon,
that one from the Cote de Beaune, that one from Carneros or the
Anderson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an Oregon style? Yes, Oregon pinots are leaner and less
full-bodied that the California versions. And perhaps less
delicate, less velvety than many Burgundies. But no sooner does one
deliver that sort of pronouncement here then someone appears with a
bottle saying ``Try this,'' and another hypothesis bites the dust.
</P>
<P>
   If any trait has developed over the years I've been coming here,
it is consistency. It appeared in the vertical tastings of Ponzi
Vineyards and Domaine Drouhin going back to 1980 in the case of
Ponzi and 1988 with Drouhin. I remember it, too, from a vertical
tasting several years ago of David Lett's Eyrie Vineyards going
back even further. His first wines were made in the late 1960's.
</P>
<P>
   While Oregon is known particularly for its pinot noirs, the
state's winegrowers are also constantly experimenting with other
varieties. There is quite a bit of chardonnay around, but Oregon
pinot gris is a wine to single out. It's got the weight of
chardonnay but (usually) without the oak and cloying sweetness.
Some of its boosters claim that it was invented to go with another
local commodity: salmon.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that not only the Oregonians are making fine
pinot noir these days. Thanks to the the gathering here, I
discovered a remarkable New Zealand pinot, a 1999 from the Felton
Road winery in Central Otago. Another came from, of all places, the
Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. It was a 1997 from Blue
Mountain Vineyard and Cellars. Then, too, there was the 1998
Nuits-St.-Georges Premier Cru, Clos de Forets-St.-Georges, from the
Domaine de l'Arlot, but that's another column. &QL;

AFTER 7 YEARS OFF, SWIMMER RETURNS AT 33 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Some people leave tickets for Elvis at sporting
events. The swimmer Dara Torres leaves them for Alfonse D'Amato.
The man once known wryly as Senator Pothole has apparently became
Senator Swimming Hole.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is one of the more remarkable stories at the Olympic
trials, which begin here on Wednesday. Having earned two gold
medals on American relay teams, she retired after her third Summer
Games in 1992 and did not swim competitively for seven years,
becoming instead a fashion model, television commentator,
spokeswoman for the Tae-Bo workout infomercials and the first
athlete to appear in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the 6-foot, 160-pound Torres decided to resume her
swimming career. She is trying to become the first American to swim
in four Olympics. And in a sport often given over to teen-agers,
she is swimming faster than ever at age 33, having overcome the
rust of a long layoff and a battle with bulimia that left her
forcing herself to throw up even during the 1988 Summer Games in
Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As she began her comeback, Torres said she met D'Amato, the
former U.S. senator from New York, on an airplane, and they began
talking about his granddaughter's swimming achievements. They
became friends, she said, and D'Amato even attended one of her
meets in suburban Washington and helped her get an endorsement deal
with Speedo. She got him tickets for the Olympic trials, but a
business commitment will keep him away, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's almost like a father figure, an awesome friend,'' Torres
said.
</P>
<P>
   What D'Amato will miss is one of the most unlikely resurgent
careers in sport. It is exceedingly rare, perhaps unprecedented,
for a swimmer to resume a career at an elite level seven years
after having ended it. Yet, Torres this summer has set an American
record of 24.73 seconds in the 50-meter freestyle and has become a
medal candidate next month at the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Torres will swim three freestyle events and the 100-meter
butterfly at the trials, which has ratcheted up the competitive
tension in the women's sprints. This is where the United States has
its greatest depth: Torres; Jenny Thompson, a five-time Olympic
relay champion; Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals at the
Atlanta Olympics; and Angel Martino, who has won six Olympic medals
over a long career.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken said she was very surprised at how fast Torres was
able to come back. ``I think it's great for the sport,'' Van Dyken
said. ``It's wonderful that she's showing people in their 30s can
be better than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Torres trained with Thompson at Stanford University
with Coach Richard Quick, who is also head coach of the U.S.
women's Olympic team. Last December, it was decided that the two
swimmers should train at different times because, as Quick said,
Torres and Thompson were trying to swim an Olympic final every day
in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Torres agreed with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are training for the same event, every day, twice a
day, both going after the same thing and only one is going to get
there, it can be very intense,'' Torres said. ``We're friends.
We're not like enemies. I just think, in a way, it's better to keep
us apart so there wouldn't be as much intensity in the workouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the comeback? A friend had planted the seed in her head,
Torres said, and it began to blossom. ``I couldn't get it out of my
head,'' she said. On July 7, 1999, she jumped back into the pool,
believing that her long legs and elegant stroke would serve her as
well as they had early in her career. Quick took one look at her
form and said, ``We don't swim like that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He changed her style, having Torres look at the bottom of the
pool instead of straight ahead. And he taught her to gain power
from the beginning of her stroke instead of the end.
</P>
<P>
   She hired a personal trainer and changed her diet, eating more
protein for muscle enhancement instead of carbo-loading as she had
in the past. She also does flexibility training that involves two
men walking on her back and her legs _ mashing, she calls it _ to
relax her muscles before and after she swims. The new Speedo
bodysuits also help reduce drag in the water and are said to
improve performances by up to 3 percent, which can be significant
in races decided by hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the tarnished history of women's swimming that any
spectacular performance brings the inevitable suspicion of drug
use. Torres said she had spoken to Quick recently about how
skepticism had come to cloud great achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad,'' Torres said. ``Why do people have to emphasize
drugs because someone does something really fast? I don't have
words to describe it. It infuriates me. People think that because
drugs are used so much in sport. Everyone has a conscience; for me,
I know I've done everything I can do to get where I am the right
way. I'm ready to swim fast.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter cheating in the sport, Torres said, she and Thompson
work with Glen Luepnitz, a physician and nutritionist who has
devised a regimen of legal supplements and amino acids that produce
quick recovery from hard workouts and build muscle during tapering
for competitions. ``He keeps us up with people who are cheating
without cheating,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   As a recovering bulimic, she admitted that she became unnerved
at first when she packed 20 pounds of new muscle onto her frame.
``I don't think you're ever completely over it,'' Torres said. ``It
freaked me out. Then I said, `No, it's muscle, you need that.'
Everything is in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   And pointing toward a medal in Sydney. &QL;

STANDING IN FOR BASIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like pesto, tapenade is an all-purpose sauce based on a single
pungent ingredient. The Provencal olive paste can be used as a dip
for raw vegetables, a spread for bread or a flavorful partner for
anything from grilled shrimp or fish to chicken. I especially like
to add it for heft and taste to an easy salad of tomato, basil and
mozzarella. And then the salad itself can be taken to another level
by spooning it onto grilled bread to make a quick bruschetta or
even onto pasta as an uncooked sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Tapenade is a welcome change from pesto at this time of year,
but it also has the distinct advantage of being easy to make year
round. Unlike fresh basil, olives are always in season. The base is
almost always black olives in brine, which are better for this
sauce than oil-cured olives. Green olives make an interesting
alternative, though. Tapenade is usually spiked with anchovies and
capers, although I find that one or the other is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   California ripe olives are not great for tapenade, but there are
literally tons of good, inexpensive olives from Italy, Greece,
Spain and France. Avoid those that have been seasoned, because the
best tapenade is dominated by the strong flavor of olives and
little else.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest way to pit them is to press them with the flat side
of a knife or the bottom of a skillet so that the olive splits and
can be pulled off the pit. To make the puree, a mortar and pestle
produces the perfect texture, but a blender or food processor is
quicker and easier. The best texture for tapenade is slightly
chunky, not creamy.
</P>
<P>
   The salad itself is fairly straightforward, although I cut the
tomatoes into wedges and the mozzarella into chunks instead of
slices. It can be varied by using a good fresh sheep's milk cheese
or thin slices of Parmigiano-Reggiano in place of the mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to use the salad as a sauce for pasta, cut the
mozzarella very small.
</P>
<P>
   TOMATO SALAD WITH TAPENADE
</P>
<P>
   Total: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 ripe medium tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces pitted black olives, about 1 cup
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets or 1 teaspoon capers, or both
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   { pound mozzarella, preferably fresh
</P>
<P>
   { cup shredded or roughly chopped basil
</P>
<P>
   1. Core the tomatoes, and cut them into eighths. Salt them
lightly, and let sit while you make the tapenade.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the olives, anchovies or capers, vinegar, oil and 1
tablespoon water in a blender or small food processor. Blend until
pureed, but not too fine. Add more water if necessary; the mixture
should be fairly loose. Taste the puree and add salt and pepper as
you like.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cut the mozzarella into chunks and toss with the tomatoes and
about half the tapenade; season with salt and pepper if necessary
and add more tapenade to taste. Garnish with basil and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

THAI SECRETS, FOR COOKS WITH TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The challenge for Su-Mei Yu, a Chinese woman who was born in
Thailand and grew up there, was to explain Thai cooking and to try
to simplify it for the American home cook without compromising its
authenticity. In her book, ``Cracking the Coconut: Classic Thai
Home Cooking'' (William Morrow, $30), she does a first-rate job of
getting to the heart of this complex and compelling cuisine, for
which there are so few good cookbooks, and making it
understandable. But simplify it? That's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, who has lived in the United States since she was 15 and now
owns a restaurant, Saffron, in San Diego, provides a collection of
vibrant recipes, which, if followed in traditional Thai fashion,
become a fascinating weekend's adventure. The first time I opened
this book I embarked on a far-flung shopping expedition for
fermented shrimp paste and various fresh and dried chilies and
herbs before settling in for an afternoon's and evening's workout.
I finally put an excellent moderately spicy chicken stew with
jasmine rice and a refreshingly tangy green papaya salad on the
table at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is not a book for cooks primarily looking
for a quick and easy menu for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation of the basic seasoning pastes, for example, cannot
be hurried. They are best made in a good-size stone mortar, with
each of the 10 or 12 ingredients, some of which are toasted first,
added in succession while the cook pounds away. You think the
mixture will never come around, but then, after a good 30 minutes,
you have the paste you need. (Occasionally a food processor is
suggested instead of the stone mortar for making short work of a
bunch of ingredients, but Yu warns that the result will not have
perfect complexity, subtlety and texture.)
</P>
<P>
   In preparing fresh coconut milk, one step requires squeezing
ground coconut through a cloth 89 times, a Thai tradition. Why not
90 times, or 40? For a task that only the most determined cooks are
likely to tackle anyway, the author does not offer an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, fussy about her ingredients, grudgingly accepts lime zest as
a substitute for shredded kaffir lime leaves, and ginger in place
of fresh galangal, a similar rhizome. She doesn't even suggest the
coconut oil that is so common in Thai cooking (some recipes call
for olive oil), and she allows tinned coconut milk as a substitute
for fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her recipes require an immensely detailed shopping list,
with some ingredients, like lemon grass and jasmine rice, often
sold in supermarkets, and others, like nam pla sauce and green
papayas, available only in Asian markets or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The author tries to reassure the cook that all this shopping and
preparation is easy and simple. But no cookbook can be called
simple if it recommends 30 minutes of pounding in a mortar or
washing and trimming the tiny roots from a bunch of cilantro and
then mincing them.
</P>
<P>
   Yu's contribution has been to make Thai cooking interesting and
thoroughly satisfying. In that vein, she explains how Thai cuisine
has evolved over hundreds of years, absorbing influences from other
Asian kitchens, the Arab world and the West. She devotes chapters
to the cuisine's essential components like coconut, rice, seasoning
blends, curries and salads.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking techniques in this book are not difficult, just
time-consuming, and the recipes are not as complicated as
assembling a galantine or making a gateau St.-Honore. It certainly
helps to have some of the proper equipment, like a roomy mortar, a
spice mill and a Chinese cleaver. I happen to own an authentic
wooden Thai coconut grater in the shape of a rabbit (the business
end is its nasty iron tongue), which I took from its spot on a
display shelf for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of recipes are relatively quick to prepare, among them
grilled lobster salad, shrimp with bamboo shoots and grilled tuna
with green mango. I even dared omit some of the garnishes, like
green beans in the spicy green papaya salad, and never missed them.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, you have to be ready for a serious
kitchen session to produce dishes that you are unlikely to find in
a Thai restaurant, like the rich green curry and coconut soup with
corn-studded meatballs, or the fiery keang chu-chi shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   For the beef and green papaya stew, Yu even says that ``the
secret is patience.'' That about sums up the book, but the effort
is not wasted.

THE KING OF SILICON VALLEY INVESTMENT BANKING 
</HEADLINE>

Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales representative

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By ADAM LASHINSKY  
 c.2000 TheStreet.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Talking with Frank Quattrone, the grand pooh-bah
of Silicon Valley investment banking, is a lot like shooting the
breeze with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Each has made gazillions on
the decade-long drunken orgy of Silicon Valley success, each is one
of the recognized leaders in his field with an ego to match, and
each is willing to speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone runs Credit Suisse First Boston's technology practice,
one of the rare Wall Street shops that allows the research
department to report directly to the head of investment banking. No
artifice here: Quattrone's outfit unabashedly combines aggressive
banking with supportive research.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to miss an opportunity for publicity, Quattrone
gathered some new-media scribes to a sit-down last Friday at the
Sheraton Palace Hotel to coincide with a get-together of his
worldwide team.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda was some good old-fashioned chest-thumping with a
dollop of insight on tech stocks. The insight won't necessarily
make you money, but it may help you understand this craziness a
little better.
</P>
<P>
   As the banker who took Cisco Systems public in 1990, Quattrone
justifiably likes to equate his success with that of Silicon
Valley. He worked his way up at Morgan Stanley, ultimately becoming
the first banker with a bulge-bracket firm (the giant,
full-service, global New York kind) to establish a Valley-based
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Every other bank followed his lead _ several years later.
</P>
<P>
   His team managed the initial public offering of Amazon.com in
1997, after the group had jumped the previous year to what then was
known as Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
</P>
<P>
   In what could become the team's latest signature deal, CSFB led
the recent $1.1-billion offering for Corvis, a communications
equipment company that hasn't recorded any revenue and yet already
is worth $36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So, given that it took Cisco years and years to get to that
valuation, how, pray tell, could Corvis and companies like it ever
be more than trading opportunities for investors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have seen how big these companies can become,
especially if you become the category leader,'' says Quattrone. ``I
think investors want call options on that.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that when Cisco went public, nobody was convinced
a new equipment company could achieve $200 million in annual
revenue. Corvis, according to the filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, already has several orders from network
service providers of at least $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   But then Quattrone's truth gene kicks in. He points out that
when Cisco went public a decade ago, Morgan Stanley priced the deal
at 18 times the company's 1990 earnings estimates. Corvis, in
contrast, priced its IPO at 49 times expected revenue _ two years
out.
</P>
<P>
   For Quattrone it's about profits in mergers and acquisitions.
His M&AMP;A guru, George Boutros _ who wasn't present Friday _ is
widely acknowledged to be one of Wall Street's shrewdest
negotiators. He's the guy hotly pursued companies turn to when they
want to sell their companies for top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And tech-oriented dealmaking is on fire. There have been more
deals, worth nearly as much money, so far this year as in all of
last year. And each year since 1993 has made the previous year look
paltry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if CSFB has been a part of taking too many ill-prepared
companies public, Quattrone allows that ``we've been searching our
souls about that.'' Never mind that Quattrone's assertion would be
predicated on the assumption that investment bankers have souls.
The answer is in the numbers. Too many public companies leads
ineluctably to outsized opportunities for M&AMP;A. That's how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone acknowledges that ``everyone is looking to see if the
venture guys will repeat their mistakes of the 1980s, when they
made lots of me-too investments and returns went to the single
digits. We're monitoring that carefully and seeing no evidence
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   I've seen evidence: the online pet sector, online weddings,
business-to-business anything _ even the hottest of the hot,
optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   This is the beauty of being a full-service investment bank. ``If
somebody explains their business to us once, we don't want to make
them go through that painful process again,'' quips Quattrone.
Translation: We'll arrange the funding when it's an idea, take them
public as soon as we can, do a secondary if the markets allow and
sell them when they've crapped out.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that top bankers like Quattrone are playing a
numbers game. They do a volume business, but they also deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies they've taken public that would not have
been funded according to the old rules are Commerce One and
Phone.com. Those two have made both institutional and plain old
retail investors gobs of money.
</P>
<P>
   And the beat goes on. For now.

<P>
   MARLBORO-MUSIC (Marlboro, Vt.) _ We've been trying to figure out
what to call this thing for 50 years,'' Frank Salomon said of the
venerable Marlboro Music School and Festival, which ends its 50th
season here August 13 with a public concert. ``It is not what
people customarily think of either as a school or as a festival.''
True, it is an odd school that has no teachers or students; only
participants, as they are called, some with much experience, some
with little, purposefully mixed and working together in rehearsals
and performances of chamber music. The learning is in the doing.
And it is an odd festival that determines its concert programs only
a week or so in advance, trusting listeners to travel from far and
wide all unknowing, and to welcome whatever pieces and performers
happen to come around. By James R. Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   YIDDISH-PINAFORE-THEATER (New York) _ The good ship Pinafore
looks familiar enough, with its big nautical steering wheel at
center stage, but why is it flying the Israeli flag? The tunes are
Arthur Sullivan's good old tunes, but what's with the lyrics? ``Ich
bin der keynig fun dem yam.'' What happened to ``I am the monarch
of the sea?'' Welcome to the Gilbert and Sullivan Yiddish Light
Opera Company's production of ``Der Yiddisher Pinafore,'' currently
anchored at Manhattan's New 14th Street Y. By Julius Novick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-FILMS (New York) _ For five weeks, through Sept. 14,
Film Forum is showing some wonderful foreign classics made in the
years 1945-65, everything from ``Children of Paradise'' and ``Open
City'' to ``The Seventh Seal'' and ``Breathless.'' The series is
titled ``The Golden Age of the Foreign Film,'' a challenging claim;
it sounds almost too good to be true. By Phillip Lopate.
</P>
<P>
   STANLEY-TONG-FILM (Hong Kong) _ When Stanley Tong left his
hometown for Hollywood in 1996, Hong Kong's film industry was
headed for a crack-up as spectacular as anything in a Jackie Chan
movie. Box office revenue was plummeting, scripts were threadbare
and rampant piracy was driving a whole generation of movie-watchers
away from theaters. Now, Tong has returned to Hong Kong and is back
on familiar ground _ shooting an action film about the Chinese
police busting a smuggling ring. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADER-DANCE (New York) _ In the show ``Wanted:
X-Cheerleaders,'' a squad of 10 real-life ex-cheerleaders rant and
cheer about women's issues. Their routines, which feature flying
pompoms, kicks and jumps, are at once authentic cheerleading drills
and carefully choreographed movement. Although ``X-Cheerleaders''
may or may not fall under the rubric of contemporary dance, it is
exactly the kind of movement-dominated performance that is carving
out a niche in the New York International Fringe Festival, which
will envelop the Lower East Side for 12 days beginning on August
16. By Kevin Giordano.
</P>
<P>
   TROCKS-DANCE (New York) _ What renowned American classical
ballet company garnered enough engagements in 1999 to employ its
dancers for an impressive 41 weeks? The Joffrey Ballet, maybe?
American Ballet Theater? No, it was Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte
Carlo, fondly known as the Trocks, home of bulldozing etoiles like
Olga Supphozova and Ida Nevasayneva. The company, opening at the
Joyce Theater on August 15, will present two repertory programs
consisting primarily of Slavic chestnuts, including the New York
premiere of an impeccably affected ``Raymonda's Wedding,'' coached
by Elena Kunikova. By Joseph Carman.

<P>
   NC-DANCE-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ Dance is getting itself happily
mixed up. Some choreographers are having a ball with rock 'n' roll
and all that jazz. Others are uniting seemingly disparate music and
dance styles. The results can be artistically provocative, the best
of such productions making theatergoers gaze in wonder at both
dance and the world from which it comes. Take two refreshing
productions at this summer's American Dance Festival in Durham,
N.C. Mark Dendy's new work was performed to a potpourri of rock and
pop music of the recent past. By Jack Anderson.

<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Decisions are now being made about
a cluster of major civic projects that, between them, will exercise
an unprecedented impact on the immediate and long-range future of
New York. All the projects have an important role to play in
meeting the fundamental challenge faced by New York and other aging
urban centers: the transition from the industrial city of the19th
century to the cultural matrix of the 21st. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXHIBITS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-INSTRUMENTS (Washington) _ Africans _ and their
descendants in the diaspora _ always seem surrounded by music. So
it hardly comes as a surprise for a museum curator to decide that
traditional African instruments should not only be listened to but
looked at. Such is the point of ``Audible Artwork: Selected African
Musical Instruments,'' a pleasant, though rather modest, exhibit
showing here at the National Museum of African Art through April 8,
2001. By Stephen A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   MALE-NUDE-PHOTOGRAPHY (Undated) _ The first photographer to make
male nudes popular subjects for both homosexuals and heterosexuals
was Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden (1856-1931), a German who worked in
Sicily, primarily from 1890 to 1914. Forty-one of his images, most
of them of young Italian boys dressed like ancient Greeks, are on
view at Throckmorton Fine Art in Midtown Manhattan through Sept.
9). By Vicki Goldberg.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Talking with Frank Quattrone, the grand pooh-bah
of Silicon Valley investment banking, is a lot like shooting the
breeze with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Each has made gazillions on
the decade-long drunken orgy of Silicon Valley success, each is one
of the recognized leaders in his field with an ego to match, and
each is willing to speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone runs Credit Suisse First Boston's technology practice,
one of the rare Wall Street shops that allows the research
department to report directly to the head of investment banking. No
artifice here: Quattrone's outfit unabashedly combines aggressive
banking with supportive research.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to miss an opportunity for publicity, Quattrone
gathered some new-media scribes to a sit-down last Friday at the
Sheraton Palace Hotel to coincide with a get-together of his
worldwide team.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda was some good old-fashioned chest-thumping with a
dollop of insight on tech stocks. The insight won't necessarily
make you money, but it may help you understand this craziness a
little better.
</P>
<P>
   As the banker who took Cisco Systems public in 1990, Quattrone
justifiably likes to equate his success with that of Silicon
Valley. He worked his way up at Morgan Stanley, ultimately becoming
the first banker with a bulge-bracket firm (the giant,
full-service, global New York kind) to establish a Valley-based
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Every other bank followed his lead _ several years later.
</P>
<P>
   His team managed the initial public offering of Amazon.com in
1997, after the group had jumped the previous year to what then was
known as Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
</P>
<P>
   In what could become the team's latest signature deal, CSFB led
the recent $1.1-billion offering for Corvis, a communications
equipment company that hasn't recorded any revenue and yet already
is worth $36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So, given that it took Cisco years and years to get to that
valuation, how, pray tell, could Corvis and companies like it ever
be more than trading opportunities for investors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have seen how big these companies can become,
especially if you become the category leader,'' says Quattrone. ``I
think investors want call options on that.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that when Cisco went public, nobody was convinced
a new equipment company could achieve $200 million in annual
revenue. Corvis, according to the filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, already has several orders from network
service providers of at least $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   But then Quattrone's truth gene kicks in. He points out that
when Cisco went public a decade ago, Morgan Stanley priced the deal
at 18 times the company's 1990 earnings estimates. Corvis, in
contrast, priced its IPO at 49 times expected revenue _ two years
out.
</P>
<P>
   For Quattrone it's about profits in mergers and acquisitions.
His M&AMP;A guru, George Boutros _ who wasn't present Friday _ is
widely acknowledged to be one of Wall Street's shrewdest
negotiators. He's the guy hotly pursued companies turn to when they
want to sell their companies for top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And tech-oriented dealmaking is on fire. There have been more
deals, worth nearly as much money, so far this year as in all of
last year. And each year since 1993 has made the previous year look
paltry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if CSFB has been a part of taking too many ill-prepared
companies public, Quattrone allows that ``we've been searching our
souls about that.'' Never mind that Quattrone's assertion would be
predicated on the assumption that investment bankers have souls.
The answer is in the numbers. Too many public companies leads
ineluctably to outsized opportunities for M&AMP;A. That's how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone acknowledges that ``everyone is looking to see if the
venture guys will repeat their mistakes of the 1980s, when they
made lots of me-too investments and returns went to the single
digits. We're monitoring that carefully and seeing no evidence
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   I've seen evidence: the online pet sector, online weddings,
business-to-business anything _ even the hottest of the hot,
optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   This is the beauty of being a full-service investment bank. ``If
somebody explains their business to us once, we don't want to make
them go through that painful process again,'' quips Quattrone.
Translation: We'll arrange the funding when it's an idea, take them
public as soon as we can, do a secondary if the markets allow and
sell them when they've crapped out.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that top bankers like Quattrone are playing a
numbers game. They do a volume business, but they also deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies they've taken public that would not have
been funded according to the old rules are Commerce One and
Phone.com. Those two have made both institutional and plain old
retail investors gobs of money.
</P>
<P>
   And the beat goes on. For now.

 Secrets Of Success: Las Camelias Fish Tacos Have a Buttery Secret   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the last couple of years, fish tacos have
become popular all over the Bay Area, but Gabriel Fregoso at Las
Camelias in San Rafael creates some of the best.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fregoso has owned this popular Mexican restaurant since 1977,
using old family recipes as the basis of many of the items on the
menu. The interior, too, has a homey hacienda feel, with stucco
walls, arched windows and fresh flowers on each table.
</P>
<P>
   The filling for Fregoso's fish tacos is a simple blend of
snapper and fresh tomato salsa sauteed with a little butter for
added richness. The tacos are not only delicious but easy to
prepare at home, and can be on the table in less than 30 minutes.
They're perfect for a quick meal when you want something different
but don't have a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   While warm corn tortillas are the traditional accompaniment, the
fish also is good atop crisp tortilla chips as a pass-around
appetizer at a cocktail party.

 Learning to Cook: Summer Berries Shine In No-Cook Pudding   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; If you are shaky about sauteing or balk at baking,
today's recipe is for you. It requires no heat at all.
<P>
   Summer pudding is a classic English dessert of sweetened berries
and bread. That's all.
</P>
<P>
   Slices of bread are used to line a mold _ often just a mixing
bowl _ then sweetened berries are spooned in and more bread is
placed on top. The dish is weighted and refrigerated overnight, or
until the berries and bread meld into a jewel-toned dessert.
</P>
<P>
   At the table, it's spooned into bowls and given a generous
dollop of softly whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   This simple dessert has taken root in America. A friend who
spent her childhood summers in Vermont remembers looking forward to
puddings. The first of the season would be blueberry. Next came
strawberry and finally blackberry and raspberry. Actually, any
juicy berry or combination of berries will work.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberry summer pudding is one of my favorite desserts. It's
simple, delicious and captures the essence of summer. You cannot
buy this in a store. Something this good has to come from your own
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RASPBERRY SUMMER PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   You will love the way this beautiful red pudding looks. But even
more, you will be stunned at how good it tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 loaf sliced white bread (not thinly sliced)
</P>
<P>
   6 cups fresh raspberries
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar, or more to taste, depending on sweetness of
berries
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Start with 12 slices of bread. The number of slices needed may
vary.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the crusts off the bread. Put 1 slice in the bottom of a
1-quart glass or stainless-steel bowl. Next, cover the sides of the
bowl with slices of bread, each slice resting on the bottom slice.
Don't squeeze or force the slices to fit perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   When you have finished, you'll have some gaps. Cut pieces of
bread about the same size as the gaps, then fit them into the
holes. When finished, the bowl should be neatly lined with a single
layer of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Put the berries in a mixing bowl and add the sugar. Lightly stir
the berries to evenly distribute the sugar. Taste and adjust for
sweetness. If more sugar is needed, add a couple of spoonfuls at a
time, then stir and taste again. When the berries taste sweet
enough, it's time to finish the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon the berries into the bread-lined bowl. Cover the berries
with additional slices of bread, again filling in crevices where
needed. When the top is neatly covered, place a piece of plastic
wrap over the pudding. Place a plate on top (one that is slightly
smaller in diameter than the bowl) and weight with a heavy object
(a can or two of food or a brick). Refrigerate for at least 6
hours. The weight will slowly press down the pudding, causing the
raspberry juices to soak into the bread.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, remove the weight, plate and plastic wrap from the
bowl. Invert a serving plate over the bowl. Firmly holding the
plate and bowl together, quickly invert the two. The pudding should
easily unmold onto the plate. Carefully remove the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with softly whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate any leftovers (they'll keep for up to 1
week).
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Danny Silver, a conservative Jewish lawyer
from Los Angeles, the news that Al Gore had chosen an Orthodox Jew
as his running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket was like
a bolt from the blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all set to vote for Bush,'' he said, ``but now I have no
choice. This is a historic moment for American Jews and I have to
stand up and be counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he is not the only one. Jewish groups across the
country Tuesday hailed the choice of Senator Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut as Gore's number two as a bold decision, one they hope
will sweep away any remaining misgivings about the place of Jews in
the mainstream of American life.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears to have done nothing but good for the flailing
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll taken for CNN and USA Today on Monday night
showed George W. Bush's lead, which reached 11 percent in the wake
of last week's Republican Convention, narrowed down to just two
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of that bounce can be ascribed to other factors,
notably Lieberman's reputation for integrity, his Jewishness
certainly does not appear to be a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are betting that times have moved on from the 1960
presidential campaign, when John Kennedy's Catholicism was cause
for widespread concern and almost lost him the election.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, they believe that Lieberman's devoutness will play
well in the American heartland, even if it is not the devoutness of
the mainstream religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is the world's most religious democracy, and people
respect religious feelings. Issues like his refusal to campaign on
the Sabbath will go down very well,'' predicted Donna Bojarsky, a
political consultant for Democrats in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are nervous, but we are also excited. People are going
to learn a lot more about the Jewish religion than they ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are Americans on the far right who denounce
Jewish conspiracies and embrace neo-Nazi ideology, the CNN/USA
Today poll showed just four percent of voters believing Lieberman's
religion to be a liability, well down on the 19 percent who said
the same thing about JFK in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey much quoted Tuesday showed that the number of
Americans willing to accept a Jew in high office had risen from 42
percent in 1947 to 92 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-Semitism is a thing of the past,'' said Steven Spiegel, a
political science professor at the University of California in Los
Angeles who advised Bill Clinton during his 1992 presidential
campaign. ``When Lieberman speaks about God, he appeals directly to
Middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lieberman's Jewishness can make a difference in
attracting specific groups of swing voters is another matter,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 70 percent of America's six million Jews are Democrats
anyway, and if there are voters like Silver inclined to switch
parties on grounds of religious identification, they are probably
not very numerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a five percent, 10 percent swing in the
Jewish vote? Big deal!'' exclaimed David Horowitz, a former
left-wing radical turned conservative gadfly. ``Al Gore hasn't even
locked down his supporters on the left, and Lieberman is too
conservative to help him with that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the highest concentrations of influential Jewish
Americans is to be found in Hollywood, whose celebrity firepower
can have enormous sway over political races.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Lieberman raises mixed feelings in the entertainment
industry because he has staged a series of attacks on the moral
values of film, television and video games and has threatened
restrictive legislation if the industry fails to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Many political observers, however, believe that liberal
Hollywood has nowhere other than the Gore-Lieberman ticket to turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish factor, meanwhile, might have a galvanizing effect in
other parts of the country like Florida, a key swing state, or New
York, where Hillary Rodham Clinton might just enjoy the knock-on
effect of American Jewish enthusiasm in her tightly fought Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some questions about the extent of Lieberman's
religious commitment. Will his place on the ticket distort U.S.
policy on the Middle East, for example? Will his observance of the
Sabbath interfere with running the country if he is elected?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Lieberman has agreed to fall in line with Gore's
platform in every particular, and since Gore is about as pro-Israel
as any U.S. politician he is unlikely to make much difference
there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the much-mooted risk of a rogue state launching a nuclear
strike against America on a Saturday, there is a special
dispensation in the Torah permitting observant Jews to work in
cases where health or safety are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has regularly gone to Capitol Hill on the Sabbath,
although he tends to walk there rather than taking motorized
transport. &QL;

 Cook's Books: Loomis Reveals Italian Farm Cooks' Secrets  &HT;       
 By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Susan Herrmann Loomis can't keep a secret. But in
the case of this veteran cookbook author, that's a good thing.
Because many of the secrets entrusted to her by farm cooks all over
Italy will help American home cooks bring the flavors of the
countryside to their own tables.
<P>
   Sometimes a secret, or  &LR; segreto &LR; , in her new ``Italian Farmhouse
Cookbook'' applies only to a specific dish; at other times, it's a
hint that will improve many similar preparations. For example, the
tip with a Tuscan vegetable soup advises, ``When `sweating' or
gently cooking vegetables until they are translucent, add them to
the skillet along with the oil. This way, the ingredients heat up
gently and you avoid burning them around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   Loomis obviously likes farms. Her two previous books were
``Farmhouse Cookbook'' and ``French Farmhouse Cookbook.'' Just as
she did for those volumes, she spent a good part of two years
crisscrossing Italy and coaxing country cooks into sharing their
traditional recipes with her. In the process, she acquired a
working knowledge of the language and made friends with many of her
hosts, resulting in chatty essays interspersed with the recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In country cooking, produce plays a far more important role than
meat, fish or fowl. So while this is not a vegetarian cookbook,
people who eschew meat _ including vegans _ will find a lot to
like.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis is more than a cook with a knack for writing. She is an
astute observer of customs and manages to put her observations into
historical perspective. She relates the basic simplicity of Italian
country cooking to the historic poverty of most Italian peasants,
caused in part by harsh environments and to an even greater degree
by oppressive land policies, including some as recent as the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this somewhat gloomy situation, Loomis found a wonderful
variety of traditional dishes that bear the stamp of their
particular region and the ingredients it produces.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, she states, you can divide Italian cuisine by north
and south. In the north, corn, butter and cream rule; in the south,
it's olive oil and wheat. But defining this division by provinces
and adding a map would have been welcome clarifications. Tuscany,
for example, is a stronghold of olive oil, but it's in northwestern
Italy, not in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Within Italy's major regions there are many
variations, not only attributable to the crops that flourish but to
historic imprints left by the many cultures that swept through this
land in its long history. Veneto, for example, over the centuries
has been influenced by its contact exposure to foreign ideas,
thanks to the port of Venice. Sicily is about the only region where
fish and seafood loom large on the farm table, since in most other
regions the coastal areas are marshy and hence not farmed.
</P>
<P>
   It may come as a surprise to read that salads are notably few on
the Italian farm despite the abundance of greens grown. Most
Italian farmers, Loomis found, prefer their greens cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Loomis did a lot of testing in her American kitchen
to get things right, since many times her question about how much
of a given ingredient was needed was answered with,  &LR; ``quanto
basta'' &LR;  _ when there is enough.
</P>

 &LR; SMOTHERED CAULIFLOWER
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is from Nunzio San Fillipo, a cook at a stately farm
in Sicily. He suggests mixing leftovers with al dente pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 large heads cauliflower, cut into florets with stems
</P>
<P>
   4 anchovy fillets, minced
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   12 oil-cured black olives, pitted, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup hearty red wine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup gently packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Scatter half the onion slices over the bottom of a medium-size
deep skillet. Arrange half the cauliflower florets over the onion,
stems toward the center, so that when you look in the pan, you see
simply florets. Sprinkle the anchovies, raisins, olives and 3
tablespoons of the oil over the cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the remaining cauliflower, stems down, over the top,
pressing the florets down firmly atop the filling. The cauliflower
will mound up over the top of the pan. Scatter the remaining onions
over the cauliflower and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon
oil, 1/4 cup water and salt to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely cover the skillet with aluminum foil, place over medium
heat and cook, checking often to make sure the cauliflower isn't
sticking. If it is, add water, a tablespoon at a time. As it cooks,
press on it so that it sinks slightly into the pan. As soon as you
can when it has sunk enough, remove the foil, cover with a lid that
fits over the cauliflower and inside the skillet, and add 4 pounds
of weight to that to press the cauliflower as it cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Adjust the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, checking the
cauliflower occasionally, until it is soft and nearly cooked
through, about 11/4 hours. Remove the weight and lid. Pour the wine
over the cauliflower and cook until it is completely tender and the
cooking liquid is reduced by about two-thirds and darkened to a
deep caramel color, about 40 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Place a large, shallow serving bowl, top side down, over the
skillet and quickly invert it, so the cauliflower and its juices
drop into the bowl. Let the cauliflower cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, mince the parsley and sprinkle it over the
cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8 to 10.

 &LR; MARIA'S FRIED TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   This preparation from Malvarina, near Assisi, is best made with
flavorful but slightly under-ripe tomatoes, which are fried till
they are almost black.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds (about 8 medium) firm, flavorful tomatoes, cored and
cut lengthwise in half
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup loosely packed fresh thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, cut in half, green germ removed
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pour enough oil into a heavy skillet to make a thin but even
layer on the bottom of the pan (for a 10-inch skillet, use half the
oil) and heat over medium-high heat until it is hot but not
smoking. Add as many tomatoes, skin side down, as will easily fit
into the pan without crowding. Cook until the skin is spotted very
dark brown to black, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the cut
side is very dark brown as well, 4 to 5 minutes more. Reduce the
heat to medium and continue cooking, turning the tomatoes
regularly, until they are very dark around the edges and have
almost melted but still keep their shape, 16 to 20 minutes. Adjust
the heat so the tomatoes brown but don't burn.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the tomatoes to a serving dish. Repeat the process with
the remaining tomatoes, adding more oil to the pan as necessary.
Sprinkle the cooked tomatoes lightly with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, very finely mince the thyme and garlic
together and sprinkle over the tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

 By ANDREW GUMBEL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Danny Silver, a conservative Jewish lawyer
from Los Angeles, the news that Al Gore had chosen an Orthodox Jew
as his running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket was like
a bolt from the blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all set to vote for Bush,'' he said, ``but now I have no
choice. This is a historic moment for American Jews and I have to
stand up and be counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he is not the only one. Jewish groups across the
country Tuesday hailed the choice of Senator Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut as Gore's number two as a bold decision, one they hope
will sweep away any remaining misgivings about the place of Jews in
the mainstream of American life.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears to have done nothing but good for the flailing
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll taken for CNN and USA Today on Monday night
showed George W. Bush's lead, which reached 11 percent in the wake
of last week's Republican Convention, narrowed down to just two
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of that bounce can be ascribed to other factors,
notably Lieberman's reputation for integrity, his Jewishness
certainly does not appear to be a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are betting that times have moved on from the 1960
presidential campaign, when John Kennedy's Catholicism was cause
for widespread concern and almost lost him the election.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, they believe that Lieberman's devoutness will play
well in the American heartland, even if it is not the devoutness of
the mainstream religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is the world's most religious democracy, and people
respect religious feelings. Issues like his refusal to campaign on
the Sabbath will go down very well,'' predicted Donna Bojarsky, a
political consultant for Democrats in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are nervous, but we are also excited. People are going
to learn a lot more about the Jewish religion than they ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are Americans on the far right who denounce
Jewish conspiracies and embrace neo-Nazi ideology, the CNN/USA
Today poll showed just four percent of voters believing Lieberman's
religion to be a liability, well down on the 19 percent who said
the same thing about JFK in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey much quoted Tuesday showed that the number of
Americans willing to accept a Jew in high office had risen from 42
percent in 1947 to 92 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-Semitism is a thing of the past,'' said Steven Spiegel, a
political science professor at the University of California in Los
Angeles who advised Bill Clinton during his 1992 presidential
campaign. ``When Lieberman speaks about God, he appeals directly to
Middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lieberman's Jewishness can make a difference in
attracting specific groups of swing voters is another matter,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 70 percent of America's six million Jews are Democrats
anyway, and if there are voters like Silver inclined to switch
parties on grounds of religious identification, they are probably
not very numerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a five percent, 10 percent swing in the
Jewish vote? Big deal!'' exclaimed David Horowitz, a former
left-wing radical turned conservative gadfly. ``Al Gore hasn't even
locked down his supporters on the left, and Lieberman is too
conservative to help him with that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the highest concentrations of influential Jewish
Americans is to be found in Hollywood, whose celebrity firepower
can have enormous sway over political races.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Lieberman raises mixed feelings in the entertainment
industry because he has staged a series of attacks on the moral
values of film, television and video games and has threatened
restrictive legislation if the industry fails to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Many political observers, however, believe that liberal
Hollywood has nowhere other than the Gore-Lieberman ticket to turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish factor, meanwhile, might have a galvanizing effect in
other parts of the country like Florida, a key swing state, or New
York, where Hillary Rodham Clinton might just enjoy the knock-on
effect of American Jewish enthusiasm in her tightly fought Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some questions about the extent of Lieberman's
religious commitment. Will his place on the ticket distort U.S.
policy on the Middle East, for example? Will his observance of the
Sabbath interfere with running the country if he is elected?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Lieberman has agreed to fall in line with Gore's
platform in every particular, and since Gore is about as pro-Israel
as any U.S. politician he is unlikely to make much difference
there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the much-mooted risk of a rogue state launching a nuclear
strike against America on a Saturday, there is a special
dispensation in the Torah permitting observant Jews to work in
cases where health or safety are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has regularly gone to Capitol Hill on the Sabbath,
although he tends to walk there rather than taking motorized
transport. &QL;

 Grocer Story Inspires Readers to Tout Their Favorite Markets  &HT;       
 By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; A quick glance into the culinary crystal ball for
the Bay Area brings one fairly safe prediction: Independent grocers
are here to stay.
<P>
   Two weeks ago, we ran a story titled ``The Last of the
Independents,'' highlighting five one-location, upscale independent
grocery stores. Along with it, we ran a list of other markets that
fit the category and invited readers to let us know of similar
stores they favored.
</P>
<P>
   And that opened the flood gates _ readers wrote, called and
e-mailed. The message that came across is that customers feel loyal
and connected to these markets. They appreciate that the stores are
tailored to specific neighborhoods; responsive to customers'
preferences and expectations; that they are run by identifiable
people rather than corporations; and that in addition to providing
fine food, they foster a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the markets recommended completely fit the profile of
the original story. Some are reliable sources for all basic grocery
needs but hardly upscale. Some are niche stores _ natural food
stores, produce markets _ that don't supply all of a household's
grocery needs. Some operate in more than one location.
</P>
<P>
   We took a look at some of the most-recommended stores, and
here's what we found.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAN FRANCISCO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   First among the favorites is  &UR; Marina Super &LR;  (2323 Chestnut St.,
near Scott Street, San Francisco; 415-346-7470) which, we are happy
to report, is alive and well, though we had been told otherwise and
erroneously called it defunct.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the few markets that does home delivery ($30
minimum order by phone; $20 if you order in-store). The store
hasn't changed much over the decades _ the two rear sections hold
staples, but the front room is the main attraction, particularly
the deli/meat/take-out food counter. Marina residents who don't
want to cook love this market. There is meat loaf to be taken home,
a variety of prepared pasta dishes, grilled marinated chicken
breasts, turkey meatballs in sauce, roasted Harris Ranch beef
tri-tip, Greek salad and more. This old-fashioned store can serve
up a complete not-so-old-fashioned dinner at reasonable prices.

 &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR; Diablo Foods &LR;  in Lafayette (3615 Mt. Diablo Blvd., near Dewing
Street; 925-283-0737), strictly speaking, doesn't fit the category
since it has a second location at 10 Dana Plaza in Concord. But the
store and its owners, Ed and Betty Stokes and their family, are so
much part of the community _ and received so many reader
nominations _ that we checked it out anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This is a handsomely appointed market with many artisan foods, a
bright floral shop, fine meat/poultry /fish department and
top-notch produce, all attractively displayed. The deli, undergoing
a brief remodel, features take-out main courses and salads and
stellar sandwiches at down-to-earth prices, including the best and
most generous chicken salad sandwich encountered in a long time _
for $4.49.

 &LR; PENINSULA
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Kevin Bianchini's namesake market,  &UR; Bianchini's &LR;  in Portola
Valley (3130 Alpine Road, west of Highway 280; 650-851-4391), also
has a companion store, Foodville, at 616 Laurel St. in San Carlos.
It is owned by his father, Al, who helps run the meat department in
Portola Valley.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bianchini's focal points is the service meat counter
where butchers are undaunted by special requests. The market offers
a lot of organic food products and take-home entrees that range
from down-home comfortable to dinner-party elegant _ think
burritos, Maui ribs, marinated salmon or cooked lobster.
</P>
<P>
   The store offers an inviting outside eating area by a fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Another top vote getter on the Peninsula is  &UR; JJ&AMP;F &LR;  (520 College
Ave., near El Camino Real, Palo Alto; 650-857-0901). This
family-owned market has a fine selection of produce, a service meat
counter and a good wine selection. One Stanford staff member
e-mailed us that the staff here is ``so friendly they even remember
the Stanford students who used to shop at the store 10 years ago.''
Here, too, there are many organic items, including Judy's handmade
vegan bread from Mendocino.

 &UR; Bruno's &LR;  (688 Point San Pedro Road, near Loch Lomond Drive;

interesting jams, condiments and the like, better-than-average
produce and extensive service meat and deli departments. Sandwiches
and salads are plentiful, as are no-hassle dinner options _ baked
stuffed potatoes, pizza, burritos, chicken chow mein.
</P>
<P>
   The other San Rafael market,  &UR; Scotty's &LR;  (620 Freitas Pkwy., in
the Terra Linda Shopping Center; 415-479-2363), is easily one of
the most attractive shopping destinations. From modern shelving to
good lighting and user-friendly displays, this market makes
shopping easy. Many food items come from relatively small
producers, like Panama Canal ravioli, and there is a
restaurant-rivaling selection of prepared foods. An in-house sushi
bar and pretty selection of flowers complete the picture of the
Marin life-style.

 Taster's Choice: Kraft Finds Balance in Balsamic Vinaigrette   By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  There's no better time for salads than August with
all of the wonderful fresh produce at its peak. Sliced tomatoes
right off the vine with a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette can be
heaven.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted 12 bottled balsamic vinaigrettes. Panelists
were disappointed by the category as a whole and felt better
vinaigrettes could easily be made at home with a good quality olive
oil and balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the primary complaint was the inferior taste of the
ingredients. Most of the vinaigrettes used vegetable oil instead of
olive oil. Many also incorporated white vinegar into the dressing,
taking away from the balsamic characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   The panel tasted the vinaigrettes alone and tossed with mixed
greens. No low-fat or nonfat vinaigrettes were included.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kraft &LR;  (14 ounces, $3.75 at Safeway) took top honors. Panelists
agreed that this vinaigrette had the best balance of flavors; one
commented that this brand seemed to use high-quality ingredients.
But one panelist didn't think it tasted much like a balsamic
vinaigrette. Others thought the finish tasted sweet and artificial.
Three would buy it, one might buy it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Cardini's &LR;  (121/2 ounces, $3.49 at
Andronico's). Two panelists particularly liked the balance of
flavors. One panelist thought the addition of herbs added to the
appearance without taking away from the flavor, but two others
didn't like the dried-herb taste. Two would buy it, two might buy
it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (12 ounces, $2.79 at Trader Joe's) _ the only
vinaigrette that must be refrigerated even before opening _ came in
third. Three panelists described the flavor as too tart and sharp.
Two others thought it had good balance, but one noted that it would
be easy to make a better vinaigrette at home. Four might buy it;
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spectrum &LR;  (8 ounces, $3.59 at Whole Foods) received a
fourth-place ranking. Three panelists described this dressing as
too sweet; one detected berry notes (there are no berries, but
white grape concentrate is one of the ingredients). Another liked
the flavor, citing a particularly good balance of tart-sweet notes.
One would buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Bernstein's &LR;  (16 ounces, $3.39 at Safeway).
Two panelists thought the dried herbs and garlic tasted artificial,
and another thought it had too much herb flavor. Two panelists
liked the tart quality, but one noted it didn't taste much like a
balsamic vinaigrette. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Newman's Own, Consorzio, Whole Foods, Wild
Thymes, Wish-Bone, Annie's Naturals and Silver Palate, but they
scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Meryl Bennan, food writer and consultant; John P.
Carroll, cookbook author; Patricia Hart, food writer and
consultant; Roland Passot, chef-owner La Folie in San francisco and
Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner,
Cafe Kati, San Francisco. A perfect score for any product would be
100. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 Food Lovers' Walks: Oakland Chinatown Walk Brings Together a 
 Variety of Tastes   By Kim Severson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; OAKLAND, Calif. _  &LR; Fresh from Burma, Philip Chu stepped onto the
streets of Oakland's Chinatown in 1969. The tiny immigrant district
wasn't much more than a handful of stores and restaurants clustered
around the intersection of Eighth and Webster streets.
<P>
   More than 30 years later, the district snakes out well past its
core, roughly a 12-block square defined by Seventh and 11th streets
and Broadway and Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Like the boundaries, the cultures represented in Chinatown have
stretched beyond the Cantonese immigrants who started the place
more than 140 years ago. All of which makes for a fascinating
shopping trip. A few hours strolling around the heart of Oakland's
Chinatown capped by lunch at one of several restaurants in the area
is a fine way for a food lover to spend the day.
</P>
<P>
   For a guide, I invited Chu and his wife, Nancy, who cook
well-regarded Burmese food at Nan Yang in Rockridge. They started
out in Oakland's Chinatown in a little restaurant near Eighth and
Harrison streets. They left in 1996, but still shop in Chinatown
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Chinatown, almost nothing is a pure distillation of
one culture. Certainly, Chinese food dominates. But Vietnamese and
Filipino goods spill out onto sidewalks, the shopkeepers often
ethnic Chinese from those countries. In almost all the stores,
shoppers can find Thai curry pastes, Japanese pickles, Burmese
spice mixes, Korean kimchi and even some Western staples. A good
place to start is the corner of Ninth Street and Broadway, where
the European cafes and Victorians of Old Oakland give way to a
strip of mostly Vietnamese run produce stands and grocery stores
along Ninth Street.
</P>
<P>
   The block allows for quick price comparisons. Long beans, for
example, can run from $1 to $1.20 a pound. Bags of pea vines, which
Chu suggests stir-frying in hot oil and garlic, then finishing with
a shot each of chicken stock and rice wine and a pinch of sugar and
salt, cost just under $1 a pound at the stands. Inside the stores
along the strip, packages of soft, white Vietnamese rice noodles
vary from 99 cents to $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   To keep you fortified before lunch, stop in at the spanking new
 &UR; Best Tea House &LR;  on Ninth Street and Webster for an iced drink with
plump, dark balls of tapioca swimming in milky sweet tea. If the
new Taiwanese drinks aren't to your liking, the calm little spot
offers a wide array of traditional teas. A short, quiet rest here
and you'll be ready to head for the heart of Oakland's Chinatown
and browse Chu's favorite shops.
</P>
<P>
   The couple often makes a stop at  &UR; Harvest Fish Market &LR;  on Eighth
Street. Chu points out the clean smell and the freshly scrubbed
rubber mats that line the narrow shop. He also likes the table and
tank displays that allow a good, close look at the shiny snapper
fillets ($2.99 a pound), whole catfish ($1.69 a pound), live
lobsters ($6.99 a pound) and small, dark live abalone ($12.50 a
pound). The labels are both in Chinese and English, which makes it
easy for shoppers who aren't bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the Chus often duck into  &UR; Sam Yick Market &LR; , a store
owned by an ethnic Chinese family from the Philippines. Because of
the mix, the Chus can find traditional Chinese produce like bitter
melon and food more typical in Filipino cooking, like okra.
</P>
<P>
   Along the shelves that line the upper reaches of the shop is a
suprisingly large selection of imported pottery. Some of it is
kitschy, but other items are real deals. A large, rose-covered vase
would be perfect in a garden and costs a mere $26.99. White mugs
covered with peaked lids and painted with blue carp would be
perfect for tea or soup _ and a bargain at $2.49 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecued duck and chicken are essential treats from Chinatown,
and the Chus have their favorite spot for them _  &UR; Gold &LR; 
 &UR; Medal Restaurant &LR; , across Eighth Street from the Sam Yick Market.
It offers steamy bowls of jook and fried, savory Chinese doughnuts
for breakfast and barbecued and roasted meats throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   A truly superior whole crispy duck with a cup of soy-based
dipping sauce costs $9.50 a bird. Roast pork, with soft, snowy meat
and crackling-crisp skin, is $4.95 a pound. Have the staff pack up
a couple of pounds for a late-afternoon snack or dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Before lunch, take a little time to wander in and out of the
Chinese apothecaries. The array of dried roots and herbs are likely
baffling to Westerners, but Chu says the medicinal soup recipes
they are used in are thousands of years old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pacific Seafood &LR; , a brightly lit shop on the corner of Franklin
and Eighth streets that specializes in all sort of dried fish, also
is worth a stop. Chu is particularly fond of the mahogany-colored
dried scallops, which range in price from $42-$70 a pound, and
smooth-shelled ginkgo nuts ($4.59 a pound), which he says are fine
to crack like pecans and boil with jook or sweet fruit soup.
</P>
<P>
   For lunch, the Chus recommend  &UR; Restaurant Peony &LR; . The restaurant
is only five years old _ a mere pup in a district that began
serving food to Chinese gold miners in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor of the new six-story  &UR; Pacific Renaissance &LR; 
 &UR; Plaza &LR;  on Ninth Street between Franklin and Webster, the Peony has
the Asian branch of the Oakland library as a downstairs neighbor.
Many older Chinese-Americans live upstairs in 200 condominiums, a
short elevator ride away from trusted herbalists, Chinese-speaking
grocers and restaurateurs cooking a familiar style of Cantonese
food.
</P>
<P>
   With seating for 800 people, the Peony is a massive stretch of
round tables and hustling waiters under miles of drop-tile ceiling.
Two of the Chus' sons had their wedding banquets here. The food is
so good, the Chus say, that many consider it the most authentic
Hong Kong-style dim sum place in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Dim sum at the Peony is so popular that there is a line even on
a Monday afternoon.  &LR; Sui mai  &LR; is a standout, as are dishes of
tender tripe and plump  &LR; har gow &LR; . But the Peony has other
surprises, like rectangular slices of steamed taro root stuffed
with shrimp paste and quickly deep-fried and served in a light
mushroom sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Chinatown, the food has to be that good, the Chus
say. No longer will people settle for the sticky sweet and sour
pork or dry, flat patties of egg foo yong that once passed for
Chinese food in the area. There are too many new immigrants, too
many people with sophisticated tastes, too many competitive chefs
who know they can only survive by being better and more creative
than the cook down the street _ or across the Bay, for that matter.

   WASHINGTON _ If you wonder why Dick Cheney and Joseph Lieberman
these days grin as though they have drawn the best tickets in the
great sweepstakes of American political life, the answer is simple.
They have.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the jokes about the office they are competing for, and
study the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen men have been vice president of the United States since
Harry Truman was elected in 1944. Of them, five have become
president and a sixth, Al Gore, may join them next January. Two
others have won their party's presidential nomination but lost.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, get elected vice president and you've a 50
percent chance of winning the top job one day. And not just because
of resignation or assassination, though both have occurred in the
last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest advantage of being vice president of the United
States is that, if you behave, you will inherit the party machine.
</P>
<P>
   Once of course there was indeed a heavy price to pay, only
underscored by the invariable pledge of an incoming president to
run a more collegiate administration, which would make full use of
his deputy's talents.
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman in question would duly be given an array of
committees and task forces over which to preside, plus an ex
officio seat on the National Security Council, and the promise of a
weekly lunch with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   But that, until recently, was as far as it went. A vice
president's value consisted of his short-term electoral dowry to
the ticket (in Lyndon Johnson's case in 1960, credibility for John
Kennedy in the South and victory in his crucial home state of
Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Once in office however, his only duty laid down by the
Constitution is to preside over the Senate and cast the deciding
vote in the case of a tie. His importance was simply that he
existed, a back-up president, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   The aphorism of George Bush senior, eight years under Ronald
Reagan, summed it up perfectly: ``90 percent of life is showing
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But for larger vice presidential egos, mere ``showing up'' would
never suffice. After a career as the most domineering and hands-on
Senate leader of his era, Lyndon Johnson, ``LBJ,'' loathed the job.
</P>
<P>
   LBJ was excluded from the Kennedy circle and bundled on to Air
Force Two to wave the flag in foreign countries he had barely heard
of, primarily to keep him out of the hair of the Kennedy brothers.
</P>
<P>
   And like many fathers brutalized by their parents during
childhood, Johnson visited similar cruelty upon his own vice
president, the inexhaustible Hubert Humphrey, by mixing neglect
with demands for an unquestioning loyalty that would destroy
Humphrey's own bid for the White House in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   No one was more brutally honest than Dwight Eisenhower, after
Richard Nixon once claimed that eight years as Eisenhower's vice
president had given him unique qualifications to be president.
Asked by the press what these qualifications might be, the good
general replied, ``Give me a week and I'll think of something.''
</P>
<P>
   John Nance Garner, a Texan who held the job for Franklin D.
Roosevelt's first two terms in the Thirties, famously remarked that
the vice presidency was not worth ``a pitcher of warm spit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years on, this no longer holds. In an age when the
workload of the president _ simultaneously head of state and head
of government of a country whose power is unique in history _ grows
ever larger, the vice presidency matters as never before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the George Bush, who so faithfully showed up, will go
down as the first modern vice president; careful never to upstage
the boss, yet exerting backstage influence and with enough foreign
policy experience to negotiate on behalf of the administration in
his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bill Clinton, Al Gore has carried the process further.
Another young, moderate Southerner, from a neighboring state, he
brought no geographic or ideological dowry. His value lay in his
expertise in foreign and security policy, where Clinton was seen as
weak.
</P>
<P>
   So well did the two get on that Clinton allowed Gore to become
arguably the most powerful vice president in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, a bargain was struck. In return for Gore's
loyalty, tested to the limit by scandal, Clinton would do
everything he could to ensure that Gore was his successor.
</P>
<P>
   And come November, it may be payoff day. In which case, Joe
Lieberman will be the next to savor the curious statistics of
advancement that go with this once-reviled job.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ever thus. ``My country has in its wisdom contrived
the most insignificant office that the invention of man ever
conceived,'' the first vice president, John Adams, wrote to his
wife Abigail in December 1793. ``And as I can do neither good nor
evil, I must be borne away by others and meet the common fate.''
</P>
<P>
   And what happened? You guessed. In 1797 Adams succeeded George
Washington as president. So much for common fate. &QL;

 Technicolor Cooking: White carrots, yellow beets and ripe
green  tomatoes make up a culinary palette   By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; At San Francisco's elegant Fifth Floor restaurant,
it takes one cook to make the heirloom tomato soup and two to serve
it.
<P>
   Working with three ladles between them, the cooks simultaneously
pour chilled yellow, red and green tomato purees into each bowl so
that the mixtures meet but don't mingle. For diners, the dish is an
invitation to explore the nuances of a favorite summer food that,
not so long ago, came only in red.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth Floor chef George Morrone's tricolor meditation on tomato
soup is just one of the more refined examples of the Technicolor
revolution in today's kitchens. With local markets overflowing with
white zucchini, striped beets, golden peppers and purple potatoes,
Bay Area cooking has never been more colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Although chefs insist that flavor always comes first, a glance
at the dishes coming out of their kitchens proves that they are
reveling in their expanded palette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It perks you up,'' says Annie Somerville, chef at Greens in
San Francisco. ``With such beautiful contrasts and colors _ it just
makes things more enticing and more fun to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Diners at Greens might find a three-beet soup, made with red,
golden and red-and-white-striped Chioggia beets and served like
Morrone's tomato creation.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's antipasto plate sometimes features a pairing of
purple ``huckleberry'' potatoes with golden Yellow Finns.
Multicolored peppers are roasted and scattered over pizza or
braised together with garlic and herbs for  &LR; peperonata &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   At Stars, chef Christopher Hernandez uses golden, red and
striped beets with watercress and shaved  &LR; ricotta salata &LR;  in one of
his favorite salads. He scatters lemon cucumbers over the top to
add a fluorescent yellow-green.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Downing, the chef at Spiedini in Walnut Creek, uses
Orchid watermelon, which has a vibrant yellow-orange color, to
create a cooling summer soup. For a whimsical touch, he carves
other pieces of melons into classic vegetable shapes like beans,
potatoes, carrots and celery. He also grills French Grey zucchini _
a varietal with light greenish-white skin _ and serves it with
yellow and purple tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color creates a visual texture that you pick up on the
palate,'' says Downing.
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant also comes in designer colors this year. Giovanni
Perticone of Splendido uses different varieties in chartreuse,
rose, green, white and lavender and sautes them together with olive
oil, garlic, pine nuts, raisins and balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Colorful History &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively recent commercial influx of white beets,
orange peppers, violet carrots and the like, produce experts say
these differently colored vegetables are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrots used to be white or yellow or violet,'' says William
Woys Weaver, the Pennsylvania author of ``Heirloom Vegetable
Gardening'' (Henry Holt, 1997). ``The Romans knew white and yellow
carrots. The orange was bred into (carrots) in the 18th century by
Dutch horticulturists.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest wild beets were white or yellow, says Weaver. Along
the beaches of the Mediterranean, you can still pull up such pallid
tubers. But some of the leaves have pink stems and patient growers
eventually got the pink to creep down the stem and into the roots,
breeding them darker and darker to achieve the blood-red beets we
know today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just controlled it,'' Weaver says. ``All (these colors)
are artificially induced on nature. But we've created commodities
out of them, so that what most people see in their supermarket is
very limited. That's why I like heirlooms.''
</P>
<P>
   By saving selected seeds from his heirloom vegetables, Weaver
can create a variety all his own. When some yellow-ribbed chard in
his garden showed a touch of red in the ribs, he saved the seed and
planted successive generations, always replanting only the seed of
the reddest ones, until he gradually produced a chard with a
deep-orange rib.
</P>
<P>
   Although orange-ribbed chard and purple beans may look like the
wayward experiments of a genetic engineer, produce experts say that
biotechnology isn't involved _ and isn't likely to be. There's not
enough profit in golden beets or white carrots to interest the
biotech industry, where research costs are huge. And because these
colors are found naturally in many species, as Weaver discovered
with his red-tinged chard, they're easy to achieve by conventional
breeding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, purple-podded pole beans, which some shoppers may
think are bioengineered, were grown in American gardens in the late
18th century, Weaver points out. But like most cooks, Weaver agrees
they look best on the pole _ the striking purple color turns khaki
green when the beans are cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Violet carrots also turn an unappetizing shade when cooked but
are visually striking and delicious when grated raw, he says. And
purple-hued tomatoes, like Cherokee Purple, can be stunning in a
salad. ``They look like raw tuna when they're sliced,'' Weaver
says. ``You can have tomato sushi.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flavor Beats Color &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For Zuni Cafe chef Judy Rodgers, purple beans and purple peppers
are among the few vegetables she would happily toss on the compost
heap of history. What she calls ``that whole slew of purple-hued
stuff'' is mostly a grand disappointment. ``It draws you in at the
market because it's unusual and a lovely rich, regal hue,'' she
acknowledges. ``But once you cook the thing, (the color) goes away.
It's a lovely enticement that doesn't make it to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   She does embrace purple asparagus, which she slices on a
mandoline into lengthwise ribbons like pappardelle and dresses with
olive oil, lemon, salt and chopped pistachios. Given this
treatment, the vegetable's color is dazzling, she admits, but that
alone doesn't persuade her to buy. ``If it didn't taste really
good, I wouldn't keep buying it,'' says Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golden beets have been my favorite beet from the first time I
had one,'' Rodgers says. Roasted, grated and stirred into a
risotto, they contribute a subtle sweetness and a color that looks
like you've added a fortune in saffron.
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs say flavor beats color every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in terms of color,'' says Craig Stoll,
chef-owner of Delfina in San Francisco. ``If the food's beautiful,
it's beautiful. It's an added bonus if it's colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when Stoll can get good-tasting beets in multiple
colors, he uses them in his beet and cress salad, topped with
Humboldt Fog goat cheese. If their flavor meets his standards,
he'll use variously colored tomatoes in his  &LR; insalata &LR;   &LR; caprese &LR; ,
along with housemade mozzarella and basil oil. The gazpacho recipe
that he perfected after a trip to Spain is ``killer'' made with
meaty yellow paste tomatoes, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, chef Traci des Jardins of San Francisco's Jardini &LR; e &LR; re
says she never buys on color alone, but is not immune to the allure
that color can contribute to a dish. Occasionally she makes a
layered tomato terrine using different colored tomatoes, and serves
it with tapenade and goat cheese crostini. Recently, she garnished
a lobster salad with a rainbow of beets and a bright green chervil
vinaigrette. And a favorite summer salad at Jardini &LR; e &LR; re showcases
haricots verts, yellow wax beans and romano beans with baby greens
ringed by beets of various colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often I'll try to integrate something colorful, but it's not
there purely for color,'' she says. Golden beets may be ravishing _
in color and taste _ but the best chefs don't scatter them around
without reason, any more than they would resort to the tired
parsley sprig garnish.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Help the Farmer
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrating colors is a wonderful idea,'' says Bill Fujimoto
of Berkeley's Monterey Foods. Too many shoppers pass up the unusual
out of fear that it won't cook or taste the same as the familiar
variety, he says, and they miss out on some delicious experiences.
Purple carrots, which the store has carried, are quite tasty, he
says. So are white, striped and golden beets, which can be cooked
just like red beets with the added advantage of not staining
everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, buying these Technicolor vegetables can pay
long-term dividends, Fujimoto says. ``The people who grow these
varieties are specialty farmers, and specialty farming is the niche
for small farmers. If you go to the store and always buy a bag of
Fuji apples, celery, navel oranges and that same romaine for your
salad, the small farms will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bay Area shoppers with a taste for adventure, the season is
now. From Sunburst squash to Evergreen tomatoes, a rainbow of
summer produce awaits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GREENS' LINGUINE WITH ZUCCHINI, CHERRY TOMATOES &AMP; GREMOLATA
</P>
<P>
   A &LR;   &LR; final sprinkle of gremolata (minced garlic, lemon zest and
Italian parsley) heightens the flavor of squash and tomatoes in
this summer pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound each, golden and green zucchini, or scalloped summer
squash
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups cherry tomatoes of different colors, such as Sweet
100, Sungold, red or yellow pear
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound fresh linguine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   Grated Parmesan cheese, as desired
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise, then slice diagonally into
1/4-inch-thick pieces. (If you're using Sunburst or pattypan
squash, halve through the stem end and slice into 1/2-inch-thick
wedges.) Halve the cherry tomatoes if large.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside 1 teaspoon of the garlic. Make the gremolata by
combining the remaining garlic with the lemon zest and parsley. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the
squash, reserved 1 teaspoon garlic, and salt and pepper. Saute over
medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, just long enough to heat the
squash through.
</P>
<P>
   Add 1 teaspoon salt to the pot of boiling water. Add the
linguine and cook until just tender. Before draining the pasta, add
a few tablespoons of the cooking water to the saute pan, along with
the cherry tomatoes and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the pasta and add it to the pan. Add the gremolata, lemon
juice and pine nuts. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat
to low and toss well. Serve immediately, garnishing each portion
with Parmesan.
</P>

 &LR; GOLDEN BEET RISOTTO
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 small or 6 medium-size golden beets
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 51/2 cups chicken broth (if canned, dilute 50-50
with water)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 yellow onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups Arborio or other short-grain Italian rice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   If the beet greens are attached, remove all but 1 inch of them.
(Save the greens for another use.) Put the beets in a baking dish
with 1/4 inch of water. Cover and bake for 45 minutes or more,
depending on size, or until a knife pierces them easily.
</P>
<P>
   When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel and grate on the
coarse side of a box grater. You should have about 11/2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the broth to a simmer in a small saucepan and adjust heat
to maintain a gentle simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with the olive oil in a medium
saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until softened.
Add the rice and cook, stirring, until the rice is hot. Begin
adding the hot broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring often and adding
more broth only when the previous addition has been absorbed. After
10 minutes, stir in the grated beets. It should take 18 to 20
minutes for the rice to absorb all or most of the liquid and become
al dente, still firm but with no hard core.
</P>
<P>
   Risotto should be creamy, neither soupy nor stiff. If you need
more liquid to achieve the proper consistency, use boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Season the risotto with salt and pepper. Cover, remove from heat
and let stand for 2 minutes. Uncover, add the parsley and the
remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir vigorously until the butter
melts. Add a little Parmesan, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately in warm bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 as a first course, 4 as a main course.

 &LR; STARS' ROASTED BEET SALAD WITH WATERCRESS &AMP; RICOTTA SALATA
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a recipe from Stars chef Christopher Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 small beets of various colors
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 thyme sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Pinch grated orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 lemon cucumbers
</P>
<P>
   2 small bunches watercress
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound ricotta salata, in one piece
</P>
<P>
   The Vinaigrette
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place the beets in a baking dish with about 1/4 inch of water.
Add the thyme sprigs, cover and bake about 45 minutes, or until a
knife pierces the beets easily. When the beets are cool enough to
handle, peel them and cut into wedges. Keeping the red beets
separate to prevent ``bleeding,'' dress beets with the olive oil,
orange juice, orange zest and tarragon. Season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 minutes before serving, peel the lemon cucumbers, cut
into wedges and season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Remove any large stems from the watercress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the vinaigrette:  &LR; Cover the shallots with wine vinegar
in a bowl and let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk in the mustard, thyme
and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Taste and adjust
balance as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the watercress with enough of the dressing to coat the
leaves lightly. Add the cucumbers and toss again.
</P>
<P>
   Divide among serving plates. Scatter the beets evenly over the
salads. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the ricotta over the salads
in long, curly slivers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And now, ladies and gentlemen and children of all
ages, direct your attention to the stupendous holiday war between
two big-top circuses.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time the City of New York will permit the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus to raise a custom-made Italian
tent in Bryant Park to present a high-end, one-ring,
family-oriented circus during the Thanksgiving and Christmas
holidays. After eight months of deliberation, the mayor's office,
the Parks Department and the Bryant Park Conservancy have given
Ringling their blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But for 23 years a feisty hometown show, the Big Apple Circus,
has become a holiday entertainment tradition by raising its
custom-made French tent in Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center to
present its own upscale, one-ring, family-oriented circus.
</P>
<P>
   The Ringling show hopes to turn a profit, and Big Apple _ a
nonprofit organization _ is crying foul. ``It could be an enormous
financial blow to us, because the Lincoln Center season is key in
providing income for the Big Apple Circus,'' said Alan B. Slifka, a
Big Apple board member who was its first board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Slifka said ``it is possible that we could be driven out of
existence,'' adding that ``we hope that this decision will be
reconsidered by the mayor as the serious threat to our circus that
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green, the New York City public advocate, wrote a letter
last week to Rudy Washington, deputy mayor for Business Services
and Community Development, urging the city to reschedule the
performance of the Ringling one-ring show because ``we are dealing
with a small potential audience, and this conflict risks
diminishing both events,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The new circus, called ``Barnum's Kaleidoscape,'' was created 16
months ago by Ringling and has visited 12 American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Feld, Ringling's 51-year-old producer and chief
executive, said ``Kaleidoscape'' would be ``the ultimate Christmas
ornament for New York City,'' referring to the champagne-colored
tent with its red stars and stripes. The elaborately produced, $10
million show offers the comforts of crushed-velvet padded seats
with backs, and red-carpeted hardwood flooring, as well as premier
``couch'' seating at $75 a head.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will be welcomed by costumed ticket-takers and ushers,
and will be encouraged to buy not only cotton candy and popcorn,
but also high-end fare ranging from panini sandwiches to designer
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right kind of entertainment for that time of year,''
said Michael Fuchs, chairman of the Bryant Park Restoration Corp.,
the nonprofit group that oversees the park.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Kaleidoscape'' crew will erect its reception tent around
the fountain in Bryant Park. Like all attractions using the park,
Ringling is contractually obligated to replace any damaged grass or
shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaleidoscape'' will also return part of every ticket sale to
the Bryant Park Restoration Corp., the total amounting to ``several
hundred thousand dollars,'' Feld said.
</P>
<P>
   Several city managers with knowledge of the deal said that
Ringling had guaranteed the park a minimum of $200,000 for the run.
</P>
<P>
   At Lincoln Center, Big Apple will hold the debut of its new
show, ``Clown Around Town,'' from Oct. 19 through Jan. 7, charging
$18 to $62 for seats. The show features 12 horses and 2 dogs; some
120 of its 140 performers and crew members live in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaleidoscape'' will charge $20 to $75 for seats. It will raise
its tent on Nov. 16 and have its debut on Nov. 21, two days before
Thanksgiving Day. The closing performance will be New Year's Eve.
It has 62 performers, 54 crew members, 8 horses and 27 geese. Only
the show's musical composer, Linda Hudes, is a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Binder, the 57-year-old founder and artistic director of
Big Apple, said he did not want to be quoted ``in a sour grapes
way'' about ``Kaleidoscape,'' which he has seen and said is
``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Binder added: ``I love the show, and I love the performers in
that show. I am only sorry that they have chosen to compete with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Slifka was not as sanguine. ``For New York to invite Ringling in
to crush the Big Apple Circus,'' he said, ``it's almost as if the
city invited a for-profit opera company to come in and compete with
the Metropolitan Opera.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs said that ``we weren't trying to harm the Big Apple
Circus,'' adding that the city ``no longer puts money into Bryant
Park, so we are dependent on the money we can bring in,'' namely,
fees for such activities as fashion shows, concerts and
movie-screening nights.
</P>
<P>
   Feld's personal connection with Fuchs helped cement the deal.
The ``Kaleidoscape'' proposal ``seemed to our staff so out of the
ordinary that it sort of got turned down automatically,'' said
Fuchs, formerly the president of HBO.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that when Ringling came back to him: ``I knew Ken,
and I said we'd look into it. The more we got into it, the more we
thought it was a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the go-ahead was given by the office of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani during the last few weeks. Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially I was concerned about elephants and lions in the
park,'' said Washington, who explained his involvement by saying
that the approval was ``a parks function, and parks reports to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we learned that it would be geese, and horses, that
wasn't a problem,'' he said. ``We deal all the time with mounted
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said that Big Apple ``shouldn't be upset,'' because
``it's not as if each show will have an audience of 20,000
people.'' He added, ``The audiences for each circus are so small
that everyone can do well, and help our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Apple plays to 450,000 annual circusgoers in Damrosch Park,
paying several hundred thousand dollars a year to Lincoln Center
for the privilege. Big Apple estimates that it turns back a third
of its $19 million yearly budget to city community programs, health
institutions and charities. ``Any money that Feld takes out of our
box office,'' Binder said, ``is lost to the children and the
families of the city of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Big Apple has done fund-raisers for city charities and
other nonprofits like Mount Sinai and Montefiore Hospitals. It runs
the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit, which sends 25 trained clowns
into seven city hospitals to perform for sick children.
</P>
<P>
   It teaches circus arts to inner-city schoolchildren and gives
free performances for blind and hearing impaired children and
donates 50,000 free tickets to poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Slifka, a principal at a Manhattan investment management firm,
contended that Ringling chose New York ``to cripple the Big Apple
Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably 50 other cities that Ringling could invade
that don't have not-for-profit circuses,'' he said. ``The only
reason for them to come at Christmastime is to compete with us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feld said he chose the city because ``New York is the
ultimate goal of any entertainment attraction.'' He hopes it will
attract attention for future additional Ringling one-ring shows
intended to tour the United States and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ringling, however, has its own claim to New York tradition.
``Its three-ring circuses have played in Manhattan back into the
last century,'' said Greg Parkinson, a circus historian who is the
executive director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis.,
``and there was P.T. Barnum's American Museum,'' a forerunner of
the Ringling show established in Lower Manhattan in 1842.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of ``Kaleidoscape'' will be ``the first time that
Ringling has pitched a tent in Manhattan,'' Feld said, as the
Ringling show has for decades occupied Madison Square Garden in its
various incarnations. Big Apple bills itself as the city's original
tented circus, since of the 18 circuses that played New York before
its arrival, all performed in buildings.
</P>
<P>
   If Slifka termed the battle of the circuses David and Goliath,
Big Apple, which was founded in 1977, is hardly an impoverished
neophyte. It bolsters its $19 million budget with yearly tours to
nine cities including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and Washington.
Nevertheless, Slifka said that Big Apple ``operates on a very tight
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parkinson, the historian, said that in the winter season,
``Paris is able to support five competing circuses, which all seem
to do well.'' He added: ``I can understand Big Apple's sensitivity
to the arrival of another one-ring circus in New York, but a
competitive rivalry could lead to near-record sales for both
circuses. New York is a very big city.''
</P>
<P>
   If Feld brought ``Kaleidoscape'' to Manhattan in the spring, he
would be competing with his own three-ring extravaganza, scheduled
to return to Madison Square Garden next March 30.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays were ``the only time Bryant Park was available,''
Feld said, given the summer and fall fashion shows and the peak
occupancy by visitors during the summer, ``and it is the time of
year when people want to see things.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fuchs of Bryant Park Restoration said that ``for our
purposes they could come in during February,'' adding, ``we felt OK
about any time in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaleidoscape'' will feature David Larible, who was for years a
star clown of Ringling's three-ring performances, as well as Sylvia
Zerbini, who performs on the trapeze and with horses, and Alex
Petrov, a wire walker who balances a spangled lady atop his head on
a 12-foot pole.
</P>
<P>
   Ringling executives have confirmed that Feld spent $10 million
to start ``Kaleidoscape,'' but several circus marketing experts
said under the condition of anonymity that the company had spent
more than $20 million thus far on its one-ring venture without
turning an overall profit, partly because of the show's elaborate
sets and its luxury seating, which require transport by a
staggering 50 trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But Feld insisted that ``Kaleidoscape'' ``is going to be a major
profit center for this company.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Ringling has only a one-year contract to bring the
circus to Bryant Park, Feld said that ``Kaleidoscape'' hopes to
return ``year after year.''

   What do you do with a dot-com that is moving full-tilt toward an

of going public and the money is no longer there?
</P>
<P>
   That's where the newspaper chains of America find themselves.
They have produced these terrific dot-coms that have good reach and
lots of good demographics. They are Media Metrix winners. However,

BOMBING IN DOWNTOWN MOSCOW KILLS AT LEAST 7, INJURES DOZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: this will be updated later)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least seven people were killed and dozens of others were
injured Tuesday when a bomb blew up inside a busy pedestrian
underpass during rush hour in downtown Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing at
Pushkin Square, a popular intersection on Tverskaya St., only a few
blocks from Red Square and the Kremlin. But the police treated the
explosion as a terrorist act and flooded the area with
reinforcements, halting motor traffic above ground and checking
other underpasses for more bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, expressed the suspicion, shared by
many other Russians, that Chechen separatists, who have set off
previous bombs, were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the crime is obvious _ the explosion hit in a
place packed with people at rush hour,'' Luzhkov told reporters at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick E. Tyler, The New York Times bureau chief in Moscow,
said that the bombing, following a weekend when Moscow was under a
state of emergency because of threats from Chechen separatists,
would have the same impact on Russians that terrorist bombings or
apartment buildings had last year. Those bombings galvanized
support for a new Russian military offensive in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's pedestrians rely heavily on downtown underpasses like
that in Pushkin Square to avoid the chaotic vehicle traffic and to
gain entrance to the city subway system. The underpasses also
contain small shops and are frequented by private vendors,
musicians and panhandlers.
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin Square lies at the crossroads of three busy subway
lines. And with its distinct statue of the 19th century Russian
poet Alexander Pushkin, Pushkin Square engenders a special
reverence for many Russians, in addition to being a favorite
meeting place for families, friends and lovers. In the old Soviet
Union, dissidents gathered in the square for demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western news agencies and television news reports
underscored the carnage of Tuesday's bombing in downtown Moscow,
describing or showing dazed bleeding pedestrians in torn, sooty
clothes as they staggered or were carried out of the smoke-filled
tunnel. Some collapsed on the sidewalk while others wandered around
the square, searching for relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, who went to Pushkin Square after the bombing, reported
that smoke was still billowing from the underpass as victims lay
injured and dying near the square. One commuter said she had been
knocked down by shock waves from the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports said that seven people were killed and more than
20 left wounded, but casualty toll of injured kept rising to more
than 30, and above 40.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian security forces had been put on alert to watch for
attacks by Chechen separatists marking the fourth anniversary of
the rebels' capture of their capital Grozny from the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny was largely demolished earlier this year when Russian
forces seized the capital in the latest round of warfare. The
Russian offensive was motivated in part by earlier bombings in
Russian cities that killed more than 300 civilians and turned many
Russians against the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The last big bombing ripped through an apartment complex in the

   Q: When something is far off, such as a car in a parking lot,
why do we say it is ``in Timbuktu''?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several popular expressions about the Saharan
desert city in central Mali, including ``to Timbuktu and back'' and
``knock you clear to Timbuktu.''
</P>
<P>
   The city, which has a population of about 20,000 today, was once
one of the largest centers of commerce in Africa, positioned
between thriving salt and gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1593, Timbuktu was sacked by invaders and faded from
prominence, becoming legendary for its remoteness. ``Timbuktu is
smack dab in the middle of desert surrounded by nothing except more
desert,'' according to the Epinions travel guide at
www.epinions.com. ``Getting there may be the best part of it (that,
and the T-shirt that reads, `I've been to Timbuktu and back
again').''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you still buy Clark bars?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.B., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: In Fort Worth-Dallas, some of the retailers who carry Clark
bars are Kroger, Rite Aid and Dollar General stores, according to
the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The rights to the Clark bar have changed hands four times in 17
years. In May 1999, the New England Confectionery Company (NECCO)
purchased the assets of Clark Bar America and begin distributing
the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since purchasing the assets of Clark last spring, we have been
working to re-establish distribution of the Clark bar,'' NECCO
marketing assistant Joanna Forney said. ``In the next few months
you should be able to find Clark bars more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida retailer HomeTown Favorites sells more than 400
well-known but hard-to-find products, including Clark bars, Oh
Henry bars, Squirrel Nut Chews, Teaberry Gum and Wonka Bottlecaps.
To order, call (888) 694-2656 or visit www.hometownfavorites.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to the singer Bonnie Raitt?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.M., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Raitt in care of Monterey Pennisula Artists, 509
Hartnell St., Monterey, CA 93940.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt, 50, was inducted in March into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame. ``It doesn't seem like I've been famous long enough to
deserve this,'' said Raitt, whose first big commercial success was
the 1989 album ``Nick of Time,'' which won four Grammy awards.
</P>
<P>
   The singer and songwriter is also raising funds for the Rhythm &AMP;
Blues Foundation, a nonprofit group that offers financial support
and recognition for musicians of the '40s, '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>

FROM OUT OF A PIT, THE ESSENCE OF ALMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Two recipes, totaling 460 words, for pit ice cream and
pit biscotti appear at end of story.)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is the perfect dessert for someone who likes to
fool guests. It looks like ordinary ice cream, the color of butter,
with the flavor of almonds.
</P>
<P>
   But not regular almonds. Almonds that could have come from a
faraway place or an unusual variety of tree. You can keep them
guessing forever.
</P>
<P>
   If they come up with the correct answer, have them pick your
lottery numbers, too.
</P>
<P>
   The secret is apricot pits.
</P>
<P>
   The pits of apricots, nectarines, peaches and plums all contain
a kernel that tastes astonishingly like an almond. Not a sweet
almond, but one with a rounded nutty flavor that ends bitter. They
can be used in ways other nuts cannot.
</P>
<P>
   I first had the ice cream at Blue Hill in Greenwich Village. The
chefs, Dan Barber and Alex Urena, got the idea from Pierre Reboul,
pastry chef at Vong in Midtown. Their version is milky and light.
Reboul's is custardy. Both are unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Reboul tried it after recalling how a single kernel gave his
mother's apricot jam a perceptible scent when he was a child in
France. Infusing cream, milk and eggs with kernels brought out the
flavor even more.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Remolif Shere, a former pastry chef at Chez Panisse in
Berkeley, Calif., tried the same thing with ice cream more than 15
years ago. She knew that apricot pits flavored Italian amaretti and
creme de noyaux, a liqueur that takes its name from the French word
for fruit stones. She added the kernels to canned apricots and
substituted them for almonds in cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Shere cracks the pits with a nutcracker to retrieve the seeds,
which she then toasts lightly and crushes with a mortar and pestle.
</P>
<P>
   Reboul crushes the stones with their seeds in a heavy-duty food
processor, then puts everything into the milk and cream infusion,
straining out the fragments before churning. All these techniques
work (smashing with a hammer is fun), but crushing makes the
infusion stronger. Toasting the kernels deepens the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   At Vong, the apricot pit ice cream is called bitter almond ice
cream so customers are not wary. Fruit pits contain cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the plant's way of protecting its young, making the seeds
poisonous to animals, so the animals don't choose it as a tasty
snack,'' said Shirley O. Corriher, a biochemist and the author of
``Cookwise'' (William Morrow, 1997). But she said that using the
kernels as an aromatic is much less risky, and that it would take a
lot of kernels to harm an adult. (A derivative of bitter apricot
kernels called laetrile was actually once touted as a curative for
cancer, but was proved useless.)
</P>
<P>
   Apricot pit ice cream is not a flavor children would appreciate.
It is best served in small amounts. The ice cream is powerful but
one-dimensional and comes to life only with other flavors. Shere
serves it with lemon ice cream, berries, fruit pies and chocolate
or caramel desserts.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe seems ridiculous at first. It calls for about 45
apricots. But you can mix apricot pits with those from plums,
nectarines and peaches. And you can save them in the refrigerator
or freezer until you have enough.
</P>
<P>
   Just be sure to taste as you cook: seeds vary widely in
strength. Shere said that when substituting fruit kernels for
almonds in a recipe, she usually uses one-eighth the volume of the
almonds. But when I tried her recipe for biscotti, half the volume
was just enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good almond extract,'' Shere said, ``you get
that flavor, but you don't get any of the roundness of flavor that
you get from the pits themselves, because with them you get a
nutlike flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a subtle difference. But one worth cracking 45 pits to
discover.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Coombs, professor emeritus at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, is a pretty bright guy. Yet he recently found himself
stymied by the opening screen of a popular computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't click the `I Accept' button for the licensing
agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs is blind.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories abound within the disabled community. This year
marks the 10th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act,
a measure that opened many buildings to those who have
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That landmark law, however, did not foresee the explosive rise
of the Web, which opens a world of possibilities for the
able-bodied -- and a maze of frustrations for those who cannot
easily view its snappy graphics, hear its colorful sounds or, as in
Coombs' case, manipulate a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   For them, technology can be a mixed blessing. Case in point:
Only last month did America Online, the world's largest Internet
service, agree to make its proprietary chat rooms and other
features accessible to screen-reading technologies used by the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   It took AOL 15 years and a lawsuit by the National Federation of
the Blind to come around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology advances. We get left behind,'' says Curtis Chong,
president of the federation's computer science chapter.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the last decade has brought many quality-of-life
advances for people with disabilities, from cochlear implants and
high-tech wheelchairs to hands-free computers controlled by the
blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet transforms commerce and communications for the
able-bodied, however, studies suggest this revolutionary technology
has not made a dent in unemployment rates for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent of working-age disabled persons in the United
States have full- or part-time jobs, according to a new Harris
survey. That figure has remained fairly constant over the last
decade, says the National Organization on Disability.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be a Catch-22 situation. Many people with
disabilities can't afford the high-tech equipment they need to hone
employment skills, says Doris Fleischer, New Jersey Institute of
Technology lecturer and co-author of an upcoming book, ``The
Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one-fourth of America's disabled population owns a
computer, Fleischer says, and only one-tenth uses the Internet. She
defines disability according to the Americans With Disabilities
Act: a condition affecting a basic life function. Government
rehabilitation programs can be stingy about providing computer gear
that might even the score.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Web has been a godsend. Yvonne Singer, whose
speech is hindered by cerebral palsy, pecks words and commands on a
keyboard with a pointer strapped to her forehead. She has edited
Web pages for a pharmaceutical company and posted poetry on her own
Web site while searching for full-time work and pursuing a master's
degree online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to say, and people have trouble understanding
me,'' says Singer, 31, of Matawan, N.J. ``On the Web, I don't have
that trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Web enables William Skawinski, a New Jersey
Institute of Technology professor who is blind, to download
scholarly articles onto his PC, where software converts the text to
speech. Years ago, he had to rely on others to read to him.
</P>
<P>
   Every new technology poses new barriers for the blind. ATMs once
had lots of buttons that blind users could feel; newer ``improved''
cash machines have touch-screens that require eyesight. Motorola's
wireless family phones initially sported an audio feature to
identify channels; a new version replaced this with a graphics
display.
</P>
<P>
   The PC arena has proven especially vexing for the blind, largely
because of Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system. As the
name implies, it is a visual environment, dependent on a
point-and-click ``graphical user interface.''
</P>
<P>
   Chong works closely with Microsoft, and says it's possible to
navigate Microsoft Word with keyboard commands instead of a mouse.
Intuit's QuickBooks, on the other hand, is useless to the blind, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has plenty of barriers, too.
</P>
<P>
   John Kemp, of halftheplanet.com, a Web site devoted to
disability issues, estimates 95 percent of sites are inaccessible
to 10 million visually impaired Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates vary widely. Whatever the number, many agree the
Web could be far friendlier to the disabled with minimal effort,
says Judy Brewer of the World Wide Web Consortium at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Web designers can embed descriptive tags in images and links,
enabling screen-reading software to audibly inform a blind person
what is depicted on a Web page. Audio files can be captioned for
those with hearing impairments. ``Text-only'' options, and bigger
buttons and icons, can be helpful, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of these things is legally required is another
story.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL settlement averted a trial that might have determined if
digital enterprises are subject to the Americans With Disabilities
Act. The 1990 law bans discrimination by most private employers,
all state and local government agencies, and such ``places of
public accommodation'' as museums, banks, restaurants and theaters.
The Clinton administration contends the act extends to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to bridge gaps in the ADA, Congress included a mandate
within the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for telecom services and
equipment to be accessible ``where readily achievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater promise comes with another pending measure that would
bar federal agencies from buying computers and information
technology or contracting for Web site designs that cannot be
adapted for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs, the Rochester professor, hopes the threat of lost
government contracts spurs technology companies to embed
accessibility features in all their new products. Many software
companies leave such details to third-party vendors, whose updates
often lag months behind a product's release, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs leads Equal Access to Software Information, an
organization supported by the National Science Foundation that
advises colleges on the accessibility of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kemp of halftheplanet.com, are counting on the
marketplace more than regulations. Born without hands or feet, Kemp
formerly led the United Cerebral Palsy Association and is a
presidential appointee to the National Council on Disability. He
says the disabled are the nation's biggest minority group, a vast
market that the Web ignores at its peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like the marketplace to say: What is it worth for us
to find new customers for our business?'' says Kemp.

 ART ADV: With two photos, of Singer (NNS1) and Skawinski (NNS2) 
 By KEVIN COUGHLIN  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Coombs, professor emeritus at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, is a pretty bright guy. Yet he recently found himself
stymied by the opening screen of a popular computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't click the `I Accept' button for the licensing
agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs is blind.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories abound within the disabled community. This year
marks the 10th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act,
a measure that opened many buildings to those who have
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That landmark law, however, did not foresee the explosive rise
of the Web, which opens a world of possibilities for the
able-bodied -- and a maze of frustrations for those who cannot
easily view its snappy graphics, hear its colorful sounds or, as in
Coombs' case, manipulate a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   For them, technology can be a mixed blessing. Case in point:
Only last month did America Online, the world's largest Internet
service, agree to make its proprietary chat rooms and other
features accessible to screen-reading technologies used by the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   It took AOL 15 years and a lawsuit by the National Federation of
the Blind to come around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology advances. We get left behind,'' says Curtis Chong,
president of the federation's computer science chapter.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the last decade has brought many quality-of-life
advances for people with disabilities, from cochlear implants and
high-tech wheelchairs to hands-free computers controlled by the
blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet transforms commerce and communications for the
able-bodied, however, studies suggest this revolutionary technology
has not made a dent in unemployment rates for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent of working-age disabled persons in the United
States have full- or part-time jobs, according to a new Harris
survey. That figure has remained fairly constant over the last
decade, says the National Organization on Disability.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be a Catch-22 situation. Many people with
disabilities can't afford the high-tech equipment they need to hone
employment skills, says Doris Fleischer, New Jersey Institute of
Technology lecturer and co-author of an upcoming book, ``The
Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one-fourth of America's disabled population owns a
computer, Fleischer says, and only one-tenth uses the Internet. She
defines disability according to the Americans With Disabilities
Act: a condition affecting a basic life function. Government
rehabilitation programs can be stingy about providing computer gear
that might even the score.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Web has been a godsend. Yvonne Singer, whose
speech is hindered by cerebral palsy, pecks words and commands on a
keyboard with a pointer strapped to her forehead. She has edited
Web pages for a pharmaceutical company and posted poetry on her own
Web site while searching for full-time work and pursuing a master's
degree online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to say, and people have trouble understanding
me,'' says Singer, 31, of Matawan, N.J. ``On the Web, I don't have
that trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Web enables William Skawinski, a New Jersey
Institute of Technology professor who is blind, to download
scholarly articles onto his PC, where software converts the text to
speech. Years ago, he had to rely on others to read to him.
</P>
<P>
   Every new technology poses new barriers for the blind. ATMs once
had lots of buttons that blind users could feel; newer ``improved''
cash machines have touch-screens that require eyesight. Motorola's
wireless family phones initially sported an audio feature to
identify channels; a new version replaced this with a graphics
display.
</P>
<P>
   The PC arena has proven especially vexing for the blind, largely
because of Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system. As the
name implies, it is a visual environment, dependent on a
point-and-click ``graphical user interface.''
</P>
<P>
   Chong works closely with Microsoft, and says it's possible to
navigate Microsoft Word with keyboard commands instead of a mouse.
Intuit's QuickBooks, on the other hand, is useless to the blind, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has plenty of barriers, too.
</P>
<P>
   John Kemp, of halftheplanet.com, a Web site devoted to
disability issues, estimates 95 percent of sites are inaccessible
to 10 million visually impaired Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates vary widely. Whatever the number, many agree the
Web could be far friendlier to the disabled with minimal effort,
says Judy Brewer of the World Wide Web Consortium at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Web designers can embed descriptive tags in images and links,
enabling screen-reading software to audibly inform a blind person
what is depicted on a Web page. Audio files can be captioned for
those with hearing impairments. ``Text-only'' options, and bigger
buttons and icons, can be helpful, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of these things is legally required is another
story.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL settlement averted a trial that might have determined if
digital enterprises are subject to the Americans With Disabilities
Act. The 1990 law bans discrimination by most private employers,
all state and local government agencies, and such ``places of
public accommodation'' as museums, banks, restaurants and theaters.
The Clinton administration contends the act extends to the
Internet.

WE'VE GOT A NEW BARREL OF TOBACCO-INDUSTRY WHOPPERS
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Bemoaning the sins of the tobacco
industry these days is kind of like shooting smelly, rotten,
stone-cold fish in a barrel. It doesn't seem terribly sporting, and
about the only thing you get when you fire off a new round is more
fish goo on your shoes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But just when it looks like it's time to put a lid on the barrel
and move on, something else emerges about the tobacco industry that
sets the ol' fishing-finger to itching again.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the World Health Organization released a
255-page report detailing the tobacco industry's secret, slimy
efforts to sabotage the U.N. agency's anti-smoking programs in
developing countries. The report relies on a variety of sources,
including industry documents made public as part of recent
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco company memos are notoriously weird, but even by those
standards, these particular ditties make for bizarre and
entertaining reading. As I perused the WHO report online at
www.who.int/toh, I kept picturing Philip Morris chairman Geoffrey
Bible smashing a bass guitar at a stockholders meeting and singing,
``Talking 'bout my d-d-degeneration ...''
</P>
<P>
   One chapter focuses on a meeting Bible and fellow Philip Morris
muckety-mucks held in Florida in 1988. The Boca Raton Action Plan,
as their chat became known, specifically targeted the WHO. Among
other things, the executives discussed efforts to ``discredit key
individuals'' in WHO; lobby journalists to question the WHO budget
and its focus on smoking; and submit anti-WHO columns to newspapers
without revealing that the authors had financial ties to the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO report also details industry efforts to set up bogus
``grass-roots'' groups to spread disinformation about smoking; slip
``consultants'' into WHO headquarters to sit in on meetings and
sneak out confidential documents; and disrupt WHO-sponsored events.
</P>
<P>
   The latter idea makes for especially entertaining reading. The
industry had particularly high hopes for wrecking the
clunkily-named 8th World Conference on Tobacco OR Health in Buenos
Aires in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes from memos in which tobacco officials talked
about training hand-picked reporters to dominate press conferences
with tobacco-friendly questions. ``We must teach (the journalists)
how to be pushy and press the speakers aggressively,'' says the
memo. (Teach a journalist to be pushy? Great idea, and let's
schedule fish for swimming lessons while we're at it!)
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco officials also talked about having ``selected
reporters'' question Ted Kennedy, a conference attendee, about
``his alcohol dependence and highlight the sexual harassing blamed
on him in the USA, thus reducing the importance of his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody also dreamed up the idea of staging an international
soccer match on the day former President Jimmy Carter was scheduled
to arrive at the conference. Soccer is big in developing countries,
the reasoning went, and everyone would ignore Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The report says it's not clear how many of these wiggy plans
were actually implemented, but some _ like the bogus grass-roots
groups _ definitely materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign market was, and still is, essential to the
industry's survival. As The Washington Post recently noted, the
adult smoking rate in our country plummeted from 40 percent in 1964
to 23 percent in 1997. The rate in developing countries, meanwhile,
is going up 3 percent a year. The yearly death toll is expected to
hit 10 million worldwide by 2030 or sooner _ with two-thirds of the
deaths in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   Think tobacco companies are doing anything, anything at all, to
discourage it? Think they've given up on the ``Look, everybody,
Teddy's a drunken womanizer!'' tactics?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if we listen to the WHO, we won't get fooled again. I'm
not buying the tobacco companies' slick TV commercials claiming
they've put their degenerate days behind them. I'm not won over by
the sight of industry executives crying puddles over their alleged
poverty. (Poor? Philip Morris has given more than $600,000 to the
GOP alone since 1999, making it the party's single largest
corporate donor.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'd rather the tobacco companies put
a lid on it. My fishing-finger is tired.

   RUSSIA-BOMB (Moscow) _ A bomb exploded in a pedestrian underpass
at Pushkin Square in the center of Moscow at the height of
rush-hour Tuesday evening killing eight, seriously injuring eleven
and sending dozens of people fleeing smoke and flames that scorched
the large underground plaza. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov described
the explosion as a ``terrorist act,'' and appealed to Muscovites to
redouble their vigilance after a weekend in which the city had
declared a state of emergency to guard against terrorist attacks

   OLY-SWIMSUITS (Indianapolis) _ When the Olympic trials begin
here on Wednesday, American swimmers will make as much news for
what they are wearing as for what records they set in preparation
for the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia. A
bodysuit that fits athletes from neck to toe and comes with sleeves
has revolutionized the sport, reducing drag through the water. At
least 10 world records have been set worldwide this year in the new
swim suits. Speedo's version is called the Fastskin suit, which
contains tiny, v-shaped ridges that allow water to pass over the
swimmer more efficiently. The super-stretch fabric also compresses
a swimmer's muscles, therefore reducing the buildup of lactic acid
that causes fatigue. Swimmers also say the suit lifts them higher
in the water and makes it easier to stroke. By Jere Longman.

PADRE ISLAND VERDICT CASE REMINDER OF FORGOTTEN HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Anglicized history of the Texas Rio Grande Valley too often
begins with the 1846-48 Mexican War, when U.S. troops massed along
the river and built what eventually became Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   The incomplete history ignores a proud culture that prevailed
before the Army wrestled the ``Wild Horse Desert' '_ the land
between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River _ away from Mexico.
Native Americans are forgotten, as are the Spanish, who began their
settlements there in the 1750s.
</P>
<P>
   Ignored are the enormous cattle ranches that were formed north
of the Rio Grande and the strong and unique culture that had been
created by the 1800s. Proud hidalgos, the frontier noblemen, raised
their families with a love of tradition that evolved from Spanish
to Mexican to eventually Tejano. These families held millions of
acres.
</P>
<P>
   But those acres and that history were lost in the transition
from Mexico to Texas to the United States. Latter-day scholars call
it the ``gran despojo,'' or great robbery.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the recent Balli suit in Brownsville was all about:
ignoring history, stealing land.
</P>
<P>
   The case pitted the heirs of Padre Nicolas Balli, who was given
a Spanish land grant for Padre Island in the 18th century, against
90-year-old New York lawyer Gilbert Kerlin. Kerlin bought the
island from the Balli heirs in 1938, and agreed to pay the family a
share of any oil or gas discovered beneath the tropical beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Oil wells were established, but the family never received the
promised royalties. Kerlin contended that the Ballis didn't really
own the property at the time of the sale, and essentially all
agreements with them were off.
</P>
<P>
   An all-Hispanic jury in a state district court sided with the
Balli heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Balli family, ranging from 300 to 500 descendants in this
litigation, never demanded that they get the island back. They only
asked for the unpaid oil and gas royalties agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And most of all, they want the record to reflect _ as it
should for all South Texas Mexicans and Mexican-Americans _ that,
unlike U.S. history would have it, we once were somebodies,'' wrote
Cecilia Balli, a family member and a reporter for the San Antonio
Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that the Ballis and other Mexican landed
families colonized the area's native and nomadic Indians, and that
they built their own classist and racist society that
discriminated, based on gender, birth and skin color.
</P>
<P>
   But Balli, who was not part of the suit, went on to write: ``The
underlying resentment is that the arriving Americans, who at first
adopted Mexican customs and intermarried the Mexican daughters,
later would end up with all that land by sale, coercion or
manipulation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that in the larger U.S. imagination _ after all the wars
that changed South Texas' identity from Spanish, to Mexican, to
Texan, to American _ we somehow would forget about the rich life
that already was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ballis won't get rich again from their settlement. The money
is huge, but so, too, is the list of people among whom it must be
divided. But the Ballis have become empowered.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar but unrelated suit, another Balli line of heirs
seeks compensation from the famed Kenedy Ranch, which they say has
leased more than 300,000 acres from the Balli family for the past
140 years. The Balli family says it is owed oil and gas revenues
from the lease.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation that runs the ranch says it bought the land
outright and owes the family nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the courts will decide. But the course may already be
set.
</P>
<P>
   One attorney called the earlier decision a ``a wake-up call for
those who for years have denied the claims of land grant heirs.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have ignored history.

MIXED WELCOME GREETS DUCASSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The transition has been stunning and fast. Seven
weeks ago, Alain Ducasse was France's gift to New York, a chef with
eight Michelin stars, opening the ultimate in luxurious
restaurants. The anticipation surrounding the restaurant, Alain
Ducasse at the Essex House, had it booked for months, and had
produced a six-month waiting list with 2,700 names.
</P>
<P>
   Then the doors opened, and everything seemed to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The food world buzzed about the disappointing cooking and the
absentee chef. Endless stories mocked the $500 tabs, the wine list
with some bottles marked up 1,000 percent, and the pompous
dining-room rituals like the presentation of a selection of knives
with every squab and a choice of expensive pens for signing the
check. The coverage went from bad to worse, hitting bottom with an
article in Fortune magazine headlined ``Ishtar: The Restaurant.''
The restaurant took out a classified ad seeking employees a couple
of weeks after opening, amid rumors that waiters were quitting
because of paychecks that were slow in coming and tips that were
minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, it was possible to book a table for the very
next day.
</P>
<P>
   A two-page cartoon in The New Yorker titled ``A Cancellation at
Alain Ducasse'' subtly belittled the place for its pretensions. The
review in The New York Post was scathing. William Grimes, the
restaurant critic of The New York Times, wondered in a column about
an evening at the restaurant, ``Would I ever lay eyes on Ducasse?''
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian in London weighed in 10 days after the restaurant
opened asking why the first New Yorkers to try it ``say it's only
`OK''' The Daily Telegraph of London asked if ``the opening of
Ducasse will prove to have been an important cultural watershed,
marking the beginning of the end of the cult of celebrity chef.''
Within the last week, New York magazine and U.S.A. Today concluded
that, for the price, the place falls short.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ducasse's good notices have appeared either in fringe
publications or have not been reviews of the food.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the welcome expected by Ducasse, who was interviewed
through an interpreter about his New York reception. He is the only
chef in the world with two Michelin three-star restaurants _ one in
Paris, one in Monte Carlo _ plus two one-star restaurants scattered
among his other 10.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, at the age of 33, he was the youngest chef to be
awarded three stars. But even in Paris, he said, he initially faced
the same sort of bad press when he opened, in 1986. In New York, he
said, ``perhaps it is a little surprising how aggressive it is.''
And he added that ``if people will not accept this price, we will
go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Soltner, who was famous for not leaving the stove in his
four-star restaurant, Lutece, said that if Ducasse talked in this
way ``he's kaput, because New Yorkers don't have to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Soltner, who sold the restaurant five years ago, was interviewed
by telephone from France, where he is on vacation. ``When people
spend $300 or $400 for a meal they want you to be there,'' he said.
``They want you to cook a little. They want a little personal
attention and they want the food to be perfect. If New Yorkers
think they are being taken for a ride, then Ducasse will have
problems. If the food is not as good as about 20 restaurants in New
York then he will have to pack up and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Soltner has not eaten at the restaurant yet, he said, because he
wanted to give it a chance to settle in. Something the 2,700 people
whom the restaurant said were on the waiting list were not willing
to do.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that it is booked until December is apparently highly
inflated. In fact, using several names that would be unknown to the
restaurant, on a recent Thursday I was able to book for the
following Monday; last Tuesday, I booked for dinner the next night;
last Wednesday, I booked for lunch the next day. There have been so
many no-shows that the restaurant now charges $150 to a credit card
when a table is booked.
</P>
<P>
   Others have reported the same experience. Michael Batterberry, a
co-founder of Food Arts magazine, who ate lunch there recently,
said six or seven of the 18 tables were empty, a situation other
diners at lunch have also reported.
</P>
<P>
   Empty tables only compound a problem that some waiters
complained about bitterly: with just 65 seats in the restaurant,
and only two lunches and five dinners a week, each with only one
seating, total tips can be lower than at a place that is open for
lunch and dinner and where the tables turn at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that out myself,'' said one former waiter. He said
he left because he is an actor and wanted to be in Los Angeles. The
gratuity system at the restaurant rewards points to each dining
room employee depending on his job.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that if he were a professional waiter he would have
stayed there even though he could have earned more money elsewhere.
``It's a great place to work for a professional waiter because you
learn a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Urs Kaufmann, the manager of the restaurant, said that some
staff members did quit in the first weeks, but that was common at a
new restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufmann acknowledged problems with the pay in the beginning,
but he said the restaurant was not fully booking nor was it serving
private parties for the first couple of weeks. Four servers are
assigned to four or five tables at each meal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what their expectations were,'' Kaufmann said,
``but one waiter confronted me in front of the entire staff with an
absolutely ludicrous number. He said you can go and work at Jean
Georges and make $3,000 a week. I was left speechless, because that
is just rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kaufmann said, there were so many complaints when the
paychecks turned out ``so much below everyone's expectations, we
quickly issued extra cash checks to ease the tension.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If a large number of staff leave and we constantly
have to retrain staff, it costs so much time and effort and in the
long run we could never sustain that.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be another reason some of the waiters left: the
system of payment. At many restaurants, tips are distributed
nightly; at Ducasse tips are included in the paychecks, with taxes
withheld. ``I'm not sure they were used to this system,'' Kaufmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse insists that giving diners the table for the entire
evening is essential to the mood of the restaurant and it is one of
the reasons he charges at least one-third more than the other top
restaurants here. The food, he said, is only part of the
experience. He said the chef doesn't need to be present all of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of the chef is to form a good team to function
without the chef being there,'' he said. He added that he had spent
a year teaching his kitchen staff technique, and that ``18 chefs in
the kitchen is sufficient for 65 covers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, because of the criticism about his absence, Ducasse
says he is spending more time at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about price, you have to talk about what
you are getting,'' he said. ``The luxury of space and time. Our
guests are still sitting here at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good service, even down to the details of the waiters' suits,
bread that is baked twice a day, organic flour that is imported
from South America, the best ingredients. The idea that we are
pretentious because we offer a selection of knives is ridiculous. I
don't know any other restaurant where they do that. Perhaps the
people who are writing that have only average knowledge of what
they were writing about.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But it isn't only the critics who have failed to be overwhelmed
by the food. Many people who have eaten at the restaurant have been
disappointed, including some chefs who describe Ducasse as a
genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went once, but we're not going a second time,'' said Amy
Stein, a harpist who lives in Manhattan. ``The atmosphere was
fantastic. The food was very nice, but it didn't make me cry like
some restaurants in Paris do. You can go to other restaurants in
New York and have a great meal for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reports mentioned blood in the foie gras and that the
pigeon was cooked medium when it should have been medium-rare.
</P>
<P>
   But Ducasse dismisses such criticism by suggesting that the
diners don't know what they are talking about. For example, there
have been numerous complaints about the toughness of the lobster in
the lobster ravioli. To that Ducasse said, ``A perfectly cooked
lobster is slightly rubbery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The clientele in New York are capable of understanding what we
do,'' he continued. ``Mai oui. Bien sur. Bien sur.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the problem. &QL;

<P>
   HAMMONTON, N.J. _ The inland heart of South Jersey is a vast
national preserve, a million acres of former ocean bottom now a
primeval terrain of craggy pines and impenetrable forest scrub.
It's strangely beautiful and fragrant flatland, but not a place
anyone would expect to reap great harvests.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a century, however, farms large and small have done
just that. Sandwiched between showy Atlantic City and stately
Philadelphia, the Pine Barrens of South Jersey is prime blueberry
country. This lean, sandy and acidic soil puts forth about 40
million pounds of the tender fruit, enough to make the state second
only to Michigan in blueberry production. This summer's consistent,
merciful weather _ which was dismal for corn and tomatoes _ was
ideal for blueberries. It has been the best harvest in recent
memory in Burlington County.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, New Jersey blueberries dominate the market in New
York from late June to mid-August, filling in between the first
blueberries of summer, shipped up from Florida, and the last of the
season, from Michigan. Twenty-seven other states and Canada produce
the fruit in season, but in many ways, New Jersey is their true
home, the place where the modern berry was developed and definitely
where it thrives.
</P>
<P>
   There's something irresistible about blueberries, and it shows
on the freshly stained blue smiles of farmers, pickers, packers and
executives who work in close proximity to them here. Blueberries
have a gracefully subdued burst of sweetness that fades on the
tongue and leaves you wanting more. Although berries early in the
season are known for their size, and late ones for their intensity,
nearly all blueberries achieve an easy balance of sweet and tart, a
dewy, baritone berryness with a suggestion of cinnamon and a
slightly tannic finish.
</P>
<P>
   Few fruits fit as easily into summer meals. Their easy balance
of sweet and tart brighten everything from breakfast granola and
pancakes to sophisticated desserts like the elegant sour cream cake
at March restaurant in Manhattan. Even better, they have recently
been found to be especially beneficial to health.
</P>
<P>
   Blueberries are a completely native American crop, but the kind
most common today originated in the 1920s, when Elizabeth White,
the enterprising daughter of a cranberry farmer in Pemberton, N.J.,
set out to improve upon the wild huckleberries that grew in the
forest thickets and swamps. She selected cuttings and bred bushes
that form the largest, sweetest-tasting berries, with the darkest
blue color and the tiniest seeds. In collaboration with Dr.
Frederick Coville, a botanist in the federal Agriculture Department
who had also been working to improve the huckleberry, she developed
the modern blueberry. These are called high-bush blueberries to
distinguish them from the wild, ground-hugging low-bush variety
common in Maine and New England.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 varieties of cultivated blueberries, like
Blue Crop, Chanticleer, Blue Jay, and Weymouth, but they are nearly
indistinguishable to the palate of the average consumer. Growers
contend that in blind taste tests they can identify varieties, yet
blueberries are rarely segregated in harvesting. Variety serves
primarily to give farmers as long a season as possible, since some
varieties ripen earlier, some at the height of the season, roughly
July 15 to July 30, and others late. Distinctions _ not only of
variety, but of origin _ have become less and less apparent to
consumers, now that blueberries are a year-round fruit, shipped in
from South American countries like Chile in winter.
</P>
<P>
   This season, you would be hard pressed to find American farmers
in better circumstances than the blueberry growers here.
</P>
<P>
   In Weymouth, N.J., a hundred pallets of blueberries, about
50,000 pounds, is barely a few hours' work for Dennis Doyle's team
of roughly 1,000 pickers, who move down the rows with quick-fire
efficiency, nudging each berry off the bush into a can or bucket,
to be consolidated in sturdy yellow plastic lugs. Doyle, a former
president of the Tru-Blu Cooperative in New Lisbon, N.J., which
packages and markets berries, is the product manager for the
Atlantic Blueberry Co., which bills itself as the largest
family-run blueberry farm in the world. Its 1,300 acres produce
nearly a quarter of the state's annual yield.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of Atlantic's business is in fresh blueberries,
sorted and boxed in a warehouse alongside the fields. Most are
destined for markets on the East Coast, within a day's drive of
South Jersey. The rest are processed berries, the frozen
blueberries that end up in a Smith's blueberry pie or at the bottom
of a Dannon yogurt cup.
</P>
<P>
   Other blueberry farmers cater more to the pick-your-own market.
Stanley Worrell, a spry 54-year-old with a joshing manner, has a
40-acre farm, a swatch of weedy white sand framed by pine forest.
His Blue Crop plants, in straight, orderly rows, are rangy shrubs
that grow to shoulder height at maturity. Stiff, slightly waxy
green leaves partly conceal clusters of marble-size berries, whose
color is equal parts indigo and battleship gray.
</P>
<P>
   As Worrell walks the rows, he can't resist snacking. Neither can
the Manhattan couple he greets, wearing sun hats and sandals, blue
tin cans cinched around their waists and brimming with fruit.
Although he sells already-picked blueberries for only 34 cents a
pound more, the retirees and suburban families who turn out by the
dozens to spend a day picking in the fields don't do it to save
money. ``They bring their kids and grandkids and picnic under the
pines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the steady retail traffic on Worrell's farm represents a
small fraction of the 125,000 pounds of berries he sells in a good
season. Most of his berries go to the Tru-Blu Cooperative, whose
members pay a 10 percent commission for its services: inspecting
the berries, providing packing materials, consolidating the harvest
and then selling the berries to wholesalers, greengrocers and
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the best of years, small blueberry farmers rarely
survive on that crop alone. From September to May, Worrell works
full time, as an instructor at a nearby center for juvenile
offenders. Fred Dietrich, the president of Tru-Blu, was a
humanities professor at Glassboro State University in New Jersey
before he retired; he now farms blueberries at Fred Plus Three
Farm. ``I'm only in it for the love of it,'' Dietrich said. ``My
wife calls it Fred's folly.'' Although Dietrich's roots in the area
go back several generations, neither of his sons plans to take over
the business. And of the 238 farms that created the cooperative in
the early 1940s, he said, only 41 remain.
</P>
<P>
   Harvesting and selling blueberries takes only 60 days, but
growing them requires steady, year-round toil. Cultivated blueberry
bushes (Vaccinium corymbosum) grow for three years before they
become fully productive and produce for about eight years before
they must be replaced. Like grapevines, each bush must be pruned
and tended by hand each winter. The soil must be weeded and
irrigated, its chemical composition monitored to keep acidity
balanced, and insects and fungi must be warded off. And then there
are mammals to contend with, particularly deer and birds.

   WASHINGTON _ Former U.S. President George Bush conceded that he
went too far last week in threatening to say just what he thought
of his successor, Bill Clinton, ``as a human being and a person,''
if Clinton persisted with personalized attacks on his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Bush told Time magazine in an interview in
Monday's issue. ``I went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush senior had been riled by a string of comments made by
Clinton at a fund-raising event in New England last week about his
son, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Mocking what he said was George W. Bush's rationale for his
presidential bid, Clinton said: ``How bad can I be? I've been
governor of Texas. My Daddy was president. I own a baseball team.
Their fraternity had it for eight years, give it to ours for eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The ridicule of George W. drew howls of laughter from Democrats
and admiration from political pundits, who saw in Clinton's ability
to sum up George W. Bush weaknesses so succinctly still more proof
of his political genius.
</P>
<P>
   The pact of Clinton's attack was only reinforced when George
Bush senior took it upon himself to respond on his son's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a television interview to react to the president's
remarks, Bush swallowed the bait and said that he would give
Clinton one month and if he had not ceased his attacks, he would
tell the same reporter exactly what he thought of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His son was far more careful, refusing initially to comment, and
then remarking: ``It's amazing to me that the president of the
United States would spend time trying to be a political pundit.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president's threat raised eyebrows on two counts. Not
only would any attack on Clinton breach the convention that former
presidents do not attack incumbent presidents; it also sent the
message that George W. Bush was a ``Daddy's boy,'' incapable of
fighting his own battles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's mother, former first lady, Barbara, has also come close
to attacking Clinton on her son's behalf, reportedly drawing a
rebuke from her son.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush parents' defensive intervention before the New
Hampshire primary was seen as one factor in their son's loss in
that state to John McCain, and their role in the campaign was
scaled down thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``daddy's boy'' charge will remain potentially
damaging for George W. Bush, any sustained attacks by Clinton on
Bush risk exposing Vice President Al Gore, to the charge that he is
not his own man.
</P>
<P>
   One telling cartoon depicted the small figures of George W. and
Al Gore slugging it out in a boxing ring, while gigantic depictions
of the current and former presidents yelled exhortations to their
surrogates on from opposite corners. &QL;

HYPE HOPES: WHICH OLYMPIC ATHLETES WILL VAULT FROM SPORTS TO FAME?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Acuff, one of America's top Olympic hopefuls, is in midleap,
blond hair and muscular legs thrown back, eyes squeezed shut in
concentration, arms outspread.
</P>
<P>
   But something isn't quite right. For one thing, the top-ranked
high jumper is wearing a black leather bikini instead of a track
suit. And instead of the gritty sports realism one often sees in
Sports Illustrated photographs, the image is charged with the
unmistakable sexuality typical of cheesecake shots of starlets.
</P>
<P>
   Which was exactly the intention. The photo is the August cover _
one of three covers, actually _ of Esquire magazine, which
celebrates 10 of this year's female Summer Olympics hopefuls.
Esquire's not dishonest about its intentions: The cover line is
``Strength &AMP; Beauty _ a portfolio of America's 10 sexiest
athletes.'' And the magazine does at least give lip service to the
sporting abilities of Acuff, triathlete Lokelani McMichael and
pentathlete Mary Beth Larsen, as well as the seven other women
athletes in the magazine who don't grace one of the ``collector's
covers'' of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Such photo spreads are an increasingly common part of the
Olympics hype machine, and some athletes might even hope these
efforts will arouse the interest of a Hollywood talent hunter or
two. After all, these women are about to get national prime-time
television exposure, and as the careers of Jenny McCarthy, Carmen
Electra and other untrained actresses prove, that's half the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably that rare athlete in Sydney or in Salt Lake
City who will cross over'' to a TV or movie career, says U.S.
Olympic Committee spokesman Mike Moran. ``TV is huge, and with that
kind of close-up look at them and their faces and their
personalities, they may get crossover appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hollywood stardom is what these athletes necessarily
have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been interested in acting,'' Acuff says via e-mail.
``I'd rather live my life than pretend to live other people's
lives. I'm convinced it's not as glamorous as it seems because many
actors dream about being famous recording artists or sports
stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, few Olympic athletes who have crossed the street to
Hollywood's dream factory have much to show for it. Swimmer Johnny
Weissmuller, still the most famous Tarzan of the movies, had a
seven-film career, but in only one _ the 1946 B-movie ``Swamp
Fire'' _ did he stretch beyond his signature King of the Jungle
role. Figure skater Sonja Henie, who competed in three Olympics in
the '20s and '30s, appeared in a series of inconsequential musicals
in the '30s and '40s and is largely forgotten today. To name a few
recent examples, 1976 decathlete Bruce Jenner appeared in the 1980
Village People romp ``Can't Stop the Music'' (as well as the TV cop
show ``CHiPs''), and gymnast Mitch Gaylord starred in a virtually
unwatchable 1986 bomb called ``American Anthem,'' before being
relegated to straight-to-video pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that there are some Olympians who have visions
of movie careers,'' says Todd Thaler, a casting director who has
worked on such movies as Sylvester Stallone's ``Cop Land'' and
Barbra Streisand's ``The Mirror Has Two Faces.'' ``But I can't say
that I watch the Olympics with an eye toward who has crossover
potential. ... I always have an eye toward who's the hot new
property, but it's more likely that I'd find them through a talent
show at a conservatory training program.''
</P>
<P>
   So why do athletes like Acuff, who deny an interest in
Hollywood, play the glamour vamp for national magazines? That's
easy, she says: to raise awareness of her sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for most people to remember in detail something that
happens only (every) four years in the span of 16 days,'' Acuff
says of the Olympics. ``It seems like El Nino comes to the U.S.
more often than track-and-field coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   So, with the days of amateur, part-time athletics gone forever,
Olympians sometimes go to great lengths to get our attention _ and
sponsors. They employ makeup artists and image consultants and go
all out in colorful, form-fitting outfits that look like they've
come straight from the Milan fashion runways.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the change in dress and style is not only a result of
economics, but also of a change in attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, says Moran, when the Olympics was a
battleground for Cold War ideologies, people thought differently
about the Games. The Olympics was front-line work for the greater
democratic good, and athletes dressed and acted accordingly. Now
the quadrennial event is marketed and packaged almost purely as
entertainment, and the athletes have evolved with the times.

 HAMMONTON, N.J.: and birds.

<P>
   Most of the fresh berries Worrell sells are picked by hand,
because they command a better price. Machine harvesters, both the
deluxe, Zamboni-like model and the smaller kind towed by a tractor,
are boxy contraptions that straddle the bushes, brushing berries
off with spring-loaded feelers. The berries collect in a trough,
and a conveyor deposits them in a bin.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, though, are rougher on the berries and
significantly less picky than the pickers. Machine-harvested
berries are most often sold to companies like Ocean Spray to be
made into purees, syrups and juices.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most subtle flaw in a crop, the presence of a green
berry in a pint, or a faintly darker cast to the lot, will
influence the price. Blueberries are moderately perishable;
handpicked at the perfect moment of firm ripeness, they will keep
10 to 15 days if refrigerated. (They also freeze extremely well.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tru-Blu Cooperative is the first test of a farmer's product.
On a radiant Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of trucks laden with
tall pallets of blueberries pulled up to the cinder-block storage
shed and loading dock in New Lisbon. Sheri Sansone, who manages the
operation in season, drove a forklift, hoisting pallets of berries
from the trucks onto the dock, to be ferried to the walk-in cooler
to chill before pickup the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   When she wasn't on the forklift, Sansone was on the phone,
fielding calls from buyers for supermarkets and cajoling growers to
harvest more berries. In her role as the Tru-Blu inspector, she
picked through a pallet of pint containers and removed a
picture-perfect sample: rotund berries with taut skins and perfect
bloom, the powdery, silvery appearance of a blueberry still on the
bush.
</P>
<P>
   For all the domestic demand for blueberries, a market is
building overseas. The bilberry, a close relative to the blueberry,
is native to France and parts of Europe, but so far New Jersey
berries are not big sellers there. In Japan, they are used to make
jelly candies and other treats, packaged to appeal to children and
teen-agers. Korea and China are also starting to buy blueberries.
</P>
<P>
   Growers in New Jersey are keen to open new markets, because
every year seems to find new competition, both from large growers
in the United States and from Central America. In the last 20
years, varieties of blueberry have been developed that are suited
to the hotter climates of southern states like Florida and North
Carolina, which now produce millions of pounds of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But at least for the moment, blueberries are doing well, helped
by a 1996 study by the Department of Agriculture at the Human
Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, which
ranked 40 fruits and vegetables for antioxidant properties, which
are said to mitigate the effects of aging on the body. The study
put blueberries on top, with blackberries, kale and garlic
following. The findings were well publicized last year and led to
what has been a recognizable, if not dramatic, uptick in blueberry
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, what makes blueberries irresistible is their
taste. A fistful of fresh berries might be the most expedient way
to experience them, but cooking with them, for those who can defer
gratification, can intensify their flavor. Heating blueberries
moderately with a little water and sugar makes a simple, versatile
sauce. After a few minutes on the flame, the berries redden and
liquefy, reducing to a vivid blueberry concentrate, delicious
drizzled over vanilla ice cream or a pound cake. The syrup keeps
for several days in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are frequently combined with other berries in
baked desserts, prefer to keep blueberries to themselves, to avoid
outflanking them with an assertive strawberry or raspberry flavor.
Lemon, lime and cinnamon, used sparingly, can complement and
enhance the natural essence of blueberry. Or toss a cinnamon stick
or even a bay leaf (a distant cousin of the blueberry) into the
simmering sauce to add complexity.
</P>
<P>
   But always, be careful not to oversweeten blueberry desserts,
which too many cooks do. Go easy on the sugar and instead, add more
blueberries. A handful more never hurt a recipe. And it just might
help you live longer.

   Athletes today are ``more informed about our culture,'' Moran
says. ``They're more willing to pose for things, do things that
they wouldn't do 10 or 20 years ago. Most of our marquee athletes
have agents now. I think it's simply reflective of a media culture
all over; they're just a different athlete because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the media _ and fans _ respond to them in kind. Esquire
wasn't the only lifestyle magazine to do an Olympics spread this
summer. GQ did a fashion shoot featuring Olympians of both genders.
Men's Journal also weighed in, though it actually treated them as
athletes, writing about the Olympics' most pitched rivalries. Maxim
reportedly also has an Olympics-themed spread in the works, but
given the magazine's penchant for scantily clad celebrities, don't
expect it to maximize coverage of the players' athletic talents.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking almost exclusively U.S. Olympians here, by the
way. But the flood of lifestyle-magazine coverage isn't inspired by
a burst of patriotic fervor _ or by Olympics fervor, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly excited about the Olympics,'' says David
Granger, Esquire's editor in chief. ``I do think it's sort of a
golden age of the female athlete, and that's caused by all the
obvious things _ the women's World Cup team and the dawn of the
WNBA _ but I can't say that I'm all that excited about these
athletes because they're in the Olympics. I just think we're in a
really interesting time as far as the image of the woman athlete
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Granger says that he began considering doing a feature on the
Olympics as early as April but didn't decide to make it the cover
story until he saw the strength of the photos _ particularly that
of pentathlete Larsen, which depicts her on horseback, decked out
in jeans and sports bra, scowling in front of a stormy sky as if
she were a Valkyrie.
</P>
<P>
   Like Larsen, all the women in the layout have the poise and
pouts of professional models, which for many is a better fit than
acting. Swimmer Ashley Tappin and surfer Malia Jones have done some
professional modeling, as has Acuff, who plays it down as a
necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done some modeling in Los Angeles, where I now live,
but this is mainly for professional income,'' she says. ``Rent is
expensive here. Unless you're Maurice Green or Marion Jones, track
and field is not a lucrative sport, and to make any money in my
event, it's imperative that I stay in the top five in the world and
win some key meets. With a little injury, suddenly an athlete is
making $0.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns can lead an athlete far afield, especially if
they're far from shy. Last year, Acuff posed, along with 11 other
members of the U.S. track-and-field team, for a 2000 pin-up
calendar; Acuff was Miss July, naked save for red-white-and-blue
paint. She has also appeared on the ``Today'' show and ``The
Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' where she high-jumped over a variety
of objects, including a bar festooned with her favorite weakness _
Krispy Kreme doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   She even has a Web site, www.amyacuff.com, but then so do many
of her fellow athletes; the Internet is even more of a presence for
this year's Olympics than it was as recently as the 1998 Winter
Games. Basketball contender (and WNBA athlete) DeLisha Milton also
has a Web site, www.delishamilton.com. Tappin, Marion Jones and
Michael Johnson are among those who have sites under construction.
</P>
<P>
   These celebrity trappings, some athletes have found, cut both
ways. It can be disconcerting when they're no longer sure if the
attention they receive comes from their athletic accomplishments or
from performing stunts for Jay Leno, though Acuff says she finds
positive uses for her fame regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get embarrassed when I'm in the grocery store in my
hometown and someone stops to praise me, because I don't know how
to respond except to say `Thank you,''' she says. ``That's about
the biggest level of celebrity I've experienced to date.
Ultimately, I think the best thing about having a degree of
celebrity is that it can allow people to be a voice for those who
aren't being heard, to help people in need, or to inspire people.
That's the most attractive element.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran, however, says that the pursuit of fame as an end unto
itself increasingly motivates Olympians in today's media-dominated
world, and that trend is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes,'' he says, ``clearly understand, after they hit
the elite level now, that there's a lucrative lifestyle out
there.''

   Scientists have often wondered why so many houses in California
remain standing after an earthquake. But now they think they know
why: stucco helps the buildings stick together. And this
weather-resistant coating is very commonly used in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of California in San Diego built a
simple, two-story house _ typical of 90 percent of homes in
Southern California _ and placed it on a hydraulic shake table that
simulates earthquakes. The artificial quakes were equivalent to the
1994 Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles, which registered 6a7
on the Richter scale and caused damage worth $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first test houses didn't have stucco _ they were just
wooden framed skeletons with a plywood shell,'' says John Hall of
the California Institute of Technology, manager of the
house-shaking project. In these tests, the top of the house swayed
back and forth 12.5 centimeters further than the bottom. But when
it was given an outer skin of stucco _ a plaster made of dehydrated
lime, powdered marble and glue, mounted on a wire mesh _ the top
swayed only 2.5 centimeters, Hall says.
</P>
<P>
   In the house, appliances toppled, and water heaters and shelves
fell off the walls. But the structure suffered nothing worse than a
few cracks. The degree of protection depends on the gap behind the
stucco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's placed far enough away from the wood frame, it allows
the wire mesh enough room to absorb most of the tension when the
house shakes,'' Hall says. ``It's like having a protective box of
concrete around your house.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers next plan to find out how old stucco can be
repaired to make older buildings less vulnerable during quakes. &QL;

   Eve is dead, say Michigan paleontologists. They claim their
analysis of an Australian fossil overturns the dominant theory of
the origin of our species.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists believe that Homo sapiens _ the modern human _
is descended from a hypothetical African ``Eve.'' We marched out of
Africa 100,000 years ago to spread across the globe, the theory
goes, completely replacing older, local populations of hominids
such as Homo erectus along the way. But some researchers, including
Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, believe
that modern humans are the product of continual worldwide mixing of
populations and gene flow between ancient hominids.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence of his theory, Wolpoff turned to a 15,000-year-old
hominid cranium, called WLH 50, unearthed in Australia in 1982.
Wolpoff's graduate student John Hawks and his colleagues compared
dozens of features on WLH 50 with an earlier Homo erectus skull
from Ngandong in Java and an early African skull. If the Eve theory
is correct, the Australian and Javan skulls should be unrelated.
But the researchers say that WLH 50 appears more like the Ngandong
skull than the African sample both in shape, such as the sloped
forehead, and in the size of features such as the ridge on the top
of the cranium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes the Eve replacement theory wrong and our theory
right,'' says Wolpoff.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stringer, a human origins expert at the Natural History
Museum in London, says he still prefers the replacement theory. The
large size of WLH 50 makes it superficially look like the Ngandong
skull, he says. &QL;

<P>
   The giant canyons on Mars were carved not by water but by an icy
equivalent of the rivers of ash that helped to destroy Pompeii,
claims an Australian geologist.
</P>
<P>
   If he's right, this would mean that Mars has been cold and dry _
and probably lifeless _ for the past 3.5 billion years, far longer
than most scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars has always been a place of people's imaginations,'' says
Nick Hoffman of La Trobe University in Melbourne. ``People want
Mars to be an abode for Earth-like life forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman thinks ``density flows,'' similar to the so-called
pyroclastic flows of gas, ash and rubble that sometimes come from
erupting volcanoes on Earth, eroded the surface of Mars. Such flows
can travel at tremendous speeds and cover vast distances.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hoffman, the collapse of unstable Martian terrain,
such as steep-sided craters, released liquid carbon dioxide that
had been locked away underground. The rapid pressure drop vaporized
some of this liquid _ just like releasing the valve on a CO2 fire
extinguisher _ forming clouds of gas and supercooled dry ice, as
well as water ice, dust and rubble. These clouds swept downhill,
carving immense channels without water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intriguing and fascinating, but I'm very skeptical,''
says planetary scientist Jay Melosh of the University of Arizona in
Tucson, though he adds that the idea is worth testing in the lab.
One problem, says Melosh, is that as gas bubbled off, the flows
would run out of steam and be unable to carve channels as long as
those on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffman disagrees. As the ``cryoclastic'' flow sped along,
the supercooled CO2 particles would continue to vaporize, fueling
the process, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Zent at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field,
California, raises another concern. The channels on Mars end in
wide flat expanses, with traces of a shoreline _ just as if water
had flooded a plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the flattest place in the Universe,'' Zent says. ``You
would have had to have done that with water.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman counters that density currents can create the same
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Earth, large density flows create characteristic wide, flat
plains, just like the northern plains on Mars,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, says Hoffman, cryoclastic flows provide a simpler
explanation for the giant channels on Mars's surface than water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd need sufficient water to create walls 200 kilometers
wide and at least 300 meters deep, and there isn't enough space
below the surface of Mars to put it all. But 1 liter of liquid CO2
gives you 250 liters of gaseous CO2 to support a flow.'' &QL;

<P>
   A fresh analysis of a classic pollution study has vindicated its
conclusion that city-dwellers in Europe and the United States are
dying young because of microscopic particles in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the concern about particulate pollution began in 1993
with the publication of the Harvard ``Six Cities'' study, which
identified particles with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers
(PM10) as a threat to public health. A team of researchers at the
Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, led by Douglas Dockery,
compared death rates and pollution levels in six American cities by
following more than 8000 adults for up to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the death rates increased in almost direct
proportion to the level of particulate pollution. People living in
the most polluted city _ Steubenville, Ohio _ had a 26 percent risk
of dying young compared with residents of the cleanest city, which
was Portage, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   A larger study by the American Cancer Society in 1995 tested
these findings by following 550,000 adults over seven years. Once
again, there appeared to be a strong link between death rates and
particulate pollution. Critics of these studies argued, however,
that other differences between the cities _ such as poverty _ might
be responsible for the different death rates.
</P>
<P>
   So the Health Effects Institute, an independent research
organization in Cambridge, Mass., funded jointly by industry and
the U.S. government's Environmental Protection Agency, spent three
years reanalyzing the data and testing dozens of different
explanations for the results. They controlled for factors such as
education, ethnicity, income levels and the availability of health
care, as well as differences in other pollutants, temperature and
humidity.
</P>
<P>
   But the reanalysis broadly confirmed the original conclusion.
``For the most part, the inclusion of these additional factors did
not alter the association,'' says team leader Daniel Krewski of the
University of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very surprised and relieved, actually,'' Dockery says.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Pope of the Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, who
led the American Cancer Society study, hopes the results will end
the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The HEI study suggests that tiny particles with a diameter of
less than 2.5 micrometers, or PM2.5, are more dangerous than PM10.
Most of the PM2.5 fraction is caused by by-products of combustion,
which may contain more carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the US sets air-quality standards for both PM10 and
PM2.5. Europe only has a standard for PM10, but the European
Commission is due to review its particle pollution standards. Roy
Harrison of the University of Birmingham, who advises the British
government on particulate air pollution, says separate monitoring
is unnecessary because, in Britain at least, PM2.5 levels rise and
fall with PM10 levels.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Brown of Britain's National Society for Clean Air says
researchers need to know more about how particle composition _ and
not just size _ affects health. Brown asks: ``Are all particles
equally dangerous?'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been listening to political banter of late, you may
think the presidential campaign is taking place in a preschool,
what with all this chatter about ``grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Grown-up. It's the catchword lately among pundits and
journalists both inside and outside the Beltway. Just in the past
week alone:
</P>
<P>
   -- An editorial in The Wall Street Journal identified
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Democratic candidate Al Gore's
new running mate, as ``a political grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Ron Reagan Jr. chastised Republican candidate George W. Bush
in The Washington Post for having made a snide comment about an
executed inmate: ``No grown-up would ever do that.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A Boston Globe writer termed Bush's acceptance speech ``the
ultimate grown-up act.''
</P>
<P>
   -- David Gergen of U.S. News &AMP; World Report agreed on
``Nightline'' that during the speech, ``gone was the sense that
this is a fellow that's not quite grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   -- And MSNBC talking head Chris Matthews declared that Bush's
speech was ``a brilliant summation of the Republican strategy. ...
On the topic of Al Gore, don't even give him the credibility of a
grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   As with so much political talk, the term ``grown-up'' carries
different meanings, said Diana Carlin, professor of communication
studies at the University of Kansas-Lawrence and an expert on
political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a baby boomer myself, I know that in our own minds, a
lot of boomers still don't see themselves as now running things,''
Carlin said. ``We've been a generation that has not wanted to grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first presidential election with two baby boomer
candidates, Bush and Gore. When Bill Clinton ran against President
George Bush, and later Kansas Republican Sen. Bob Dole, those
contests were seen as the baby boomers vs. the World War II
generation.
</P>
<P>
   So what America is witnessing with this election is the final,
total generational power shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``And any time there is a shift, we really have to,
symbolically, through language, suggest that now is the time for
the next generation to take over,'' Carlin said.
</P>
<P>
   As in John F. Kennedy's now-famous inaugural phrase, ``The torch
has passed to a new generation of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at it with a negative spin, the term grown-up ``is a
veiled reference, obviously, to the Clinton problems'' with intern
Monica Lewinsky that took place in the Oval Office, Carlin said.
``Some would view that as not being very grown-up behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan was quoted last week in The Christian Science
Monitor as saying that Bush's wife, Laura, makes sure the candidate
``acts mostly like a grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is a professor of government specializing in
presidential politics at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I meant was that she was keeping his inner scamp under
control, his desire to show disrespect,'' Buchanan said. ``Bush has
a chip on his shoulder toward various icons, particularly Eastern
intellectuals, and Laura reins him in on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that in other cases, he thinks ``grown-up'' refers
to ``maturity. As John McCain said in one of his speeches, it
embodies the responsibility to interests larger than
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   And, specifically in Bush's case, sobriety and ``the possibility
of redemption,'' Buchanan added.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the term within the political arena goes back several
years, Buchanan said. After ``Newt Gingrich and company and all
their breathing fire and hurling spears, it was said that when
Gingrich left, the grown-ups came back to power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also agreed that the shadow of Clinton hides behind the
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``Self-control is an element of being a
grown-up as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Republican strategist Ken Duberstein last week told
Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service that Gore had to ``find a
grown-up in the Democratic Party'' for his vice-presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started using that term a few weeks ago,'' said Duberstein,
who served President Reagan as chief of staff. ``I was talking
about the fact that both Bush and Gore needed grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, ``the person had to be seasoned, experienced,
ready,'' Duberstein said. ``Not simply good for the ticket, but for
governing. Not an old-fashioned choice, someone who would deliver a
certain state, but someone to govern, to be an adult, someone who'd
been around the track.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what happened, Duberstein added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, in Dick Cheney, George W. got an adult. Cheney's a
former White House chief of staff, congressman, a Republican leader
in the House, the secretary of defense. A member of the governing
class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection of Cheney put pressure on Gore,'' Duberstein
continued. ``And with Lieberman, Gore eliminated some people who
would have been perceived as wet behind the ears, and he found
someone clearly mature and grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein sees a positive outcome to all this public talk of
grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's reassuring that even with all the complaints and
criticisms of the selection process for the president and vice
president, the system works,'' he said. ``We ended up with four
adults running.''

CELEBRITY SKINNED: NEW BOOK SKEWERS THE CULTURE OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JEFF GUINN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a screenwriter and free-lance journalist whose work has
appeared in publications ranging from Salon to the San Francisco
Examiner, 32-year-old Cintra Wilson has met enough famous people to
conclude there's something wrong with most of them _ and with us,
for making them famous. Wilson's satirical book, ``A Massive
Swelling: Celebrity Re-Examined as a Grotesque Crippling Disease
and Other Cultural Revelations,'' has just been published by
Viking. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reached Wilson in her Brooklyn
apartment, where she ruminated about the nature _ and dangers _ of
modern-day fame.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What made you decide to write a book about fame and
its ramifications?
</P>
<P>
   Wilson: The publisher of Salon helped me get a book deal before
I knew what I wanted to write about. Then I saw some play that had
a line, ``Fame is the spiritual disease of the 20th century.'' So I
stole that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you really believe the modern concept of celebrity is bad
for both famous people and their fans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course it is! Look at the intense emotions nontalents can
stir up. Kathie Lee Gifford's a good example. She has some fans who
think she's perfect, and millions of people who think all her
orifices ought to be stitched up. We spend time even thinking about
Kathie Lee Gifford? What does that say about us?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yet you make a living writing about just that kind of
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I've also been a fairly unsuccessful screenwriter. I've
done a couple of things for Francis Ford Coppola. I rewrote some
material for HBO. I really got started as an underground playwright
in San Francisco, which is where I'm from. I put together eight
full productions in six years. But that turned out not to be
enough. What I really wanted to do was eclipse Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you want to be famous, too?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's better that I didn't get to be. I think I would, if
famous, make a rotten diva of a human being. The servants would be
selling their stories to the National Enquirer. I think the real
story of my career is that I have never been able to sell out
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What qualifications do you, personally, have for fame?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a smart-mouth. Isn't that enough?
</P>
<P>
   Q: You also may be in trouble after some celebrities read what
you've written about them in ``A Massive Swelling.'' Cher, for
instance, may not like all the comments about plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true I better never write a screenplay that ends up with
Cher starring in it. Hey, I'm not the first person to slag off on
Cher. She ought to be used to it by now. See, that's the thing
about these so-called celebrities _ they at least ought to have a
sense of humor about themselves. When they don't, that's when you
know they're never going to last. I'd like to think Cher might read
about herself in my book and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You think that would ever happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``A Massive Swelling'' also suggests Michael Jackson's odd
personal tendencies outweigh his artistic talents.
</P>
<P>
   A: When I look at Michael Jackson I just think, ``Where's the
nose?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you also critical of publications that exist to glorify
celebrities, like, say, People?
</P>
<P>
   A: People? Fish wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what is it, really, that you think is so dangerous about
fame?
</P>
<P>
   A: Too many people want it too badly, and often ruin their lives
pursuing it. The rest of us encourage them; our fascination with
famous people is just as bad.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So if you hate fame so much, are you willing to renounce
still wanting to be famous yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes _ no _ yes _ no! I don't know! See? Wanting to be famous
is a filthy little addiction. It's a horrible kind of disease,
particularly since I think my own chances of becoming famous are
slim.

CHILE'S HIGH COURT ENDS PINOCHET'S IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Chilean Supreme Court announced Tuesday
that it would revoke Gen. Augusto Pinochet's senatorial immunity,
removing a giant legal hurdle for the arrest and trial of the
former dictator on charges he was responsible for the kidnapping,
torture and killing of thousands of people during his 17 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 14-6 confirms a lower court ruling in May by the
Chilean Court of Appeals and will allow an investigation, and
possible trial, to go forward. The actual decision was made in a
secret vote, but not announced until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Pinochet have argued that he should be stripped of
his immunity because of a wealth of evidence linking him to the
disappearance of Chilean citizens opposed to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean government has said secret police were responsible
for the disappearance of 3,197 people in the nearly two decades
Pinochet was in power.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet took power after he led a coup in 1973 to bring down
Chile's Marxist government. He exercised that power through a
campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces more than 100 criminal complaints, mostly filed
by family members of the more than 3,000 people who disappeared.
Judge Juan Guzman is prosecuting Pinochet, has anchored his case on
and the disappearance of 19 people immediately after the 1973 coup.
He has said he hopes to question the former dictator about these 19
incidents. Opponents of Pinochet believe the 19 were executed on
the orders of top government advisers.
</P>
<P>
   He has denied ever ordering any killings or torture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Pinochet took the position of ``senator for life,''
largely to give himself the protection from prosecution that public
officials enjoy. Pinochet was never elected to the Senate. He
assumed the seat by applying a constitutional provision written
during his rule, which lasted until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who is 84 years old and suffering from heart ailments
and diabetes, could die before he is convicted of any crimes in
Chile. But his opponents say that holding him accountable for his
actions is an important step toward creating a civilian-run
democracy based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers have said they can prove he is not guilty of
the charges against him if he goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a defeat,'' Gustavo Collao, a lawyer for Pinochet
told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ``Our next step, if a trial
actually takes place, is to prove the complete innocence of General
Pinochet.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers are likely to argue that he is not healthy
enough to direct them competently and therefore should not be
forced to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The general's lawyers have said that they will not allow their
client to undergo tests of mental fitness, a stance that could lead
to another legal battle that might further delay proceedings
against Pinochet. Under Chilean law, all criminal defendants over
70 must undergo an examination before trial. Mental illness can
prevent any trial from going forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who mounted the case against Pinochet said they were
happy with the court's decision, but uncertain as to whether
Pinochet would ever be punished.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest push to investigate and try Pinochet began after
the former dictator was detained in England in late 1998 on a
Spanish warrant that charged him with human rights crimes. He was
held there under house arrest during 16 months of legal wrangling.
Lawyers for Pinochet claimed immunity from prosecution because of
his position as a senator. Pinochet was released by the British
after doctors said he was neither physically or mentally fit to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   During the proceedings, no evidence ever linked the general
definitively to any single crime. But prosecutors are hoping that
his deteriorating legal status will encourage several retired
officers who are already imprisoned to testify that the former
dictator was aware of their crimes or helped cover them up.
</P>
<P>
   The case in Britain, which ultimately involved four countries,
brought about a fundamental change in international law that gives
universal jurisdiction to the prosecution of crimes considered
human rights atrocities, no matter where they were committed.

KASHMIR GROUP ENDS CEASE-FIRE AFTER INDIA REFUSES PAKISTAN ROLE IN
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The prospect of peace in Kashmir _ a flicker
of hope that had burned unsteadily for the past two weeks _
appeared to die out completely Tuesday when the militant group
Hizbul Mujahedeen called off its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This peace offensive has not been reciprocated by India, who
have demonstrated their traditional intransigence,'' said Syed
Salahuddin, the organization's chief, at a crowded news conference
in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   The group had insisted that Pakistan be allowed to join in any
talks, something India refused to allow, alleging that Islamabad is
guilty of sponsoring the ``cross-border terrorism'' that has made
Kashmir one of the world's most violent places since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul Mujahedeen, one of the main insurgent groups in the
Himalayan territory, declared its unilateral, three-month cease
fire in a surprise announcement on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   India was receptive to the peace initiative, but the move drew
immediate and harsh criticism from other militant groups whose
leaders said Hizbul was off on a fool's errand. To make sure that
errand failed, some of the guerrillas murdered more than 100
innocents _ many Hindu pilgrims _ during one bloody night last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hizbul field commanders and Indian officials
managed to hold a preliminary round of talks on Thursday in
Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar. They agreed to continue
negotiations on setting terms for the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   But all optimism was quickly moderated when the Hizbul made
another surprise announcement, this time an ultimatum: India had
until Tuesday to agree on including Pakistan in any talks or the
cease-fire was off.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India made several
conciliatory statements about open-ended conditions for talks, but
the inclusion of Pakistan was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul made good on its threat. ``As the deadline has expired,
we direct all the commanders with the mujahedeen in the field to
break the cease fire and go ahead with all target-oriented
missions,'' Salahuddin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hizbul chief sounded defiant, but there will now surely be
behind-the-scenes attempts to revive the peace process and, in
replying to a question, Salahuddin said that his group might review
its stance if India made necessary concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In its official reaction to Tuesday's events, the Indian
government spared Hizbul its wrath and placed all blame on
Pakistan: ``Pakistan's object has been to derail the peace process
by seeking to involve itself as a party in discussions between
India and the Hizbul Mujahedeen. The sabotage of the peace process
by Pakistan clearly shows its callous disregard for the welfare of
the people'' of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, a territory about the size of Utah with a population
whose majority is Muslim, is wedged between India, Pakistan and
China. Its ownership has been disputed between predominantly-Muslim
Pakistan and largely Hindu India since both gained independence in
1947. The two nations _ the world's newest nuclear powers _ have
fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, an insurgency broke out in the Kashmir's storied
valley. Pakistan has backed many of the militant groups that have
taken up arms _ some of whom favor an independent Kashmir, some of
whom prefer union with Pakistan. The Indian military has attempted
to crush the militancy, often using tactics condemned by human
rights groups. An estimated 25,000 to 40,000 people have died
during the decade of violence.

 &HT;    BOMB CONSIDERED A 'TERRORIST ACT' ROCKS DOWNTOWN MOSCOW; KILLS
7, WOUNDED 53
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A bomb tore through a street underpass packed with
rush-hour shoppers and commuters in downtown Moscow on Tuesday,
killing at least seven people and fueling fears that Chechen rebels
have again brought their war to the heart of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 wounded, including women and children, crawled and
staggered out of the passageways that run underneath two of
Moscow's busiest streets and between three subway lines at Pushkin
Square. Charred bodies lay crumpled on the street, as police and
ambulances rushed to the scene shortly after the 5 p.m. (Moscow
time) blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an enormous bang behind me and saw smoke streaming
from the entrance,'' said Irina Selimbaeva, 17, who was sitting
with friends on a park bench just 10 feet away from one entrance to
the underpass when the bomb went off. ``We were too surprised to be
scared, until we saw the wounded come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushaillo(CQ), the highest-ranking
government official to visit the bomb sight, was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as calling the blast ``a terrorist act.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediate suspicion fell on rebels fighting a second war against
Russia for independence in the southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's fatal incident comes almost one year after three
blasts destroyed multi-story apartment buildings in Moscow, killing
more than 300 people. Those explosions were blamed on Chechen
rebels, and led to a renewed military campaign in the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the crime is obvious _ the explosion hit in a
place packed with people at rush hour,'' Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov Tuesday denied
responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the regular Chechen forces nor the special services or
warlords have anything to do with the explosion at Pushkin
Square,'' Agence France Press quoted Maskhadov as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin called an emergency session of
his top law enforcement officials Tuesday night, and in a written
statement expressed his condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors treating the estimated 53 wounded warned the death toll
could rise above seven, as some people brought to the hospital were
in serious condition. Police were placed on heightened alert and
ordered to check the many underground passageways around Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities had earlier in the day called for heightened
security in all major cities, after the Interior Ministry reported
that authorities had confiscated a large amount of explosives in
other parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow city police said there was no warning ahead of the early
evening blast.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Emergency Situations Ministry said the bomb
probably came from a suitcase left in the underpass, which is
crowded with flower stalls, cosmetic stores and airline ticket
kiosks. The official said a detonation device had been found in the
corridor between two subway stations. He provided no details about
the size or type of the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue officials found and defused a second bomb found in the
underpass, Interfax reported. That report could not be immediately
confirmed with federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Pushkin Square, Moscow's equivalent to New York
City's Times Square, was sheer panic for the first two hours after
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was carried to an ambulance, her flesh severely
charred and blood gushing from her nose. A younger woman, her hair
matted with blood and shirt torn off, sat with her face in her
hands as passersby rushed over to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to find our way out. We couldn't see or breathe. We
covered our noses. I passed one other wounded and then another, and
another,'' said one black-haired middle-aged man, his hands shaking
and his glasses broken and askew on his smoke-stained face.
</P>
<P>
   But by 9 p.m. (Moscow time), crowds milling around the bomb
scene had tapered off. Businesses around the square, including a
movie theater and several restaurants, remained open. People sat in
outdoor cafes, drinking beer and discussing the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's scary that this has happened in the capital. We
don't want to think about who did it. The answer is too
frightening,'' said Lilia Alimbaeva, a curious onlooker who stopped
to view the aftermath on her way home from work.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of last year's explosions, Chechen rebel leaders
also denied responsibility. No one has been charged with any crime
for those blasts. Some analysts and Russian citizens believe that
Russian security services planted the bombs to give Vladimir Putin,
who had just been named prime minister and now is Russia's
president, as excuse to wage war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Chechen rebels have been dropping pamphlets
around Chechnya warning civilians to flee ahead of a planned new
offensive against Russian troops.

CONFEDERATE-TEXAS-HNS,2TAKES &HT;    CONFEDERATE MONUMENT DISPLAY IN CAPITOL DISPUTED
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A plaque on the ground floor of the Texas state
Capitol declares that the Civil War was neither a rebellion ``nor
was its cause to sustain slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   A giant portrait of Confederacy President Jefferson Davis is
perched at the right hand of the lieutenant governor as he wields
his gavel in the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient soldier, believed to be the last survivor, poses in
uniform next to the Confederate battle flag as he stares from a
painting in the office of the Texas House speaker pro tem.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning. An official inventory by the
state turned up a dozen items on display which make overt
references to the Confederacy. The list doesn't include countless
other Confederates portrayed in portraits wearing civilian clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Capitol grounds and the Capitol interior serve as a
virtual modern-day Confederate museum,'' Gary Bledsoe, president of
the Texas NAACP, said after a recent visit. ``... What is
mind-boggling is the obvious dominance of Confederate symbols
throughout the Capitol and its grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as presidential candidates debated the presence of the
Confederate battle flag atop South Carolina's statehouse earlier
this year, many a Confederate ghost inhabited the Texas Capitol
where Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush presides as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it is. It's part of our history,'' said
Rick Crawford, executive director of the State Preservation Board.
</P>
<P>
   The abundance and prominence of Capitol art commemorating the
Confederacy is partly the result of a faithful, $200 million
historical restoration begun in 1989 in which the Capitol was
returned to its turn-of-the-century elegance. By holding true to
pre-1915 photographs of the chambers, however, the preservationists
locked in the undoubtedly Confederate spirit of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made it clear that relics of all six governments that
have ruled Texas will remain in the Capitol complex. He responded
in June, however, to Bledsoe's plea to remove two Confederate
plaques from the Texas Supreme Court building. One displayed the
Confederate battle flag while the other bore the Confederate seal.
</P>
<P>
   The action dismayed descendants of Confederate soldiers who kept
up a daily vigil in the following weeks, braving the Texas summer
heat and decked out in Confederate regalia to wave the battle flag
in front of the court. The Confederate buffs let off plenty of
steam elsewhere, refusing to let the issue die.
</P>
<P>
   Demp Toney, an Austin actress and granddaughter of a Civil War
veteran, recently appeared before the General Services Commission,
waving her own small Confederate battle flag and not-so-subtly
implying that Bush is a carpetbagger. At the GOP convention in
Philadelphia, the Southern Heritage Coalition of North Carolina
flew a Confederate battle flag attached to a banner saying, ``Bush:
Put the Tx vets plaques back!'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The debate over appropriate display of Confederate symbols most
often centers on the battle flag itself, which has been adopted by
various hate groups, including neo-Nazi skinheads in Germany.
Gradually, however, questions of what might be deemed offensive
have grown.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   In May, for instance, a portrait of former Texas A&AMP;M University
President Gibb Gilchrist was removed from a building on the
school's campus. The removal followed a complaint that an image of
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was looking over Gilchrist's
shoulder and suggested racial intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any visitor to the state Capitol can view far more than a
single portrait-within-a-portrait of Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Just inside and right of the front gate of the Great Walk
leading to the south entrance stands the massive Confederate
Soldiers monument, erected in 1903 by surviving comrades. It speaks
of state's rights being trampled upon and is topped by a bronze
statue of Jefferson Davis above four other bronze figures,
representing the various branches of the Confederate Army.
</P>
<P>
   On the left of the walk nearer to the Capitol entrance, a
monument of a mounted soldier honors Confederate members of a
cavalry unit called Terry's Texas Rangers. Just east of the Capitol
stands the tallest monument on the grounds, erected in 1910 and
honoring the battles of John B. Hood's Texas Brigade, which is
topped by a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's office contains a portrait of former Texas
Gov. Lawrence ``Sul'' Ross in a Confederate uniform. Inside the
Senate chamber, Jefferson Davis is joined by a large portrait of
Albert Sidney Johnston, general of the western division, standing
in uniform next to the official ``stars and bars'' flag of the
Confederacy.
</P>

   On the House side are two identical portraits of Confederate war
hero Dick Dowling of Galveston. In the Capitol office of Rep. Tom
Uher, the speaker pro tem and Bay City Democrat, a portrait of
Walter Wade Williams, who claimed to be the oldest survivor of the
Confederacy, also depicts the Confederate battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   Uher, dean of the Texas House with 33 years seniority, requested
permission to hang the painting from the state collection,
according to the State Preservation Board. Uher's staff hands out
information sheets on Williams that say he lived to be 117 years
old.

   AUSTIN: 117 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the least conspicuous of Confederate reminders is also
among the most provocative. It is a small plaque located on the
ground floor in a tiny hallway between the elevators and the Senate
stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   Erected by the Texas Division of the Children of the Confederacy
in 1959, it contains the group's creed. In it, the organization
pledges to ``study and teach the truths of history (one of the most
important of which is, that the war between the states was not a
rebellion, nor was its underlying cause to sustain slavery)....''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the Capitol's Confederate
plaque does not raise the same issues as the other plaques that the
governor agreed should be removed from the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plaque represents the sentiments of this particular
group,'' she said. ``The Texas House passed a concurrent resolution
in 1959, allowing the erection of that plaque.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bledsoe said Texas lawmakers should consider using state
resources to provide more balance and accuracy in relaying the
history of the Confederacy at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we tell the story of the Confederacy without
mentioning the slaves, the declaration of causes or the ordinance
of secession?'' he asked. ``What we see displayed at our Capitol
and its grounds is revisionist history that suggests slavery was
not the focal point of this war, and which does this in a way as to
be an affront to the government of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas ordinance of secession, adopted in February 1861,
repeatedly complains of the Northern states wanting to stop slavery
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   It also describes the ``beneficent and patriarchal system of
African slavery'' and protests the ``debasing doctrine of the
equality of all men, irrespective of race or color _ a doctrine at
war with nature... ''
</P>
<P>
   It's now 139 years later, but reminders of bygone days of the
Old South still stir passionate emotions in both the descendants of
plantation owners and slaves.
</P>
<P>
   For the battle flag-waving protester Toney _ who says her
ancestors fought in the Civil War, Texas Revolution and American
Revolution _ tributes to the Confederacy elicit deep emotions of
pride and great sadness for the fallen soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up hearing stories about the Confederacy, the hardships
of the South. In my family is a cannon ball that one of them
brought back from the Civil War. It's kind of a sacred thing that
we love dearly,'' she said as she toured Confederate memorials at
the Capitol last week.
</P>
<P>
   Toney, who won't reveal her age, said she remembers being a
little girl and hearing her mother crying as she retold the stories
her own father, a Civil War veteran, had told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had nothing to come back to because immediately after the
war, the carpetbaggers from the North swarmed over the Mason-Dixon
line like vultures circling a deserted battlefield,'' Toney said.
</P>
<P>
   Toney said her mother lived on a sugar cane plantation, and the
family had owned slaves. She still has deeds of slave trades and
sales and believes the slaves were not abused but ``cared for.''
They were ``investments'' after all, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the Capitol's tributes to the Confederacy have
``incredible meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a shared history, as Karen Haller of Houston sees it.
She is a descendant of Nathan Haller, one of the last former slaves
to serve in the Texas Legislature during Reconstruction. Nearly 70
years would pass before African-Americans, including Barbara
Jordan, returned to the state Legislature. Haller said she, too,
knows some die-hard Confederates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hold that near and dear to their heart,'' Haller said.
``For people to say it wasn't about slavery _ what else was it
about?''
</P>
<P>
   As far as she is concerned, lessons of the Confederacy can be
better taught in history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should go _ all of it,'' she said of the
Confederate monuments, paintings and plaques at the Texas Capitol.
``Slavery is a part of history and so is lynching, but you don't
see a slave hanging in front of the Capitol. You don't today,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the dragging death of James Byrd Jr., a black man
in Jasper, as evidence that the dehumanization slavery represented
still exists today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's history. We still have our reminders and we
still have people who believe the same things as their ancestors
did. We perpetuate racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as old wounds heal slowly, new monuments might eventually
broaden the scope of how the Old South is depicted in the state
capital. Land has been set aside for a monument on the south lawn
commemorating Juneteenth, when Texas slaves learned belatedly they
had been liberated. And on April 13, 1999, the State Preservation
Board approved a site north of the Capitol for another monument to
honor black Texans, the result of legislation passed by Houston
Democrats Sen. Rodney Ellis and Rep. Garnet Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Svatora, a legislative aide to Ellis, said the Confederacy
is part of Texas history, and the senator does not wish to deny the
existence of one of the six governments that ruled Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to acknowledge that we had a rough past,'' he said.
``The history of Texas is tumultuous, but the diversity is a
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the history of African-Americans in Texas is
extraordinarily interesting and partly because it is so rarely
told.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just amazed. I don't know why people don't understand the
hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition has been the biggest excuse for you to make other
people uncomfortable and get away with it,'' he added. ``What's one
group's tradition is another's nightmare.''

WHERE   THEY PREFER MISFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By KEVIN GIORDANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the show ``Wanted: X-Cheerleaders,'' a squad of 10
real-life ex-cheerleaders rant and cheer about women's issues.
Their routines, which feature flying pompoms, kicks and jumps, are
at once authentic cheerleading drills and carefully choreographed
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece is somewhat theatrical in that we have a script and
an order, but it's not a narrative,'' said the choreographer Jody
Oberfelder, who, with the director Kim Irwin, created
``X-Cheerleaders.'' ``What we're doing defies category.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``X-Cheerleaders'' may not fall under the rubric of
contemporary dance, it is exactly the kind of movement-dominated
performance that is carving out a niche in the New York
International Fringe Festival, which will envelop the Lower East
Side for 12 days beginning on Wednesday. Now in its fourth year,
the festival (on the Web at fringenyc.com), will present at least
40 theater shows a day at 20 different venues. Of the 180 shows,
about 20 can legitimately be called contemporary dance or
performance art.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known fringe festival is the one at Edinburgh, founded
in 1947, which was created to give unconventional theater companies
a chance to present their work. Today there are fringe festivals
all over the world and in American cities like Seattle,
Philadelphia and Houston. John Clancy, the artistic director of the
Present Company, founded the New York festival in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festival succeeds in the creation of a common meeting
ground for artists, where artists can see each other's work and
collaboration can take place,'' said Clancy, who heads a 30-member
panel that selects applicants' work for the festival, contrary to
the usual fringe standard of first-come, first-served. ``What we
provide for the audience is challenging new work and convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the New York festival is predominantly a theater event,
dance companies like Ben Munisteri, Open 24 Hours/Pam Tanowitz, Neo
Labos and Claire Byrne have performed there in the past. This year,
FringeNYC will hold a symposium to discuss issues concerning
choreographers and dance companies. The panel will include David R.
White, director of Dance Theater Workshop; Laurie Uprichard,
executive director of Danspace Project; Steve Greco, a committee
member of New York Performance and Dance Awards (the Bessies); and
Gus Solomons Jr., a dancer and choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that first year, we made a commitment to dance, to
multimedia work, to the old term `performance art,''' said Clancy.
``What's great about the Fringe is that it's a flexible beast.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clancy, ``X-Cheerleaders,'' which had its premiere at P.S.
122 in 1994, is emblematic of what FringeNYC is all about. ``It's a
perfect example of the emerging style of performances that do not
fit comfortably into any category,'' he says. ``What do you call
that style? It's theater, but it's dance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``X-Cheerleaders,'' there will be a collection of
other dance-oriented performances. Tony Silva Dance and Music will
present ``Air Born''; Falling Plaster will show ``Full Frontal
Facts''; Caroline Jauch and Co. are offering ``The Handless
Maiden''; Artichoke Dance Company will perform ``Ho-Down
Showdown''; Stratton Gonzalez Dance Theater will offer ``A Place in
Line''; and Vickie Mendoza/vicdog 3d will show ``Three Worse
Flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Oberfelder, Fringe performances are yet another chance to
cheer on the blending of dance and theater. ``It's a funny thing
with Fringe,'' she says. ``It's sort of outsider art in a way.
Hopefully, what we do makes accessible the edgier kind of work that
packs a punch.''

 ART ADV:With two photos, of Larry Bird (NNS4) and Harry Rubenstein
(NNS5) 
 By DELIA M. RIOS  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the evening that Republican vice-presidential nominee Dick
Cheney spoke to his party's convention, just before delegates were
called to order, Larry Bird stood beside the Texas delegation, a
cell phone to his ear, patiently waving his arm in the direction of
the Pseudo.com skybox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a curator at the Smithsonian Institution,'' Bird repeated
to at least three Pseudo employees as they disbelievingly passed
the phone around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waving at you,'' Bird added hopefully, straining to be
seen amid the crowd on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo CEO David Bohrman was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think that the Smithsonian wants something that
you're using,'' he sheepishly admitted later.
</P>
<P>
   But, indeed, the Smithsonian did -- specifically, an Internet
camera valued at upwards of $20,000 that was transmitting
gavel-to-gavel convention coverage to the Pseudo.com site from a
Texas delegation perch.
</P>
<P>
   Bird and his colleague, Harry Rubenstein, wanted to add the
camera to the political collection at the National Museum of
American History, where it would join the microphones from FDR's
fireside chats, Thomas Jefferson's lap desk, and placards from the
1963 civil rights March on Washington. A day of negotiations later,
Pseudo and the camera's manufacturer, BeHere, happily announced at
a Republican Party-sanctioned press conference that they were
honored to make the donation.
</P>
<P>
   All in a day's work for Bird and Rubenstein -- better known as
Larry and Harry -- as they scavenged the convention floor with an
eye toward history. It's a hunt they'll take to Los Angeles next
week when the Democrats convene to nominate Al Gore for president,
searching for political memorabilia with inherent wit and appeal
but also the commonplace and the mundane. Brace yourself, but this
year their wish list includes a ``Convention Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential election is months off, but room is
already being made for its place in history. Long after President
Bush or President Gore leaves the White House, something of this
summer's conventions and our times will survive in the museum's
political collection -- already sizable at 90,000 objects, some of
them older than the presidency itself.
</P>
<P>
   Not that collecting comes easily -- even when posterity is
invoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what you really need until you see it,'' Bird
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is what they can't give away,'' Rubenstein added.
``We rely a lot on the Smithsonian reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the curators meet any number of conventioneers only
too willing to be a small part of history. Delegate Paula Maxwell
did her civic duty by handing over a cowboy hat with ``ARIZONA''
printed in block letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a hat; now it's making history,'' Maxwell said,
a touch of resignation in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   But as unfailingly polite and engaging as they are -- Bird
approached a West Virginia delegate by asking, ``Sir with the hat?
Can I talk to you?'' -- the curators' pitch can be a hard sell.
Delegates often don't want to give away their prized mementos, for
sentimental or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   A Delaware delegate they approached, for one, allowed as to how
her delegation had been offered $100 and even a bottle of Puerto
Rican rum for their black tri-corner hats. The hats evoked the
spirit of Caesar Rodney, revered in Delaware for riding by
horseback to Philadelphia -- although he was dying of cancer -- to
cast a critical vote for the Declaration of Independence as a
member of the Continental Congress. The curators eventually left
with a promise that a hat would be sent to them at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the tussle over the Texas standard.
</P>
<P>
   The curators persuaded the Texas delegation to give them the
red, white and blue rectangular sign imprinted with their state
name. Susan Weddington, the delegation chair, extracted an
assurance that any Texan could visit the standard, any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to commune with it in perpetuity,'' Bird
promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a deal,'' Weddington replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bird explained that the standard needed a protector. After the
nominee's speech, exuberant delegates leaving the floor tend to
consider anything they see a personal souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would like to have this,'' Bird told
Weddington.
</P>
<P>
   Prophetic words, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   The standard disappeared Thursday night after Bush addressed
delegates. The curators found it in the possession of determined
conventioneers. Not even the Smithsonian's name could dislodge it.
But by the following Monday, the Republican National Committee had
secured the standard and promised the curators it was on its way to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice touch to have the home state standard of the
nominee, and just the kind of thing that Americans might expect to
see in a museum exhibit. But it's the Internet camera discovered in
Philadelphia or the ``go'' light used to prompt speakers at the
1996 Republican convention in San Diego that tell a fuller story
about political life at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The ``go'' light will allow historians to illustrate how
scripted the conventions have become, while the Internet camera may
become a relic of a transforming technological moment -- something
like the primitive appearance of television in 1948 when both the
Republicans and Democrats met in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's so interesting to a historian,'' Bird said.
``What does it mean? We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are the intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   The curators wanted the Bush/Cheney signs the delegates
brandished because the letters of Cheney's name were smaller.
Typically, the names of the presidential and vice-presidential
nominees are printed in the same size to symbolize the new team.
``So,'' Bird speculated, ``there's something going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   They also were intrigued by blank poster boards left for
delegates to write their own political messages. All those
hand-painted signs delegates wave at television cameras are usually
mass-produced and designed to convey specific party themes.
Rubenstein interpreted the blank posters as a sign that Republican
officials were confident enough in the convention's unity to allow
renegade signs. Even those, he said, were ``pretty much on
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest voices were muted, and the curators took notice where
they did emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of red meat rhetoric, you get red meat items,'' Bird
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two cases in point: ``Life of the Party'' vests worn by abortion
opponents,and the political buttons popping up on delegates that
were, Rubenstein said, a lot less subtle than the official rhetoric
about restoring dignity to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The curators must be discerning in their search. What they bring
back to the museum is the raw material from which future historians
will work. Bird and Rubenstein, curators in the museum's Division
of Political History, are acutely aware of that responsibility --
they are drawing now, in fact, on the museum's extensive collection
for an exhibit opening Nov. 15 called ``The American Presidency: A
Glorious Burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird has attended conventions since 1984, and Rubenstein joined
him in 1988. Their travels this year extended to the Iowa caucuses
and the New Hampshire primary where they took inventory of
potential objects. When they arrive in California, among the
artifacts they'll be on the lookout for is that ``Convention
Barbie.'' Word had it that Republican delegates had them in
Philadelphia, but the curators never actually saw one.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll be attuned to the coded language Democrats use and
how that gets translated onto the signs television viewers see. In
Philadelphia, for example, signs blared the words ``honesty'' and
``integrity.'' With the choice of the widely respected Connecticut
Sen. Joseph Lieberman as Gore's running mate, Bird says similar
signs might show up on the floor in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian curators have gone to the conventions since the mid-
to late 1960s to expand on a private collection left to the
institution by Washington, D.C., attorney Ralph E. Becker --
described by Bird as a premier assemblage of campaign Americana.
Becker had attended Republican conventions since the 1940s, and
began seriously collecting memorabilia in the 1950s. The campaign
collection was folded into the broader political history
collection.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of television in the 1950s, delegates gave more
emphasis to putting on a good show. There certainly was evidence of
that in Philadelphia. Rubenstein, finding himself face-to-face with
a Colorado delegate wearing patriotic leather chaps and several
bottles' worth of glitter spelling out her state's name, asked,
``Just out of curiosity, why are you doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my state,'' she answered. Sure enough, she was on
television the night Bush accepted the convention's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The curators also have learned to work television. Nothing
inspires a delegate's generosity more than a news crew at his or
her side. It was an interview on Fox television that finally
convinced Bohrman, the Pseudo.com CEO, that the curators were
legit.
</P>
<P>
   Once that was settled, however, he invited Bird to the company's
skybox for an Internet interview. As Bird took questions from the
site's chat room, Rubenstein peered over a computer screen and
watched his colleague do the museum's work in real time.

<P>
   Lieberman! Of course! Why, it's the obvious choice for veep,
especially when you factor out all the charismatic fellows from
important states.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's praising the choice, but that's standard operating
procedure these days; if Al Gore had appeared at a news conference
with a monkey on his shoulder, and announced that Screechy the
Lemur would be his Veep, Dems would praise the choice, and
Republicans would let it be known how much they admire Screechy.
``I worked with him during the budget battles,'' former Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich said, ``and although we were adversaries, I
admired his diligence, command of the details, and ability to pick
nits out of my back hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah. Politics nowadays are one long answer to Rodney
King's plaint: Yes, it seems we can all get along. It makes you
long for someone to stop with the nice-talk, do a spit-take on CNN:
``Lieberman? Joe the Drone? Nice guy, but listening to him orate
isn't exactly like flossing with a Roman Candle. The man's a cross
between Alfred E. Newman on downers and Droopy with a mouthful of
Novacain. What was Al Gore thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Perhaps Gore feared that Dick Cheney would
monopolize the vexatious-prostate demographic. Perhaps Gore needed
moral cover -- and Lieberman is now portrayed as Gandhi from
Connecticut, with super-human ethical abilities that cancel out
Gore's evasions. New, concentrated Joe detergent -- gets out even
the toughest White-House Coffee stains!
</P>
<P>
   The real question, however, is what Sen. Lieberman was thinking.
He is, by all accounts, a sharp and decent fellow. Moral, upright,
ethical, all those old Scout virtues. And that's why it's sad to
watch him clamber in the sack with Gore. Let's remember two key
moments in the impeachment drama. Lieberman issued a stern, sad
denunciation of his old friend Bill. The president, said Lieberman
in his nerdy warble, ``had extramarital relations with an employee
half his age and did so in the workplace in the vicinity of the
Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate. It is
immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Now, let's recall Al Gore's speech on the White House
lawn, where he insisted President Clinton was the by-gosh bestest
president a fella could have, and he was proud to be his
boot-licking vassal. Or words to that effect. So one has to ask:
Why does Sen. Lieberman want to be Veep for an immoral creep's
apologist?
</P>
<P>
   Power, of course. Next stupid question?
</P>
<P>
   OK, what does he bring to the ticket? Well, as the first Jewish
Veep choice, he breaks a precedent. Much will be made of how much
is not being made of Lieberman's religion. It startles one to
realize that it's taken this long to name a Jew for this position.
At this rate, we can expect black presidents and female Veeps of
Arab or Hispanic extraction around the time we admit the Pluto
Colony to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   He also brings diversity of opinion, although it's hard to see
why this matters. Supposedly, Cheney was named to bolster George W.
Bush's lack of foreign policy expertise. If the Russians moved into
Ukraine, the Dems suggest, Bush would hide in the well of his desk;
Cheney would pry him out, slap him, and present the options.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is in a different position. On many issues he
holds positions contrary to Gore: Parental notification. Missile
defense. School vouchers. Letting municipalities sue gun makers.
Gore won't change his mind on any issue because Joe has another
opinion -- in fact, the reverse will happen. Surely Lieberman knows
that he's the one who'll be carrying Gore's water, drinking it, and
pronouncing it to taste like champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone look forward to hearing Lieberman explain why he's
now in favor of all the things he used to oppose? Have a nice ride,
Joe. Hope it's worth it.

   If you've been listening to political banter of late, you may
think the presidential campaign is taking place in a preschool,
what with all this chatter about ``grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Grown-up. It's the catchword lately among pundits and
journalists both inside and outside the Beltway. Just in the past
week alone:
</P>
<P>
   -- An editorial in The Wall Street Journal identified
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Democratic candidate Al Gore's
new running mate, as ``a political grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Ron Reagan Jr. chastised Republican candidate George W. Bush
in The Washington Post for having made a snide comment about an
executed inmate: ``No grown-up would ever do that.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A Boston Globe writer termed Bush's acceptance speech ``the
ultimate grown-up act.''
</P>
<P>
   -- David Gergen of U.S. News &AMP; World Report agreed on
``Nightline'' that during the speech, ``gone was the sense that
this is a fellow that's not quite grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   -- And MSNBC talking head Chris Matthews declared that Bush's
speech was ``a brilliant summation of the Republican strategy. ...
On the topic of Al Gore, don't even give him the credibility of a
grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   As with so much political talk, the term ``grown-up'' carries
different meanings, said Diana Carlin, professor of communication
studies at the University of Kansas-Lawrence and an expert on
political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a baby boomer myself, I know that in our own minds, a
lot of boomers still don't see themselves as now running things,''
Carlin said. ``We've been a generation that has not wanted to grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first presidential election with two baby boomer
candidates, Bush and Gore. When Bill Clinton ran against President
George Bush, and later Kansas Republican Sen. Bob Dole, those
contests were seen as the baby boomers vs. the World War II
generation.
</P>
<P>
   So what America is witnessing with this election is the final,
total generational power shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``And any time there is a shift, we really have to,
symbolically, through language, suggest that now is the time for
the next generation to take over,'' Carlin said.
</P>
<P>
   As in John F. Kennedy's now-famous inaugural phrase, ``The torch
has passed to a new generation of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at it with a negative spin, the term grown-up ``is a
veiled reference, obviously, to the Clinton problems'' with intern
Monica Lewinsky that took place in the Oval Office, Carlin said.
``Some would view that as not being very grown-up behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan was quoted last week in The Christian Science
Monitor as saying that Bush's wife, Laura, makes sure the candidate
``acts mostly like a grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is a professor of government specializing in
presidential politics at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I meant was that she was keeping his inner scamp under
control, his desire to show disrespect,'' Buchanan said. ``Bush has
a chip on his shoulder toward various icons, particularly Eastern
intellectuals, and Laura reins him in on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that in other cases, he thinks ``grown-up'' refers
to ``maturity. As John McCain said in one of his speeches, it
embodies the responsibility to interests larger than
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   And, specifically in Bush's case, sobriety and ``the possibility
of redemption,'' Buchanan added.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the term within the political arena goes back several
years, Buchanan said. After ``Newt Gingrich and company and all
their breathing fire and hurling spears, it was said that when
Gingrich left, the grown-ups came back to power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also agreed that the shadow of Clinton hides behind the
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``Self-control is an element of being a
grown-up as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Republican strategist Ken Duberstein last week told
Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service that Gore had to ``find a
grown-up in the Democratic Party'' for his vice-presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started using that term a few weeks ago,'' said Duberstein,
who served President Reagan as chief of staff. ``I was talking
about the fact that both Bush and Gore needed grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, ``the person had to be seasoned, experienced,
ready,'' Duberstein said. ``Not simply good for the ticket, but for
governing. Not an old-fashioned choice, someone who would deliver a
certain state, but someone to govern, to be an adult, someone who'd
been around the track.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what happened, Duberstein added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, in Dick Cheney, George W. got an adult. Cheney's a
former White House chief of staff, congressman, a Republican leader
in the House, the secretary of defense. A member of the governing
class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection of Cheney put pressure on Gore,'' Duberstein
continued. ``And with Lieberman, Gore eliminated some people who
would have been perceived as wet behind the ears, and he found
someone clearly mature and grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein sees a positive outcome to all this public talk of
grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's reassuring that even with all the complaints and
criticisms of the selection process for the president and vice
president, the system works,'' he said. ``We ended up with four
adults running.''

 ART ADV: With two photos, of Singer (NNS1) and Skawinski (NNS2) 
 By KEVIN COUGHLIN  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Coombs, professor emeritus at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, is a pretty bright guy. Yet he recently found himself
stymied by the opening screen of a popular computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't click the `I Accept' button for the licensing
agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs is blind.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories abound within the disabled community. This year
marks the 10th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act,
a measure that opened many buildings to those who have
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That landmark law, however, did not foresee the explosive rise
of the Web, which opens a world of possibilities for the
able-bodied -- and a maze of frustrations for those who cannot
easily view its snappy graphics, hear its colorful sounds or, as in
Coombs' case, manipulate a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   For them, technology can be a mixed blessing. Case in point:
Only last month did America Online, the world's largest Internet
service, agree to make its proprietary chat rooms and other
features accessible to screen-reading technologies used by the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   It took AOL 15 years and a lawsuit by the National Federation of
the Blind to come around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology advances. We get left behind,'' says Curtis Chong,
president of the federation's computer science chapter.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the last decade has brought many quality-of-life
advances for people with disabilities, from cochlear implants and
high-tech wheelchairs to hands-free computers controlled by the
blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet transforms commerce and communications for the
able-bodied, however, studies suggest this revolutionary technology
has not made a dent in unemployment rates for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent of working-age disabled persons in the United
States have full- or part-time jobs, according to a new Harris
survey. That figure has remained fairly constant over the last
decade, says the National Organization on Disability.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be a Catch-22 situation. Many people with
disabilities can't afford the high-tech equipment they need to hone
employment skills, says Doris Fleischer, New Jersey Institute of
Technology lecturer and co-author of an upcoming book, ``The
Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one-fourth of America's disabled population owns a
computer, Fleischer says, and only one-tenth uses the Internet. She
defines disability according to the Americans With Disabilities
Act: a condition affecting a basic life function. Government
rehabilitation programs can be stingy about providing computer gear
that might even the score.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Web has been a godsend. Yvonne Singer, whose
speech is hindered by cerebral palsy, pecks words and commands on a
keyboard with a pointer strapped to her forehead. She has edited
Web pages for a pharmaceutical company and posted poetry on her own
Web site while searching for full-time work and pursuing a master's
degree online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to say, and people have trouble understanding
me,'' says Singer, 31, of Matawan, N.J. ``On the Web, I don't have
that trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Web enables William Skawinski, a New Jersey
Institute of Technology professor who is blind, to download
scholarly articles onto his PC, where software converts the text to
speech. Years ago, he had to rely on others to read to him.
</P>
<P>
   Every new technology poses new barriers for the blind. ATMs once
had lots of buttons that blind users could feel; newer ``improved''
cash machines have touch-screens that require eyesight. Motorola's
wireless family phones initially sported an audio feature to
identify channels; a new version replaced this with a graphics
display.
</P>
<P>
   The PC arena has proven especially vexing for the blind, largely
because of Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system. As the
name implies, it is a visual environment, dependent on a
point-and-click ``graphical user interface.''
</P>
<P>
   Chong works closely with Microsoft, and says it's possible to
navigate Microsoft Word with keyboard commands instead of a mouse.
Intuit's QuickBooks, on the other hand, is useless to the blind, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has plenty of barriers, too.
</P>
<P>
   John Kemp, of halftheplanet.com, a Web site devoted to
disability issues, estimates 95 percent of sites are inaccessible
to 10 million visually impaired Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates vary widely. Whatever the number, many agree the
Web could be far friendlier to the disabled with minimal effort,
says Judy Brewer of the World Wide Web Consortium at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Web designers can embed descriptive tags in images and links,
enabling screen-reading software to audibly inform a blind person
what is depicted on a Web page. Audio files can be captioned for
those with hearing impairments. ``Text-only'' options, and bigger
buttons and icons, can be helpful, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of these things is legally required is another
story.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL settlement averted a trial that might have determined if
digital enterprises are subject to the Americans With Disabilities
Act. The 1990 law bans discrimination by most private employers,
all state and local government agencies, and such ``places of
public accommodation'' as museums, banks, restaurants and theaters.
The Clinton administration contends the act extends to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to bridge gaps in the ADA, Congress included a mandate
within the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for telecom services and
equipment to be accessible ``where readily achievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater promise comes with another pending measure that would
bar federal agencies from buying computers and information
technology or contracting for Web site designs that cannot be
adapted for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs, the Rochester professor, hopes the threat of lost
government contracts spurs technology companies to embed
accessibility features in all their new products. Many software
companies leave such details to third-party vendors, whose updates
often lag months behind a product's release, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs leads Equal Access to Software Information, an
organization supported by the National Science Foundation that
advises colleges on the accessibility of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kemp of halftheplanet.com, are counting on the
marketplace more than regulations. Born without hands or feet, Kemp
formerly led the United Cerebral Palsy Association and is a
presidential appointee to the National Council on Disability. He
says the disabled are the nation's biggest minority group, a vast
market that the Web ignores at its peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like the marketplace to say: What is it worth for us
to find new customers for our business?'' says Kemp.

`FLASHMAN AND THE TIGER': A HERO AMONG A THICK THICKET OF
CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good old Flashy, the high-living cowardly hero, the man for whom
that delicious Victorian word poltroon might have been invented.
Here he is in his latest installment, sprawled on the ground
outside a private club, dressed like ``an elderly down-at-heel of
the kind that slinks round the West End streets, picking up cigar
butts'' and pretending to be in a drunken stupor.
</P>
<P>
   Two policemen who have just apprehended a man that Flashman
wanted to murder see him there, and one of them starts to say that
he looks like somebody: ``You know, made such a hash of the
Khartoum business, with Gordon . . . yes, and years ago he won a
great name in Russia, and the Mutiny _ V.C. and knighthood _ it's
on the tip of my tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Harry Paget Flashman, for those who have not yet been
introduced to the historical novels of George MacDonald Fraser, is
the British soldier who manages to turn up at every major event of
the mid- to late 19th century, from the Crimean War and the Sepoy
Mutiny to Custer's last stand. Wherever he appears, he somehow
emerges with his reputation for valor intact even though he spends
most of his time trying to escape danger. In placing his main
character in such well-researched settings, Fraser actually teaches
us some history, history with flavor, history with sweep, history
as grand, morally dubious, sanguinary spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's new book, the 11th in the Flashman series, is
``Flashman and the Tiger,'' in which our hero stumbles, grumbles
and fornicates his way through three separate episodes. The longest
recounts Flashman's unwitting sabotaging of an assassination
attempt against Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary in 1883.
Another reveals Flashman's role in preserving the reputation of the
Prince of Wales (known as Beastly Bertie to the irreverent Flash)
in a card-cheating scandal in England in 1880. The third has to do
with a duel to the death between Flashman and a certain Tiger
Moran, who is blackmailing his granddaughter. The new volume is not
the best of the Flashman books, precisely because of the
minor-episode quality to them. Still, it is entertaining and
pedagogically valuable. Aficionados will not want to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know Blowitz, probably never heard of him even,'' is
Flashman's first line in the first of the stories, and therein lies
part of Fraser's genius. Blowitz is such an interesting eccentric
that one assumes he is entirely a fictional invention. He is the
corpulent, charming, manipulative, ambitious correspondent of The
London Times in Paris, and it is he who gets Flashman involved in
the plot to protect Franz Josef. But while Flashman is fictitious,
Blowitz is not, or at least not entirely. He really was The London
Times' man in Paris, and if you went to a good research library you
could read his memoirs (which is probably what Fraser did).
</P>
<P>
   That Blowitz was real gives ``Flashman and the Tiger'' the sense
that one gets from all of the Flashman books, namely that actual
history turns up a thicker thicket of human types than mere
imagination would be capable of producing. There is also a larger
historical lesson in Fraser's first episode, which has to do with
Hungarian nationalism under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the
interests of the conservative powers of Europe in preventing
Hungary from becoming independent. ``I understood it was the
biggest state in the empire bar Austria itself,'' Flashman says of
Hungary, ``and that the natives were an ornery lot, but fine
horsemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Spies of the German chancellor, Otto Bismarck, have learned that
just such an ornery lot, a Hungarian group known as the Holnup, is
plotting to assassinate the emperor, an event that would throw
Europe into turmoil. Flashman is dragooned into a scheme to prevent
an assassination from happening. The trick is that the emperor must
be protected but kept from knowing that he is being protected until
after he has been saved. That necessity provides the story's comic
potential, but, unlike most manipulations of history for dramatic
purposes, it also makes historical sense.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Flashman is the reluctant James Bond of the 19th
century, an adventurer in the service of the crown who provides
action and suspense but is not to be taken too seriously. Like
Bond, Flashman is very much a ladies' man, and he beds down with
more women than you can count, referring to all his partners in
language that might be authentic for that century but are
politically incorrect now.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Fraser makes few concessions to our current
sensibilities, and this may offend some readers. He talks about the
Zulu warriors who crushed a British Army in South Africa in 1879 in
terms that seem plainly racist by today's standards, even as he
shows his respect for their bravery and skill.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Flashman shows a vernacular contempt for just about
everybody. In his jaundiced view, the British aristocracy is that
``genteel rabble;'' his wife is ``featherbrained'' and he himself
is ``a true-blue coward who'd sooner shirk a fight than eat his
dinner, and has run from more battlefields than he can count.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a vision of the human condition here, of the paradox of
image and reality. Because of the fog of circumstance, Flashman
remains a hero, even as he confesses that he is really a coward.
Knowing him better than his admiring contemporaries do, we are in
on Fraser's little joke, which is that things are sometimes the
opposite of what they appear to be. We also understand that
Flashman is the kind of poltroon brave enough to admit when he is
scared.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in this new volume seems aware of that fabulous fact
other than us, Fraser's fortunate readers.

SRI LANKA EFFORT TO END CIVIL WAR VIA NEW CONSTITUTION IS SET
BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ President Chandrika Kumaratunga's
long-awaited peace plan for this war-torn nation _ embodied in a
new constitution that would have given greater autonomy to the
Hindu Tamil minority in this majority-Buddhist Sinhalese nation _
foundered Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga had planned to push the proposed constitution
through Parliament after only three days of debate, with a final
vote on Wednesday. But Tuesday, her government postponed voting
indefinitely, apparently bowing to the reality that it lacked the
necessary two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year term of this Parliament will end in a little more
than two weeks. And national elections must be held by early
November.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga, the Sinhalese leader who more than any other has
reached out to the Tamils, told Parliament last week that her
proposal would help end one of the world's most intractable
conflicts _ a civil war that has cost more than 60,000 lives on
this island nation of 18 million off the southern tip of India.
</P>
<P>
   It would convince the Tamils, she said, that the Sinhalese were
sincere about sharing power with them and that the Tamil people no
longer need support the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a group
of separatist rebels who have been fighting for a Tamil homeland in
the country's north and east for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   But her proposal, written and rewritten during the past six
years, was a compromise that ultimately failed to satisfy the
moderate Tamil politicians who risked their lives _ as did
Kumaratunga _ in the search for a political settlement, or to
mollify the Sinhalese right wing and the influential Buddhist
clergy who feared it was a threat to the majority population.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, despite months of negotiations with the opposition United
National Party _ the country's other major Sinhalese-dominated
party _ was Kumaqrtunga's Sri Lanka Freedom Party able to achieve a
bipartisan consensus for the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A frenetic effort by the government in recent days to collect
enough votes came up short. Kumaratunga last week proposed
increasing the number of members of Parliament in the upcoming
election to 298 from 225. Political analysts said the move was a
naked last-minute attempt to woo members of the opposition to
support the constitution with the promise they could run under her
party's banner.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders also accused ministers in Kumaratunga's
government of trying to bribe its members of Parliament to defect
with promises of cash, houses and utility vehicles _ accusations
the government denied.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the tactics, the government did not get enough
crossover votes from the opposition and also discovered that some
leading Tamil moderates it had counted on were planning to vote
against the constitution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, a protest against the proposed new constitution
by hundreds Sinhalese nationalists and Buddhist monks turned into a
victory celebration. A cheer rose from the throng of monks gathered
at the gates of Parliament when their priestly leaders announced
that the vote had been postponed. The men joyfully waved placards
that called anyone who supported the constitution a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposed constitution empowered the central
government to stomp out secessionist movements and reserved for
Buddhism ``the foremost place,'' the monks said they believed it
was a first step towards the country's division and a threat to
Sinhalese Buddhists, who make up 70 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is trying to divide the country and hand it over to Tamil
terrorists and stay in power all her life,'' said M. Ananda, a monk
who shielded himself from the blazing sun under a multi-colored
umbrella. ``That is her ulterior motive. We Sinhala Buddhists have
more than 2,000 years in this country. We have no other country. We
have to preserve it for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   While the monks accused the president of going too far to
appease the Tamils, Tamil political leaders said she had not gone
far enough towards creating a federal system of government with
adequate powers for the north and eastern region that Tamils regard
as their historic homelands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the proposed new constitution would give the
regions authority over health and education, but says such
authority must be exercised in line with national policy.
</P>
<P>
   It also deletes the description of Sri Lanka as ``a union of
regions.'' And it does not give the regions authority over publicly
owned lands _ an emotional issue for Tamils who say the central
government colonized Tamil areas by settling Sinhalese people on
government lands in past decades.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Tamil United Liberation Front, who had been
deeply involved in earlier efforts to shape the new constitution,
said Kumaratunga diluted it too much in her recent negotiations
with the opposition United National Party.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision not to support her was particularly poignant,
they said, since it was a member of Parliament from their party,
Neelan Tiruchelvam, who was the chief Tamil architect of the
earlier drafts _ and who was assassinated a year ago because of his
peace-making efforts. The Tamil Tiger rebels, who have killed off
many Tamil leaders who favor a political solution, are believed to
have sent the suicide bomber who killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed constitution had finally made it to Parliament last
week after the spilling of what Kumaratunga called ``a river of
blood.'' Not only was Tiruchelvam killed, but Kumaratunga lost the
sight in one eye in another Tiger suicide attack in December, which
also injured the main Sinhalese author of the new constitution, her
justice minister, G. L. Peiris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry for this lady,'' said V. Anandasangaree, senior
vice president of the Tamil party, referring to the president.
``She had moved heaven and earth to find a solution to the problem,
but the UNP took her for a ride and then dropped her like a hot
potato.''

 &HT;    Gore, running mate start on the stump in Nashville
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore showed off his new running mate Tuesday in Nashville,
Tenn., and declared that their Democratic ticket will ``tear down a
mighty wall of division'' by making Joseph Lieberman the first
Jewish vice president of the United States. Gore compared their
quest to the election of John Kennedy as the first - and only -
Roman Catholic president in 1960. He said the Democrats made
history then, and with Lieberman's nomination, will do it again.
Lieberman praised Gore for breaking a barrier by choosing him. He
said the vice president showed his faith in the tolerance,
diversity and ``basic fairness of the American people'' by choosing
him.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll taken Monday night after Joseph
Lieberman's selection by Al Gore shows that George W. Bush's lead
has almost disappeared among registered voters. Bush's lead was
reduced to 2 points, 45-43 percent, in the poll (4 percentage point
error margin) that included Lieberman on the Democratic ticket.
That's down from 19 points among registered voters in a similar
poll taken Friday and Saturday. Gallup senior editor David Moore
says polls of registered voters are not as accurate as those of
likely voters. Moore also noted that one-day polls are subject to
errors not found in polls taken over more than a day.
</P>
<P>
   A HOT TICKET FOR HILLARY, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, trying to court New York's crucial Jewish
electorate in her Senate race against Rick Lazio, said today she's
already asked Joseph Lieberman to campaign with her. Clinton said
she and Liberman talked by phone after he was selected as Al Gore's
running mate. ``Here in New York, it's going to drive up the vice
president's numbers which will be great for the ticket,'' she said.
``I hope he'll be here, but I can't be greedy because he's got a
lot of ground to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   GOTTA GO WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT A CHANCE
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers decided to overlook its dissatisfaction
with Al Gore's support for normal trade relations with China and
endorse the Democrat for president. The Detroit-based union, with
1.3 million active and retired members mostly in the key
battleground states in the Midwest, said its international
executive board was unanimous in endorsing Gore. Back in May, UAW
President Stephen Yokich said his union might back Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   BIGOTS WITH WEB CONNECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's selection of Joseph Lieberman as his vice presidential
running mate prompted a flood of anti-Semitic hate messages on the
Internet from people objecting to the fact that he is an Orthodox
Jew. The Anti-Defamation League, which monitors hate speech on the
Internet, said that offensive language and anti-Semitic slurs were
sprouting on message boards, discussion groups and e-mail lists.
The New York Times reported today that a chat room about the
Lieberman selection drew 14,000 postings _ half, at times,
attacking Lieberman's religion.
</P>
<P>
   SOME RELIEF WITH THE SETBACK
</P>
<P>
   For Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, there was disappointment.
For Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz, there was pain in seeing her spouse
passed over for a job he wanted. Yet for both of them, Al Gore's
decision to choose Joseph Lieberman instead of Kerry brought an
unexpectedly liberating end to a three-month running-mate selection
process. Kerry termed the waiting process an unsettling ``kind of
limbo.'' He did, however, acknowledge in an interview with the
Boston Globe that he had started writing notes for a possible
acceptance speech at next week's convention.
</P>
<P>
   SOME UPHEAVAL WITH THE EUPHORIA
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney knew her life would not be the same when a truck
toting a satellite dish and a camera suspended from a pole parked
in front of her home in a Dallas suburb soon before George W. Bush
chose her husband as his running mate. For the past few days she's
been riding a vintage train with more than 100 journalists, a slew
of Secret Service agents, dozens of 20-something campaign workers
and a mobile satellite dish for film crews. She plans to campaign
full-time with husband Dick when he separates from Bush on the
campaign trail starting today. The Cheneys will focus on the
nation's conservative voters, while Bush courts independents with
John McCain at his side.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU WANNA BE A TOP BANANA . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the three days before the Democratic convention, President
Clinton and Hillary Clinton will be dominating Los Angeles with a
whirl of celebrity-packed fund-raisers and appearances. Even though
Clinton agreed to leave the city after addressing delegates on
Monday, the convention's opening night, the Washington Post reports
that some members of Al Gore's team, chronically anxious about
whether the president is overshadowing their man, are irritated by
Clinton's ability to command the spotlight and soak up Hollywood
money.
</P>
<P>
   FRACTURED PARTY COULD USE SOME REFORM
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party activists gathered in Long Beach, Calif., for a
national convention and a showdown over the party's future, its
presidential nomination, and the $12.5 million taxpayer dollars
that come with it. The process of deciding who gets the money began
behind closed doors _ and in a dispute in the lobby outside _ as
supporters of Pat Buchanan and party founder Ross Perot fought to
seat a committee that will take up still more disputes, among them
whether Buchanan followed the rules in the party's primary or
should be disqualified from receiving the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S CLEANING UP _ IN SEVERAL WAYS
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is launching a $3.7 million ad
campaign critical of Al Gore's handling of the environment on his
own property to air in 17 battleground states starting today and
running through the week. The ad says George W. Bush offers a
positive issue agenda while Gore is spending his time on the
attack. ``George Bush is cleaning up Texas,'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   SO, CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is flourishing in the polls, but a majority of
Americans in two new surveys don't consider him to be ``a different
kind of Republican'' as claimed by his campaign. A CBS News poll
said 35 percent consider Bush a different Republican, while 52
percent said he is ``a typical Republican.'' An ABC News-Washington
Post poll had similar results on that question, with 35 percent
saying he was different and 56 percent saying he's the same as
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON REPRISING PART IN SEQUEL
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Cheney campaign is calling on Tennessee Sen. Fred
Thompson _ Watergate lawyer-turned movie star-turned political star
_ to reprise his most recent, successful role as Republican
spinmaster. Thompson spent last week expounding on Republican
positions in a series of network interviews during the GOP
convention. This time he's been asked to be at the Democratic
convention, in his old stomping grounds, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   THOSE OTHER FIVE STATES COULD BE CRITICAL
</P>
<P>
   Green Party candidate Ralph Nader has submitted enough
signatures to appear on 34 state ballots and hopes to be on in as
many as 45 states this fall, said campaign manager Theresa Amato.
In addition, the campaign has filed lawsuits challenging tough
ballot access laws in North Carolina, Illinois, South Dakota and
Oklahoma. The campaign also began airing a slick new TV ad, ripping
the two major party candidates and demanding that Nader be included
in the fall debates.
</P>
<P>
   DOES THE `P' STAND FOR PRISON?
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush, the son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and and nephew
of George W., was, according to WSVN-TV of Miami/Fort Lauderdale,
``the subject of a 1994 Miami-Dade Police report for burglary and
criminal mischief.'' Said WSVN: ``The police report contains
allegations that George P. broke into the Killian-area home of his
ex-girlfriend. It also accuses him of driving his Ford Explorer
through two front lawns, doing an estimated $300 in property
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   $100,000? CONVENTION PETTY CASH!
</P>
<P>
   The man accused of being the ringleader of the illegal street
protests during the GOP convention had his bail reduced from $1
million to $100,000 as defendants contended that the Philadelphia
police were guilty of jailhouse brutality and city officials
maintained there was a criminal conspiracy to shut down the city.
The reputed ringleader is John Sellers, 33, leader of the Ruckus
Society of Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   RINGLING BROS. SHOULD CHECK THEM OUT
</P>
<P>
   Two women scaled the 15-story downtown Figueroa Hotel in Los
Angeles and tried to unfurl a giant banner across from the Staples
Center denouncing corporate dominance at the Democratic convention.
Within an hour, the banner was cut down by police, and the two
climbers and two others were arrested. The banner, modeled after
the U.S. flag with corporate logos in place of stars, got snagged
on one side and was never fully unfurled.

 &HT;    BOMB CONSIDERED A 'TERRORIST ACT' ROCKS DOWNTOWN MOSCOW; KILLS
7, WOUNDED 53
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A bomb tore through a street underpass packed with
rush-hour shoppers and commuters in downtown Moscow on Tuesday,
killing at least seven people and fueling fears that Chechen rebels
have again brought their war to the heart of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 wounded, including women and children, crawled and
staggered out of the passageways that run underneath two of
Moscow's busiest streets and between three subway lines at Pushkin
Square. Charred bodies lay crumpled on the street, as police and
ambulances rushed to the scene shortly after the 5 p.m. (Moscow
time) blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an enormous bang behind me and saw smoke streaming
from the entrance,'' said Irina Selimbaeva, 17, who was sitting
with friends on a park bench just 10 feet away from one entrance to
the underpass when the bomb went off. ``We were too surprised to be
scared, until we saw the wounded come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushaillo(CQ), the highest-ranking
government official to visit the bomb sight, was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as calling the blast ``a terrorist act.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediate suspicion fell on rebels fighting a second war against
Russia for independence in the southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's fatal incident comes almost one year after three
blasts destroyed multi-story apartment buildings in Moscow, killing
more than 300 people. Those explosions were blamed on Chechen
rebels, and led to a renewed military campaign in the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the crime is obvious _ the explosion hit in a
place packed with people at rush hour,'' Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov Tuesday denied
responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the regular Chechen forces nor the special services or
warlords have anything to do with the explosion at Pushkin
Square,'' Agence France Press quoted Maskhadov as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin called an emergency session of
his top law enforcement officials Tuesday night, and in a written
statement expressed his condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors treating the estimated 53 wounded warned the death toll
could rise above seven, as some people brought to the hospital were
in serious condition. Police were placed on heightened alert and
ordered to check the many underground passageways around Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities had earlier in the day called for heightened
security in all major cities, after the Interior Ministry reported
that authorities had confiscated a large amount of explosives in
other parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow city police said there was no warning ahead of the early
evening blast.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Emergency Situations Ministry said the bomb
probably came from a suitcase left in the underpass, which is
crowded with flower stalls, cosmetic stores and airline ticket
kiosks. The official said a detonation device had been found in the
corridor between two subway stations. He provided no details about
the size or type of the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue officials found and defused a second bomb found in the
underpass, Interfax reported. That report could not be immediately
confirmed with federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Pushkin Square, Moscow's equivalent to New York
City's Times Square, was sheer panic for the first two hours after
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was carried to an ambulance, her flesh severely
charred and blood gushing from her nose. A younger woman, her hair
matted with blood and shirt torn off, sat with her face in her
hands as passersby rushed over to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to find our way out. We couldn't see or breathe. We
covered our noses. I passed one other wounded and then another, and
another,'' said one black-haired middle-aged man, his hands shaking
and his glasses broken and askew on his smoke-stained face.
</P>
<P>
   But by 9 p.m. (Moscow time), crowds milling around the bomb
scene had tapered off. Businesses around the square, including a
movie theater and several restaurants, remained open. People sat in
outdoor cafes, drinking beer and discussing the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's scary that this has happened in the capital. We
don't want to think about who did it. The answer is too
frightening,'' said Lilia Alimbaeva, a curious onlooker who stopped
to view the aftermath on her way home from work.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of last year's explosions, Chechen rebel leaders
also denied responsibility. No one has been charged with any crime
for those blasts. Some analysts and Russian citizens believe that
Russian security services planted the bombs to give Vladimir Putin,
who had just been named prime minister and now is Russia's
president, as excuse to wage war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Chechen rebels have been dropping pamphlets
around Chechnya warning civilians to flee ahead of a planned new
offensive against Russian troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Corporations beware: if you were born before 1865,
Deadria C. Farmer-Paellmann is looking for slaves in your archives
and may have bad news for you.
</P>
<P>
   The sleuthing started in 1992 when, as artistic director of the
protest (a 26-hour ``drum vigil'') that halted excavation of a
17th-century African burial ground near City Hall, Farmer-Paellmann
got insider privileges to crunch a hard hat over her dreadlocks and
crash the site. There she stumbled on a scene that changed _ and
channeled _ her life's work.
</P>
<P>
   On property the government planned to convert to a parking lot
were the skeletons of some of her ancestors, the 20,000 slaves who
helped build the city where she grew up poor on public assistance
but now lives comfortably _ no apologies _ in a Second Avenue
duplex with doormen at her beck and call. After all, she's nine
months' pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the past and the deceased slaves for whom
Farmer-Paellmann, 34, is a legal advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeletons were intact, many skulls bore tribal markings,
and the way she remembers it, all wore the same expression: ``They
looked like they were screaming.'' Her shock subsided only slightly
when assured by an archaeologist that decomposition caused the
grimaces.
</P>
<P>
   But first impressions don't lie, and she tends to trust hers.
That's how she wound up married to a white German who works in
corporate finance. For someone whose Afro-centric commitment
extends to her hairdo _ dreadlocks since 1990 _ that might count as
three strikes against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned there might be a perception I didn't think
black guys were good enough, but what was I supposed to do, pass
him up because he wasn't black?'' she explains. ``I looked beyond
race,'' she adds, sounding defensive. ``Plus, he treats me like a
queen.'' Plus, he supports the mission she adopted after seeing the
skeletons: pressing the case of the dead slaves of America versus
the corporations that turned a profit exploiting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lived, worked and died in this city, and they never got
their reparations _ it moved me,'' says Farmer-Paellmann, whose
search for ``tainted corporations'' in the Northeast has turned up
a dozen offenders. First, she wants the companies to apologize.
Second, using a tactic that echoes the German Parliament's
endorsement of a corporate-financed reparation fund for World War
II slave laborers, she wants part of their profits assigned to a
trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   If she's a little fuzzy on how this fund will be dispersed, not
to worry: so far, no one has contributed. It's been rough just
extracting apologies. But thanks to a pending alliance with two law
firms, she anticipates that her targets will soon pay her more
attention. And pay up.
</P>
<P>
   In February, in conjunction with Black History Month,
Farmer-Paellmann, a 1999 graduate of the New England School of Law,
began her offensive: she castigated Aetna, the insurance giant, for
having written policies on slaves with the owners as beneficiaries.
She also charged that the FleetBoston Financial Corp. had ties to
slavery, including loans to John Brown, the Rhode Island slave
trader whose family helped to found Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna apologized publicly in March, and The Hartford Courant,
confessing to slave advertisements in its classifieds, did the same
last month. She says that Fleet declined to deal with her.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing spurt of coverage, a Canadian newspaper called
her ``a moral extortionist.'' Is she?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one calls the Jewish Holocaust survivors and their
descendants moral extortionists,'' she fumes. ``I know this is
justice. People say we waited too long, but these guys were on it a
hundred years ago, the ex-slaves themselves,'' she asserts, waving
a copy of a reparations bill the Senate vetoed in 1898. ``The
government crushed it. It's tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   When her grandfather's grandparents, Clara and Able Hinds, ran
away from the rice plantation on St. Helena Island, S.C., where
they were enslaved, they did not live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   When Farmer-Paellmann moved with her mother and five sisters
from East New York, where the Black Panthers ran the summer lunch
program for kids but gangs ran the streets, across Brooklyn to
Bensonhurst in 1973, they didn't live too happily either. And not
just because (with a semi-deadbeat dad in the picture) they relied
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 7 years old and I found out that that black people were
still called nigger,''says Farmer-Paellmann, who also discovered
hers was the only black family on the block. ``The day the
neighborhood kids got back from summer camp, they saw us in the
window, threw a can at us and called us niggers, and I thought,
`Whoa.' Probably not a day went by when I didn't hear it. It seemed
like every time the window was repaired, something would get thrown
through it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Farmer-Paellmann escaped into music via a piano, a
gift from her grandmother. But she hankered, inexplicably, to be a
lawyer: ``My father used to say, `You have an excuse for
everything' and I'd say, `Dad, there's a reason for everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   Except slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long are we going to stay asleep on this?''
Farmer-Paellmann asks. ``I don't mind starting this alone: I'm the
wake-up call.''

REALITY ON YELLOW BRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Warner LeRoy is the owner of Maxwell's Plum, Tavern on the Green
and the Russian Tea Room, all in New York, and the developer of
Great Adventure  in  Jackson, N.J.; this was written with Patricia
R. Olsen)  
 By WARNER LEROY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ My grandfather was Harry Warner, one of the pioneers
of the film industry. My father was Mervyn LeRoy, who produced and
directed more than 95 movies, including ``The Wizard of Oz.'' I
grew up on the back lot of the Warner Brothers studio.
</P>
<P>
   I was on all the movie sets. One day, when everyone took a lunch
break during the filming of the yellow brick road scene with the
Munchkins, I was skipping down the yellow brick road. All of a
sudden I hit the wall. I didn't realize that the road was only 12
feet long and the rest was a painted background. I was only 4, but
it was my first moment where fantasy and reality came together.
</P>
<P>
   We had a screening room in the house _ all our friends did _
with a popcorn machine and a cotton-candy machine. Paintings in my
dad's fine art collection lined the walls, and the movie projectors
were behind one wall. He'd push a button and the bottom of a
Picasso painting would lift up to allow a movie to be projected. My
Uncle Jack had the best screening room. His screen rose from the
floor. A kid could climb on top of it and rise to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   I also spent time on the Warner ranch, 2,000 acres in the San
Fernando Valley. My grandfather lived on 100 acres; the rest was
devoted to movie sets, with permanent fixtures of 45 cities from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   My parents divorced when I was 7. Both their houses were always
filled with movie stars. It was nothing to come home and see Frank
Sinatra and Judy Garland singing at our piano. I didn't know there
was anything special about this. I was going to Europe by myself
when I was 11, and at 12 I visited a Paris nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   In my teens, I went to private school in Switzerland. The
beginning was a disaster because I knew no French. My classmates
were the shah of Iran, the king of Belgium and some of the
Rothschilds. My roommate was Karim, now the Aga Khan. I spent many
weekends with his family at their palazzo in Cannes. In French,
``le roi'' means ``the king,'' so whenever I'd walk down the
hallway with Karim the servants would bow to me. They didn't know.
Sometimes we'd fly to Ireland, where the family had a major racing
stable.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, I was student head of the drama department. After I
came East, I first worked with Garson Kanin. Off-Broadway didn't
exist; I was one of the founders. I opened a theater at 64th and
First and directed or produced plays by writers like Tennessee
Williams and Maxwell Anderson. When a coffee shop on the corner
went out of business, I decided to turn it into an open sidewalk
cafe like the ones in Paris. I spent 15 years working on
regulations with the city for sidewalk cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's was the first New York restaurant that had an American
theme, with a massive, glass-enclosed sidewalk cafe. Back in 1966,
it was called a ``singles place,'' where women felt comfortable
coming alone. The line that spread around the block _ it reached
six people across at times _ became part of the street life. A
person could meet someone in line.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, when I wanted to build Tavern on the Green, New York
was in trouble financially. I finally obtained the license at
midnight on New Year's Eve, the last day of John Lindsay's tenure.
Now it's the highest-grossing restaurant in America.
</P>
<P>
   I developed Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., and five other
parks. I also rebuilt the Russian Tea Room; it took more than four
years to talk the former owner into selling it.

   SMOKE-JUMPERS _ Smoke jumpers are tech-age consultants. Like
their namesake firefighters who parachute into a blaze, these
fix-it specialists spend 3 to 6 months repairing the business end
of high-tech startups neglected by young entrepreneurs who are
really good at designing web sites, but forget to hire bookkeepers.

   WEBMD _ WebMD scrambled this week to counteract what it said was
an unfair and inaccurate report that alleged that Jim Clark had not
followed through on his promise to buy $200 million in WebMD
shares. The report noted that WebMD stock had soared following
Clark's promise _ only to come slowly crashing back to earth since,
while Clark has bought a relative pittance. The company claims
Clark was constrained from buying by Securities law. The columnist
in the New York Times wrote that was not the way the SEC interprets
the rules in question. (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

   DSL _ The process of extending high-speed Internet access over
phone lines in Texas and elsewhere has stressed Southwestern Bell
and its affiliate companies. One prominent Austin Internet service
provider, Jump.Net Inc., is so fed up with delays and miscues by
SBC that it has stopped taking new orders for DSL service delivered

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vasari's life of Michelangelo reports that the artist believed
the male body was ``something divine,'' an idea so powerful that
over 200 years it was thought appropriate to make nude monuments to
Napoleon and Beethoven. For several centuries, artists regarded the
male rather than the female nude as the noblest subject they could
treat. In the 19th century, when the naked female triumphed
decisively over the naked male in art, it turned out to be a
pyrrhic victory, with women not so much ennobled as reduced to sex
objects.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term superiority of the male nude in western art
depended on classical Greece, where a homosexual preference was
openly expressed in vase painting and in literature. Later, though
the sexual nature of the female nude was always evident, the
homoerotic element of male nudity was seldom explicit or even
acknowledged, though it could be implied or inferred. Greece was
the source to which artists looked for justification, for
compositional types, sometimes for subjects. Greek mythical or
historical subjects automatically conferred a certain dignity on
artistic enterprises and were the best excuse for male nudity since
Adam.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this held true even for photography. The first
photographer to make male nudes popular subjects for both
homosexuals and heterosexuals was Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden
(1856-1931), an East Prussian aristocrat who worked in Sicily,
primarily from 1890 to 1914. Forty-one of his images, most of them
of young Italian boys got up like ancient Greeks, are currently on
view at Throckmorton Fine Art in midtown Manhattan (through Sept.
9).
</P>
<P>
   The baron, after he was found to have a lung disorder (probably
tuberculosis), moved to Taormina in 1878 for his health. Evidently
he left Germany for other reasons, too, being unable to fulfill his
sexual fantasies or desires in his native land. He took up
photography as a hobby, encouraged by Wilhelm von Pluschow, a
distant relative who lived in Naples and also specialized in
pictures of young nude men. Germany in the 1880s was still
prosecuting men for nude sunbathing, but in Sicily, male children
ordinarily went nude on the beach, and most Mediterranean countries
tacitly accepted homosexuality as a passing phase in a boy's
development.
</P>
<P>
   Von Gloeden's pictures are fascinating as much for what they
reveal about the late 19th century, the history of sexuality, and
photography itself as they are for their sometimes beauty and
campiness. He created an arcadian past embodied by the local boys
dressed up in togas or loincloths or simply their bare skins, with
garlands in their hair or laced-up sandals on their feet, carrying
Pan pipes or stringed instruments, gazing off at Mount Etna, posing
next to amphorae, holding palm leaves, toying with grape clusters.
Von Gloeden was an innovator, taking the nude body out of the
studio, where it had resided in the 19th century, and photographing
it in his private garden or some secluded outdoor spot .
</P>
<P>
   He created a theatrical idyll, a classical age that had never
existed outside the imagination of those who wished it had. This
faux-Greek paradise was a place of pastoral grace, eternal youth
and budding masculinity. It was the photographer's fantasy come
almost true, enacted by contemporary peasants who must have taken
time off from their outdoor labor to play roles in this romance.
Von Gloeden paid them for their time before his lens, and their
expressions indicate that they trusted him and enjoyed the game.
</P>
<P>
   Both the past and the pastoral were von Gloeden's inventions.
His props were a mix of different periods and his models altogether
unlike the delicate ephebes wooed by athletes in Greek vase
painting. One or two of the Sicilian boys have stocky bodies that
would not have fit the Greek ideal. Some were even North African,
with dark skins. The ancient Greeks, to whom the word barbaric
meant ``not Greek'' (it later meant ``not Roman,'' and later still
``not Christian''), presumably would not have found them so
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, child labor was common in Taormina, and several of the
boys, despite the photographer's attempts to cover up the effects
of weather and work, have sunburned faces, necks and hands acquired
through laboring outdoors in a good deal more clothing than they
wore for him. (Taormina was poverty-stricken and threadbare when
von Gloeden arrived. He contributed to its improvement, and by the
late century, it was a thriving tourist spot.)
</P>
<P>
   The glory and peculiarity of these pictures is the exacting
degree of realism the camera cannot help bestowing. If a boy's ribs
show or a shoulder is bony or a bit of fuzz is beginning to grow on
his upper lip, photography adds that information to Arcadia. It
does not hesitate to point out that none of the models have been
circumcised, or that some, though barely into adolescence, have
sprouted pubic hair. A dying boy dramatically sprawled on his back
on a large rock, in a pose roughly derived from Hellenistic
sculpture (but upon whose groin a large bunch of leaves has
decorously fallen), is indisputably a real boy who is just as
indisputably not dying.
</P>
<P>
   As Roland Barthes once wrote, ``The Baron's photographs are at
the same time sublime and anatomical.''
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, von Gloeden's pictures were popular
with a wide and educated audience. Well, some were. Others were
popular with a more restricted and educated audience of
homosexuals. His work was shown in international exhibitions and
published in art journals, which doubtless preferred the more
discreet images, for von Gloeden's project spoke to the hopes of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   The late 19 century experienced a gathering sense of unease in
the face of all the changes brought on by the Industrial
Revolution, changes that threatened established ways of life. The
dream of a long-gone golden age when life was simpler, calmer and
more innocent _ that dream that seems to recur whenever
``progress'' looms and anxiety creeps up on material well being _
had seized the popular imagination. Taormina, von Gloeden and his
photographs seemed to incarnate the dream. His studio was a drawing
card for tourists; his guest book included the signatures of Oscar
Wilde, Eleonora Duse, J.P. Morgan and King Edward VII.
</P>
<P>
   Of these guests, perhaps only Wilde correctly translated the
erotic messages underlying the classical gloss on these
photographs. In the century that Michel Foucault said had
``invented'' homosexuality, the coded signs that initiates could
recognize were subtly embroidered upon.
</P>
<P>
   But today, von Gloeden's photographs do not seem subtle in the
least. Nineteenth-century ideas about sexuality were sometimes
primitive and hazy, but 19-century powers of self-deception were
highly developed. So was the ability to devise elegant stratagems
to legitimize sexual display.
</P>
<P>
   Classicism covered a multitude of sins while uncovering the
body, and it made a habit of doing so throughout the century. In
1863, for example, Alexandre Cabanel painted ``The Birth of Venus''
as a straightforwardly lascivious image of a juicy-fleshed young
woman lying on her back on the sea, from which Venus usually rises.
Had it hung above a bar, no one would have noticed the painter's
artistry, but Cabanel had a high reputation in the academy, and so
did his classical subject. Like Cabanel's Venus, von Gloeden's
naked peasants fiddling with Pan pipes fulfilled three wishes: for
art, for classical tranquillity and for permissible glimpses of
desirable bodies.
</P>
<P>
   They did even more for homosexuals, who could also buy his more
starkly naked postcards, which could not be mailed to friends.
Around the turn of the century, as homosexual culture gathered
force, a few periodicals were established to cater to gay men's
tastes; these, too, reproduced some of von Gloeden's photographs.

UNDATED: Gloeden's photographs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Von Gloeden was an artful dodger whose work circumvented the
appointed censors. Not only his hybrid classicism but also his
artistic bona fides made admirable what would otherwise have been
illicit. He borrowed from many masters other than the Greek and had
a large following himself.
</P>
<P>
   As most male nude photographs up to his time had been
``Academies'' _ studio studies of mature individuals that were
intended for artists and that made no effort at naturalness _ von
Gloeden's work was a kind of treasure trove for artists. In his own

Alma Tademas and Maxfield Parish, and after his death on Cecil
Beaton, Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Bruce Weber.

   Not bad for a man who might have well been arrested for child
pornography in our supposedly more tolerant and certainly less
willfully innocent culture. Von Gloeden was interested only in
young boys and early adolescents (except in genre pictures of the
local population). He photographed some of the same models for
years but usually stopped doing so as they reached early manhood. A
couple of young children who cannot be much more than 5 or 6 also
turn up in his photographs.
</P>
<P>
   By the turn of the century, Freud had recognized the sexual
nature of children, but good citizens would have considered that
kind of wisdom mere folly. Under the guise of erudite classicism,
the public opted for ignorance, bliss and the promise of eternal
youth and all-male company in the shadow of Mount Etna.

 &HT;    Showboating takes over The Show
 &HT;    By Dave Andrews
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marlins closer Antonio Alfonseca launched into his usual
post-save routine. He screamed, pounded his chest and pointed
toward the heavens. Then he glared into the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the whole episode, which took place July25 in
Atlanta, was that Alfonseca didn't register a save. Instead he
struck out Steve Sisco, a .111 hitter, in the eighth inning with
the Marlins losing 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in our dugout got (ticked) off after he did his
little jig,'' Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``He stared
into our dugout with his team losing by two runs. That's showing a
guy up. I mean, who can't pitch when his team's behind?''
</P>
<P>
   From Alfonseca's ``jig'' to Houston pitcher Jose Lima's
contortions to San Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds' penchant for
not leaving the batter's box until his homers clear the wall,
players and managers say there has been a decline in traditional
baseball etiquette this season.
</P>
<P>
   Refer to it however you want: showing up a player, showboating
or showing off. By any name, players and managers say it has gotten
so bad that even players who are losing, such as Alfonseca, will
strut their stuff like they just won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showing off is bad for baseball,'' Marlins manager John Boles
said. ``It's running rampant. Baseball's etiquette throughout the
years has changed. There was no fanfare back then. You didn't even
shake hands until a guy got back to the dugout (after hitting a
home run).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have guys ripping imaginary chain saws across their
necks after hitting a homer or you see guys doing the electric
slide after a strikeout. They get to see themselves on
`SportsCenter' doing it 70 times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins broadcaster and former major-league player Tommy Hutton
said he has seen a boom in players showing each other up, but
today's players aren't the first to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid- to late '70s it really took off, but there's a lot
more of it now,'' Hutton said. ``Back then you had guys like Reggie
Jackson doing his curtain calls (after hitting a home run). Guys
like Mickey Rivers, Tito Fuentes and Willie Montanez had flair and
were considered hot-dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Today opposing pitchers expertly show up hitters and vice versa.
Players are quick to criticize other teams for demonstrative
actions on the field, but what do fellow Marlins think about
Alfonseca's exuberance after a strikeout?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to tell him to chill out because he's part of
this family here,'' Marlins outfielder Cliff Floyd said. ``But I
think he's showing up a hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonseca, the league leader in saves with 33, said he has heard
the criticism of his antics on the mound, especially from Jones and
Mets pitcher John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about Atlanta or Chipper Jones,'' Alfonseca said.
``I don't care about John Franco. John Franco does his job and I do
my job. And I have a championship ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Championship rings equal clout. So does winning 20 games and
hitting 40 home runs. But Cubs catcher Joe Girardi apparently
doesn't think the Marlins have any.
</P>
<P>
   After Floyd hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the
10th inning against the Cubs on June26, his teammates congratulated
him as he crossed home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for a young team they have an arrogance about them.
It's bad,'' Girardi told a South Florida radio station after the
series finale. ``I think they showed people up. I've always been
taught to play the game hard, pat yourself on the back, don't do a
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Boles said Girardi never specified what bothered him and didn't
think the Marlins did anything excessive. Floyd said he can't
believe Girardi would make a comment like that because he plays
with Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cubs have one of the best home-run hitters in the game,
and when he hits one he doesn't just run around the bases,'' Floyd
said. ``He does his hop and stares at it. As a pitcher what are you
going to do, hit him? No. You are just going to let him hit his 66
home runs a year and let him hop around the bases 66 times because
of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying Sammy is a showboat. That's his thing. He's the
man. But what I'm saying is, how can Girardi make that comment
about us? We did nothing different from another team after a guy
hits a game-winning home run. I've seen a ton this year, and I
haven't seen one team wait for the guy at the stairs of the
dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said hitters are subjected to a double standard by
pitchers. Hitters aren't allowed to celebrate like pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't as hitters show the pitcher up because pitchers have
control over the whole situation,'' Floyd said. ``I don't think you
should have to worry about the next time you are up if you are
going to get hit in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of pitchers get on my nerves, and I'm talking about
pitchers who haven't done nothing in the league, either. If we hit
a ball that goes over the wall and it's a game winner, you get
criticized or you hear the pitcher chirping at you.
</P>
<P>
   Hitters who celebrate excessively irk Marlins pitcher Ryan
Dempster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing wrong with celebrating when you win a game, but I'm
not big fan of pumping a home run when the game isn't close,''
Dempster said. ``It's tough because you can't retaliate because if
you hit someone you'll get suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said he doesn't celebrate excessively on the field for a
simple reason: He doesn't want to look stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I watched the ball, glared at a pitcher or
showboated, the ball wouldn't go out of the park,'' Floyd said.
``That would be my luck. The wind would bring it back in once it
got to about 385 (feet) and I would be stuck on first base looking
stupid. That's why I just run out everything I hit and if I got a
homer I'll slow down once I get to second.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one pitcher Floyd would love to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do owe Jose Lima and I will get him,'' Floyd said. ``When I
hit a home run off him, I am going to rub it in. I am going to ask
the good Lord to give me one home run off him. I don't care if it's
the only one I hit the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the electric slide after he struck me out with an
82-mile-per-hour changeup. (Showing off) will always come back and
bite you. I'm so happy he's stinking it up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, after a 21-win season in 1999, is 4-13 this season and
dyed his hair and goatee blond to try to break out of his slump. He
said nothing worked until he recently began being more emotional on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out and strike a guy out I like to do my dances,''
Lima said. ``I get away with it because I won 21 games. I have
earned the respect in the league. I tried to change it (at the
beginning of the season) and it's not working, so I have to go back
to my old style.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like what I do, then don't play against me that
day. Hitters get mad when you show them up but there is nothing
they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager and former major-league pitcher Larry Dierker
said he has become immune to celebrating by players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Lima every fifth day and that's about as excessive as it
gets,'' Dierker said. ``He's the most emotional player I've ever
seen in 35 years in baseball. You just expect it now from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said the demonstrative actions of baseball players today
bother him and he hates when he has to tell his own players to
knock it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel like an old man,'' said Dierker, 53. ``They
act like they don't know what I'm talking about, look at me like
I'm crazy. When I was playing, if you started yelling and screaming
at the other team, someone would get hit with a pitch. The game has
changed.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will dissipate early Wednesday over
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More thunderstorms will erupt
across the interior Northeast during the midday and afternoon,
especially from the Appalachians to the eastern Ohio Valley as a
cold front approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Areas near the Northeast coast will have another very warm and
humid day with hazy sunshine. Thunderstorms will arrive from the
west late in the day and at night.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be hot and sultry with ample sun. Scattered
afternoon thunderstorms will form near the Gulf Coast and southern
Appalachians, but most of the region will stay dry.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual heat will persist over a large area from the interior
West to the Plains. Scattered afternoon lightning storms may
exacerbate wild fires near many mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Alberto, with winds of 75 mph, will pass far north of
the Lesser Antilles by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE REAL SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Although the period between June 1 and Nov. 30 is the official
hurricane season in the Atlantic, the period between mid-August to
mid-October is when most tropical storms occur. Roughly 70 percent
of all Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between Aug. 10
and Oct. 20, when tropical seas are warmest. Ocean temperature is
the most important factor in the development of hurricanes and
typhoons.

 &HT;    U.S. DRUG CZAR SEES 'POSITIVE' TRANSITION OF POWER AMONG MEXICAN
JUSTICE OFFICIALS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Before heading to drug-plagued Colombia, U.S. drug
czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey stopped in Mexico Tuesday and praised
what appears to be an open transition of power here after 71 years
of one-party presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty positive atmosphere,'' McCaffrey told U.S.
correspondents here, after meeting with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, justice officials and members of Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who frequently has visited Mexico as the White
House's director of National Drug Control Policy, said Fox's
representatives are participating in meetings between U.S. and
Mexican officials Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fox defeated Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI, and will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the PRI was shocked by its defeat, but I sensed an
enormous goodwill and respect for Mr. Fox,'' McCaffrey said.
``There is a completely open transition process going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to clean up corruption in Mexico, a country that
is the transit point for up to 60 percent of the South American
cocaine sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick politician has suggested that he will dramatically
revamp Mexican police agencies and the Attorney General's office
here. Because one party has controlled Mexico's presidency for
seven decades, speculation is rampant over how smoothly this can be
accomplished and how organized crime groups will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition team we've been exposed to is pragmatic and
looking for creative new solutions,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are determined to go down in history as Mexican
patriots,'' he added. ``I cannot believe they will do anything that
doesn't make sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will reportedly review the role of the Mexican military in
the future and whether troops should be used for police work.
Currently, the Mexican military is involved in eradication of
drugs, interdiction, and intelligence and law enforcement work.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey praised the record of Mexico's Navy, which has been
working effectively with United States officials over the last year
to detect and seize drug shipments off the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to comment on whether Mexico should continue to
use the military in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive of one thing. The United States should not have a
hand in any way in shaping how . . . foreign nations in the
hemisphere organize themselves internally to confront these
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did say, however, that Mexican and U.S. officials will
recommend that Fox and whoever wins the U.S. presidency in November
should try to preserve the agreements for cooperation on drugs that
have been established under Zedillo and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already said he would like the United States to get rid
of the current annual ``certification'' of countries, in which
Congress judges countries for their drug-fighting records. Mexico
has repeatedly come under attack for corruption and other failures.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has long agreed with Fox's proposal, but doesn't
believe Congress is willing to scrap certification.
</P>
<P>
   He said nations in this hemisphere would discuss an alternative
system for grading each other on the drug war when they meet for
the Summit of the Americas in April 2001 in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey meets in Miami Wednesday with officials from the U.S.
Army's Southern Command, before heading to Cartegena, Colombia to
talk about the U.S.'s $1.3 billion anti-drug aid package to
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will visit Colombia on Aug. 30 to show
support. Colombia is a cocaine-producing country overwhelmed by
violent traffickers and rebels that control about 40 percent of the
nation's territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is in a risky position,'' he said. ``We're committed
to standing with them. Hopefully the region will also, along with
the Europeans and the Japanese. He (President Andres Pastrana) has
to solve several problems at the same time: an economy in the
dumps; a peace process that's going nowhere; and a drug production
problem that's skyrocketing.''

CHILE'S STEP TOWARD JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet never stands
trial for any of the atrocities of his 17-year reign, the ruling
Tuesday by Chile's Supreme Court to strip him of his immunity
heralds a strengthening commitment to the rule of law in that
country. It also sends a warning to human-rights abusers worldwide:
Even cronies in the military and business community may not deter
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-6 ruling, which upholds a lower court decision, answers
those who said the general should face a court only in Chile _ and
not in foreign countries that were home to some of his regime's
more than 3,000 victims. It was one such country, Spain, that in
1998 first ordered the extradition of General Pinochet to face
trial for crimes against Spanish citizens.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Pinochet was in England. British authorities put
him under house arrest while the nation's courts weighed the
Spanish request. Although England's highest court eventually found
his arrest lawful and his extradition was ordered, the British
government finally decided he was too ill to face extradition and
sent him home to Chile in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean court showed impressive fortitude Tuesday in
standing up to the bullying tactics by Pinochet supporters after
the lower court decision in May. The military's chief of staff made
an official visit to Pinochet in a demonstration, he said, of
``institutional support'' for the leader of the 1973 coup that
seized power from the democratically elected socialist government
of Salvador Allende. Pinochet's son spoke darkly of a repeat of
1973 if the lawsuits against his father were not dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is diabetic, has a pacemaker, and, say his doctors,
suffered two strokes in England that caused brain damage. Chilean
officials may find him as unfit to stand trial as Britain's home
secretary did. But, as Isabel Allende, daughter of the president
and now a congresswoman, said Tuesday, ``We have shed our fear of
this man. Through this case we have discovered that we are building
a real democracy in Chile.'' That is a worthy monument to the
memory of Pinochet's victims.

TOKYO RELIEVED AFTER 6 GANGSTERS ARRESTED IN SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Residents of this normally safe city were horrified
Monday at a shootout in an upscale business district but breathed a
sigh of relief Tuesday after police arrested six members of one of
Japan's largest organized crime syndicates in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which sent shock waves across this relatively
crime-free city of 8 million people, unfolded at 3:20 p.m. Monday,
when about 15 gangsters wielding knives and swords stormed the
office of a right-wing group with ties to the same syndicate in
Tokyo's Chiyoda district.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the gang members, who are affiliated with the
Sumiyoshi-kai, one of the three biggest organized crime syndicates
in Japan, came to collect on a loan the group owed them. The
situation exploded as three members of the right-wing group opened
fire on the gangsters, killing Tetsuo Nagashima, 52, and Hideo
Takahi, 49, whom police identified as mid-level mob bosses. Five
people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Public shootouts are rare in Japan, and the incident was
especially troubling because it violated what has long been an
unspoken agreement with gang members. Police do not meddle in their
affairs as long as the mob operates within set boundaries in its
prostitution, gambling, and low-level extortion operations and
avoids public violence.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting also reflected growing turmoil within Japan's mob,
or yakuza. The mob has been battered both by a weak economy and by
a recent crackdown on some aspects of organized crime by the police
and community groups. Rival factions, often from the same clan, are
increasingly fighting one another for control of shrinking criminal
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of `Godfather' violence is not supposed to happen in
Japan,'' said a senior police official. ``Yes, we have organized
gangs in Japan, but like everything else in our society there are
set rules and parameters to keep the wa, or harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the recession, revenues from the gangs' legitimate
businesses like construction have dropped, along with the illegal
traffic in drugs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of the five people injured in the shootout, four were from the
crime gang and one was from the right-wing group Sofusha, or Blue
Wind Group, which police said has 30 members and was established in
1983 by former members of gangs related to the same Sumiyoshi-kai
syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the rightist group had a business arrangement,
including cooperation on loan collection, with the other gangsters
but that relations between the two groups soured over how to divide
profits from the loan collection venture.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sofusha is well known in Tokyo for its right-wing political
activities, especially its loud-speaker truck that has traversed
city streets demanding the return of four Russian-held islands off
the northern island of Hokkaido. In recent months, the group had
fallen on hard financial times and indicated it would disband,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Sofusha members were arrested in 1988 on suspicion of
beating defendants accused of giving patients HIV-tainted blood
products.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing group's office is located along Shinjuku-dori
Avenue near the Hanzomon district, where the Imperial Place and a
residential complex for lawmakers are situated.
</P>
<P>
   Tomonori Ikeda, a 30-year-old clerk who works in an adjacent
building, told the Japan Times newspaper that after the shooting,
he saw a man, covered with blood, running and using a cellular
phone. ``I can't believe a shooting happened here,'' Ikeda said.
</P>
<P>
   While the level of violent crime in Japan remains very low in
comparison with that in the United States and most other countries,
many Japanese have become alarmed at a recent increase in crimes,
especially by young people. Still, the streets of Tokyo and other
Japanese cities are relatively safe to walk at any hour.
</P>
<P>
   In March, authorities expressed concern over a series of
firebombing attacks against telephone dating clubs _ places where
men come to arrange for sexual encounters with prostitutes. Police
said the bombings were the result of increasing competition between
rival gangs related to Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest crime
syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   In one attack, four patrons burned to death in the southern port
city of Kobe after gang members threw a gasoline bomb inside a
telephone dating club. The club's owners had refused to pay
protection money to a gang that was impinging on an affiliate's
turf, police said.

&HT;     THE AMERICAN POLL PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Monday, the headline on the front page of USA
Today said: ``Bush lead on Gore grows to 17 points.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, USA Today reported that Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
lead had almost disappeared. Bush was only 2 points ahead of Vice
President Al Gore, within the statistical margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shift in sentiment between the poll conducted after
the Republican National Convention and the quickie reaction to
Gore's selection of Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman to be his
running mate is startling, but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Post-convention bounces don't always last, and the signals they
send can be contradictory. For instance, Bush has gained among
moderates, white women, middle-aged voters, independents and
college graduates. Yet barely 35 percent of those responding to the
USA Today/CNN/Gallup survey agreed with the campaign theme that
Bush is a ``different kind of Republican'' and 56 percent said he
is ``pretty much the same as other top Republicans.'' No clear
message there, except that a lot of voters are confused.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 88 percent in the overnight post-Lieberman poll said
the fact he is Jewish would make no difference in their vote. Yet
the media were full of speculation about the potential impact of
his religion. Inescapably, this is a subject that will be on many
people's minds and debated in living rooms all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is Gore. It's his name at the top of
the ticket, not Lieberman's. Even though he has been vice president
for nearly eight years, voters don't know him very well. The
Republicans naturally painted a grim picture of him as President
Clinton's toady; no wonder he hasn't done well in polls. At his own
convention next week Gore gets equal time to portray Bush as
daddy's boy and present a more inspiring image of himself. The
political dynamics will change again. And again, and again.
</P>
<P>
   The polls are bound to go up and down and over and under
regularly during the coming campaign, in response to unfolding
events. Presidential races in which the candidates are so
mismatched that the outcome seems preordained are rare _ and this
is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   And in this tight, closely-matched race the only poll that
ultimately matters is the one on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken now lack the crucial element of extended comparison
between the two tickets and their issues. They are driven by
momentary public whim, which is notoriously fickle. And results may
vary depending upon whether registered voters or only those likely
to vote are surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The poll taken in the immediate afterglow of the successful
Republican convention but before the Democrats had a chance to
respond could never last, despite the self-congratulatory glee of
GOP backers. This was not the final word.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a poll taken in the excited hours after a dramatic,
unprecedented veep pick, before voters have a chance to think about
what it might mean, reflects a transitory emotion. Lieberman is
hardly a household word; voters have yet to see him in action. Were
they really impressed or simply caught up in the excitement of the
moment?
</P>
<P>
   It would be sensible if voters would just ignore polls until we
get close to election day. But they fascinate us, because we love
the horse race aspect of politics, measuring each contestant
against the other as they trot along.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, you say, what about self-fulfilling prophecies? If we keep
hearing Bush is ahead, or Gore is ahead, won't we decide it's all
settled and vote accordingly? This is too convoluted to interpret.
Some supporters who think their man is losing might stay home in
despair. Or they might get angry and rush to the polls to help him.
Or supporters who think their man is winning might think their vote
is not needed. Or they might rush to the polls to join the
bandwagon. This sort of thing is unknowable.
</P>
<P>
   The private polls of the candidates serve a different purpose.
The Bush camp likes to denounce Gore as driven by poll numbers and
political calculation but in truth both men carefully monitor how
their words and deeds are playing with the public. They would be
fools not to do so. An uninformed candidate is a candidate who
makes needless mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   They tailor their words and their policies to appeal to the most
people and offend the least people. We all know this; we weren't
born yesterday. But this is OK. It may not be bold political
leadership but it has proven over time to be the way to get
elected. A democracy requires some attention be paid to what voters
want.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has consistently tried to ignore the polls in public,
particularly because he has sometimes been behind and never far
ahead. The Bush team has also dismissed the polls, predicting they
would narrow as the campaign progressed. They may have been trying
to lower expectations but they also seem to have been correct.

MALAYSIAN COURT CONVICTS ANWAR OF SODOMY, CONCLUDING TWO-YEAR
DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., fyi, skedded earlier as MALAYSIA-IBRAHIM) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ The widely expected sodomy conviction
early Tuesday of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar
Ibrahim, could snuff out the career of a charismatic leader who was
seen as one of the rising stars in Asian politics.
</P>
<P>
   The terse ruling capped a long, corrosive legal battle, and came
on top of a previous conviction for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Arifin Jaka found Anwar guilty of sodomy and sentenced him
to nine years in prison. He declared that Anwar had committed
``despicable acts in our society,'' and deserved the ``utmost
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict marked the end of a two-year drama that had riveted
this nation of 22 million, and had repercussions beyond it. Anwar's
trial called into question the motives of Malaysia's leaders and
credibility of its courts. It also exposed a deeply traditional
country to a relentlessly sordid spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 52, reacted with a mix of coolness and anger. He smiled
and hugged members of his family who had gathered in the courtroom,
but later exploded in frustration, saying: ``Bloody, rotten
judiciary!''
</P>
<P>
   Before the sentence was read, Anwar delivered a withering
denunciation of his former boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
He accused Mahathir of orchestrating a conspiracy to destroy him,
and said Malaysia's judiciary had demeaned itself by doing his
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Mahathir's lust for power is insatiable,'' said Anwar,
brushing aside angry protests from the judge. ``He will lie and
force others to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge found Anwar's adopted brother, Sukma Darmawan, 39,
guilty of sodomy as well, sentencing him to six years and four
strokes with a rattan cane. Anwar escaped the caning because that
penalty is not given to people older than 49. Both men were
convicted of engaging in homosexual relations with Azizan Abu
Bakar, a former driver for the family.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's lawyers said they would appeal the sentence, which one
described as ``mind-boggling.'' Although the judge could have
imposed a 20-year term, Anwar said he was expecting six years.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Anwar predicted the harsh sentence would unleash a
new wave of political unrest here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to sustain the opposition movement to Dr.
Mahathir,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, the deputy president of the
National Justice Party, which was formed last year after Anwar's
first conviction. ``People are going to see it as another example
of Mahathir's cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the Moorish-style courthouse, there was little
evidence of the outrage that drew thousands into the streets after
the first verdict. This morning, several hundred supporters of
Anwar gathered at a mosque behind the courthouse. A few carried a
banner that said, ``Free Anwar.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had threatened to crack down on any pro-Anwar
demonstrations. That warning, combined with a formidable array of
riot police and water-cannon trucks, seemed to work. Police quickly
dispersed the protesters, arresting at least 12 people amid a
handful of scuffles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The verdict will do little for Malaysia's tarnished reputation
overseas. Amnesty International and other human rights groups
condemned the decision, as did the New Zealand government. Human
Rights Watch, based in New York, said, ``The verdicts are another
blow to justice in Malaysia.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's case has always been about more than his sexual
practices. From the day he was dismissed by Mahathir in September
1998, Anwar has been waging a war against his former mentor for the
soul of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, 74, a onetime country doctor, presided over a great
Asian success story _ transforming a fractured, ethnically polyglot
former British colony into a well-oiled economy. He had carefully
groomed Anwar, a Muslim youth leader with Western sophistication,
to be his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But when the regional economic crisis tore through Malaysia's
palm plantations and semiconductor factories, the two men began to
clash over policy. Anwar favored the remedies of the International
Monetary Fund, while Mahathir inveighed against foreign currency
traders.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists argue that the differences between the two men
were overblown. But there is no question that Mahathir felt
threatened. Rather than fading away _ or being toppled like his
Indonesian counterpart, Suharto _ the prime minister made a
pre-emptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the charges against Anwar guaranteed that his
trial would be a lurid affair. Homosexuality is taboo in this
Muslim country, and Malaysians were alternately enthralled and
repelled by the talk of furtive encounters and soiled mattresses.
But as the trial dragged on, public interest flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Anwar said the sexual misconduct case was
hopelessly flimsy. The government prosecutors switched the dates on
which Anwar was supposed to have committed sodomy three times.
Azizan, the former driver, said he had been asked by the police to
testify to a new date.
</P>
<P>
   But Arifin said, ``I'm satisfied the prosecution has proven its
case against both accused beyond reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar must serve the nine-year sentence after his six years for
corruption. Even if both terms are reduced by one-third for good
behavior, Anwar faces a decade behind bars. Under Malaysian law, he
is forbidden to run for office for five years after his release.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, by contrast, was re-elected handily last November. His
coalition amassed a huge majority in Parliament. The prime
minister, who has been in power 19 years and is Asia's longest
ruling leader, said that this term will be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's allies noted Mahathir had paid a price for his attacks _
losing many of the Malay voters who were the bedrock of his party,
the United Malays National Organization. Disgusted by the trial,
these voters switched their allegiance to Malaysia's Islamic party
in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Anwar's most fervent supporters acknowledge their
jailed hero can no longer be the driving force of the anti-Mahathir
movement. ``He was very important to the `reformasi' movement,''
said Chandra of the Justice Party. ``But the struggle for change
needs to go beyond Anwar.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Anwar's wife is confronting the prospect of life
without her husband. Sitting in the sun-drenched living room of her
home here last week, Dr. Wan Azizah said she wanted her children to
recover a sense of normalcy after the turmoil of the past two
years. She has urged her eldest daughter to stay out of politics to
concentrate on her college studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish in my heart that Anwar won't spend years and years in
jail,'' Wan Azizah said wistfully. ``But I feel this doom looming
over me.''

`LIVE THROUGH THIS': ANCIENTS MAKING NEW HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL GENZLINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For several reasons, ``Live Through This,'' the dramatic series
that has its premiere Wednesday night on MTV, ought to come with a
sort of reverse parental advisory. Something like ``May not be
suitable for viewing by people who were at or near the original
Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there's the premise of the show: a once-mighty
rock band reunites to go on tour, with the band members taking
along their children, ages 16 to 23. But the jarring thing, for
viewers of a certain age, is that the heyday of this has-been band
was in the late '70s and early '80s. That, apparently, is what
today's MTV audience thinks of as ancient rock history. Ouch.
Despite what Mick Jagger sang (in 1964), time, time, time is not on
our side.
</P>
<P>
   Also unsettling, for the geezer-age viewer, is the dialogue of
the show's young adults, which is drenched in slang of the moment,
or perhaps it's slang that the writers just made up hoping that it
would become slang of the moment by the time the show hit the air.
``He's such a buzzkill'' and ``That would be totally spank'' and
``He would be stoked to see me,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour of this, it begins to become unclear what's
slang and what isn't. When a band member, Drake Taylor (Ron Lea),
tells his son, Travis (Matthew Carey), that one of the group's old
CD's now sells for $100 on eBay, Travis replies, ``Steep.'' Is he
merely saying, ``That price seems steep''? Or is ``steep'' slang
for, ``I hate you, and the all-black outfit doesn't work with your
paunch''? Hard to say. In any case, the effect is to cause the
viewer to start seeing slang everywhere _ in the kitchen utensils,
in the mop closet. It's cuisinarting, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Live Through This,'' MTV's first attempt at an
hourlong dramatic series, has no intention of appealing to anyone
old enough to have been at Woodstock, or even anyone old enough to
have been fans of the Jackson Decker Band, the fictional group in
the show. The aim is much younger, and the show's writers go for
the target in a way that is almost manipulative. ``Live Through
This'' (a 1994 album by Courtney Love's band, Hole, has the same
title) is the world as a teen-ager might create it: the young
people are the smart ones, their parents the ones in need of
shepherding and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Most obvious is that the band's tour is organized and run by
Chase (Tom Lock), the son of Keith Rooney (David Nerman), one of
the band's guitarists. He has an MBA from Stanford, a knack for
resolving crises, and more sense than the four band members
combined. When he's not lecturing one of them the way a parent
might lecture a wayward child, he keeps tabs on his sister, Olivia
(Jessica Welch), who is not quite as straight-and-narrow as he is.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Lu (Sarah Manninen), who selflessly keeps her
mother, the band's torch singer (played by Jennifer Dale), away
from alcohol and such, or at least tries to. Even sweet and
innocent Darby (Jane McGregor), who at 16 is the youngest of the
children on the tour, turns out to be a parental life-saver. Though
her dad, Rick Parsons (Bruce Dinsmore), the group's drummer, is now
neurotically overprotective, it emerges that back in the glory days
he was the band's bad boy; it was Darby's birth that jolted him off
of the Hendrix-Joplin-Etc. Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Consciously or unconsciously, the young-is-better worldview of
``Live Through This'' also extends to the performers. The actors
who play the band members seem to be sleepwalking much of the time,
and who can blame them, since they're playing stereotypes. The
younger actors are also playing stereotypes but are more spank
about it.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the show would have been much better, downright fun
even, as a comedy. As a drama, despite the original premise, it
falls back on the same old parent-child tensions that have already
been explored, and better, by other shows. Still, with the
soap-operalike possibilities for couplings and recouplings, the
music and all that swell slang _ well, it's easy to be hoovered by
the show, if you're not too waxy-buildup.
</P>
<P>
   If only the dialogue were a little less self-consciously hip.
``Drake's obsessed with that guitar,'' Lu tells Travis in one
scene. ``Once he put it up for auction at a Save the Music benefit,
then yanked it at the last second. Sting still won't talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   That Sting _ he's always going brillo.

ARTS ABROAD: WORLD TOUR FOR A DIVA LONG BANNED FROM SINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   By HADANI DITMARS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ In Pacific Coliseum sports
stadium, the Iranian pop diva Googoosh was about to begin her
second public performance in more than 20 years. Dressed in an
elegant simple blue silk dress reminiscent of her days as a Tehran
cabaret star, and encircled by replica pillars from the ancient
Persian site of Persepolis, she paused reflectively.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching into ``Gharibeh Ashenah'' (``A Stranger,
Familiar''), an old favorite from her '70s heyday, Googoosh, bathed
in green, white and red light, the colors of the Iranian flag,
proclaimed to the crowd, ``I wish that all Iranians could be here
with me tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words, which were met with a resounding cheer from the
thousands in the sports stadium, were at once defiant and wistful;
they expressed her wish that her fans in Iran could also hear her
live performance. For Googoosh, along with all other Iranian women,
has been banned from singing in public since the 1979 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, Googoosh, 50, is not merely a pop star. She is a singer
whose fame and post-revolutionary exile from the public eye have
turned her into a national icon. When, later in the program, she
sang the song ``Captive Land'' from her new CD, ``Zartosht'' (which
she recently recorded in Toronto after the music was recorded in
Tehran), the allusions to imprisonment, pain and heartbreak could
have referred to her own life story as well as the plight of her
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   For Googoosh's life _ which has traversed harassment by the
family of the shah and 20 years of isolation in post-revolutionary
Iran _ has become for many Iranians a metaphor of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But, auspiciously perhaps, and in a possible sign of the power
of reformist currents in Iran, Googoosh was recently given
permission to travel abroad. In the last few years the Iranian
authorities have softened their hard-line stance on pop music.
While the sale of pop music cassettes and CDs is still illegal,
possession is now allowed. In addition, some male pop singers have
been permitted to perform in public under certain circumstances.
While it is unclear whether President Mohammad Khatami himself gave
the green light for her public performances abroad, there were no
conditions attached to her departure. On July 29 Googoosh began a
world tour that will include dates in North America, Europe and the
Middle East. She is scheduled to appear in Los Angeles on Aug. 19
and at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Googoosh's husband, the filmmaker Massoud Kimiai, is
accompanying her, and with a brother in Toronto and a grown son and
grandchild in Los Angeles, there is much speculation among Iranians
that she may eventually settle in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent reformist tendencies, it is still not known how
the singer, whose full name is Faegheh Atashin, would be received
if she does return to Iran. Already her world tour has been
condemned by outraged fundamentalists. And Kimiai was recently
summoned to appear in an Iranian court to defend the morality of
one of his films.
</P>
<P>
   But for her thousands of expatriate Iranian fans, hearing
Googoosh live after two decades of silence is a dream come true.
Her fame has often been compared to that of Elvis Presley in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically and musically her work is complex. She has worked with
the best arrangers and poets in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Her songs are a blend of East and West, rooted in serpentine
Persian melodies but often backed up by danceable bass lines and
electric guitars and, more recently, propelled by Gipsy Kings-style
rumbas. At the same time one senses in Googoosh's haunting alto the
influence of the French chanson, with her gift for deeply emotional
and compelling interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   With the post-revolutionary ban on public singing by women _ the
authorities contend that women's voices could corrupt men _ she
went from being a pop diva with her own palace, to singing only
occasionally for small groups of women in private. But her impact
on the Iranian public continued.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice and image have been kept alive by a huge fan base
inside and outside of Iran. There are several Web sites in Farsi
and English that offer video clips from her films and television
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In Googoosh's appearance here in Vancouver, after an inaugural
one in Toronto, her fans were ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all this time, she's only gotten better,'' said Mehrdad
Hashemi, 33, one of some 50,000 Iranians in Vancouver and one of
the 10,000 at the concert. ``We say she is like a carpet from
Kerman. The older and more worn down it gets, the more valuable it
becomes. She is precious to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has suffered, but she has triumphed,'' said Tahareh
Zahrah, a 42-year-old mother of two who last saw Googoosh perform
in 1977. ``Googoosh was my idol so this is a real thrill. Growing
up, we all used to imitate her _ what she wore, how she acted. She
used to change her hairstyle and her look as often as Madonna. We
just loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Zahrah's friend Nahid Yusefi said that to this day her presence
was still palpable in Iran. ``When I went back home in 1995, you
could hear her old songs everywhere, in taxis, in the parks, even
in public buildings, you could hear the melodies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Googoosh meant to him, Zahra's 21-year-old son, Omid,
who was born just after the revolution and grew up in Canada, said,
``She represents the real spirit of what was the true country
called Iran.'' One factor in Googoosh's continued cult status is
veneration by a generation of young people who were not even born
when she last performed in public.
</P>
<P>
   Some left-wing critics of the Iranian government living abroad
object to her tour, arguing that it helps present a softer, false
picture of Iranian rule. And for fundamentalist elements inside and
outside Iran, she is still considered decadent. Opposition to the
tour has also been expressed by some Iranian pop singers in Los
Angeles who, after 20 years of struggling to make it in what they
refer to as Tehrangeles, are at least temporarily being upstaged by
a star from the past.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahmin Mahjouri, editor of Payvand, a leading Farsi weekly
in Vancouver, said that he believed making artists into political
apologists was unfair. ``Googoosh is simply doing what she loves
best _ performing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was certainly not overlooked by fans in Vancouver, who
seemed to cheer the loudest when she sang from her new CD, ``Why is
it these days that singing is a crime?''

 &HT;    U.S. DRUG CZAR SEES 'POSITIVE' TRANSITION OF POWER AMONG MEXICAN
JUSTICE OFFICIALS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Before heading to drug-plagued Colombia, U.S. drug
czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey stopped in Mexico Tuesday and praised
what appears to be an open transition of power here after 71 years
of one-party presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty positive atmosphere,'' McCaffrey told U.S.
correspondents here, after meeting with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, justice officials and members of Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who frequently has visited Mexico as the White
House's director of National Drug Control Policy, said Fox's
representatives are participating in meetings between U.S. and
Mexican officials Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fox defeated Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI, and will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the PRI was shocked by its defeat, but I sensed an
enormous goodwill and respect for Mr. Fox,'' McCaffrey said.
``There is a completely open transition process going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to clean up corruption in Mexico, a country that
is the transit point for up to 60 percent of the South American
cocaine sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick politician has suggested that he will dramatically
revamp Mexican police agencies and the Attorney General's office
here. Because one party has controlled Mexico's presidency for
seven decades, speculation is rampant over how smoothly this can be
accomplished and how organized crime groups will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition team we've been exposed to is pragmatic and
looking for creative new solutions,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are determined to go down in history as Mexican
patriots,'' he added. ``I cannot believe they will do anything that
doesn't make sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will reportedly review the role of the Mexican military in
the future and whether troops should be used for police work.
Currently, the Mexican military is involved in eradication of
drugs, interdiction, and intelligence and law enforcement work.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey praised the record of Mexico's Navy, which has been
working effectively with United States officials over the last year
to detect and seize drug shipments off the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to comment on whether Mexico should continue to
use the military in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive of one thing. The United States should not have a
hand in any way in shaping how . . . foreign nations in the
hemisphere organize themselves internally to confront these
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did say, however, that Mexican and U.S. officials will
recommend that Fox and whoever wins the U.S. presidency in November
should try to preserve the agreements for cooperation on drugs that
have been established under Zedillo and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already said he would like the United States to get rid
of the current annual ``certification'' of countries, in which
Congress judges countries for their drug-fighting records. Mexico
has repeatedly come under attack for corruption and other failures.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has long agree

 &HT;    Baby boomers heading for a nontraditional type of retirement
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The generation that changed America in
the '60s is certain to change it again as the baby boomers enter
their own 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how is a multibillion-dollar question.
</P>
<P>
   The most fawned-over consumers in history are being asked again
and again what they'd like to do, where they'd like to live and how
they want to be treated in their leisure years. Just how leisurely
those years will be remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   One survey found that eight in 10 intend to keep working; others
show similar results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading-edge baby boomers are likely to work at least 20
hours a week,'' says Charles F. Longino Jr., professor of
gerontology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. ``They'll
be returning for second careers. They'll be going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for bingo.
</P>
<P>
   Longino, who has made a continuing study of retirement trends,
is one of many who see the boomers headed for an oxymoronic future:
active retirement. Some will work to pay the bills; others to keep
from climbing the walls. After packing more rest-and-recreation
time into their working lives than any generation before, they'll
be more inclined toward surfboards than shuffleboard - and less
inclined to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very mobile generation,'' Longino says.
</P>
<P>
   Some will be adventurous in picking out-of-the-way destinations,
from the once-rural American South to jungle-fringed beaches of
South America. They'll be every bit as demanding, but they'll
demand features foreign to most of today's retirement homes.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb Corp., the Arizona-based retirement builder, surveyed
boomers across the nation last year and found that nearly 60
percent would rather have a gourmet kitchen than a swimming pool;
most men (and many women) want a home office; and more than half
want a house at least as big as the one they live in now.
</P>
<P>
   Making mass predictions about boomers isn't easy because they
aren't one mass, just the coincidental byproducts of postwar
prosperity and pent-up passions. The label covers everyone born
between 1946 and 1964. The oldest will reach retirement age in less
than 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most diverse generation in history,'' says John
Rother, legislative director of AARP. ``It is economically diverse.
It is ethnically diverse. There's also considerable diversity of
attitudes in men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   The age spread creates its own diversity: The oldest were born
before most Americans owned a television. The youngest were born
after President Kennedy was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   America's over-60 population is already bigger than ever, at
more than 30 million. Many will still be going strong when the
boomers push the over-60 figure to 50 million by 2015. Late
arrivals will bring the swell to full strength in 2030 at 65
million.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the boomers who rocked Woodstock and protested
Vietnam will be in their 80s, while the ones who grew up with the
Brady Bunch will still have to show IDs to get into senior citizen
buffet night.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they want, at whatever age, the boomers are likely to
get it. Instead of being wheeled - or pushed - boomer retirees will
strut into their later years with a different attitude: More
assertive, more engaged in the world around them. Many will also be
more affluent than previous retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have the tools to make choices no one had before,''
says Rother.
</P>
<P>
   For most of history, retirement presented no choices at all
because it didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   In Colonial times, retirement was for the rich, who didn't have
to wait until they were old. Otherwise, you worked in the mill or
the shop or the field until you either died behind the plow or
someone who wanted your job shoved you out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War veterans were probably the first mass group to get
pensions, but retirement still wasn't even a dream for small-town
shopkeepers and farmers as the 20th century approached. Few had to
worry long: Average life expectancy was about 50 in 1900, and only
about one in 25 Americans was 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for old-age security had become standard fare for labor
organizers and social reformers by the end of World War I - the
idea had already taken hold in Europe - but who could hear the
clamor over the Roar of the Twenties?
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, stock-market crash of 1929 made retirement an
unwelcome reality for millions. More than a dozen states enacted
old-age plans among other relief measures, but most were restricted
to the truly poor, and few were paid enn previous generations
missed: employer-subsidized stock plans, IRAs and considerable
equity in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, won't be as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a third of boomers, including many women and minorities,
don't have pensions or health insurance, Rother says. ``A lot of
divorced women haven't saved for retirement,'' he says. ``Unless
something changes, they'll arrive at 65 with very few options
except to continue working.''
</P>
<P>
   Some boomers may think they're in better shape than they really
are.
</P>
<P>
   An annual survey released in May showed that most have some sort
of retirement strategy or retirement savings and that more
Americans than ever are very confident of having enough money to
last to the end of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey showed that most thought they'd need to save
only $50,000, that almost a quarter of all workers had actually
saved less than $10,000 and that many were underestimating their
expected life spans by 10 or more years.
</P>
<P>
   Worse: Two out of 10 boomers hadn't begun to save at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there are signs that some of the confidence may be
misplaced,'' says Danny Devine of the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, a Washington think tank that conducts the annual survey
along with the affiliated nonprofit American Savings Education
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Devine says the good omens in the survey outweigh the
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are paying attention to retirement,'' he says.
``They're beginning to understand that they have to make a plan.
They're taking small steps. Confidence comes from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITES TO PREPARE YOU FOR RETIREMENT
</P>
<P>
   Retirement isn't an impossible goal. All it will take is money -
very nearly as much as you make now.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say you'll need at least 70 percent of your
pre-retirement income. But that won't leave much wiggle room, and
all the surveys say you plan to do plenty of wiggling.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the kids will be done with college. But will the house be
paid for? What about that cabin in North Carolina? What about jet
skis and greens fees? And do you really expect that Lexus to last
as long as you do?
</P>
<P>
   You'll most likely be around for at least 16 years after you
cash the first Social Security check, maybe a lot longer - plenty
of time to wear out just about everything you own. So, better to
figure you'll need closer to 90 percent of your pre-retirement
income. Here are some of the best places on the Web to start your
figuring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Social Security Administration (www.ssa.gov): You won't find a
detailed account of your benefits, but you can request one
(1-800-772-1213). Meanwhile, you can use online calculators to work
up estimates and to find out when you'll be eligible for full
benefits. (Remember: The full retirement age is
</P>
<P>
   increasing in phases for anyone born in 1938 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The American Savings Education Council (www.asec.org) has
printable and interactive calculators that will help you estimate
how far you'll have to stretch your savings after figuring in your
company pension and investment income. It also has tools to help
determine how much additional savings you can pile up in the time
that's left. There's also an online savings personality quiz that
can tell you how likely you are to blow it all before then. Also
available at the site: The new Retirement Confidence Survey
results, so you can see how others are doing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The federal Administration on Aging
(www.aoa.dhhs.gov/retirement) offers a bonanza of information on
retirement finances, taxes and other advice, plus links to many
more retirement-related sites. So does the U.S. Department of
Labor's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration
(www.dol.gov/dol/pwba).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MSN Money Central (http://moneycentral.msn.com/home.asp) has
lots of information about money and investing, but one of its most
entertaining features (in a morbid sort of way) is a
life-expectancy calculator
(http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/calcs/nexpect/main.asp) that
crunches much more detailed information than most. Don't expect
your date of death, but do expect to be surprised by how long you
may hang around - all the way to 102, for example, if you're a
reasonably healthy and trim woman of 45.

 &HT;    Healtheon/WebMD responds to column
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Healtheon/WebMD scrambled this week to counteract what
it said was an unfair and inaccurate report alleging that Jim Clark
had not followed through on his promise to buy $200 million in
WebMD shares.
</P>
<P>
   After making the vow, Clark _ who founded Healtheon before its
merger with WebMD _ bought $8.78 million worth of stock in April
and $311,000 in shares the next month. Clark made the promise April
7, professing continued confidence in the company even as its stock
_ which once traded above $100 a share _ languished below $22. As
news came that legendary Silicon Valley investor Clark was still
bullish, company stock jumped to $29.19.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times column Sunday by Gretchen Morgenson noted that,
``at the rate Mr. Clark is buying, it will take roughly five and a
half years for him to buy $200 million worth of stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said subsequent purchases were limited by securities
regulations meant to prevent either fraud or stock manipulation.
After assessing that defense, Morgenson concluded Clark and the
company had done a disservice to investors. Shareholders should
have been warned Clark's purchase of stock was not going to happen
as promised, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion of improper conduct made officials at
Healtheon/WebMD nearly apoplectic. They worked into the night
Sunday crafting a response, which was released the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Dennison, executive vice president and general counsel for
Healtheon/WebMD, said the column was peppered with errors. He said
Clark was constrained by the rules. ``It is not a matter of
interpretation. This is black-letter law.''
</P>
<P>
   Insider trading restraints are triggered when the official has
knowledge that _ if public _ could move the stock either up or
down, information that might change an investor's judgment on the
stock. Dennison found especially annoying the suggestion that the
company or Clark should alert investors to those times when he was
under restraint. ``You'd start all sorts of rumors. ... And you are
misleading the market. At best, this is incrediblurchases would be
subject to securities law.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the civil actions brought each year by the
Securities and Exchange Commission involve insider trading, said
spokesman John Heinie. Heinie said he could not comment on specific
cases. What an investor is permitted to do ``depends on the facts,
the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   David Stockton, who specializing in securities law for
Kilpatrick Stockton in Atlanta, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Clark) is in possession of non-public, material
information, then he shouldn't be trading in his company's stock.
But it's not black and white. What's material? It's difficult to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney's instinct is to urge caution, Stockton said.
Stockton said it appears the lawyers gave Clark good advice not to
trade _ but it is not precisely true to say that Clark was legally
required to refrain.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the column and the controversy did not dramatically
move the stock, which has fallen still further since in April.
Healtheon/WebMD was up 6.25 cents on Monday, dipping by the same
amount Tuesday to close at $12.63 a share.

   OLY-SWIMSUITS (Indianapolis) _ When the Olympic trials begin

what they are wearing as for what records they set in preparation
for the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia. A
bodysuit that fits athletes from neck to toe and comes with sleeves
has revolutionized the sport. At least 10 world records have been
set worldwide this year in the new swim suits. Speedo's version is
called the Fastskin suit, which contains tiny, v-shaped ridges that
allow water to pass over the swimmer more efficiently. The
super-stretch fabric also compresses a swimmer's muscles, therefore
reducing the buildup of lactic acid that causes fatigue. Swimmers
also say the suit lifts them higher in the water and makes it
easier to stroke. By Jere Longman.

Rights, many low-income families who faced higher rates for natural
gas during last year's relatively mild winter cut back on food,
health care, phones and electricity to pay for heat. With prices
rising, the department says that situation could worsen this year.

LIEBFRAUMILCH: FAREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUEDESHEIM, Germany _ At Georg Breuer, a leading wine estate in
this small town on the Rhine, I tasted three bottles of Ruedesheim
Berg Schlossberg, 1998, '97 and '90 vintages. Each had aromas that
were almost floral, and each was powerfully dry. The youngest was
almost mouth-puckering, but with age, the wines seemed to mellow,
emphasizing their extraordinary balance.
</P>
<P>
   Dry is hardly the description most Americans imagine when they
think of German wines. The images that arise are sugary
liebfraumilch, which was once a popular beginner's wine; fruity,
vibrant rieslings; and powerful trockenbeerenausleses, some of the
world's grandest (and most unpronounceable) dessert wines.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what do the Germans themselves drink? Dry wines.
Occasionally, the wines are as exquisite as the Breuers. But as I
found on visits to almost two dozen wineries in the Rhine and Mosel
valleys, they are more often not simply dry, but so parching that
they seem to drain the mouth of every last bit of moisture. These
wines are often labeled halbtrocken and trocken, which translates
literally as half-dry and dry, but more accurately as dry and very
dry. And now, as the German wine industry ponders how to make its
product more appealing to Americans, many see dry wines as their
salvation, as a way to get in step with a world that may not know a
lot about white wines but wants them to be called dry.
</P>
<P>
   It's not merely a debate, but an identity crisis within a wine
industry in which everything seems to be open to challenge, from
the tortured methods for assessing the quality of German vineyards
and the Byzantine labeling laws to the recent history of German
winemaking itself. And, inevitably, statesmanlike solutions for
improving and simplifying German wine rules fall prey to politics,
which pits region against region and artisanal winemakers against
industrial producers.
</P>
<P>
   The economic stakes are high. Through the 1990s, the United
States imported about 10 million liters a year of wine from
Germany, way down from a high figure of about 60 million in 1984,
according to the German Wine Information Bureau in New York. Most
of that difference came from big German producers of sweet and
cheap wines, whose popularity nosedived along with that of most
American jug wines in the last 15 years. But these producers want
to get back into the American market and see dry wines as their
best bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Italy had the same problem with Riunite and
lambrusco, and they came out with pinot grigio,''' said Johannes
Selbach, whose winery, Selbach-Oster, in Zeltingen on the Mosel
River, produces both fruity and dry wines. ``But we Germans should
not forget that there is a strong Italian restaurant scene and
market in the U.S., and they haven't had the problems with World
War I and World War II. That's a strategic disadvantage for Germany
that you cannot change with a change in style.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the trockens point not only to the worldwide market
for dry wines, but also to their popularity in Germany, where
trockens and dry Italian wines like pinot grigio are still popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '80s saw a boom in dry wines and a complete falling off of
the sweet wines,'' Selbach said. ``The trockens exploded, and
drinking anything but trockens was considered politically
incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say that the German embrace of dry wines is really a return
to the way German wines were made a century ago, before technology
allowed winemakers to control fermentation precisely. By this
argument, today's dry wines have a greater claim to authenticity
than the fruity style most people think of as traditional.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``People can misconstrue the move to a dry style as a move away
from the traditional German style, but I don't think that's true,''
said Stephen H. Metzler of Classical Wines in Seattle, which
imports Breuer and other dry rieslings into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because of climate, soil and other conditions, some areas in
Germany, like the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, were always more suited to
making fruity wines than dry wines, Metzler concedes. But he says
that in areas like the Rheingau 90 to 95 percent of all wines made
100 years ago were bone dry. ``This is the way wines were made
until technology gave winemakers more methods of manipulation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others regard this as historical revisionism and wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans were losing market share to dry Italian wines in
the late 1970s and said, `Why can't we make these wines?''' said
Terry Thiese, a leading American importer of German wines. ``First,
they wanted to sell more wines. Then, they came up with historical,
religious and health-oriented justifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the salient fact about the trocken wines is that
most Americans are not used to wines so dry and acidic. And yet,
many restaurants in Germany offer little besides trocken wines,
because that is what Germans say they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to believe that human beings can enjoy shrill, sour,
ugly, dry wines,'' said Thiese, who estimates that trockens make up
20 percent of his sales in the United States. ``I have to believe
that the German market's embrace of these wines has nothing to do
with taste and everything to do with fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the dry wines, like Armin Goering, director of the
German Wine Institute, which promotes German wines at home and
abroad, assert that they are better matches with food than fruity
wines. Others argue for a diversity of wines, especially in a
country with a wide range of cuisines like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a place for trocken wines, and there's a place for
fruity wines, and it depends on what comes out of the kitchen,''
said Rudi Wiest, another leading American importer of German wines.
``I think they're illiterate when it comes to wine and food
pairings over there. They don't have the plethora of styles of food
that we have over here. This pushing of all dry wines, they're
barking up the wrong tree. Even American wines are not bone dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the best dry German rieslings, which are rare because
they are very hard to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defy anyone to sit with a glass of well-made trocken
riesling and say anything negative, but you have to taste through
hundreds of them to find anyone who knows how to do them,'' said
Willie Gluckstern, a wine-and-food consultant, author and
passionate proponent of German rieslings, dry and fruity.
</P>
<P>
   The glory of German riesling rests on a teetering balance of
acidity, alcohol and sweetness. When ripe grapes are picked, their
juice is full of sugar. When they ferment, the sugar is converted
to alcohol. If the fermentation stops before all the sugar is
converted, that residual sugar will sweeten the wine, which will
have less alcohol. If all the sugar is converted to alcohol, the
wine will be completely dry and more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card is acidity. Some residual sugar must remain to
balance the tartness of riesling's naturally high acidity. Yet, if
the residual sugar rises above 9 grams to a liter, by German law
the wine can no longer be branded with the magic word trocken. It
must be called halbtrocken if it has up to 18 grams of residual
sugar, though these wines may still taste bone dry because of their
high acidity.
</P>
<P>
   The tangle of German wine laws present problems to importers,
who recognize the American wine market's aversion to anything but
white wines labeled dry. Gluckstern, for one, plans to bring in
good-quality German wines to sell for under $10, but the
trocken-halbtrocken issue is nettlesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go that dry to make a German white wine that
will appeal to Americans,'' he said. ``The problem with
halbtrocken, though, is if I write `half dry,' it's a death knell.
It means it's sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as some of the greatest Italian wines can only be called
vino da tavola, because they do not adhere to Italian wine rules,
some leading German wine producers like Georg Breuer are choosing
not to play the labeling game, eliminating potentially prestigious
terminology like kabinett and spaetlese in favor of simple vineyard
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the style of my wines,'' Bernhard Breuer said. ``If we
use terms like kabinett and spaetlese, it implies that there are
other sweetness levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Breuer does use terms like auslese, beerenauslese and
eiswein to describe his ultrasweet wines, which he makes in small
quantities, but not his dry wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in trocken wines,'' said Breuer's importer,
Metzler. ``We believe in well-balanced flavorful wines. Trocken has
come to mean mediocre wines, in which the sweetness has been taken
out, exposing its mediocrity.''

SENSES OF DIRECTION &HT;    (Advance for release Thursday)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Say ``Canadian film'' and many people think of an American movie
shot north of the border. So many domestic films and TV series have
been shooting in Canada that it's hard for film crews in the United
States to find work.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians do make movies and have a film industry, even
though it seems like the only Canadian films we've seen here the
last few years have been those from director Atom Egoyan
(``Exotica,'' ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' ``Felicia's Journey'').
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeremy Podeswa, director of the Toronto-shot ``The Five
Senses'' didn't realize how many Canadian films there are.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Toronto Film Festival this year, the programmers looked
at 140 feature films (from Canada), which sort of shocked me, and I
live there,'' Podeswa said in a phone call from Calgary, Alberta.
``Most Americans would see one or maybe two Canadian features in
their cinemas each year. Most Canadians would see only 10 or 15 a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Five Senses'' won best Canadian film at last year's
Toronto festival. It's a low-key but compelling ensemble film about
a variety of people who live or work in a Toronto apartment
building. Some of them know each other, some don't.
</P>
<P>
   The title comes from the five human senses, each represented in
one or more of the characters. Podeswa got the idea from reading
Diane Ackerman's nonfiction book ``A Natural History of the
Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me think about how we take a lot of things in our
lives for granted, including people and relationships,'' the
38-year-old Podeswa said. He thought it was a wonderful starting
point for a movie. ``If you gave that idea to 50 filmmakers, you
would have 50 films that are really interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't want to make a film about the senses. Rather, he
wanted to use the concept to represent the connections and layers
between otherwise unrelated elements of the story _ and to put his
viewers in a thoughtful mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this was a clue that I want you to think about
something else on another level,'' he said. ``There is some design
for this all happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa immediately realized that such a concept could only be a
starting point, not the focus of his film, or it would have become
a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it isn't because I was very conscious of the fact it
could be gimmicky. If I had made it more gimmicky, I would have
changed the title,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very conscious thing on my part to let the characters
and the story take over, so all those other things became subtext.
As you watch the movie you may be thinking a little about the
senses, but as things go on, you start focusing on things that are
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the fact that, although Podeswa's film was
the Toronto festival winner, Egoyan had withdrawn ``Felicia's
Journey'' from the competition. But the assumption that Egoyan, who
has won the award three times before, would have won again may be
wrong. Both films have gotten considerable praise and attention,
but people already expected a lot of Egoyan, especially after his
``The Sweet Hereafter'' was Oscar-nominated for best direction and
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   When Podeswa was making his film, he expected to sell it in
foreign markets but not the United States, since so few Canadian
films show here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I hoped that would happen,'' he said. ``It seemed
like it would happen when we got a standing ovation an Cannes. The
film sold very well internationally. (But) when I was making the
film, I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that one of leading actors in his excellent cast
is American Mary-Louise Parker (``Fried Green Tomatoes''). She
plays a baker who creates lavish cakes that taste awful. She's
having a fling with a visiting Italian who seems crazy about her,
but because of her own insecurities, she keeps interpreting
everything he does as suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such a hard time casting that role in Canada,'' Podeswa
said. ``That role requires vulnerability, but also prickliness,
irony, and sexiness and humor and sensitivity. It's a really hard
package to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always loved her from (her) movies I'd seen. I felt really
lucky when she came on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa readily acknowledges superficial similarities between
the films of Egoyan _ who is a friend of his _ and his own movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both look at film as a form of personal expression,'' he
said. ``We think of film in the same way we would think of
song-writing or novel-writing. We are trying not to be aware of the
whole thing as an industrial complex. All of our films reflect who
we are as people and what our preoccupations are.''
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa doesn't mind being compared to Egoyan _ ``I think Atom
is a brilliant filmmaker'' _ but he says it's a mistake to assume
they represent some sort of widespread Canadian film sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a lot of kinds of movies,'' he said. (In the United
States) you've got a skewed perspective. You get such a tiny
fraction of what Canadian movies are, and you tend to see the art
cinema.``

   BILINGUAL-AMERICA _ BOSTON _ This summer, three former

were forced to speak English instead of Spanish by their managers.
As immigrants from non-English-speaking countries flow into the
United States, businesses and institutions increasingly face a
foreign-language test: How best to cope with new workers and new
customers whose first language is not English. The notion of
English as the sole language of American business and political
life is being challenged, swamped by new demographic and market
realities. The demand for translators and translation services has
soared. Hispanics spent about $380 billion last year on products
and services, up 84 percent since 1990. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers

   GRAPES _ BOONVILLE, N.C. - In the four decades he's grown
tobacco, Frank Hopson never worried about the rising and setting of
the sun. ``Tobacco's a weed,'' and will grow just about anywhere,
he always figured. But now one of a fast growing number of North
Carolina farmers growing grapes to supply area vineyards,
57-year-old Hopson has learned to pay attention to sunshine and
other considerations critical to growing sweet, firm grapes. The
payoff? A crop that agricultural experts say won't replace North
Carolina's embattled, nearly billion-dollar-a-year crop, but one
that is acre for acre as profitable as tobacco.

   SOUTHERN-TOBACCO _ LEXINGTON, Ky. _ Southern tobacco farmers are

and South Carolina farm 90 percent of the domestic crop. But a $145
billion anti-tobacco verdict in Florida has many wondering whether
this is the straw that's broken Joe Camel's back. Will they turn to
catfish farms and grape vineyards or car sales? We check and see.

thousands of Russians, bored or disenchanted with traditional

farmer. That the election took place in China is a sign to some -
especially those at the Carter Center, who are working with China
on standardizing village elections _ that this communist country is
on a slow but steady course towards democracy. To others, village
elections are but a cynical gambit by the central leadership to

culminate 16 years later in a punishing U.S. Tax Court ruling that
found UPS had committed a ``sham transaction.'' As a result, the
company may now be forced to pay the IRS one of the largest bills

   The New York Times News Service is planning full coverage _
text, graphics and photos _ of the Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles from Aug. 14 to Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   A biographical series on Vice President Al Gore, written by
Melinda Henneberger, has been filed during the last two months, and
the stories are available for retransmission. The slugs are:
GORE-BIO, GORE-BIO-COLLEGE and GORE-MILITARY; abridged versions and
photos are also available. For repeats, call 212-556-1927.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editors plan several pages of stories for
each day of the convention. The News Service will list these
stories on a daily convention budget (BC-DEM-BUDGET-NYT), which
will include all Times stories and will also spotlight stories from
Times partner and regional newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   --Early coverage will include a poll/profile of the convention
delegates by Adam Nagourney, comparing them to the general public
and to the GOP delegates, and a look at the Democratic platform.
</P>
<P>
   --Daily stories are scheduled to include: a convention ledeall
by Richard L. Berke (DEM-RDP-NYT), an analysis by R.W. Apple Jr.
(DEM-ASSESS-NYT), a convention diary column by Matthew Purdy and
Alex Kuczynski (DEM-DAIRY-NYT), a television critic's notebook by
Caryn James (DEM-TV-NOTEBOOK-NYT), the view from TV and the Web by
Rick Lyman (DEM-POLITICAL-SURFING-NYT), how successfully the
message is communicated by Peter Marks (DEM-MESSAGE-NYT), stories
on Hillary Clinton by Adam Nagourney, profiles of the speakers and
editorial columns from Times writers on political developments and
issues.
</P>
<P>
   --Plans for other stories include scene, color and insight
pieces on health care, taxes and the economy by New York Times
political writers Robin Toner, Todd S. Purdum, James Sterngold,
Adam Clymer and Kevin Sack, among others.
</P>
<P>
   --For Wednesday: a profile and assessment of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman's acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   --For Thursday: a Man in the News profile of Vice President Al
Gore by Melinda Henneberger and Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   --For Friday: a deconstruction of Gore's acceptance speech.

RECENT VIDEO RELEASES (Advance for release Thursday) &HT;    By BRUCE WESTBROOK
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games''
</P>
<P>
   If Ehren Kruger doesn't watch it, he may go quickly from hot new
screenwriter to one more cold nose pressed against the Hollywood
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' was a potent enough thriller, but he brought
no invention to ``Scream 3,'' and his ``Reindeer Games'' is among
the most ludicrous scripts of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't help that star Ben Affleck is miscast.
Clean-cut, good-guy Ben as a convict who grapples with violent
thugs upon his release from prison? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   The setup _ which could only occur in a movie _ has Affleck
assuming the identity of his former cellmate, hooking up with a
lovely lass (Charlize Theron) who had written love letters to the
guy without ever demanding a photo.
</P>
<P>
   Things get ugly when her brother (Gary Sinise) and his gang pop
up, insisting that Affleck help them rob a remote casino where his
cellmate had worked.
</P>
<P>
   It's never clear why Affleck's supposed knowledge is so vital,
or why a scarily murderous Sinise doesn't kill him on several
occasions. Chalk it up to hopeless contrivance.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran director John Frankenheimer still handles action well
enough (albeit in a painful, brutal way), but characters and nuance
seem beyond him. ``Reindeer Games'' is as messy as its low-rent
robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically a stupid story about stupid people doing stupid
things _ sort of like ``A Simple Plan,'' but without the grounded
sense of drama. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
2000, R, Dimension, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.99

<P>
   ``Dragonheart: A New Beginning''
</P>
<P>
   This effective and affecting movie is being released directly to
video as a sequel to 1996's ``Dragonheart,'' which starred Dennis
Quaid and had Sean Connery as the voice of its dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero here is a young stable boy (Chris Masterson of
``Malcolm in the Middle'') who dreams of being a knight, then gets
a shot when he discovers a young dragon (voiced by Robby Benson)
hidden in a monastery. ``E.T.''-style, they become pals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they're embroiled in a castle intrigue involving a
power-grabbing aide to a doddering king.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in Slovakia, the film has a fine sense of exotic detail,
apart from overly obvious shots of models standing in for distant
castles.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled with snow flurries, some scenes have an enchanting
sense of lighthearted magic. The action is spirited and colorful,
thanks to crisp swordplay, flashy martial arts (an Asian sage and
his spunky daughter appear) and fine computer-animated dragon
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Masterson is likably earnest without seeming naive, and his
allies make an eccentric and charming good-guy band. Harry Van
Gorkum also has wicked fun with the villain, Osiro.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, not too much hinges on the beast _ unlike, say, in
``Godzilla.'' This is a solid family film without constant
bombardments of monstrous stunts. If anything, the dragon is a bit
too boyishly humanized and ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``A New Beginning'' is a satisfying youth-oriented
adventure, and it's often graced by Randy Edelman's stirring
musical theme from the first film. &QL; 
Grade: B &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 2000, PG, Universal, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.98
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on Earth''
</P>
<P>
   This chick flick didn't click, earning just $10 million in
theaters. Although video can be kinder to intimate stories, don't
count on it: Big screen or small, ``Here on Earth'' is a wretchedly
written mound of mush.
</P>
<P>
   Utterly predictable, it welds a romantic triangle onto the
socioeconomic chasms of ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   It's set in a picturesque small town where residents have a
pathological hatred for elitist boys at a nearby prep school.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-cultural dating (the horror!) occurs when an arrogant
preppie (Chris Klein) romances a waitress (Leelee Sobieski).
</P>
<P>
   She seems sweet, but she is driven by lust. With one look at
Klein's pecs, she ditches her loyal farm-boy beau (Josh Hartnett),
whose only sin is having a bad-hair year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden love, of course, is that most enticing of young loves,
and the road gets even rockier _ for both the lovers and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are fine young actors. They just deserve a better
script.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the music swells or rain drenches our lovers in a
dripping embrace, we want to buy into this _ to revel in the sweet
ache of an emotional wallow.
</P>
<P>
   But when Klein quotes a Robert Frost poem that happens to be
Sobieski's favorite, we stop trusting him _ and the movie, which is
a slick but hollow entertainment masquerading as romantic
profundity. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
2000, PG-13, Fox, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $34.98

<P>
   Due next week: ``The Naked Gun'' and ``Planet of the Apes''

Rules.''

   Nanny bonanza
</P>
<P>
   If your favorite things include Julie Andrews nanny movies,
you're in luck.
</P>
<P>
   New in stores is a ``Gold Collection'' edition of ``Mary
Poppins'' ($22.99 on VHS, $29.99 on DVD). Due Aug. 29 is a
35th-anniversary edition of ``The Sound of Music'' ($14.98 on tape,
$29.98 on disc).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Poppins'' has been on tape since the '80s and even had an
earlier DVD release. But the new ``Sound of Music'' is big news.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the beloved film's debut on the booming DVD market.
Also, Fox is loading its two-disc sets with more than six hours of
bonus material, much of it never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Poppins'' has far fewer spoonfuls of sugar. Its first DVD
had zero extras, and this one adds only a few, including
``Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere,'' a 10-minute featurette made
for theaters in 1964 to document the film's bow. (This also appears
on VHS.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also a 16-minute documentary, ``The Making of `Mary
Poppins,''' hosted by star Dick Van Dyke.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't new. ``Making of'' was produced for a previous VHS
edition in 1997. Oddly, ``Poppins''' new tapes don't have the
featurette.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to see fresh young stars of the era make their
glittering arrivals, from Mary Tyler Moore and ``enchanting Angie
Dickinson'' to ``Poppins''' Andrews _ beaming and wrapped in fur _
and Van Dyke, joined by his wife and kids.
</P>
<P>
   Other extras for DVD: a 16-question trivia game and a theatrical
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Poppins'' is shown in wide-screen, with a 1.85-to-1
aspect ratio on DVD. As for the transfer, it looks exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   If you already own the film on tape or disc, Disney feels your
pain. The studio is offering a $5 ``upgrade'' rebate when you send
in the proof-of-purchase tab or UPC symbol from your original copy.

ROCK 'N' ROACH 'N' RAGE &HT;    By MICHAEL D. CLARK
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Papa Roach is the hardest-working band I've been associated
with. They will be signed. It's just a matter of where and when.''
_ Gary Avila, Papa Roach manager, July 1999
</P>
<P>
   It's been a little more than a year since rock-rappers Papa
Roach played Big Shots pool hall in tiny Roseville, Calif., just
north of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The group was late for the sound-check because the van broke
down on a stretch of nowhere interstate in California's central
valley. Manager Gary Avila was still shopping for a record deal,
and until then there would be little money to fix the road beast
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Roach couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   The van was coughing, but now parked in the strip-mall lot that
housed the billiard room. But they had made the gig. A group of 500
high school and college-age kids were lined up outside waiting for
the doors to open, and several commuters had waved and honked at
the band while it was broken down on the freeway shoulder earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Roach had been recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really thought about it, but we are a successful
local band,'' said lead singer Coby Dick that day, with a sneering
smile much like Dennis Quaid's. ``That's so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Jerry Horton offered Dick a little perspective on this
new-found pride, ``Yeah, we're a successful local band with a
broken-down van.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple hours later Dick was jumping around in Big Shots' back
room, priming himself for the night's packed-house show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limp Bizkit and those others started the party,'' he crowed,
beating on his chest for emphasis. ``We're here to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Papa Roach was playing side stages at radio
festivals. Now, behind the million-selling major-label debut
``Infest,'' the band can headline club shows and hold its own
opening for a band like Korn.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Roach is now a band in demand by late-night talk shows and
video music programs. A band that doesn't travel in beat-up vans or
play pool halls anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Avila's old California pager is now disconnected, but his home
number still works.
</P>
<P>
   A family member informs a caller that he is in Los Angeles with
P Roach (what the die-hards have called the band since it formed in
1993) on the set of the new video for ``Broken Home.'' It's the
second single from the DreamWorks-backed ``Infest.``
</P>
<P>
   Following a triumphant salutation from radio audiences with its
first single, ``Last Resort'' earlier this summer, ``Infest'' has
spent its entire shelf life on the Billboard charts, peaking as
high as No. 5. After 14 weeks it's only dropped a notch to No. 6.
That's eight places above Kid Rock's latest, ``The History of
Rock'' ( No. 14), and 36 notches above celebrated Sacramento peers
the Deftones.
</P>
<P>
   Both those highly anticipated summer releases were put out after
``Infest.''
</P>
<P>
   Avila remembers the night back at Big Shots and generously takes
the time away from the video crew to chat. He says interviews with
the band are no problem: They just have to be worked around the
current tour.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and it can't be on the day that the band is flying to New
York to play ``The Late Show With David Letterman'' or attending
the MTV Video Awards. The band is nominated for best new artist
against Sisqo, Pink, Macy Gray and Christina Aguilera. Dick readily
admits he doesn't figure P Roach will win, but the group will
perform for the broadcast, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A couple more obstacles: Talks are ongoing about a fall tour
with Limp Bizkit and Eminem, all of which takes time to hammer out.
And discussions about what P Roach song will be included on the new
extreme-sports video game ``Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.'' Those
meetings will have to be worked around, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going crazy right now,'' Avila says. ``It's crazy
in a good way. When the band goes on tour, I'm going to move from
Sacramento to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer Dick, 24, has no plans to move anywhere other than to a
better apartment in Sacramento. After years of living in a
run-down, low-rent square in a bad part of town, he says he plans
to head home and ``get my lady out of the ghetto.'' That could be a
while: The last time he spent any time there was last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dick has no other life changes in mind. He plans to remain as
crazy and erratic as he always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before a show we all get in a huddle and say, `Everybody hates
us,'`` he says. ``We make ourselves believe that we're hated, and
then we just hit the stage and kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Papa Roach started slaying with its music right around the time
of that Big Shots' gig last summer. The group had just been granted
a demo deal with Warner Bros. in which the band got funding to cut
a few tracks for label consideration. In return, Warner Bros. got
the first option to sign the band.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner Bros. passed, opening the door for DreamWorks. P
Roach signed to the label late last year under a deal that gives
the band enough freedom to continue to rage as they did while
cutting self-financed demo tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still bringing it, only now it's with a DreamWorks
tag,'' Dick says. ``They're letting us be who we want to be, and we
have a lot of creative control.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks must have recognized that P Roach's combination of
rock, rage and rhymes is perfectly timed. Starting with Rage
Against the Machine and culminating in several summers of the Korn
and Limp Bizket-led Family Values tours, rock 'n' rap is rivaled
only by shiny Brit-Sync pop as the dominant rhythm of radio.
</P>
<P>
   Dick's gruff megaphone growls can stretch from the fierce
punishing indictments of Henry Rollins to the confessional
philosophizing of Bush's Gavin Rossdale. Song titles from Infest
are a cross between scarred psyche nightmares (``Snakes,''
``Between Angels and Insects'') and a slightly altered version of
the seven deadly sins (``Binge,'' ``Never Enough``).
</P>
<P>
   Dick splits time in most songs between singing and rapping, and
buffers it with Horton's lipstick metal guitar squelches. Tobin
Esperance's sludge bass and drummer David Buckner's pounding
tom-tom blows enhance the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike rap-heavy peers like Korn, P Roach is more democratic in
its use of rock 'n' rap to create a contrast on songs like ``Last
Resort'' and highlight track ``Between Angels and Insects.``
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice blend, but what will put this group over the top is
the ability to rapture with a metal ballad like ``Broken Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick appears to sense the importance of ``Broken Home.'' He
describes the video as a simulated look at a family gone nuclear,
with P Roach providing the soundtrack. It's clearly very personal
to the singer because it refers to his own life. Reminders of that
day back at the pool hall in Roseville, the van that barely got P
Roach to the venue and the local die-hards waiting to see the band
has silenced Dick for a rare moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I have not had one minute to look back lately,'' he
says. ``Not long ago Mike Bordin (drummer for Faith No More) told
me to not look back _ don't even worry about reflecting, just keep
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His comedown was over quickly, replaced by the vociferous
rapid-speak that is his norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do look at it, but how do you take it all in? It's all a
shock,'' Dick says. ``But we'll stick around for a long time. We
don't want to be a one-hit wonder and quit.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Limp Bizkit and those others started the party,
but P Roach is here to finish it.

CAMP SONG MEMORIES REKINDLED ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Please note that tilde in parentheses has been used in the

 By GARY KIRKLAND   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ There is something about camp songs that
makes them stick like a toasted marshallow in your memory.
</P>
<P>
   They are the sort of tunes thate come in handy in fighting
boredom on the road during family vacations, or as a method of
fighting drowsiness on long distance solo drives.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, Sarah Portier, a 20-year-old University of
Florida junior majoring in aerospace engineering, has camp songs
kicking around in the back of her head. But she is not content to
leave them there.
</P>
<P>
   Portier, who compiled songs during a dozen years in the Girl
Scouts, has posted them on the Web at
www.afn.org/(TILDE)afn26527/songindex.html. The site now has nearly
80 songs, and she said she has about 10 more to add.
</P>
<P>
   She said ``Father Abraham,'' a song that incorporates lots of
choreography, as well as vocals, was likely the first camp song she
learned. ``My Brownie troop was crazy about that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs borrow their tunes from old standards and
substitute new lyrics. Like the classic ``Pink Pajamas'' sung to
the tune of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   I wear my pink pajamas in the summer when it's hot.
</P>
<P>
   I wear my flannel nightie in the winter when it's not.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes in the springtime, and sometimes in the fall,
</P>
<P>
   I jump right in between the sheets with nothing on at all.
</P>
<P>
   Glory, glory hallelujah! Glory, glory, what's it to ya, balmy
breezes blowing through ya with nothing on at all!
</P>
<P>
   That song highlights one of the drawbacks of camp songs. Once
the alternative version is planted in memory, it can make it
difficult to take the original seriously, Portier said.
</P>
<P>
   There are songs, with lyrics that are incredibly silly, but are
too much fun to sing to pass up. In that category she includes
``McKinney and McCormick'' sung in two parts, one part handling the
melody to the tune of ``The Irish Washerwoman'' (a sample of it is
on the Web at www.acronet.net/(TILDE)robokopp/eire/irishwas.mid).
The second part, playing the role of human bagpipes, sings
``A-wang, A-wang'' in drone like fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, McKinney is dead and McCormick don't know it,
</P>
<P>
   McCormick is dead and McKinney don't know it,
</P>
<P>
   They're both lying dead, dead in their beds.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one knows that the other one's dead.
</P>
<P>
   (then the parts switch)
</P>
<P>
   Portier said singing was usually done when walking in groups
between activities or when waiting in line to eat. ``We sang all
the time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she remembered the songs more than the camping,
she said the two go together _ the songs spark the memories.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few songs scattered in her collection that carry an
emotional wallop. The song ``Say When,'' frequently sung around a
final campfire, tells of saying goodbye. It can be a tough one to
sing with dry eyes. Or ``On My Honor,'' the song sung during the
ceremony when Brownies ``fly up'' to become Junior Girl Scouts,
Portier said, gets her every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tucked away a song or two, if you're feeling low there's
one for you,'' she said, quoting the lyrics.

 &HT;    Lieberman choice may herald decline in anti-Semitism
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night in 1970, when Sam Massell was running for mayor of
Atlanta, he awoke to see a cross burning in his yard.
</P>
<P>
   Massell, undaunted, went on to win his race and serve as
Atlanta's only Jewish mayor. He says now that anti-Semitism wasn't
a major problem in Atlanta then, and it's even less of one today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think conditions have improved dramatically, not just on the
surface, but in true understanding and respect for one's fellow
man,'' Massell says.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for such optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have tapped a Jew, Sen. Joseph Lieberman
(D-Conn.), as their vice presidential candidate. And that gives
credence to polls by the Anti-Defamation League that show a long
decline in anti-Semitism. The percentage of strongly anti-Semitic
Americans dropped from 29 in 1964 to 12 in 1998. ``Things are
getting better,'' declares Jay Kaiman, Southeast director of the
ADL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm right, but I don't see that much anti-Semitism in
the country,'' says Deborah Lipstadt, a Jewish historian at Emory
University. ``I think people have just come a long way. I'm not
naive enough to think it's all gone away, but I still think it's a
whole lot better than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even as the ADL releases hopeful polling data, it
continues to collect thousands of reports of anti-Semitic acts each
year, such as desecrations of synagogues, and to track hundreds of
hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   And even in 2000, many Jews _ long accustomed to blending in to
make themselves less likely targets of bigotry _ remain concerned
that their profile may be raised to uncomfortable levels by the
Lieberman nomination, says Barbara Babbitt-Kaufman, an owner of
Longstreet Press in Atlanta and an active member of the Jewish
community.
</P>
<P>
   This year Babbitt-Kaufman's company published ``The Jewish
Phenomenon'' by Steven Silbiger, which trumpets the successes of
American Jews. The book notes, for example, that one-third of all
American multimillionaires are Jewish, and that 20 percent of
professors at leading universities are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very controversial,'' she says. ``Some wanted to scream
out the pride in what the Jews have accomplished. And others felt
it was better to keep it a secret among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Hirsch, a 67-year-old Atlanta architect, came to
Atlanta as a child just before his family was arrested by Hitler's
Gestapo. He's writing a book on what it was like growing up Jewish
in Atlanta in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always in fistfights, several times a week until I was
16, about some anti-Semitic comment,'' Hirsch says. One gentile
eventually came to his aid. ``Then this big guy named Whitey
Kugler, who later died in a jet crash, decided to take up for me.
He just says, `Anybody who wants a piece of Ben has to come through
me first.'''
</P>
<P>
   Things have improved since then, he says. ``Now I would say most
anti-Semitism in Atlanta is more or less low key. But I can tell,
it's still there. Sometimes you hear jokes. And people look at me
funny because I wear a beret for religious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Alfred Uhry, 63, experienced anti-Semitism while
growing up in Atlanta. ``Sometimes, I'd be called `a dirty Jew,'''
he says. For the most part, though, his childhood was pleasant, and
when he depicted the lynching of Jewish factory manager Leo Frank
in the musical ``Parade,'' he made clear that the mob was not
originally motivated by anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was hanged because he was Jewish,'' Uhry
says. ``What people in Georgia feared and hated in 1915 was Yankees
and bosses. And Frank was a Yankee boss. I think his Jewishness was
secondary until a lot of anti-Semitism was whipped up. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has always been, though less now, motivated by
deeply Christian beliefs, people who see Jews as the killers of
Christ. And that can be whipped up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews have lived in Georgia since 42 arrived at Savannah in 1733,
six months after James Oglethorpe landed. Jews fought with American
troops in the Revolution and every war since. Many Jews served in
the Confederate Army, and at least four Union generals were Jewish.
Judah Benjamin, a Jewish lawyer, was Jefferson Davis' chief
adviser. After the war, many, like the Rich family of Atlanta,
became prominent in business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jews had to look over their shoulders. It's worth noting,
Uhry says, that a statue of Tom Watson, a virulent racist whose
rhetoric incited the Marietta lynch mob, still stands on the
grounds of the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Now, reaction to the Lieberman nomination may show whether the
optimists are right, and the most hateful anti-Semites really have
been marginalized, as the ADL poll seems to say.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Philip Self, assistant pastor at Johnson Ferry Baptist
Church, is hopeful. ``Maybe I'm just sheltered,'' he says. ``I find
it incredible the percentage could be as high as 12 percent. I
can't fathom that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a twist of historic irony, one group with lingering
anti-Semitism is African-Americans, according to the ADL poll. A
generation ago, Jews were blacks' strongest allies on civil rights.
But in 1998, fully 34 percent of blacks harbored anti-Semitic
attitudes, according to the poll, compared with 9 percent of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   The finding rankles some blacks. The Rev. William Sheals, of
predominantly black Hopewell Baptist Church in Norcross, says the
people he knows are not bigoted. ``That is an absolutely false
reading,'' he says of the ADL statistics on African-Americans. ``I
pray a man's religion doesn't become a big issue in this
presidential race.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that showed high levels of anti-Semitism: those
with high school or less education, 43 percent, and those age 65
and up, 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another cautionary finding: Overall, though just 12 percent of
Americans indicated strong anti-Semitism, another 35 percent fell
in a middle range, indicating possible prejudice. And all the
numbers may be overly optimistic, the ADL's Kaiman says, because
people tend to understate bigotry in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Emory's Lipstadt, who in April won a decisive triumph over
British writer David Irving, who had sued her over her portrayal of
him in a book, says strong reactions to the Lieberman announcement
show that some level of prejudice remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say I'm struck by the fact that so many people are so
excited about this,'' she says. ``It says we haven't come as far as
we thought. This should be a ho-hum matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are very excited, in the sense that it's a final barrier.
So many thought it was a given he wouldn't be chosen because he's a
Jew. I was excited when I heard, and very pleased, but also annoyed
that I was pleased. This should really be no news.''

 &HT;    Black colleges say crime figure are misleading
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _For the most part, black colleges have been the victims
of their environments _ when it comes to crime.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Atlanta University Center. With six separate colleges,
the AUC is known in some circles as the mecca of black education.
But it is also located in Atlanta's West End, which boasts one of
the city's highest crime rates and has the highest concentration of
public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Atlanta University) was founded in 1865, where were we
going to put it?'' said A.J. White, director of public safety at
Clark Atlanta University. ``We have to embrace the community.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to brainstorm on how colleges can better work with
communities, White has invited law enforcement officials from black
colleges to Atlanta for a conference designed to share ideas about
ways to make their campuses safer. The conference is being held
through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   David Bergeron, chief of policy and budget for the U.S.
Department of Education, said no data exists that shows
historically black colleges as being more dangerous than white
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that campus security has been a concern for many years
at black schools,'' said Bergeron. ``There is now a perception that
they are not safe, but I think one of the things the data will show
is that perception isn't rooted on fact.'' The idea for the
conference was born last November when a crime report predicted the
risk of becoming a victim of violent crime in neighborhoods
surrounding U.S. universities. It listed the west Atlanta community
that borders the AUC as the country's most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Brown College topped a list of 25 schools. LeMoyne-Owens
College in Memphis earned the No. 2 spot, followed by Spelman
College, CAU and Morehouse College. All five are black schools, as
are the neighborhoods they are in.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State and Georgia Tech ranked 13th and 19th,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But AUC officials called the report unfair and misleading,
because it did not consider actual crimes that took place on the
college campuses, or crimes that involve students who lived within
those campuses.
</P>
<P>
   White said CAU has a large and visible police presence on campus
and that most of the crimes committed on campus involve burglaries,
particularly car break-ins. Steve Bowser, director of public safety
at Spelman, there are about 150 officers, security guards and staff
working for the six campuses that make up the AUC. In Zone I, where
the schools are located, there are only 123 Atlanta Police officers
assigned to the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Current crime statistics for the immediate area surrounding the
AUC were not available, but a homicide study showed that between
1990 and 1999, there were 189 murders in that area. Comparatively,
there were 227 murders near Tech and 37 near Georgia State.
</P>
<P>
   White said CAU is working with the community to institute a
greater community policing presence. Beginning this semester,
students will be enlisted as sentinels to report crimes that occur
on or around campus. They will not intervene or get involved with
apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty safe campus,'' said White, who came to CAU
two years ago. ``We have had no rapes. No murders. Last year, we
had a guy in the dorm who tried to fondle a student and we had him
within five minutes.''

FIRSTENERGY TO ACQUIRE GPU IN $4.5 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., N.J.)   By NEELA BANERJEE with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FirstEnergy Corp., an Ohio-based utility company, agreed Tuesday
to acquire GPU Inc. of Morristown, N.J., for $4.5 billion in cash
and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would make FirstEnergy the sixth-largest energy
concern in the United States, based on customers served. Its
increased size and scale would also give it the potential to
produce and distribute electricity more efficiently, industry
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, approved by the board of directors of both companies,
could save the companies $150 million the first year, a FirstEnergy
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   FirstEnergy is based in Akron, Ohio, and primarily serves the
Cleveland, Akron and Toledo markets and western Pennsylvania. Best
known for its past ownership of the Three Mile Island nuclear
plant, GPU provides power to central and coastal New Jersey, as
well as the northwestern part of the state and eastern and central
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The merger allows FirstEnergy, which generates electricity,
operates a transmission grid and services clients, to double its
customer base to about 4.3 million and to establish itself firmly
on the East Coast. GPU, for its part, would receive a significant
premium on its equity as part of the deal. FirstEnergy is offering
$36.50 for each share of GPU common stock, which rose 75 cents
Tuesday, to $31.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of FirstEnergy closed down 0.3 percent, or 6.25 cents, to
$25.3125 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   GPU, has which divested itself of nearly all its power plants,
would have access to FirstEnergy's power generation and would also
be able to buy power more cheaply as part of a bigger company,
changes that could translate into lower rates for its current
customers in western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Together with last week's announcement of a union between FPL
Group of Florida and Entergy, based in New Orleans, the FirstEnergy
acquisition may signal the start of another round of consolidation
in the electric utility industry, which was reshaped last year by
more than two dozen mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices of many utilities have risen substantially since
the start of the year, increasing the temptation for management to
find buyers for their companies. Utilities also realize that in the
wake of last year's mergers, bigger companies have more
opportunities to cut costs, to market their electricity more
aggressively and to negotiate better deals for the purchase of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be big to implement the most efficiencies and
have the economies of scale,'' said Barry M. Abramson, senior
utility analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates in New Jersey expressed guarded optimism over
the sale of GPU. Blossom Peretz, the ratepayer advocate for the
State of New Jersey, a position appointed by the governor, said
rates charged by GPU and other New Jersey utilities were relatively
high, but that GPU had built a solid reputation as a company that
cooperates with customers and regulators. The state ratepayer's
office said it wanted to find out if GPU would be able to buy
cheaper energy as part of a larger company with better purchasing
power. Peretz also said her office expected FirstEnergy to share
with its customers any savings made from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also concerned that none of the merger related costs go
to ratepayers,'' Peretz said, ``and that there be no rate shocks
due to the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The market, however, had a negative reaction to the deal. When
word of a possible acquisition leaked out Monday, most analysts
downgraded their ratings of FirstEnergy, citing the burdens the
company will have to take on in purchasing GPU. Both companies are
growing at a rate of 4 percent to 5 percent a year, lagging behind
other utilities that show double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
   FirstEnergy, which has no current debt on the parent company
level, will have to incur debt to make the acquisition. ``Financing
for the cash portion of the transaction is going to come from a
combination of public debt and bank financing,'' said Richard
Marsh, the chief financial officer of FirstEnergy, during a
conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, FirstEnergy will assume GPU's $7.4 billion in debt,
which the latter racked up through a series of overseas investments
that are faltering.
</P>
<P>
   GPU entered the retail energy field in Australia at the height
of the market, but sold its venture recently for a loss. It also
bought into the British market at a time when industry observers
felt that utilities would be hit by a rate cut _ which is what
happened. And GPU sold its generation business before power
generators began making hefty profits because of high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Because it shed most of its generation capacity, GPU is also
short of power in Pennsylvania, a gap that FirstEnergy, whose own
capacity is stretched in summer, will have to address. Analysts
also said that the merger process would keep FirstEnergy tied up
for 12 months, which could stall other projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a lot of strategic value to it,'' said Andrew
Levi, senior utilities analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston,
which downgraded FirstEnergy from ``strong buy'' to ``hold'' on
Monday. ``It doesn't create anything but a big company that can cut
some costs.''

ANALYSIS: AFTER THE BOUNCE, DOES THE V.P. REALLY MATTER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-LIEBERMAN, GORE-SELECTION) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut as his running mate on Monday, the frenzy of
speculation that preceded it and the outpouring of analysis that
has followed it raise a number of insistent questions.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, do such selections ever decide presidential
elections? Do they make any difference at all, either to the
national popular vote or in individual states? Or are they merely
something to keep politicians and journalists busy, now that the
nominating races end so soon and conventions decide almost nothing?
</P>
<P>
   The candidate making the choice usually gets an uptick in the
polls after it becomes known. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
benefited from the customary ``bounce'' after he chose Dick Cheney,
and Gore closed the gap with Bush after choosing Lieberman, at
least according to an overnight USA Today/CNN/Gallup survey.
</P>
<P>
   But such changes are almost always transient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think political scientists pretty much agree that in the
long run, in November, these choices have very little impact,''
said Paul C. Light of the Brookings Institution, a student of the
vice presidency. ``Maybe you pick up half a percentage point, or
even a whole one, with a good selection and lose about the same
with a bad one. But that isn't often enough to swing an election
one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say, of course, that selecting a running mate has
no meaning. Since World War II, five vice presidents have moved
into the Oval Office _ Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon,
Gerald Ford and George Bush. Two have been nominated for president,
only to lose in November _ Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the debate about whom to choose usually centers not
on the capacity of the prospective choice to serve as president, an
issue of transcendent significance, but on his or her capacity to
improve the performance of the ticket at the polls, an issue of
considerably less importance.
</P>
<P>
   George McGovern's choice of Sen. Tom Eagleton of Missouri in
1972 wrought no real damage, even though Eagleton was dropped from
the Democratic ticket after it emerged that he had been treated for
mental illness. George Bush's choice of Dan Quayle in 1988, viewed
in hindsight by most politicians as a major gaffe, did no
overwhelming harm to the Republican cause. But exit polls
nonetheless suggested that Quayle was a distinct liability,
especially when compared with the Democratic vice-presidential
nominee, Lloyd M. Bentsen. Quayle may have cost the Republicans as
much as 4 percentage points, which could have proved decisive in a
closer race.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, presidential nominees often chose running mates
to appeal to swing states or to sections of the country where their
own appeal was weak. The most successful example of that in the
modern era, it is often said, was John F. Kennedy's selection of
Johnson in 1960, because Texas then voted Democratic. But that view
is challenged by revisionist historians.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy-Johnson ticket, like the pairing of Adlai E.
Stevenson and Estes Kefauver on the unsuccessful 1956 Democratic
ticket, was an attempt to provide not only geographical balance but
also ideological balance. In choosing Quayle, Bush sought something
else: generational balance.
</P>
<P>
   But those modes of selection have gone out of style in more
recent elections. Warren Christopher, the former secretary of
state, who conducted the vice-presidential searches for Clinton and
Gore, said in an interview earlier this summer that the Clinton
choice put a new emphasis on the personal relationship between the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can assemble all the material and do all the studies of
voting records and statements,'' Christopher said. ``But in the
final analysis, chemistry weighs very heavily. Between the two
candidates, compatibility is very important and, I think,
increasingly important as the vice president's role as an adviser
becomes more important.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton chose Gore, a man from the same part of the
country as he _ indeed, from an adjacent state _ and from the same
part of the ideological spectrum. This year, the two vice
presidential candidates come from states with relatively few
electoral votes _ Cheney from Wyoming and Lieberman from
Connecticut _ and both candidates are close ideological fits to the
men who picked them.
</P>
<P>
   Both selections provided a kind of inoculation. Cheney, well
seasoned in government, lent the inexperienced Texas governor some
needed weight. Lieberman, a politician known for his independence
and for his criticism of Clinton's sexual peccadilloes, lent Gore
some cover from those who think he has marched in lock step with
Clinton, regardless of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People suspect vice presidents,'' said Light. ``Remember
Hubert? He was seen as Johnson's captive until he showed his mettle
in the speech in Salt Lake City where he broke free on Vietnam. It
came too late to save him. Well, I think that Lieberman could be
Gore's Salt Lake City, but earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice-presidential nominees used to be chosen at conventions; in
the days, ending about a quarter century ago, when conventions
rather than primaries chose the presidential nominees, it was
considered poor form to talk about running mates until your own
nomination was official. The first breach in tradition came in
1976, when Ronald Reagan, seeking to halt Ford's march toward the
Republican nomination and to dampen talk that Reagan was too
conservative to win, stipulated before the convention that if
nominated he would choose Sen. Richard S. Schweiker of
Pennsylvania, a moderate, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   He never got the chance. Ford was nominated after all. But in
1984, Mondale, hoping to get voters to give him a second look,
despite Reagan's popularity, chose Geraldine Ferraro before the
convention and promptly announced the choice _ a dramatic one,
because she was the first woman on a major national ticket. Yet the
race quickly regained its equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a running mate has been a kind of litmus test of
judgment for many years, because it is always the first major
decision a nominee makes. But now that early selection has become
the pattern, the choice seems to have gained additional importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewed narrowly, it is still not decisive at the ballot box,''
said professor Michael Nelson of Rhodes College in Memphis, another
vice-presidential scholar. ``But now that it comes on the eve of
the convention, the selection of a running mate shapes the media
coverage of the candidate and his party. They go in upbeat or
downbeat, with the delegates energized or enervated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can carry over into the campaign in an important way. It
did for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Another element has changed. The new system gives a presidential
nominee plenty of time to vet, and then to carefully consider, the
possibilities before him. In the old days, the choice was often
made late at night, in a hurry, by ad hoc groups of insiders _
``BOGSAT,'' as the political consultant Douglas Bailey once termed
them, a ``bunch of guys sitting around a table.''

BOND PRICES RISE AFTER PRODUCTIVITY REPORT EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices rose on Tuesday after a
better-than-expected government report on productivity and labor
costs and a good start to the Treasury's quarterly debt sales.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity report increased optimism that the Federal
Reserve will leave rates alone when its policy makers meet on Aug.
22. The fresh supply of government debt kept an early cap on the
day's gains, but good results helped lift prices later to session
highs. The Treasury sold $10 billion of 5-year notes and plans to
auction $10 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $5 billion of
30-year bonds on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Solid auction results on the 5-year maturity renewed interest in
other Treasuries as investors bought the issue at a
better-than-expected 6.060 percent yield. The number of bids
exceeded the size of the issue by a ratio of 3.06 to 1, the best in
years, though some of that could be attributed to the reduced size
of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the closely watched 30-year bond rose 11/32, to 107
13/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell
to 5.73 percent from 5.75 percent on Monday. The 10-year note, the
emerging bellwether issue, rose 8/32, to 104 7/32. Its yield fell
to 5.91 percent from 5.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Labor Department's numbers couldn't have been any more
friendly for bonds and stocks,'' said Robert Pugliese, senior vice
president and director of the fixed-income department at the J.W.
Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca Raton, Fla. ``But that doesn't mean
bond prices will rise simply because the Fed is not expected to
raise rates. We are still competing with abnormal rates of return
in equities.''
</P>
<P>
   The productivity of the nation's workers increased at an annual
rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter compared with a revised
1.9 percent in the first quarter. The government also said unit
labor costs fell 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surge in nonfarm business productivity blew past even the
most bullish forecasts on the Street,'' said Anthony Chan, managing
director and chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said last week's employment report and Tuesday's
productivity report might further encourage the Fed leave policy
unchanged when they meet later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could argue that it calls into question whether any
further action can be expected from the Fed,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fever has broken. Manhattan's real estate market,
overheated after more than four years of rising prices, seems to be
cooling down.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment hunters, who this spring seemed caught up in a ``grab
it now before it's gone'' panic, no longer have that desperate urge
to buy, a desperation that resulted in bidding wars and angry
recriminations. Within the last two months, real estate brokers and
statisticians say, bidding wars have declined, apartments have
stayed on the market longer before being sold, and hundreds have
even been marked down.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan real estate prices appear to be finally leveling off.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things everyone is beginning to feel is that the
market is flat,'' said Deborah Beck, executive vice president of
the Real Estate Board of New York. In another sign of a cooling
off, the board measured a 14 percent drop in the number of
Manhattan apartments sold for the quarter ending June 30, compared
with the same period last year _ ``a significant slowdown,'' Beck
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Corcoran Group, sealed bids, an indicator of unusual
levels of competition, were down 33 percent in July compared with
July 1999. Clearly, the experts say, this is not a case of the
seasonal summer blahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The edge is off the market,'' said Jonathan Miller, president
of Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm that compiles statistics for
Douglas Elliman, the city's biggest brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The experts link the slowdown to the Nasdaq plunge that began on
April 14, and to the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate
increase in May, ``the one that really had the impact,'' said
Marilyn Harra Kaye, president of Prudential/MLBKaye Realty.
</P>
<P>
   The changing statistics mirror a national trend, but there is
nothing to indicate the start of a downward movement like the one
in the late 1980s and early '90s. Real estate experts repeatedly
pointed out that prices remain high _ the average apartment price
for the period April through June was a record $854,704. But that
figure represents contracts signed an average of two months before
_ in the white-hot months of February, March and April. Based on
contracts signed in July, Miller projected a rise of only 1
percent, to $864,000.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the experts were willing to predict where the
Manhattan market would be by the end of the year, no one labeled
the cooling temporary. One thing seems certain: One of the biggest
sellers' markets in New York history has suddenly tilted more
toward the buyer _ and the buyers are noticing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the first time in his two years of looking, Tom Pappas, a
Midtown lawyer, has spotted the same properties showing up week
after week on his Internet searches. But he is not biting until
their prices go down. Then, he vowed, ``I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, brokers insist that no one is grasping at
lowball offers, but they concede that more sellers are accepting
modest reductions off the asking price than they were doing earlier
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The market's softening is particularly evident with
cookie-cutter, ordinary apartments _ particularly fixer-uppers _
that have been selling for ``extraordinary prices'' over the last
two years, said Pamela Liebman, chief executive at the Corcoran
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers cite myriad examples, including a five-room co-op
reduced in June to $535,000 from $615, 000. a one-bedroom lowered
to $305,000 from $335,000 and a studio dropped to $175,000 from
$190,000.
</P>
<P>
   A five-room penthouse at 834 Fifth Avenue, one of the city's
top-tier co-op buildings, went on the market in April priced at
$7.9 million. In late June, it was reduced to $6.49 million, and on
July 31, the price dropped to $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers are quick to say that many of these price decreases _
especially those in the multimillion-dollar category _ were the
result of overpricing. The two-bedroom penthouse ``ended up being
overpriced,'' said Hall Willkie, head of residential sales at Brown
Harris Stevens, the Upper East Side firm with the listing. ``We
were testing the market; we were aggressive, and we had to reduce
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   In the report Miller just finished, he found that the average
property spent 28 percent more time on the market than it did
during the same period a year ago, 118 days versus 92 days.
</P>
<P>
   These changes reflect a national trend. Fred Flick, the vice
president for research at the National Association of Realtors,
said the real estate market nationally was down 6 percent in
volume; by the end of the year, the association estimates that
volume will be down 9 percent. And while it still predicts average
price increases at 2 percent to 3 percent this year, that is less
than last year's 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've slowed from a blistering pace to a simmering pace,''
said Flick. The national slowdown was confirmed on Thursday, when
the Commerce Department reported that across the country, new home
sales fell 3.7 percent in June to the lowest level in two and a
half years. Median prices fell slightly.

RUSH-HOUR BLAST KILLS AT LEAST 8 IN DOWNTON MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A bomb ripped through a crowded pedestrian underpass in
downtown Moscow Tuesday, killing at least eight people, injuring
dozens more, and spreading fear across the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred during evening rush hour in a walkway under
Moscow's fashionable Pushkin Square, which was packed with hundreds
of commuters and shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found and defused a second bomb in the same
underpass, which connects three busy subway stations.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but many here,
including Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, said they suspected separatist
rebels from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came just weeks before the anniversary of a series of
apartment bombings that killed more than 300 people last fall, and
many Muscovites said they feared that it marked the start of a new
campaign of terror. The Kremlin blamed last year's bombings on
Chechen rebels and sent troops to subdue the breakaway republic a
few weeks later. The Chechens denied responsibility for those
blasts, which remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir V. Putin, who gained popularity after his
tough response to last year's bombings and his handling of the
Chechnya war, called an emergency session of his top law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets around the congested underpass Tuesday, medical
workers treated injured people lying in the road as wounded
pedestrians, covered with blood, their clothes burned and shredded,
staggered out of the subterranean passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a bang and the lights went out,'' Natalyya
Zulumatova, who was working in one of the small kiosks in the
underpass, told the Reuters news agency. The ends of her hair was
singed and her ankles stained with blood. ``I was hit by the blast
wave. There was smoke all over the place. We all managed to get out
in the smoke. I saw many injured people.''
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the site, shown on Russian State Television,
showed charred corpses lying on shattered glass and rubble in the
underpass as police and emergency workers picked through the
smoldering ruins.
</P>
<P>
   On the street above, paramedics carried a woman, her flesh
burned and blood gushing from her nose, to an ambulance. Medical
workers bandaged another woman's legs as she screamed in pain.
</P>
<P>
   For hours after the explosion, smoke poured from the stairway to
the underpass, which thousands of Moscow residents use every day,
and a sulfuric stench filled the air. Officials said as many as 53
were injured, including small children, a pregnant woman, and
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   Police released descriptions of two suspects, both men in their
late 20s with dark skin and ``apparently from the Caucasus
region,'' Russian State Television reported. Police said they would
soon distribute composite sketches of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   According to law-enforcement officials, the suspects placed the
bomb, which was in a plastic bag, on the ground in front of a kiosk
in the walkway. The explosion had the force of one &UR;  &LR; to &UR;  &LR; three
pounds of TNT, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov called the blast an ``act of terrorism'' and said there
was an ``obvious Chechen connection'' to the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony from several witnesses who were able to answer
questions in hospital shows. . . it was 100 percent Chechnya,''
Luzhkov said. He said that witnesses reported that two young men
with dark complexions had been bargaining with a shopkeeper and
left a bag behind them. The explosion occurred shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor went on to warn against indiscriminate anti-Chechen
sentiment in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude, expressed by some, that the only good Chechen is
a dead Chechen, is unacceptable,'' Luzhkov said. ``We need to
distinguish between terrorists and normal people.''
</P>
<P>
   News agencies quoted Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo,
Russia`s top law enforcement official, saying they were
investigating several possible scenarios for the bombing, including
that it was the work of the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate statement from Chechen rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Police across Russia had been on high alert for several days,
fearing that Chechen rebels would stage attacks to mark the August
6 anniversary of the day they drove Russian forces out of the rebel
region's capital Grozny in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In raids earlier Tuesday, police seized large caches of
explosives in Moscow and the southern city of Ryazan. Law
enforcement officials said the explosives were intended for
terrorist acts by Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of Tuesday's blast, Pushkin Square, is one of the
busiest parts of Moscow, at the junction of two major streets and
three subway stations. The passageway is a virtual underground
shopping center, lined with kiosks and shops selling cosmetics,
clothing, compact disks, candy, and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer months, it is also a popular hangout for
teenagers, who often gather there to drink beer and flirt.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Michaelin, 15, had just escorted several girls to the
subway station and was standing on the street near the underpass
when the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very worried about the girls,'' Michaelin said,
standing with a group of friends. ``We don't know if they are all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Moscow were placed on heightened alert and ordered to
check the many underground passageways around Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to appeal to citizens to show the same vigilance you
showed a year ago,'' said Emergency Minister Sergei Shoigu in
televised comments.
</P>
<P>
   Following last September's apartment bombings, fear and paranoia
swept Russia's capital as police, amid accusations of racism, went
house to house rounding up thousands of Chechens and others from
the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched basements and attics across the city as
residents kept round-the-clock watch over the courtyards of
apartment buildings. Police telephone lines were clogged with calls
from people informing on ``suspicious looking'' neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been jittery ever since, and many said Tuesday's
explosion had revived the fear that gripped the city barely a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we are frightened. This can happen at any time in
any place,'' said Svetlana Mikhailova, who was milling around the
blast site. ``There could be another explosion right where we are
standing. There could be a bomb in that car next to us.''

DISMISSAL SOUGHT IN CASE OF PAIR ACCUSED IN FATAL FIRE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Two homeless people accused of setting a fire
in a warehouse last December are no more culpable for the blaze _
or the deaths of six firefighters _ than city officials or the
building's owner, defense lawyers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two hapless souls shouldn't be here,'' said Edward P.
Ryan Jr., a lawyer for Thomas Levesque, 37. Levesque and Julie
Barnes, 20, have each been charged with six counts of involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in Worcester Superior Court, lawyers for the pair
argued that the charges should be dropped. Prosecutors disagreed.
Judge Timothy Hillman took the case under advisement, and is not
expected to rule before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The debate centered on whether Barnes's and Levesques' actions _
accidentally knocking over a candle, then leaving the warehouse
without telling anyone _ constituted the ``reckless and wanton
conduct'' required for a manslaughter charge.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Larry Murphy said they did. Reading
from statements police took from the pair after the fire, Murphy
cited several indications of what he called reckless behavior in
the minutes before the fire. Barnes and Levesque were trespassing
in the warehouse, Murphy said; Levesque was smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   And being ``aware of the fire in progress, . . . turning their
backs and walking away from the fire, is reckless,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyes said the couple had no legal duty to report
the fire. And Lou Aloise, a lawyer for Barnes, said the
firefighters themselves might have worsened the blaze when they
vented an elevator shaft. If they couldn't have foreseen the fire's
danger, he said, how could Barnes and Levesque have been expected
to?
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ryan said, the building's owner and city officials
were aware of potentially unsafe conditions in the warehouse, ``and
they had the power to do something.'' Instead, Ryan said, police
arrested ``two of life's unfortunates, who were scared, who didn't
know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Aloise later said defense lawyers believe no one should be
charged in connection with the fire.
</P>
<P>
   If a trial goes forward, prosecutors indicated they might treat
Levesque differently than Barnes. Murphy said it seems possible,
based on police statements, that Levesque was sexually assaulting
Barnes before the candle fell _ though he noted that Barnes and
Levesque seemed to be on friendly terms later that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Levesque is more responsible for the start of this fire,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Levesque and Barnes have been working jointly in
their fight for a dismissal. Both said the prosecution's statements
wouldn't change that relationship, for now.

SEEING STOCK OPTIONS AS INCOME, SOME DIVORCE COURTS RECONSIDER
SUPPORT AWARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   In just the last decade, stock options have gone from being
icing on the cake in many executive pay packages to the cake
itself, and the number of Americans holding at least some options
has soared from 1 million in 1992 to an estimated 10 million today.
</P>
<P>
   Now, America's divorce courts are playing catch-up in trying to
understand options as a compensation method. In recent years,
judges in several states have taken a closer look at the wealth
locked up in unexercised options and have made decisions that are
aimed at awarding at least some of that wealth to the former
spouses of those who hold the options.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rulings address different facets of the perplexing
question of how to evaluate unexercised stock options, legal
experts say they collectively reflect a social concern that is
central in family law: the best interests of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Academics may have developed mathematical models for valuing
unexercised options, notably the Black-Scholes method. But these
recent court decision are more about how to make sure ex-spouses
share in the wealth generated by options than about how to value
them.
</P>
<P>
   The court decisions hold the potential for inflicting a great
deal of financial pain on breadwinners who thought the ordeal of
their divorces was behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Richard John Kerr and his former wife,
Deedee Jean Kerr. In 1996, the couple went to court in California
for a permanent support hearing before the dissolution of their
20-year marriage. At the time, court documents show, Deedee Kerr
was a homemaker and Kerr was vice president of engineering at
Qualcomm Inc., a wireless communications company based in San
Diego, with an annual salary of $159,735. Two of their four
children lived at home.
</P>
<P>
   When they separated three years earlier, the couple, as required
by California law, had already agreed to an equal division of all
their property, including options in Qualcomm stock that Kerr had
acquired but not yet exercised. In addition, Kerr had agreed to pay
his ex-wife $3,309 a month in alimony and child support, based on
his salary at that time of $110,427.
</P>
<P>
   Deedee Kerr, however, asked Judge Edward Huntington to increase
the payments _ and after the hearing in 1996 he complied, raising
them 45 percent, to $4,806. His reasoning, legal experts say, broke
new ground. Stock options are a form of income, he ruled, and
because the income that the Kerrs had received in past years by
exercising Qualcomm options was a big factor in maintaining their
standard of living, the calculation of alimony and child-support
payments had to take into consideration the probable awarding and
exercising of future stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Huntington also ruled that Deedee Kerr should receive 40 percent
of all income that resulted from the future exercise of her
ex-husband's options, until both children had reached the age of
18, and 25 percent after that. Kerr was free to exercise the
options he currently held, as well as those awarded in the future,
at any time. He also had an incentive not to exercise the options
until the children reached 18. But if he declined to do so, legal
experts say, his ex-wife could ask for support based on income that
would be derived as if he had exercised the options.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr appealed, arguing that the court abused its discretion and
the award exceeded the needs of his ex-wife and children. But the
couple negotiated a confidential settlement before an appellate
judge could issue an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the ruling was the first in a string of court decisions
in several states that are setting important precedents in divorce
law, legal experts say: proclaiming options to be a form of income,
rather than a form of property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue had been before the courts, but as best I know never
decided,'' said George Norton, a California family-law specialist
who has consulted and written extensively about options cases. ``In
California, options are not property subject to division if they
are `earned' after separation. The logic then becomes they must be
`income' earned after separation and then subject to support
awards. The concept is options can't be `nothing' _ either property
or income, but not nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   If options are property, most legal experts say, an ex-spouse
has no future claim to them. But once they are considered income,
they become eligible for alimony and child support awards. And
those can be changed at any time.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio last year, a state appellate judge took the Kerr case a
step further and ordered a Procter &AMP; Gamble executive to make
additional child support payments based on an amount of money equal
to that which he would have paid had he exercised his stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   When the executive, Graeme Murray, and his wife, Susan, divorced
in 1994, she received half the options he held at the time. Three
years later, she asked a magistrate's court to increase his child
support payments because his income had increased from $212,702 to
$325,743.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The court then re-examined the way Murray's income had been
computed and discovered that his salary, bonus, dividend and
interest income, and even taxable employee benefits, had all been
included, but not his stock options. After that court and a
subsequent trial court ordered Murray to pay more, he appealed the
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, an appeals court ruled that the value of
Murray's unexercised options in Procter &AMP; Gamble stock should be
included in his gross income for the purposes of determining child
support for his 16-year-old son. Since the options could be
exercised a year to the day after the grant date, the judge
calculated the appreciation that would have occurred as if Murray
had exercised the available options that year.
</P>
<P>
   For 1997 the appeals court valued the appreciation of the
post-divorce options at $421,167. Excluding the options from the
calculation, the court found, would allow an employee ``to shield a
significant portion of his income and deprive his children of the
standard of living they would otherwise enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Ahlers, Murray's lawyer in Cincinnati, described the
ruling as faulty because it would in effect force Murray to
exercise his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind it takes away his ability to plan for his financial
future,'' she said. ``With no other income, he would have no other
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Huntington, who ruled in the California case, said the
decision made sense: ``I see it as a logical extension of Kerr,''
he said in an interview. ``Smart companies and industries can find
creative ways to compensate employees and camouflage income as
something other than income. Children and spouses are entitled to
the fruits of those labors. Our job is to unmask the camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   A court in Florida threw a sop to an ex-husband who suddenly
found himself with a bigger support bill: if the underlying value
of the stock options he held fell, the court might consider
reducing the payments he had to make.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-husband, Albert Seither, was a Southwest Airlines pilot
with annual income of more than $100,000 and 8,415 stock options
that vested at a rate of 1,403 options per year on Sept. 1 of each
year for five years beginning in 1998. The rest are to vest on
Sept. 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Seither's wife, Katherine, a part-time dental hygienist with a
17-year-old daughter at home, went to court in 1998 for a two-day
final hearing on the dissolution of their marriage. After the
hearing, the court found that Seither had a need for $4,000 a month
in permanent alimony, not the $600 she had been receiving, in
addition to the $893 in child support to which Seither had agreed.
Court documents indicated that he had apparently accepted the
options in lieu of a salary increase. And an accountant who
testified on Seither's behalf said the theoretical value of the
options justified the substantial increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Like the courts in California and Ohio, it ruled that the
options were income, not property. And it ordered Seither to pay
alimony of $2,000 twice a month instead of the $600 monthly he had
been paying, in addition to his existing child support.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida state appellate court, while acknowledging that
options have a dual nature, upheld the judgment in December.
However, the appellate judge wrote, ``If the price of Southwest
Airlines' stock falls significantly below the CPA's predictions,
this change should be regarded as a potential ground for the
modification of alimony.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another wrinkle in the developing legal consensus on how
to treat options in divorce proceedings, a Tennessee appellate
court ruled in October that an increase in income from exercising
yearly stock options as part of a bonus could be averaged and added
to an employee's base salary in calculating child-support payments.
</P>
<P>
   The new terrain these courts are exploring has pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlers said she believed the Ohio court failed to grasp the
nature of stock volatility. In March, after Proctor &AMP; Gamble warned
that it would not meet its earnings forecasts, the stock dropped
from $89.87 a share on the grant anniversary date to $61.68 eight
days later. ``Now he's overpaying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some compensation specialists question whether the
judiciary should be meddling in an area as arcane as options. The
court-ordered exercise of options could harm an executive in a
couple of ways, says James Crawford Jr., a benefits attorney in
Davis, Calif. ``It could be construed by top management under
certain circumstances as not being beneficial to the company,'' he
said. Moreover, ``If the stock goes down, there's risk of loss if
he's forced to exercise; if the stock goes up, then there's gain
foregone.''
</P>
<P>
   With the specter of stock downturns, company attitudes toward
stock options may be changing. Watson, Wyatt Worldwide, a
consulting firm, tells clients that options are neither
compensation nor benefits: ``They are a behavior-changing employee
communication plan,'' said Carine Schneider, leader of
global-stock-plan services at Watson, Wyatt. Even though options
currently represent about $1 trillion in unexercised wealth
nationally, she said, companies are letting employees know they are
not entitled to this kind of compensation forever.
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why mediated settlements instead of divorce
trials hold appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about money, which gets people very
emotional,'' said Arnold Schienvold, president of the Academy of
Family Mediators, which is based in Lexington, Mass. He tells
clients to think, ``Not what do I have a right to, but what do I
need.''

<P>
   If you want to experience the very best that New York City has
to offer, make sure that your visit includes a Sunday. Most of the
usual weekday attractions such as plays, museums and shopping are
still available and Broadway theaters offer special matinees on
Sunday afternoons _ but some quintessential New York happenings
occur only on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is Sunday brunch, a New York phenomenon. In
Manhattan, you'll find restaurants crowded with executives and
professionals lingering over eggs Benedict and coffee in a way they
don't have time for during the week.
</P>
<P>
   For a particularly festive brunch experience, try Tavern on the
Green. Set in Central Park _ a haven of greenery, light and air to
harried New Yorkers _ this famed restaurant sets the scene with
stained-glass windows, sand-carved mirrors and glittering, crystal
chandeliers. Weather permitting, head for the outdoor cafe ringed
with tree branches strung with thousands of white lights and enjoy
the view of the park with your pancakes and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the Tavern is one of Central Park's major
attractions. Officially called ``The Wildlife Conservation Center''
but better known simply as ``the zoo,'' it houses more than 450
animals of 100 species in a habitat that represents three distinct
climates: the tropical zone, the temperate regions and the polar
circle (be sure not to miss the penguins).
</P>
<P>
   Central Park's 843 acres offer places for tennis, horseback
riding, bicycling, rowing and in-line skating, and on a sunny
Sunday, you'll see people enjoying them all.
</P>
<P>
   If the zoo has whetted your interest in wildlife, a very
different animal experience can be had at the nearby American
Museum of Natural History, at Central Park West and 77th Street.
True, this venerable institution has an outstanding collection of
minerals and gems, including the Star of India _ the world's
largest star sapphire (563 carats) _ but it's the dinosaurs and
their kin that seem to fascinate almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Six halls completed in 1996 house an impressive fossil display.
A branching, evolutionary tree allows visitors to follow the
development of vertebrates from the earliest, jawless fishes
through dinosaurs and mammals. The museum has the largest
collection of fossil vertebrates in the world _ as well as the
world's largest living lizard, the 10-foot-long Komodo dragon who
reposes benignly in a glass case.
</P>
<P>
   Most New York City museums are open on Sundays, but one that
gives particular pleasure is The Cloisters, which often presents
concerts on Sunday afternoons in its magnificent setting in
Northern Manhattan's Fort Tryon Park.
</P>
<P>
   Re-creating a fortified monastery, the complex incorporates
elements from five medieval French cloisters. Here, a stroll along
the rampart wall offers striking views of the buildings, the park
and the Hudson River. The collections include sculptures,
tapestries and stained glass windows spanning more than 1,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   The tapestries, in particular, are dazzling. Among the most
beloved are the Unicorn tapestries, depicting the familiar legend
of the Virgin and the Unicorn with brilliant colors and
extraordinary attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday shoppers will find much to please in the various museum
gift shops. But a very different Sunday-in-New-York shopping
experience can be had downtown on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
known historically as a melting pot for newly arrived immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Lining the narrow streets, an eclectic ensemble of tenement
buildings, crowded, open-air markets and grand houses of worship
combine to create one of America's landmark ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunting? Check out Orchard Street. Once jammed with
pushcarts, this bustling artery and the surrounding streets are
closed to traffic on Sundays, becoming a mecca for those seeking
good prices on clothing and accessories. More than 300 tiny stores
display their wares from stalls in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   For another outdoor shopping experience, go to the Avenue of the
Americas (Sixth Avenue) between 26th and 27th Streets and wander
through the flea market. On Saturdays and Sundays, vendors fill a
weekday parking lot with wares that range from the ratty to the
rare. You may find a silver frame or a vintage hat, but be sure to
check the merchandise before paying and don't hesitate to bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it would be remiss to consider Sunday in New York
without mentioning its historic churches. Many offer musical
programs on Sunday afternoons or evenings, and all, of course,
welcome visitors to services.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight just one, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine,
seat of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, is reputedly the largest
Gothic-style cathedral in the world. The massive stone edifice at
Amsterdam Avenue and 110th Street in Morningside Heights _ begun in
1892 and still under construction _ can accommodate up to 8,000
worshippers at a time. The central Portal of Paradise features a
set of bronze doors sculpted with scenes from both Old and New
Testaments. Each weighing three tons, the doors were produced in
Paris by Ferdinand Barbedienne, who also cast the Statue of
Liberty. Tours are available on Sunday afternoons.

CUBIST IN DEAL FOR ANTIBIOTICS TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced plans Tuesday to acquire
TerraGen Discovery Inc. for $29 million in a stock swap that will
give Cubist propietary technology for developing antibiotics using
untapped microbes in the environment along with an extensive patent
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Cubist will exchange 608,000 shares for all
the stock in TerraGen, a private company in Vancouver, Canada. The
Cubist shares were valued at $47.6625 with the entire transaction
expected to close in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``TerraGen exploits the biological diversity that exists in
nature and facilitates the discovery of pharmaceuticals from
environmental sources that have been previously untapped,'' said
Scott M. Rocklage, Cubist chairman, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that less than 1 percent of the plants and animals
have been accessible for drug screening. However, drugs produced
from naturally occurring substances, such as tree bark, soil and
fungi have become a rich source of pharmaceuticals. Currently $14
billion in annual global antibiotic drug sales start with products
derived from natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   TerraGen, a five-year old venture-capital backed business, has
developed proprietary technology that enables the identification,
production and screening for pharmaceuticals from the other 99
percent, Rocklage said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian company, which also has research operations in
Slough England, has also developed a large patent estate to cover
the methods by which environmental samples are collected along with
a chemical extract library generated from a variety of
microorganisms that can be used for drug development.
</P>
<P>
   Rocklage said TerraGen will help Cubist expand its pursuit of
antibiotic drugs that fight bacterial and fungal infections. Cubist
also plans to license TerraGen's technology to another drug maker
by year end.
</P>
<P>
   Cubist is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical with
daptomycin, an antibiotic, with the branded name Cidecin, to treat
complicated skin and soft tissue infections and other serious and
life-threatening infections such as bacteremia. The Cambridge,
Mass. company also has research collaborations with several major
pharmaceutical companies such as Merck &AMP; Co. and Novartis AG.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice deal because it adds a very strong demension to
Cubist's drug discvoery capabalities at what looks like a very
minimal cost,'' said Jay B. Silverman managing director at
Roberston Stephens in New York. ``TerraGen is in a very hot area
for screening of natural products but also needed some management
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   TerraGen, whose president left the company less than a year ago,
is now run by Julian Davies chief scientific officer and founder.
He and the small research firm's 50 people in Vancouver and in
Slough, UK will remain. He was also the former president of the
American Society of Microbiology.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SPEAKING OF RELIGION, GORE DID US ALL A FAVOR
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JANE ELY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a very special way, Al Gore, the certain Democratic
presidential nominee, performed a terrific service to Americans of
all political persuasions when he formally chose Joe Lieberman to
be named his running mate at their party's national convention in
Los Angeles next week.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime a Democrat includes a prayer and many references to his
god in his first speech as the one tapped to be his party's
vice-presidential nominee, he surely helps ease the almost constant
Democratic harangue at the religious right of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the end, the fact Sen. Lieberman, D-Conn., is quite
public in his religion may have a far greater effect on the
presidential race than the reality his religion is that of an
Orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Though the great attention focused on Lieberman's religion and
the fact he is the first Jew to run for vice president is
dominating the early news of his selection by Gore, his religion
surely and simply can't be considered more controversial than that
of the Christian conservatives who certainly were in the great
majority at last week's Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   To some, that may sound flip. It is not meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   It is meant to be the observation of one who respects all
reputable faiths and all those who embrace them _ with one caveat.
I do not want to be coerced to subscribe to any religion nor do I
want to be compelled to live my life by the religious tenets of &QL; 
others.
</P>
<P>
   It is inconceivable to me how anyone who professes a religion
could damn the professed religion of another. And it is beyond my
comprehension how even the staunchest of nonbelievers could object
to others believing _ so long as they are not pressured to believe
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it is my beliefs that make it almost impossible for
me to understand why Gore's selection of Lieberman can be
considered a particularly bold choice.
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world should it be considered ``bold'' for a
presidential candidate to choose as his running mate a man known as
``the moral conscience of the Senate,'' as a man of unflinching
integrity and a person of staunch personal morals?
</P>
<P>
   Is it ``bold'' because Lieberman is a Jew? If so, then this
``bold'' selection says more about us than it does about Vice
President Gore, who tapped him.
</P>
<P>
   So does the first general reaction to Gore's selection of
Lieberman and to George W. Bush's tapping of Dick Cheney as his
Republican running mate seem to tell us more about Bill Clinton
than most of us might wish.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we have almost unbounded admiration for the veep nominees,
respect for their integrity and esteem for the high regard in which
they are held by those in both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   And, on the other hand, we had President Clinton's vice
president and the man he chose to run as vice president in his own
presidential campaign speak for about an hour to a crowd that stuck
with them under a blazing Tennessee sun, and not once did Bill
Clinton's name pass their lips.
</P>
<P>
   Though this week and next week clearly are the political
province of Al Gore, so too are they Joe Lieberman's time of glory
and attention _ just as the last two were Bush and Cheney's. But,
when the sun goes down after the Democratic nominating convention,
so too will pretty much all the attention paid to Lieberman and
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Not even those who really try can suggest a time since the 1960
election when they can contend a vice-presidential nominee made a
difference to the election.
</P>
<P>
   It is not without irony that that ticket was the one headed by
John F. Kennedy, the first Roman Catholic ever elected president.
Many insist Kennedy's selection of then-Texas Sen. Lyndon Johnson
was essential to the Democratic victory that year, for, it is
maintained, Kennedy could not have won without Texas and he
couldn't have carried Texas without Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   There are those of us who question even that now near-ancient
political contention. We believe LBJ was an inherent pol of the
first order and think Kennedy could have cut a deal for Johnson to
help him carry Texas _ and about any other place where skilled
political arm-twisting was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been _ and still is being _ made about Kennedy being
the first Roman Catholic elected president. When we think of that
win and then think of Joe Lieberman the Orthodox Jew, we need to
remember two things: &QL; 
No. 1, Kennedy was elected nearly 30 years ago. No. 2, Kennedy the
Catholic was elected president, and Lieberman the Jew is running
for veep. Those are two mighty big differences.
</P>
<P>
   How big? Let's say that's something only someone's god _
Catholic? Jewish? Protestant? Maybe, evangelical? _ might know. &QL;

$2.3B VERIZON DSL DEAL COULD SPEED SERVICE DELIVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, struggling with a major strike and an
earnings disappointment that pounded its stock price, said Tuesday
it is merging its digital subscriber line high-speed Internet
operations with California-based NorthPoint Communications Group in
a deal valued at $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Local customers of Verizon Online, the new name for the former
Bell Atlantic Infospeed DSL service, will see no immediate changes
in service offerings or prices. However, the deal could lead to
faster rollout of DSL services in areas served by Verizon,
including New England.
</P>
<P>
   NorthPoint operates as a wholesale DSL supplier for Internet
service providers, including Shore.net of Lynn and Quincy's Network
Plus locally. It counts 62,000 DSL lines in service nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began building in Greater Boston last summer,
NorthPoint has grown to cover an estimated 75 percent of all homes
and businesses in the metropolitan region, according to NorthPoint
spokeswoman Caroline Howell.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon and NorthPoint will combine their operations into a
so-called ``new North Point'' that will be 55 percent owned by
Verizon and 45 percent by NorthPoint.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon will invest $800 million in the new unit, of which $450
million will be used to expand NorthPoint's network. The balance
will be distributed as $2.50 per share to NorthPoint shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is similar to a joint arrangement between SBC
Communications and Prodigy that allowed the mid-American Baby Bell
to turn over responsibility for its DSL services to what is widely
seen as a nimbler, more entrepreneurial company. Bell Atlantic had
been widely seen as a laggard in rolling out reliable, easily
installed DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Fetter, who will continue as NorthPoint president and chief
executive after the merger, said the deal will make the two
operations ``a stronger competitor against cable and other
broadband service providers, delivering to customers . . .
innovation, increased choice and better service.''
</P>
<P>
   NorthPoint is now testing in the San Francisco area a planned
new national service called Blast offering video and computer games
to customers over high-capacity DSL links.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year the combined operation is projected to
cover 3,000 phone company central offices nationwide with a
potential market of 63 million homes and businesses in 163 US
metropolitan areas. The operations now have more than 600,000 Bell
Atlantic, GTE and NorthPoint DSL lines in service.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is subject to approval by antitrust regulators
and NorthPoint shareholders, is expected to be completed by next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was announced as Verizon shares fell 12 percent, their
biggest drop since the 1987 crash, on warnings that the nation's
number one local phone company will fail to meet this year's
earnings estimates. Verizon was also in the third day of a
companywide strike over unionizing its wireless operations and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Verizon shares dropped
$5.625 to $42.25. They were down 17 percent from the June 30
completion of the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon said costs of merging operations and investing in new
technology, and lower than expected operation savings from the
merger, will cut this year's earnings per share to between $2.90
and $2.94, below analysts' consensus of $3.15 reported by First
Call/Thomson Financial.

HER MONEY. WITH BARBIE-SIDEBAR AND PHOTO

<TEXT>
<P>
   Say what you will about Barbie, she sure is taking the heat off
of Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   America's favorite doll has found herself in hot water _ and
we're not talking the kind in her Pool Party Playset.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Presidential Barbie 2000 refused to debate Surprise
Party candidate Vanessa, but she also was a no-show at the
Republican National Convention last week in Philadelphia _ only to
have Republican Delegate Barbie show up instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did challenge them to a debate. The response was `Barbie's
too busy being a delegate in the campaign races to have a debate
with us,''' said Jennifer Baker, Vanessa for President campaign
manager (and founder of the Philadelphia-based Getsetclub.com,
maker of Vanessa and the other four dolls in her Cabinet).
</P>
<P>
   ``How can she be a delegate and a presidential candidate at the
same time? Maybe she doesn't understand the job?''
</P>
<P>
   The doll race for president is shaping up like another
``Crossfire`` edition of ``she said, she said.'' Real or not, that
other race (you know, George W. Bush vs. Al Gore?) can't hold a
candle to the camp factor of this year's Barbie vs. Vanessa
face-off.
</P>
<P>
   Texas District 137 state Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, took
time from the campaign trail (she's up for re-election, too) to
address the battle of the dolls:
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me like Vanessa is more issue-oriented and wants
to have more debates on the issues,'' said Danburg, stressing she
wouldn't vote for a candidate ``just because she's a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is trying to appeal to a broader cross section of our
society, and has the educational background and range of experience
that would make her a better official if she were to win the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltway insiders say the road to the presidency is not paved in
plastic shoes. Regardless of what the polls say, if Barbie wants to
lead the country, she'll have to beat Vanessa in November.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie, reportedly holed up at her Malibu Dream House with
longtime companion Ken, could not be reached for comment. Her
campaign manager, Julia Jensen of Mattel, defends her candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with 41 years of experience, Barbie is uniquely
qualified to serve as president of the United States,'' Jensen
said. ``She's been a doctor, she's been a veterinarian, she's
served as a nurse, she's been in the armed forces several times.
She's been a teacher, she's worked in the communities and she's
really in touch with what's on the minds of young people in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a hard-line, anti-pink agenda and unbelievably
sensible shoes, Vanessa's visibility at the GOP convention has
given the African-American presidential candidate new power in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more than just pretty in pink,'' said Baker, adding that
nonpartisan Vanessa is also booked for the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's smart. She's independent. She's the only candidate in
this campaign who can stand on her own two feet _ and I mean that
literally.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Barbie. Until just a few weeks ago, she had been running
unopposed with an arsenal of feminist organizations behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen said despite the not-nice behavior of the other side,
Barbie is keeping a pretty face about it all:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barbie, as well as Mattel, is thrilled that there's
such an interest in girls being exposed to running for such a high
office. That's really the crux of Barbie doll taking on the role as
president, and it's great that Vanessa is doing the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Barbie has a past. Long before Vanessa threw her faux
pearls into the ring, Washington observers questioned Barbie's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   From her on-again, off-again relationship with Ken (so many
bridal gowns; never a wedding) to her ambivalence about committing
to a career (one day a glamorous astronaut; next a Malibu surf shop
operator) Barbie's image hasn't always been presidential.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she isn't trying, mind you. In fact, both candidates
have entered the ring with head-to-toe makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa, typically seen in sporty pants, tops and tennis shoes,
has traded in the ``club kid'' look for a roomy blue pantsuit,
pearls, red loafers and a conservative, pulled-back hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie (who is constantly reinventing herself anyway) sports
shorter, bobbed hair for the campaign, complete with hairspray! And
her slinkier numbers have been cast aside for, yes, another blue
suit with campaign button and matching pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Perry, a Houston-based corporate and personal image
consultant who dressed Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer and his wife,
Patty, said red and blue both work for political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When rating the two candidates' outfits overall, Vanessa clearly
comes out on top.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie lost major points on her pantyhose, hot-blue numbers with
a seam up the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That screams fashion victim,'' Perry said. ``She's trying to
be elected for something besides a political office. Definitely an
inconsistency there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa's ready-for-U.N.-peace summit navy blue pantsuit,
however, was noted as a wise political maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pantsuit works, especially with the corporate casual
trend,'' she said. ``It makes her more approachable. Sometimes it's
more graceful for women when they sit down on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's platform, which has received the backing of Girls
Incorporated as part of the nonprofit, nonpartisan White House
Project, is about showing girls from sea to shining sea that
``becoming president is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is buying the Barbie rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Schroeder, a former U.S. representative from Colorado,
has also voiced her opposition:
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the `Barbie for President' message?'' she wrote
earlier this year in the New York Times. ``I'm afraid it's `you can
be a president if you look like a 10!'``
</P>
<P>
   VOTER INFORMATION: Polls for this presidential race are open.
Early votes are being taken at www.getsetclub.com. A spokeswoman
for Barbie said the candidate is running as a write-in.

 &HT;    The spotlight is on suits at Olympic Swimming Trials
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - The U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials open today with
the same tension and many of the same names, but a completely
different look.
</P>
<P>
   Skin is out, bodysuits are in - some stretching from neck to
ankle and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Semifinals have been added for races up to 200 meters, so the
event - which is a carbon copy of the Olympics - now lasts eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Trials ending only one month before the Sydney
Games, some elite swimmers are banking on making the team without
being at peak form. They want to save their best for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 swimmers are here vying for a maximum of 52
spots, 26 each for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara ``B.J.'' Bedford, who is competing in her fourth Trials,
is one of many swimmers showing less skin than in `96, but in a
different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not shaving my head this time,'' said the
27-year-old backstroker, who despite her bald move finished one
spot short of the team in 1996. ``I think that added a little bit
of pressure last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic Trials is unlike any other meet - ever. It's one
of the hardest, most heartbreaking meets for 99 percent of the
people who are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson knows that sinking feeling. She has five gold
medals and one silver, but no golds in an individual event.
Suffering from insomnia in 1996, she was crushed when she made the
team only on relays.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson had planned on retiring after Atlanta, but she said,
``That all changed when I felt I hadn't done what I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Thompson, other swimmers with unfinished business are
back, and the biggest names are in her event: There's a pair of
33-year-olds, Angel Martino and Dara Torres (Torres is 10 days
older). Martino, a two-time Olympian who lives in Milledgeville, is
married and the mother of a little boy. Torres returned from a
seven-year retirement and hopes to become the first American to
swim in four Olympics. And Amy Van Dyken, who won four golds in
Atlanta, is back from shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are promising newcomers to the Olympic Trials,
such as 16-year-old breaststroker Megan Quann and 17-year-old
backstroker Aaron Peirsol, who haven't had their hearts broken.
</P>
<P>
   Quann hasn't reduced her yardage as much as usual because of the
closeness of the Trials to the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets you up well for the Olympics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1988, the last time the Trials were so late,
everyone except Janet Evans and Matt Biondi fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world has been waiting, too, to see what the
U.S. can do. Australia set five world records at its Trials in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't swum fast this year yet,'' said backstroker Lenny
Krayzelburg, the world record holder. ``It's important for me to
make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Others will make only a fashion statement. The controversial
bodysuits were banned from the Trials, then reinstated when
manufacturers promised to make enough for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Malchow said the Speedo ``Fastskin'' helped him set the
world record in the 200-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me confidence,'' said Malchow, who won't shave his
body here so he'll be sleek in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bobby Brewer, a backstroker from Forest Park, may wear
the old-fashioned brief made by his sponsor, Tyr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody should make (the bodysuits) at all,''
Brewer said. ``There's too much going on with the material. Are
they judging the best athlete or the best suit?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore has come down with a highly symbolic _ and possibly
highly selective _ case of ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Without publicly dotting the i's and crossing the t's, Gore
wants his selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as the Democratic
vice-presidential nominee to be seen as at least a modified
declaration of independence from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That's the main point Gore wants voters to take from the hoopla
surrounding his choice of Lieberman, a good, decent, thoughtful man
(as even the Bush-Cheney campaign warmly, wisely and quickly
conceded).
</P>
<P>
   What Gore doesn't want the electorate to reflect on are:
</P>
<P>
   1.The touch of desperation that the choice of Lieberman
represents. Gore, although seemingly a straight-shooter in his own
personal life, is tacitly admitting that his own fund-raising
scandals and his association with Clinton have exposed his ``moral
leadership'' flank. Gore felt the need to use the biggest moment of
the pre-convention campaign to attempt to cover it. Gore was
trailing and played defense.
</P>
<P>
   2a.The success of Bush, to this point, in capturing the middle
ground. Lieberman _ even more than Gore, in his current
``populist'' configuration _ represents the moderate ``New
Democrat'' wing of the party. Lieberman is chairman of the centrist
Democratic Leadership Council (or DLC), which Jesse Jackson once
derided as ``Democrats for the Leisure Class.'' Lieberman's
presence on the ticket makes class warfare a riskier endeavor for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's inroads in the center forced an uncomfortable choice on
Gore: to use his vice-presidential selection for the short-term
goal of shifting left to solidify the Democratic base (a task so
far not blessed with stellar results) or to look to the fall
campaign, in which reaching out to independents likely will be more
important. Gore, at least, has chosen the right option.
</P>
<P>
   2b.The success of Bush in advancing an agenda that features some
key points with which Lieberman agrees and Gore does not. This
includes Lieberman's support for such basic Bush tenets _ denounced
by Gore _ as limited use of Social Security tax revenues for
private retirement accounts and at least a test of federally
financed education vouchers to allow low-income families to get
children out of failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the only differences in the Democratic ticket that
may be highlighted in the coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, Gore's selection of Lieberman represents the vice
president's apparent inability to tell _ or at least to convince _
Clinton to butt out of the campaign. Now, finally, Gore has decided
to let his selection of a running mate do the talking for him.
</P>
<P>
   In most forms of social intercourse it would be the height of
ingratitude to throw over one's patron and mentor so
unceremoniously. But this is politics, so rules of civilized
behavior have nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The public perception of Clinton as a sleazebag who has worn out
his welcome was costing Gore, so steps had to be taken. Luckily for
the vice president, Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to
speak out strongly against Clinton's sexual shenanigans with intern
Monica Lewinsky (``Immoral,'' he said) was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   But will Lieberman reinforce Gore's attempt at independence or
merely remind voters of what they don't like about Clinton and
about Gore's long-term association with and obeissance to the
president?
</P>
<P>
   Gore is counting on the electorate being able to perform what
may prove to be intricate surgery: severing him from the slime ball
part of the Clinton record without denying him any credit for the
happier portions, especially the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a neat trick.
</P>
<P>
   This is, remember, the same Al Gore who stood in the Rose Garden
19 months ago and gave the newly impeached Clinton a big wet kiss:
``A man I believe will be recorded in the history books as one of
our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during his brief time in divinity school, Gore picked up
the concept of situation ethics.

REFORM PARTY CONVENTION BEGINS ON SOUR NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ In a fractious opening act, the Reform
Party began its convention Tuesday with a closed-door quarrel that
led to charges of fraud, a walkout by officials loyal to party
founder Ross Perot, and assertions of victory by the campaign of
Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   While competing forces shoved and bellowed in a hotel mezzanine
outside a guarded ballroom, Buchanan's sympathizers won a showdown
ruling inside at a meeting of the party's national committee.
Afterward, the candidate's sister and campaign manager, Bay
Buchanan, said of the effort to deny him the party's presidential
nomination: ``It's over now.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Buchanan's supporters appeared to grab control of
the Reform Party apparatus, dozens from the 160-member national
committee stormed from the meeting. Shouting that they had been
cheated by a ``lawless'' procedure, the group gathered in a rump
session at a hotel down the street to claim that they still
represented the official party.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Donovan, who described herself as ``press secretary in
exile'' of the Reform Party founded by Perot during his
presidential campaign in 1992, said their next moves were not yet
clear. But she was withering with her criticism of the Buchanan
backers. She said Gerry Moan, interim chairman of the party and
considered a Buchanan ally, had ``lost his mind'' by throwing
Tuesday's meeting into the hands of Buchanan supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is chaos,'' said Russell Verney, a former national
chairman of the party and leader of the anti-Buchanan bloc, after
being blocked from attending the meeting where Buchanan's allies
took over the party. Verney charged that Buchanan had stuffed the
room with ineligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   Verney's remarks to reporters and old Perot backers barred from
the ballroom were met with shouts of ``Shut up Verney!'' and ``Go
home!'' from Buchanan supporters milling in the mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   As the confrontation intensified, several uniformed Long Beach
police officers arrived to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   Micki Summerhays of Oregon, one of 10 members of the party's
executive committee, described turmoil behind the closed doors. She
said Moan disregarded a parliamentarian and allowed dozens of
Buchanan delegates _ whose credentials were under dispute _ to be
seated. The decision enabled Buchanan's forces to outnumber
veterans of the Reform Party who object to his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perot is not expected to attend the convention and has
taken no public role in the struggle, the fight against Buchanan
has been led by Perot's political associates. In a prelude to this
week's event, the pro-Perot executive committee voted a few days
ago to disqualify Buchanan as a Reform Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting convened inside the ballroom, Jim Mangia, the
party's national secretary, rallied several members of the
executive committee for an impromptu press conference. Raising his
arm in a mock Nazi salute, he charged the Buchanan campaign with
``overstepping bounds, seizing the power of the national committee,
and submitting false lists of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that Pat Buchanan will steal our party and
$12.6 million in matching funds,'' Mangia said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Roth, press secretary for John Hagelin, Buchanan's only
rival for the nomination, described the scene as ``crazy'' as the
political party veered toward anarchy. ``Moan thinks he's in
charge, and Mangia thinks he's in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Buchanan seemed assured of winning the party's
presidential nomination when the national convention formally
begins Thursday, his opposition vowed to go to court to prevent him
from obtaining the $12.6 million due to the Reform Party from the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan said she anticipated the legal challenge, but
insisted that her brother's campaign would receive the money within
two weeks. She said Buchanan had worked legally within the system
to win a majority of the delegates at the convention. She said the
disruptions were being caused by people ``who would rather destroy
the party than to have a Buchanan candidacy.''

PALESTINIANS SEE SETBACK FOR PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHOSHANA LONDON SAPPIR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian officials have been choosing their words
diplomatically when commenting on the choice of the first Jewish US
vice presidential candidate. But the buzz on the Palestinian street
Tuesday was that this would not favor their side in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Like their Israeli counterparts, Palestinians were careful to
avoid the appearance of taking sides in US politics. But clearly
Senator Joseph Lieberman's Jewishness is not insignificant for
either side, and Palestinians privately voiced concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real feeling on the street is that here is another example
of the American unfairness and leaning towards Israel because of
the Jewish vote,'' said political analyst Ghassan Khattib, who
heads the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center. ``This is not
good news for the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he (Lieberman) will look at the issue of Middle
East peace through a wider lens and make balanced decisions,'' said
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official in charge of Jerusalem
affairs. ``I believe he can do so because he is informed about the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has a solid pro-Israeli record, and was hailed by
Israeli politicians as a friend of Israel. Likud party stalwart
Moshe Arens, speaking on Israel Radio, referred to Lieberman as ``a
declared Zionist.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Lieberman signed a letter to President Clinton
describing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as the ``villain'' of
the peace process, and accused him of refraining from stopping a
campaign of anti-Israeli bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Khattib said Palestinian concerns over Lieberman focus on his
political record, not his religion. As to the short-term effect of
the nomination on the chances of Israel and the Palestinians
signing a peace accord in the next weeks, Khattib doubted it would
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not have an effect on the peace process because it is
not working with or without him,'' he said. ``It can't be worse.''

fits athletes from neck to toe has revolutionized the sport. At
least 10 world records have been set worldwide this year in the new
swim suits. Speedo's version is called the Fastskin suit, which
contains tiny, v-shaped ridges that allow water to pass over the
swimmer more efficiently. The super-stretch fabric also compresses

 &HT;    Woman hurt at Home Depot gets $1.24 million
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Colorado jury has awarded $1.24 million to a woman who was
injured in 1997 when a metal rack hit her head at a Home Depot
store in Louisville, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Marlo Rice, 32, of Golden, Colo., suffered permanent head
injuries when a rack of bedding plants fell on her in Home Depot's
garden department.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said a gust of wind knocked the rack on top of Rice.
Rice claimed the rack was unstable because several steel-framed
tables were leaning against it. The company declined comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based retailer also recently agreed to pay $500,000
to a New Jersey couple whose 3-year-old son was injured in a 1997
store accident. The boy was hit on the head when several boxes of
vinyl siding fell on him at a store in Mount Laurel, N.J.

 &HT;    Amato leading new-look NC State
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. - There have been some amazing changes to North
Carolina State's football program since the Wolfpack lost to East
Carolina 23-6 to end their season Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   -Mike O'Cain, coach for seven years, was fired in late November.
</P>
<P>
   -FSU assistant head coach Chuck Amato was hired as head coach
Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   -Athletics director Les Robinson quit and went to The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   -Amato hired a staff whose combined experience exceeds 200 years
and combined salaries exceeds $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   -State announced it will upgrade Carter-Finley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and East Carolina is no longer on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, like so many other programs, State fired its
coach, brought in a new one and gave him everything the old coach
had been asking for for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Amato was a linebacker at State in the late '60s and welcomed
his chance to get back to his roots, despite leaving a program that
won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me how many of our players could start at Florida
State,'' Amato said. ``I tell them zero, although three or four of
our players would be on their depth chart. Bobby Bowden doesn't
have any secrets down there. It's called speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Amato had been at Florida State since 1982. He owns a box full
of bowl rings and watches. one of which he wears on his right hand
along with his Rolex. ``Having the watch and the ring doesn't hurt
when I'm recruiting,'' he said. ``I tell 'em I like jewelry and I
want to add to my collection and you're the type person who can
help me do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amato's all-star staff is headed by former BYU offensive
coordinator Norm Chow, who had worked with BYU coach LaVell Edwards
since 1976. Chow will get a chance to prove his worth early since
State will start a true freshman, Phillip Rivers, at quarterback.
Rivers takes over from four-year starter Jamie Barnette, who
finished his career as the record-holder in almost every
single-game, single-season and career passing category at State.
``We hate to have a freshman at quarterback, but Phillip is very
mature,'' Amato said. ``He picked up the system quickly and he
makes good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Robinson, after an injury-plagued 1999, should open at
tailback. Koren Robinson was the 1999 ACC Rookie of the Year at
receiver, and along with Bryan Peterson, will give Rivers nice
targets to hit.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line was the area most depleted after 1999, with
four starters gone.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Buddy Green will have eight of 11 starters
returning, and defense will have to carry the Wolfpack in the early
going. There are four starters returning at linebacker, including
two who were on the preliminary Dick Butkus award list _ Clayton
White and Edrick Smith. The secondary is the weak link on defense,
with All-America corner Lloyd Harrison and sidekick Tony Scott
graduated.
</P>
<P>
   With three critical areas with little or no experience _
quarterback, offensive line and cornerback _ Amato sets his
journey. He admits he has a long road ahead.

LIEBERMAN THANKS GOD, GORE FOR `MIRACLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Thanking God and Al Gore, an emotional Senator
Joseph Lieberman accepted Gore's offer to be his running mate
Tuesday, beaming with pride at the ``miraculous day'' that made him
the first Jewish candidate for the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for bringing me
to this extraordinary moment in my life. And Al Gore, I thank you
for making this miracle possible for me and breaking this barrier
for the rest of America forever,'' Lieberman told a crowd of
several hundred who gathered in the sweltering Southern heat to
watch the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old Connecticut senator praised Vice President Gore
for his ``bold step,'' saying the selection said more about Gore
than it did about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot express with words the gratitude I feel today as the
first Jewish American to be a major party candidate for the vice
presidency,'' said Lieberman, who stood with his wife, Hadassah;
Vice President and Mrs. Gore; and other members of the two
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who might call Al Gore's selection of me
an act of chutzpah,'' Lieberman quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Gore compared his selection to the candidacy of President John
F. Kennedy, who 40 years ago became the first Catholic to win the
presidency. Kennedy was nominated at his party's convention in Los
Angeles, where Democrats will meet next week to nominate Gore and
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voted with our hearts to make history by tearing down an
old wall of division, and when we nominate Joe Lieberman for vice
president, we will make history again,'' Gore said, eliciting an
enthusiastic cheer from the crowd. ``We will tear down an old wall
of division once again.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican National Convention earlier this month drew on
the traditionally Democratic themes of inclusion and diversity, the
Democratic announcement borrowed the common Republican themes of
faith and family.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, as the first Democratic senator to publicly criticize
President Clinton for his behavior in the Monica S. Lewinsky
scandal, is expected to help counter the Republicans' character
assault on the Democrats, and help Gore separate himself from
Clinton on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman repeatedly referred to God, to his and Gore's personal
religiosity, and to the family he said helped propel him to this
moment of history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has never wavered in his responsibilities as a father, as
a husband, and as a servant to God Almighty,'' said Lieberman, an
Orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a centrist, second-term senator, has more
conservative views than Gore on some issues, prompting Republicans
to remark that Lieberman was actually closer to their nominee,
George W. Bush, in his thinking that he was to that of his own
running-mate.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, Lieberman insisted, are just trying to ``blur the
differences'' between the two tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even responded to the news that Al Gore picked me by
saying that George Bush and I think alike,'' Lieberman told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, I think that's like saying that the
veterinarian and the taxidermist are in the same business, because
either way you get your dog back,'' Lieberman joked.
</P>
<P>
   The joke, which is one Gore himself has used on more than one
occasion, drew a big laugh from the crowd, and from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are embarking on a busy, pre-convention tour that
will take them from Gore's home town of Carthage, Tenn., to
Lieberman's home state of Connecticut and then to Atlanta. Gore
will then head to Philadelphia, Springfield, Pa., Cleveland,
Independence, Mo., and Michigan. Lieberman will campaign with Gore
at least through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how Lieberman's campaign schedule will be
limited by his religious practice, which forbids him from working
on Saturdays in most circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   News of Lieberman's selection was followed by a huge leap in the
polls for the Democratic ticket. Lagging by as much as 19 points in
opinion polls following the Republican National Convention July
31-Aug. 3, Gore and Lieberman were just 2 points behind their
Republican rivals in a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, taken Monday night, showed Bush leading by a
razor-thin 45 percent to 43 percent against Gore. The same polling
group had Bush well ahead Aug. 5, with 54 percent of the vote
against Gore's 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An overnight ABC poll showed that 60 percent of voters approved
of Gore's choice for vice president, although two-thirds said they
didn't know enough about Lieberman to make a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those polled said his religious faith makes him more
appealing, but 29 percent also worried that Lieberman might try to
influence US policy toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane was heartened by the jump in the
polls, but noted it was just a ``snapshot'' of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, what the polls show is that the choice of Joe
Lieberman is a grand-slam,'' Lehane said. But ``there is a degree
of elasticity in the electorate right now. Polls will continue to
bounce around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's standing as an early and forceful Clinton critic
appeared to win points for the Democratic ticket. When told of
Lieberman's blistering comments about Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky, 72 percent of those polled by ABC said they thought more
highly of the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore drew on that public relations strength in introducing his
vice-presidential pick to the crowd, lauding Lieberman for his
character and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and I come from different regions and different religious
faiths, but we believe in a common set of ideals, and we both
believe with our whole resolve that, as Americans, we must make
real the great ideal that we are one country with a common
destiny,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Hadassah Lieberman, the senator's wife, whose moment
in the blazing sun moved many in attendance. She was introduced by
Tipper Gore, who noted that the two women had graduated from Boston
University in the same class, though they did not know each other
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know something about her,'' said Mrs. Gore.
``Her mother is a survivor of Auschwitz and Dachau. Her father was
in Nazi labor camps and organized an escape of Jewish men. And
after the war was over, he helped organize and nurture Jewish
orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hadassah was 3 years old, her parents escaped from
Stalinist repression in what was then Czechoslovakia and emigrated
to America.
</P>
<P>
   With obvious emotion, Hadassah Lieberman noted that she was
standing in the midst of a plaza commemorating World War II, among
other wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here I am, the daughter of survivors from the Holocaust,
the most horrendous thing that happened, and here I am in the place
that commemorates the American heroes, the soldiers who actually
liberated my mother in Dachau and in Auschwitz,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to America's newest citizens, Mrs. Lieberman said,
``Whether you and your family immigrated from Europe, Africa,
Mexico, Latin America, or Asia, I am standing here for you! This
country is our country!
</P>
<P>
   ``This land is your land,'' a smiling Mrs. Lieberman said to
loud cheers and applause. ``And anything is possible for us.''

 &HT;    EarthLink sticking to aggressive course
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink Inc., the second-largest Internet access
provider in the country with 3.7 million dial-up subscribers, is at
a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts worry about the company's stock price, which has
hovered around $11, down from a 52-week high of $31.88.
</P>
<P>
   Customers worry that with the company's explosive growth and the
departure of founder Charles Brewer that customer service _ the
catalyst for the company's early success _ will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   And there are fears that EarthLink's avowed goal of catching
rival ISP America Online is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   But the company remains committed to its aggressive plan to
catch AOL as well as grow its share of the high-speed broadband
market. Chief Executive Garry Betty said that with the completion
of a deal to acquire OneMain.com, Atlanta-based EarthLink will
reach 5 million subscribers by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink plans more acquisitions by the end of the year.
Tuesday it said it will pay cash for the acquisition of the
consumer dial-up business of IBS Interactive Inc. IBS will receive
cash based upon what EarthLink said was the ``final determination
of the total number of subscribers who remain EarthLink
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink would not disclose exactly how many subscribers would
be included with the IBS acquisition. Dow Jones News Service
reported that IBS has 17,000 dial-up subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions are one leg of EarthLink's plan for aggressive
growth. It plans to acquire dial-up customers, increase its
Web-hosting business and generate more non-subscriber revenue from
advertising and its personal start page. In recent weeks, the
company has placed increased emphasis on what may be the most
critical element of its strategy _ an aggressive rollout of
high-speed broadband services.
</P>
<P>
   Betty and President Michael McQuary contend the company can meet
its ambitious goals and eventually catch America Online, the
runaway leader with more than 27 million subscribers. But analysts
who follow the company are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catching AOL is virtually impossible for EarthLink or any
other ISP _ even the free ones,'' says Joe Laszlo, a senior analyst
with Jupiter Communications. ``The only way ISPs can grow is by
acquisition. It's hard to find ISPs out there that can help them
grow to the size of an AOL. Virtually all ISPs want to poach
customers from AOL, but people who are new to the Internet still
tend to gravitate toward AOL's strength of brand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Laszlo said continued subscriber acquisition is one
indicator of how an ISP is doing financially, it's not all that
matters. The number of ISPs that can add substantial numbers to
EarthLink's base is beginning to dwindle. Laszlo said EarthLink
should continue to focus on customer retention, high-speed access
and alternative revenue streams. EarthLink already has aggressive
plans for each of those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo believes it is important to convey to Wall Street that an
EarthLink subscriber is more valuable in the long run than
customers going to the free ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter believes multiple revenue streams are key,'' he said.
``EarthLink's personal start page is a good strategy, and Wall
Street will be looking for growth in that area, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles Russ, an analyst with Atlanta-based Robinson Humphrey,
agreed. ``They're not going to catch AOL. There are not enough
subscriber bases out there for them to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ said retention of EarthLink's dial-up customer base should
be its primary focus because eventually, EarthLink will be able to
convert customers to its more expensive broadband service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Gary and Mike McQuary have said they've seen higher churn
(cancellation rates) because people have gone to broadband. The
company has been very aggressively marketing high-speed (digital
subscriber line) telephone access,'' Russ said. ``If you look at
the last quarter, you'll see marketing costs went down. That's a
reflection of cutting back on sales and marketing and focusing on
DSL. I think it's a very smart move from management.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ believes that in the end broadband customers will be more
attractive to Wall Street. Broadband customers typically spend
about $49 monthly for access and spend more money and time online.
``They're going after a higher-quality customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is aggressively marketing and promoting its
high-speed broadband service to the point of taking out a full-page
ad in the Sunday New York Times. Currently, EarthLink has 80,000
broadband subscribers _ more than six times the amount it had last
year at this time and 78 percent more than in the first quarter of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo said EarthLink's acquisition strategy is important, but
what's even more important is being able to hold on to its
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to show a solid subscriber base and provide
information about what kind of subscribers are EarthLink
subscribers,'' he said. ``How much time do they spend online, and
how much to they shop online? That sort of demographic information
would help them a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Chairman Charles Brewer, who left the company
and sold all his EarthLink stock, also raised red flags among some
investors, even though Wall Street is enthusiastic about the
appointment of EarthLink founder Sky Dayton as chairman. Many
onlookers feel Brewer's departure could mean EarthLink is willing
to sacrifice its legendary service and support in favor of
aggressive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   When the company released its second-quarter earnings July 27,
it also acknowledged that the quality of service has suffered in
the first few months after the merger between EarthLink and
MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some rocky times in the first quarter,''
McQuary said. But he added that service would continue to improve.
In a recent interview, McQuary also said that as the company has
gotten larger (it now has about 5,500 employees), MindSpring's
original ``core values and beliefs'' have met with varying degrees
of passion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he believes that commitment to service will not fall by
the wayside in the quest for new subscribers. He says it's up to
him and other top EarthLink executives to instill those values.
``We still have a pretty dedicated core of employees who think that
(the core values) are the main reason for working here, and that
will cast light on the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey's Russ said EarthLink's current position is
oddly reminiscent of the days immediately following MindSpring's
initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is battening down the hatches and trying to
re-prove themselves to the Street,'' he said. ``Nobody thought
(MindSpring) could make any money, either. But MindSpring insisted
they could, and they were going to stay the course. I'm seeing the
same thing with EarthLink as a merged company. They've come out and
said, `We are not going to go away.' They said, `We are not like
the other dot-coms, and we are not running out of cash.' I get a
sense from the management team that they know their stock is
undervalued but there's nothing else they can do but execute their
business plan.''

LIEBERMAN COULD ATTEND SATURDAY INAUGURATION, RABBI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inauguration Day next year falls on a Saturday, the
Jewish Sabbath. But if Senator Joseph I. Lieberman is elected vice
president, he could still participate in the ceremony, his rabbi
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, observes the holiday by not working,
driving or writing from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. And the
Connecticut Democrat does vote when the Senate meets in a rare
Saturday session, by citing an exception in Jewish law that allows
work when human life or national security is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Mark Dratch of Congregation Agudath Sholom of Stamford,
Conn., said the senator's faith would not keep him from the
festivities on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly possible for him to attend the inauguration,''
Dratch said. ``I can't imagine he would ask for it to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Grand Rabbi Y.A. Korff of Zvhil-Mezbuz, an
ultra-Orthodox congregation, said, ``On a technical basis, he would
be permitted to participate because he could walk. The only
question is if it is keeping with the spirit of the Sabbath Day,
and that would be up to him to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Al Gore's campaign, said there
hasn't been any discussion whether Lieberman would participate in
Inauguration Day ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's putting the cart before the horse,'' Hattaway
said. ``We're focused on Election Day at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Amendment of the Constitution requires the president
and vice president to take office at noon on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution just requires that the president- and vice
president-elect take the oath on Jan. 20, and they can do that in a
private ceremony,'' said Donald Ritchie, an associate Senate
historian.
</P>
<P>
   If the public ceremony date were to change, it would need to be
decided quickly after the election because Congress's joint
inaugural committee has started planning the event, Ritchie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place and the date are set,'' he said. ``Presumably they
would express their concerns as soon as the election is held.''

HARLEM SCHOOL BATTLES THE ODDS AND THE BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Michigan)   By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As school districts from New York City to Dallas to
Inkster, Mich., experiment with handing over the worst schools to
private managers in a last-ditch effort to save them, the
experience of the Sisulu Children's Academy in Harlem may offer
some insight into how well this new tactic will work.
</P>
<P>
   Sisulu, founded by a Wall Street financier who half-jokingly
compares himself to the heroic, persecuted protagonist in the movie
``Gladiator,'' opened last fall. It was one of New York City's
first two charter schools (publicly subsidized yet independent),
and the only one being operated with the intention of making a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   A look back at Sisulu's first year suggests, not surprisingly,
that private management is no magic bullet. Two of 12 teachers were
let go during the year, and three will not have their contracts
renewed next year. (Administrators point out that they were able to
act decisively to remove bad teachers because there was no contract
with the teachers' union.) Sisulu went up only to second grade in
its first year, so there are no test scores to compare it with
other Harlem schools.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an obvious academic difference, at this early stage,
between Sisulu and conventional public schools, it is just what one
might expect from a school run by a businessman: Vigilance for the
bottom line and a concern for the customers _ parents and
schoolchildren _ all too rarely seen in the traditional school.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of school, every student at Sisulu (named for
the South African apartheid foe Walter Sisulu) went home carrying a
complimentary copy of one of E.D. Hirsch's ``core knowledge''
series of books. James Banks, a second grader, walked away with
``What Your Second Grader Needs to Know,'' filled with enough
lessons in history, math and literature to keep him busy all
summer. His mother was thrilled. The school also sent home a sort
of yearbook, long obsolete in most no-frills poorer elementary
schools, full of photographs of students, samples of their work and
testimonial letters from parents.
</P>
<P>
   Most Sisulu parents sent their children to this new charter
school in a search for a better education than they could find in
existing public schools, and, after the first year, most believe
they have found it. Of the 90 parents who responded to a school
survey 250 children are enrolled), 88 said Sisulu was either ``a
lot'' or ``a little'' better than the nearby public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very convinced that it's a good social mission,'' said
Steven B. Klinsky, founder of Victory Schools, the company that
manages Sisulu. ``I would like to see it get to the point where it
will cover expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky is already wealthy from his previous life as a corporate
raider and has a well-documented altruistic side: Seven years ago
he started an after-school program in the East New York section of
Brooklyn, in memory of his brother. As the head of New Mountain
Capital, a private equity firm, he certainly doesn't need to turn a
profit at Sisulu to make a living. But that doesn't mean he isn't
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Sisulu is what a loss leader might be in the retailing business,
the price of penetrating the market and achieving name-brand
recognition before expanding. To his frustration, Klinsky says, he
hasn't made a penny of profit yet.
</P>
<P>
   His company is reimbursed at the annual rate of $6,000 a
student, about 40 percent less than a conventional New York City
public school. To collect an additional $2,700 stipend for special
education, he would have to take special-ed children out of their
regular class for more than half the time, which he has refused to
do.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be prudent to buy, rather than lease, a building,
but he has not been able to fit it into his business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky says he feels like the gladiator in the movie, who,
having to fight the emperor, does so only after defeating a series
of other foes, and then while badly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, the gladiator wins, and Klinsky could,
too. In part, it's the Amazon.com principle. As the first to enter
the market, he captures as much market share as he can, making it
harder for newcomers to survive. Already, he has received
permission to start two new charter schools on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   If he's lucky, he becomes so big that the government can't get
rid of him. His constituents, the parents, will defend him; he will
lobby the government to change the financing formula. With so much
potential power, no wonder that other major lobbying group, the
United Federation of Teachers, doesn't like him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he'll be going national, and his stock will soar. Unless,
of course, it turns out that charter schools are even less of a
magic bullet than anyone thought.

`SURVIVOR' ENDGAME: AND THE WINNER IS ... 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kelly wins ``Survivor.'' But I'm probably wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's wrong about ``Survivor.'' A lot of us figured Richard
was a goner on the first week. He's still in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Gretchen was supposed to have the inside track. She
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Then a computer hacker claimed he'd found a coding glitch at the
CBS Web site revealing Gervase as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again; Gervase got the hook last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So television's best-kept secret is intact as ``Survivor''
backstabs its way toward a finale two weeks from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a big event, with the two-hour finale followed by a
one-hour town hall meeting. There will be four remaining
contestants at the start of the August 23 show.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the million-dollar jackpot will survive two
``immunity challenges'' that night, and three tribal councils.
</P>
<P>
   Let's figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant force on ``Survivor,'' since the fourth week, has
been the Tagi tribal alliance of Richard, Susan, Kelly and
sometimes Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   The last five contestants voted off the island were in the rival
Pagong tribe, all tagged by the Tagis.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday night, the only Pagong who hasn't been
gonged is Colleen, a favorite of male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Tagi alliance is shaky. Rudy is too cranky to be
reliable. Last week's preview of Wednesday's show hinted at
squabbles. Also last week, Kelly claimed to have ethical qualms
about the alliance, though in the end she voted with Richard, Susan
and Rudy to oust Gervase.
</P>
<P>
   But if the alliance members are rational, they'll keep it
together Wednesday night. It's in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   That means Colleen, who wore a ``sitting duck'' T-shirt to the
last tribal council, gets her island flame extinguished Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The other major possibility is Sean, the clueless neurologist
who last week abandoned his alphabetical-order voting scheme,
possibly because he'd soon have to vote to banish himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's one way or the other. Colleen, then Sean. Or Sean, then
Colleen. That leaves Richard, Rudy, Susan and Kelly as the four
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The other three next gang up on Rudy. He's on the wrong side of
a generation gap, and he's too opinionated. He's out, even though
the others fear he'll track them down back home and slit their
throats.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is next. Now the core members of the alliance have to
turn against each other. But Susan and Kelly are tight.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever really liked Richard anyway. Susan and Kelly must
have wondered, along with the rest of us, why Richard is the only
contestant who appears to have gained weight on the island.
</P>
<P>
   So, exit Richard. The last seven to be ejected will choose the
winner from between Susan and Kelly. Susan's own deviousness will
now stand exposed. She'll be blamed more than Kelly for everyone
else's banishments. Richard avenges himself. Kelly wins.
</P>
<P>
   My scenario is clouded by variables. I don't know who succeeds
in the remaining immunity challenges. I don't know who wins a
luxurious stay on a yacht Wednesday night, possibly triggering an
envious backlash. Richard may want to keep Sean in the mix,
figuring Sean would be easy pickings in the ``Survivor'' endgame.
Maybe the alliance falls apart prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But I do know this. Richard, Susan and their Tagi alliance will
haunt the next batch of ``Survivor'' contestants in the Australian
outback, when ``Survivor II'' reaches CBS in January.
</P>
<P>
   Those contestants will have seen the first ``Survivor.'' They'll
be loathsome from the get-go. Sixteen Richards and no prisoners.
Eee-haw.

ROBIN DAY, 76, BBC `GRAND INQUISITOR,' DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sir Robin Day, a BBC broadcaster widely known as the
``grand inquisitor'' for a relentless and searching interviewing
technique that revolutionized British television news, died on
Sunday, Aug. 6. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He died in a London hospital where he was being treated for
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, his polka dot bow ties, pin-striped suits and
beetle-browed frown at unsatisfactory answers to penetrating
questions made him one of Britain's best recognized presences.
Outsize horn-rimmed glasses framing his craggy features added to
the look of unforgiving scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival on British television in the 1950s put an end to a
deferential manner of interviewing derided since as the ``What have
you to say to a grateful nation, Prime Minister?'' style. Sir Robin
combined a prosecutorial method learned from his Oxford legal
education and his presidency of the Oxford Union debating society
with a theatrical flair more typical of a music hall showman than a
staid and reverential British news reader of the period.
</P>
<P>
   He was studiously courteous, never more so than when asking the
same question again by apologizing for not having made himself
clear in the first place. It was calculated to keep the audience on
his side, and it worked. He not only pressed his right to ask a
question, but he also insisted on a responsive answer and enforced
the demand with glowers and expressions of incredulity when he did
not get one.
</P>
<P>
   Though his approach was revolutionary, he was not. He was a
staunch monarchist with a love of politics and the law and a
respect for Parliament that led him in recent years to complain
that some of his successors were guilty of disrespect and bullying
in their treatment of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers often complained of being mauled by him on
the air. One even fled the studio in mid-interview.
</P>
<P>
   But they eventually adjusted to the robust cut-and-thrust
exchanges that have become the norm in British public affairs
broadcasting and something of a blood-rite measure of the mettle of
the modern British politician.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Thatcher, one of Sir Robin's frequent combatants,
greeted the news of his death by saying, ``Our paths often crossed,
and I always enjoyed the joust.''
</P>
<P>
   Those encounters were blunt and lively by the standards of the
times. In one of them, Sir Robin tried to curb her habit of turning
appearances on his program into political broadcasts, saying, ``Can
I get this question in, Prime Minister, because we're having an
interview, which must depend on me asking some questions
occasionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robin brought a fresh directness to the air. In a 1973
conversation with Lord Lambton, an Air Force minister who had left
office in disgrace, Sir Robin said, ``Why should a man of your
social position and charm and personality have to go to whores for
sex ?''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Day was born in Hampstead in North London, the son of a
telephone engineer. After secondary school, at the Bembridge School
on the Isle of Wight, he served from 1943 to 1947 in the Royal
Artillery in Northern Ireland and Kenya and then went to Oxford,
where he received his law degree. He practiced law only briefly
before going to Washington in 1953 to work as a press officer for
the British Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to London and answered an ad for a ``newscaster,'' a
new job description in British life, for ITN, the new commercial
Independent Television News that was being organized in the
mid-50s. In 1958, he interviewed Harold Macmillan in what The Daily
Express called ``the most vigorous cross-examination a prime
minister has been subject to in public.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Sir Robin ran unsuccessfully for Parliament from
Hereford as a Liberal, and after his defeat, he went to work for
the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He made his name on two major public affairs programs,
``Panorama,'' a topical magazine, and ``Question Time,'' which
featured a live audience and four guests from public life. He was
also the central figure in broadcasting national elections, and for
eight years he presented ``The World at 1'' on radio. At the height
of his career, he was more famous than many of the people he
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   His active career ended in 1989, and in recent years he lived
alone in an apartment near Parliament and became a fixture at the
lunch table at the venerable Garrick Club. He married Katherine
Ainslie, an Australian-born law professor at Oxford who was 17
years his junior, in 1965. The marriage ended in divorce in 1986.
The couple had two sons, Alexander and Daniel, and in his
best-selling memoir of 1989, ``Grand Inquisitor'' he dedicated
words of E. Smith, the Earl of Birkenhead, as counsel to them.
</P>
<P>
   They read, ``The world continues to offer glittering prizes to
those who have stout hearts and sharp swords.''

COMMENTARY: FOR RICHER, FOR POORER 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After working hard for many years, you and your husband have
retired with a decent income from pensions and investments. Then,
sadly, he dies. Is it fair that you should suddenly face higher tax
bills, because your deductions have been cut in half and you are
now in a higher tax bracket? In 1969 widows didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to their complaints, Congress decided to
increase the deductions offered to single adults, and raise the
incomes at which they entered higher tax brackets. Married couples
in which the husband was the dominant earner _ the norm 30 years
ago _ still paid lower taxes than they would have if unmarried, but
their advantage was reduced. Nowadays, however, there are enough
married couples with two comparable incomes that this tax break for
widows is denounced as a ``marriage tax,'' though even more couples
receive a ``marriage benefit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is that the legislation Bill Clinton
vetoed last week, which would have reduced the taxes of married
couples, was not a clear move in the direction of ``fairness.''
Widows, widowers and single people in general can justifiably claim
to have been unfairly neglected _ especially since it turns out
that most of the benefits would have gone to couples who already
pay lower taxes than they would if they were unmarried. And the
vetoed tax cut would _ surprise! _ also disproportionately help
couples who are already very well off. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So is this just another example of trickle-down economics, of
tax cuts for the affluent that are supposed to benefit the rest in
some indirect way? No: it's worse than that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You see, in the good old days conservatives used to argue that
the really important thing was to reduce the marginal tax rate, the
share of an additional dollar of income paid to Uncle Sam. If
people got to keep more of any extra money they made, so the
argument went, they would be motivated to work harder, save more,
and so on. Of course, that also meant big tax cuts for the rich _
but increasing incentives was supposed to be the point of it all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill eliminating the ``marriage penalty,'' however, doesn't
reduce marginal tax rates for its biggest beneficiaries. A married
couple earning $100,000 a year would have gotten a tax break of
around $1,700 _ seven times as much as the benefit for a couple
with half their income _ but any additional money they earn would
have been taxed at the same 28 percent rate as before. And because
the marginal rate hasn't changed, the couple have no incentive to
work harder, invest more, or any of those other good things that
tax-cutters usually promise. So this isn't even supply-side
economics; it's just a gift package for upper-middle-class
couples. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, isn't it a good thing to encourage marriage, the bedrock
of our society? Any tax expert could have told Congress that the
really serious marriage penalty in our tax code involves the
earned-income tax credit, which supplements the income of the
working poor: when low-earning workers marry, their benefits are
sharply reduced. Congress did vote a token increase in
earned-income tax credit allowances, but not nearly enough to solve
the problem. You might think that strengthening families trying to
work their way out of poverty is more important than persuading
affluent professionals not to live in sin. But I guess not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I never thought that I would miss the days of the Laffer curve,
when right-wingers used to say that lower taxes would mean higher
revenue. But back then tax cuts were rationalized by ideas, however
silly. These days the anti-tax movement seems driven only by a
carefully selective sentimentality _ one that weeps for children of
multimillionaires who don't get their full inheritance, but tells
poor mothers to go out and get a job.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it's a funny thing, but though the rationale for tax cuts
seems to have changed, the distribution of the rewards _ who gets
nothing, who gets the big benefits _ always ends up being the same.
You might think that just once, for the sake of appearances,
Congress would pass a law that provided more benefits (at least as
a percentage of income) to those earning less than $50,000 a year
than to those earning more than $150,000. But these guys are
nothing if not consistent.

 &HT;    SBC trips on supplying high-speed Internet access
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its race to become a kingpin of high-speed Internet access,
SBC Communications Inc. has stumbled over logistical and personnel
hurdles this year, alienating some of its business partners.
</P>
<P>
   One of those business partners, Jump.Net Inc. of Austin, became
so frustrated with delays and miscues that it stopped submitting
new orders to SBC for the high-speed Internet service called DSL,
or digital subscriber line.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the big San Antonio-based communications company,
acknowledged that its subsidiary, Advanced Solutions Inc., has run
into delays in installing the new service. But a spokesman said the
company has fixed most of its problems by adding more technicians
in Texas and the 12 states it serves and by changing its business
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   SBC is both a partner and a competitor to companies like
Jump.Net. It enables Jump.Net and other service providers to
deliver high-speed Internet connections over its phone lines, but
it also delivers the same service through its affiliate, Prodigy
Communications Corp., which it partly owns.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC's assurances have yet to convince Jump.Net marketing
vice president Dewey Coffman that the telephone holding company has
solved its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major fiasco right now,'' said Coffman, who said SBC's
problems include lost service orders, significant service delays,
incomplete installation and faulty installations. ``We have
hundreds of customers who are waiting for DSL service through SBC.
Some customers have been waiting three to four months. Some orders
have gotten lost three to four times.''

 &HT;    SBC trips on supplying high-speed Internet access
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its race to become a kingpin of high-speed Internet access,
SBC Communications Inc. has stumbled over logistical and personnel
hurdles this year, alienating some of its business partners.
</P>
<P>
   One of those business partners, Jump.Net Inc. of Austin, became
so frustrated with delays and miscues that it stopped submitting
new orders to SBC for the high-speed Internet service called DSL,
or digital subscriber line.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the big San Antonio-based communications company,
acknowledged that its subsidiary, Advanced Solutions Inc., has run
into delays in installing the new service. But a spokesman said the
company has fixed most of its problems by adding more technicians
in Texas and the 12 states it serves and by changing its business
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   SBC is both a partner and a competitor to companies like
Jump.Net. It enables Jump.Net and other service providers to
deliver high-speed Internet connections over its phone lines, but
it also delivers the same service through its affiliate, Prodigy
Communications Corp., which it partly owns.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC's assurances have yet to convince Jump.Net marketing
vice president Dewey Coffman that the telephone holding company has
solved its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major fiasco right now,'' said Coffman, who said SBC's
problems include lost service orders, significant service delays,
incomplete installation and faulty installations. ``We have
hundreds of customers who are waiting for DSL service through SBC.
Some customers have been waiting three to four months. Some orders
have gotten lost three to four times.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Jump.Net resells high-speed Internet service from SBC,
its Internet customers complain to it rather than to SBC.
</P>
<P>
   Such service complaints are to be expected in an emerging
industry like DSL, according to analyst Mike Lowe with Cahners
In-Stat Group.
</P>
<P>
   Both SBC and Jump.Net have a lot riding on DSL service. SBC
reported that it had more than 300,000 DSL customers this spring,
making it the largest DSL provider in the country, according to
In-Stat. The communications giant has pledged to spend $6 billion
over the next three years to make DSL service available to the bulk
of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   In-Stat projects that DSL service will mushroom from less than 1
million lines in service early this year to more than 77 million
lines in service by the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Jump.Net, among the most active Texas-based Internet service
companies in offering DSL, has several thousand high-speed
customers statewide, Coffman said. Although it has stopped
submitting new DSLorders to SBC, the Austin company is working with
two alternative companies to deliver DSL to customers.
</P>
<P>
   When SBC does connect customers to DSL service, it occasionally
connects them to the wrong Internet service company. Jump.Net's
Coffman calls that practice ``slamming'' _ or intentionally trying
to switch customers to its own service company.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC spokesman Michael Coe said his company's incorrect
service connections have been inadvertent errors and not
intentional attempts to slam.
</P>
<P>
   SBC says it fixed its most pressing DSL-related problems in June
and July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Service levels were not where we wanted them to be in June and
July,'' Coe said. ``But we have been improving and we continue to
improve. We are doing so every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Most customers who request DSL service get it within 15 days,
the Coe said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Robertson, who heads a trade group for Texas Internet
service providers, said Jump.Net's complaints are entirely
justified, but he added that SBC has made new assurances that its
installation problems will be solved soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe (SBC) is trying to live up to what they said they
would do, but it has been too big a job for them,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, SBC installers will give top priority
to installing high-speed Internet access to customers who contract
for the service with independent Internet service companies, such
as Jump.Net.
</P>
<P>
   And SBC technicians who run into problems in installing service
at house or business will try to set up an appointment with the
home or business owner to return to complete the job.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman, however, said he will only be convinced when he sees
his company's customers getting the service they were promised
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very skeptical,'' Coffman said. ``I've seen a lot of
things that were promised that didn't come to pass.''

Monday's weekend poll and Tuesday's quickie reaction to Gore's

ADVERTISING:   WOMEN ATHLETES GAIN FAME BUT MADISON AVENUE ISN'T
BUYING 
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lightning struck first in 1996, when the United States
women's soccer team won the gold at the summer Olympic Games, a
traditional generator of sports heroes. Then it happened again, a
year ago. After a month of matches, the United States women's
soccer team _ composed largely of Olympic athletes _ beat China in
a spectacular finale and captured the 1999 Women's World Cup.
Before, during and after, the nation watched, rapt, as it rarely
had for any women's team sport. Players like Mia Hamm became media
darlings, their names known to all. And Madison Avenue sat up and
paid attention.
</P>
<P>
   Or did it?
</P>
<P>
   ``With their great success on the field, it should have been a
given that great commercial success would have come to all of these
women,'' said Nova Lanktree, whose Lanktree Sports Celebrity
Network in Chicago has been matching athletes and endorsers for 15
years. ``But it hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after the triumph of Team USA and with the start of the
2000 summer Games only weeks away, prospects are indisputably
better than they once were. But it seems that when it comes to
women and product endorsements, sex still sells better than
athletic prowess on the playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Anna Kournikova, the pretty 19-year-old tennis player
whose looks have earned her an estimated $11 million to $15 million
in endorsement contracts despite a lackluster record on the
professional circuit.
</P>
<P>
   While Kournikova is only ranked 19th in the world, her earnings
are about equal to those of the top-seeded player, Martina Hingis,
who has won millions in tournament money. Kournikova, in fact, came
in first in income among female athletes on Forbes' Celebrity 100
list. Indeed, her endorsement contracts put her ahead of more
accomplished athletes like Monica Seles ($7.5 million in annual
income) and Venus and Serena Williams ($5 million and $6 million,
respectively).
</P>
<P>
   Even Kournikova could not come close to earning what the men
did, like Tiger Woods ($47 million), Michael Jordan ($40 million)
and even the 70-year-old Arnold Palmer ($19 million).
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Simple economics. ``For an advertiser, the most important
element is visibility,'' Lanktree said. ``And in sports, women are
just not as visible.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is one of marketability, according to Lanktree, not
sexism, Kournikova's obvious use of sex appeal to get endorsement
contracts notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of women's sports that are on par with
respect to attendance and money,'' said Jackie Thomas, the director
of women's marketing at Nike, in Beaverton, Ore., which uses many
female athletes to promote its footwear and athletic apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endorsement payments are based on market value,'' Thomas said,
``whether it's a man or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, of course, that no woman athlete has
achieved success in advertising on par with men, or that women
cannot go beyond the sports clothing endorsements to which most
have been limited in the past. Nike, for example, uses Hamm, the
soccer player, to promote products that ``transcend the gender
line,'' as Thomas put it, and has in fact named one of the
buildings on its Beaverton campus headquarters in her honor. And
Gatorade, sold by Quaker Oats, recently introduced a campaign
titled American Woman, with a television spot featuring Hamm,
Chamique Holdsclaw, a star of the Women's National Basketball
Association, Billie Jean King, the tennis legend, and Marion Jones,
the champion runner.
</P>
<P>
   The Gatorade campaign is aimed at all consumers, not just women,
as are other ads for Gatorade, featuring male athletes like Derek
Jeter, Peyton Manning and Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But that commercial is still the exception. Usually, advertisers
who use female athletes do so because they are seeking to reach
women. For instance, General Mills for its Multi-Grain Cheerios
cereal just signed a three-year sponsorship deal with the Ladies
Professional Golf Association because the market for the product is
``women over 25,'' according to a General Mills spokesman, Greg
Zimprich, who are a ``perfect fit demographically'' with the
women's golf tour.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the ballyhooed case of Kournikova. She has
endorsement contracts with Charles Schwab and Adidas, among others,
and was the subject of a cover article in Sports Illustrated in
June. The cheesecake layout accompanying the article led to
criticism of her for perpetuating the stereotype of women as sex
objects to the detriment of other female athletes who may be better
at their sports but not as conventionally attractive.
</P>
<P>
   But Kournikova has her defenders. ``One of the beauties of being
a woman today is that you can be a lot of different things,'' said
Thomas at Nike, who said she believed that glamour is one of the
many options that should be afforded to female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lieberman-Cline, coach of the WNBA Detroit Shock and
president of the nonprofit Women's Sports Foundation, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Though she called the Kournikova example an ``isolated
situation,'' Lieberman-Cline said that if ``playing off her looks''
is what Kournikova wants to do, she has the right to ``project her
image any way she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite lingering inequalities, Lieberman-Cline said, things are
``absolutely better than they were before.'' She ought to know: a
member of the United States women's basketball team that won a
silver medal at the 1976 Olympics, she was at the time one of only
a few women athletes to obtain nationwide recognition and
substantial product endorsements with companies like Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and Jordache.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day, it was Nancy or nothing,'' Lieberman-Cline said,
adding: ``That's really changed. Now I could rattle off the names
of dozens of female athletes who are highly marketable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very empowering to be a woman in sports these days.''

 &HT;    North Carolina site offers cool, clear water and resort-caliber
fun
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LURE, N.C. _ It's been 13 years since this laid-back little
town, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains around a
pristine 1,500-acre lake, doubled as New York's Catskills in the
film ``Dirty Dancing.'' Thirteen years since Patrick Swazye,
Jennifer Grey and the rest of the cast and crew took up temporary
residence at the historic Lake Lure Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 1987 coming-of-age drama _ which seems to be running
at least three times a week this summer on TBS _ remains the area's
primary claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Take an hourlong pontoon boat cruise from Lake Lure Marina, and
your guide will point out the very spot where Swayze taught Grey
the finer points of, um, dancing.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also learn that ``A Breed Apart'' (1984) _ with Powers
Boothe as a mountain climber up to no good, Rutger Hauer as a
conservationist and Kathleen Turner as a fishing supply store owner
_ was filmed here. So were scenes from ``Firestarter'' (1984) with
Drew Barrymore and, more recently, ``The Last of the Mohicans''
(1992) with Daniel Day-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story of how one man's dream to build an upscale
resort in Hickory Nut Gorge was dashed by the Depression is far
more dramatic than any Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the turn of the century, Missouri physician Lucius
B. Morse came to the mountains seeking relief from tuberculosis.
Next thing you know, he was the proud owner of a giant granite
monolith called Chimney Rock and 64 surrounding acres. He began to
envision a sparkling mountain lake that would be the centerpiece of
the state's largest resort.
</P>
<P>
   He convinced Rutherford County leaders to dam the Rocky Broad
River and build a hydroelectric plant. By 1925, he had his
1,500-acre lake and was ready to proceed with his resort with
``five golf courses, two bathing beaches, amusement piers, fleets
of motor boats, stables, polo, fishing, athletic fields and much
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the stock market crash of 1929. Morse's money was gone
_ along with his dream.
</P>
<P>
   While the Morse family still owns Chimney Rock, now a popular
attraction in the gorge, a string of businessmen and corporations
has bought and sold the property around the lake. Wealthy folk have
bought lots and built homes _ many quite grand _ along the shores.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the top end of the lake, is the Lake Lure Golf &AMP; Beach
Resort, an upscale getaway owned by Fairfield Communities. The
sprawling resort _ not a far cry from what Morse imagined _ boasts
condo villas and resort homes for rent, two 18-hole golf courses
(Apple Valley and Bald Mountain), four tennis courts, a sandy beach
and marina, three swimming pools and a lakefront restaurant as well
as a golf bar and grill.
</P>
<P>
   The south end of the lake, hugged by U.S. 64-74A, is an
easygoing resort anchored by the circa-1927 Lake Lure Inn, a
50-room hotel across the highway from the Beach at Lake Lure.
Nearby is the marina, where you can rent boats, take a narrated
lake tour or enjoy a lazy stroll along a trail that skirts the
water, pausing to feed the panhandling ducks.
</P>
<P>
   We have come to the lake on a day trip from Hendersonville,
about 20 miles away. Our outing begins with a tour led by Capt.
Richie Cunningham, who introduces himself with the quip, ``That's
my real name. That guy you see on TV is an imposter.''
</P>
<P>
   He begins his spiel with the tidbit that ``National Geographic
calls this one of the 10 most beautiful man-made lakes in the
world,'' then proceeds to tell us the story of Morse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paid 25 cents to ride a mule to the top of Chimney Rock,
where he envisioned a lake and hotel,'' says Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he informs us we are directly above the spot where a
church in the community of Buffalo stood. Before the town was
flooded, the 80-foot steeple was taken off the top of the church.
It now rises heavenward atop the First Baptist Church of Chimney
Rock. We can catch a glimpse of it on the way back.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the story of how Snake Island was cleared of
snakes. Cunningham says six pigs were left on the island for 18
months to do the extermination job. ``The good news was the snakes
were gone,'' says Cunningham, ``but those six pigs had become 20
pigs that weighed 400 pounds each, and they couldn't get them off
the island.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that Elvis once owned a house on the island, also
called Yacht Island. ``Some people think he's still there,''
Cunningham says, completely serious, ``but I pass here every day
and I've never seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   When our cruise ends, the sun is high over the gorge and we're
ready to hit the lake. We spend the next few hours lazing on the
beach, hopping quickly across the hot sand to splash into the cool,
clear, blue-green water.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd is a mixed bag of locals and tourists, a cross section
of Americana, who've brought blankets, folding chairs and coolers
filled with soft drinks and picnic fixings. A NASCAR race roars on
a nearby radio. A chubby toddler gleefully kicks a beach ball
across the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing exclusive or pretentious here, simply an old-fashioned
but well-maintained mountain retreat _ a good place to kick back.
And in the fall, one can just imagine the glorious palette of color
that will paint the scenic gorge.
</P>
<P>
   Day's end finds us dining on pecan-encrusted trout and crab
cakes at Larkin's on the Lake, which, as the name implies, has a
nice lake view.
</P>
<P>
   After supper, as twilight settles over the gorge, we drive
around the east side of the lake to check out Lodge on Lake Lure, a
rustic but elegant bed-and-breakfast inn, and around to the north
to see the sprawling Fairfield resort.
</P>
<P>
   It's dark by the time we head back to our inn in nearby
Hendersonville, discussing whether we would rather stay at the
hotel, bed-and-breakfast or resort _ or all of the above _ during a
future visit.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they don't have the place tied up with filming a
``Dirty Dancing'' sequel that TBS can show over and over, say, in
2013.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   Take I-85 north to U.S. 25 just east of Greenville, S.C. Go
north, pick up U.S. 64 in Hendersonville, N.C., and travel
northeast to U.S. 74A. Turn right and travel through Bat Cave and
Chimney Rock to Lake Lure. About a four-hour drive from Atlanta.

<TEXT>
<P>
   America wants to grow up. Underneath the barbs and platitudes,
that is the theme of this presidential campaign. Maybe it came out
of polls. But probably not. It has the ring of an unexpected truth,
the kind of thing a speechwriter, or even a candidate, sometimes
intuits and finds a way to express.
</P>
<P>
   The theme got under way with Bill Bradley's candidacy, which was
about the idea that a prosperous America could afford to pursue
higher goals through politics. Bradley proposed that self-interest
left people cold in the end, and that economically comfortable
voters were looking for ways to reduce poverty, create equality of
opportunity and address racial division. We'd had our good times,
and now was the time to act like adults.
</P>
<P>
   The growing-up issue survived the Bradley campaign. Karenna Gore
Schiff, a visible spokeswoman for her father, has made her
trademark a call to her peers to surrender their ``ironic
detachment,'' the emblematic adolescent attitude, and dare to get
passionate about presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has defused questions about his own maturity by
appearing front and center in the campaign for national adulthood.
His acceptance speech at the Republican Convention took over
Bradley's theme wholesale. Bush, who by several accounts finished
his adolescence some 20 years after many of his peers, couched his
``prosperity with a purpose'' theme in an exhortation to his
generation to prove itself, to ``reclaim some essential values, to
show we have grown up before we grew old.''
</P>
<P>
   His generation ``tested limits'' in its youth, he said, but is
now coming to ``a responsibility era.'' That phrase animated the
final minutes of Bush's speech and captured his idea that
individuals, religious organizations, corporations and presidents
must temper their appetites and self-interest with a sense of duty
to children, neighbors, the needy, the nation, the natural world.
Everyone must begin acting like a grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gore seemed to answer Bush's challenge by naming a
running mate who is more associated with positions of moral
responsibility than almost any other politician today. In fact, if
there has been a criticism of Sen. Joseph Lieberman this week, it
is that he becomes sanctimonious about higher purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of adulthood is resonant for more than one reason.
The most obvious is the adolescent behavior of the Clinton
administration. These eight years have seen undisciplined
appetites, ceaseless experiments with looks and attitudes, and a
desperation to please that sometimes reverses itself into towering
arrogance. People learn to expect these irritations from their
children, but not from their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper reason is the widespread perception that, indeed,
prosperity is not enough. People who have provided for themselves
and their families are looking for ways to contribute to larger
communities, to give back and to put new meaning in their work.
Others are noticing that, as the country's wealth increases, its
inequalities grow more stark and unsettling. People worry that
``They got rich and threw a lot of parties'' is not history's
highest benediction.
</P>
<P>
   Many young voters take personal maturity and responsibility
seriously. Children of divorce, now coming to adulthood in force,
object to both hasty marriages and self-indulgent departures. Even
anti-sweatshop activists and youthful union organizers read up on
personal investment and build accounts for retirement, their
children's education, or just security. Thirty years ago this would
have seemed premature middle age. Today it has become common-sense
behavior. It is always reassuring to hear politicians echo common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a risk for candidates in too loudly enunciating the
politics of adulthood. Personal responsibility is as desirable in
citizens and leaders as in friends and family. But the main work of
politics is not to produce virtue, and personal virtue does not of
itself produce good politics. Saying that corporations must be
``responsible to leave the air and waters clean,'' as Bush did in
his acceptance speech, is a reason to pass strong and efficient
environmental laws, not a substitute for them.
</P>
<P>
   Politics matters because government enables us to do things
together that none of us could do alone: protect the environment,
keep the workplace safe, guard public health, and address poverty
and inequality on a national scale. Leading decent, successful
lives may not, by itself, make a good society.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely why so many people now feel that prosperity is
not enough. When politicians only urge us to lead better lives, and
promise to do the same themselves, they may end up amplifying the
discontent that they set out to solve.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I have often been asked how it is that Joe
Lieberman and I are frequent allies in the Senate. We wrote, along
with former Sen. Dan Coats, legislation to provide vouchers to
disadvantaged children in the public schools of the District of
Columbia. We have repeatedly joined in calling on Hollywood to stop
producing vulgar and violent entertainment. We co-sponsored a law
providing humanitarian help to religious groups being persecuted in
southern Sudan. Away from Capitol Hill, we are honorary co-chairmen
of the Healthy Culture Initiative, which promotes charities and
social projects _ including those that are faith-based _ in local
communities.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect Lieberman has been asked as often as I have how we
work together so easily. He is a Jewish Democrat from the
Northeast; I am a Christian Republican from the Midwest. But our
frequent collaboration is, I believe, based on more than a
collegial professional relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when families of all faiths feel their values are
under attack, Lieberman and I are part of a political alliance that
is quite logically emerging between theologically orthodox
Christians and Jews. Certainly, there are significant differences
in outlook. But there is one sense where these two groups clearly
and strongly agree: We share a belief in universal Truths, in a
moral order ordained by God and discovered, not created, by man.
That shared conviction often translates into similar ideas of how
to improve our laws and our society.
</P>
<P>
   On many issues, including Social Security reform, supporting
missile defense and tort reform, Lieberman has followed his
conscience across party lines, making his record on these issues
more conservative than Al Gore's. It remains to be seen how the two
men's differences will play out as the presidential campaign takes
off in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Including Lieberman on the ticket does give much-needed
integrity and decorum to the Democrats. History and experience
shows us, however, that the vice president's principles and
positions are subsumed by the president's agenda. If we are to
renew our culture and restore honor to the presidency, leadership
will have to come from the top of the ticket.

IRAN'S LAST MAJOR REFORMIST NEWSPAPER IS CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's last major reformist newspaper was closed
by the hardline judiciary Tuesday, two days after the country's
supreme leader intervened to block legislation aimed at restoring a
free press.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Parliament, hundreds of hardliners demonstrated for a
second day, demanding the expulsion of pro-reform deputies who
objected to the action by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's top
religious leader who has final say in state issues.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, Bahar, a popular daily, one of 23 publications shut
since April, was ordered closed for ``disturbing public opinion.''
Its publisher, Saeed Pourazizi, a close aide to President Mohammad
Khatami, a reformist, was charged with printing ``a fake interview
at a sensitive time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahar, which means ``spring,'' had lasted less than three
months. It appeared after a crackdown on independent newspapers
that had helped reformist candidates win the parliamentary
elections in February. Reformist politicians promised voters that
the new Parliament would overturn the restrictive press and social
laws enacted by its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Khamenei denounced the proposed revision in the
press law as a threat to national security and religion. The
Parliament had to drop the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists, stunned at the ayatollah's last-minute intervention,
held emergency meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bahar published an interview with Ahamad Pournejati,
a member of Parliament, who said the reformers would seek a way to
pursue the bill. A hardline newspaper, Keyan, asserted that Bahar
had faked the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pournejati, a leader of the effort to revise the press law,
resigned Tuesday as chairman of the Parliament's Commission for
Culture, to protest the attacks on the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason behind the commission's attempt was nothing except
fulfilling its lawful and legitimate duty toward honorable people
who are the major owners of this system,'' Pournejati told the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned hours before Bahar was closed and as supporters of
Khamenei demonstrated outside Parliament. Dressed in white funeral
shrouds, to show their willingness to die, the protesters carried
banners that backed the supreme leader and criticized reformist
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to become martyr,'' they chanted. ``The Parliament
is no place for traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The current press law allows the courts, which hardliners
dominate, to close newspapers at will. This week, a provincial
journal, Cheshmeh Ardebil, was shut, and Ahamd Zeidabadi, a
journalist with a reformist newspaper, was arrested. A publisher
and two journalists were also summoned to court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But reformers pledge to carry on their campaign. Other lawmakers
expressed dismay at being barred from voting on the press bill, but
they also said they were confident that some progress might yet be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Elaheh Koulai, a reformist deputy, said: ``The bill is not dead
yet. We can change the parts that the leader is concerned with in a
way that people and the Parliament would be satisfied, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker of Parliament, Mehdi Karoubi, a veteran
revolutionary recently turned reformer, insisted Tuesday that the
Parliament consider the press bill ``over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our duty to obey the leader's order,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The independent press has been an important vehicle for the
reform movement since Khatami's election three years ago.
Publishers have started papers as old ones were shut. Eight new
publishing licenses have been issued by the pro-reform Ministry for
Culture and Islamic Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will legally press for reform in rational ways,'' said
Pourazizi, the publisher who despite the closing of his paper
expressed hope. ``Reform is not a hasty movement. We must be
persistent and patient.''

   Responding to demonstrations against a Guanajuato state bill

VERIZON STRIKE VANDALISM, VIOLENCE INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As 85,000 telephone workers enter the third day of a strike at
Verizon Communications, a group of religious, legal and labor
advocates say they will demand a meeting with managers at the
company's wireless unit in Woburn, Mass. to discuss the alleged
harassment of nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, company officials reported that police are
investigating 455 acts of vandalism and violence, including severed
cables and rock throwing. In some cases, managers who are
substituting for front-line workers since the walkout began Sunday,
were pelted with eggs and rotten fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rabe, vice president of communications at Verizon, said
two-thirds of the incidents took place in New York City, where more
than 1,000 picketers took part in a mass rally in lower Manhattan
this week. Rabe said the company sought a court injunction to limit
the number of pickets at each exit or entrance to four.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to
the prosecution of strikers who have tampered with company property
or physically harassed any of the 30,000 managers who are
substituting for the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represent
15,000 telephone operators, customer service representatives, cable
installers, and maintenance technicians in Massachusetts, struck
Verizon Communications over job security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the unions are seeking the right to
automatically sign up employees of Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary,
without going through the union election process. The voluntary
plan, called a card check neutrality agreement, is a reaction to
prior court appeals by other employers who were challenging union
election results.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has said in the past that it is against the unionization
of the wireless unit because increased labor costs would limit its
ability to compete with new, nimble startups and established
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the company confirmed that cables had been cut
and some managers were harassed by strikers as they drove to work
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state union official said that while negotiators were
hashing out the details of a card check neutrality agreement,
Verizon Wireless managers were distributing a memo to 48 wireless
workers in the Union Park office complex in Woburn designed to
dissuade them from supporting a union.
</P>
<P>
   The memo obtained by the Globe posed the following questions and
answers:
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Can the union guarantee improvement of wages or benefits?''
</P>
<P>
   A. ``No. The union cannot guarantee improvement in wages or
benefits without agreement from the company. Afterall, it is the
company - not the union - that signs employee paychecks.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Do I have to sign and return the union authorization card
to the union?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Absolutely not. You have every right to refuse to sign the
card.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said in a teleconference that the memo was intended to
answer questions about the impact of unionization on their wages,
benefits, and jobs. He said the intention was to inform rather than
intimidate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the National Labor Relations began taking
statements from wireless workers who claim in a complaint filed
July 13 that they were threatened with discharge if they talked
about union organizing while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jobs with Justice, a coalition of community, union
and religious groups, is scheduled to hold a press conference
Wednesday at IBEW Local 1505 in Woburn to discuss alleged
harassment at the wireless unit. ``We want the word to go out that
workers have the right to organize in the United States and, even
subtle attempts to intimidate them, are not welcomed,'' said
Jonathan Fine, director of the Interfaith Committee for Worker
Justice in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One worker said in an interview that a manager told her he would
``get rid'' of her if she spoke to any of her colleagues about the
unions while on company property.
</P>
<P>
   CWA representative Steve Early said union officials sent the
memo to negotiators in Washington ``so they can talk to the company
about curbing this kind of management behavior.''

 &HT;    New Democratic ticket gets UAW endorsement

<P>
   Nashville, Tenn. _ Under a sweltering sun Tuesday, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman basked in the historic moment of becoming the nation's
first Jewish vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Dream is alive and it is well,'' the Connecticut
Democrat told a cheering crowd at a downtown plaza after being
introduced by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments about his choice of Lieberman to be
his running mate, Gore called his friend of 15 years a man
dedicated to helping average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and I come from different regions and different religious
faiths, but we believe in a common set of ideals, and we both
believe with our whole resolve that, as Americans, we must make
real the great ideal that we are one country with a common
destiny,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The new ticket got some good news Tuesday. The United Auto
Workers endorsed Gore after months of sharp criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yokich, president of the 1.3 million-member union, said
in a statement, ``It's no secret that we disagree _ and disagree
sharply. ... Yet even on trade, where we don't see eye to eye, Al
Gore is better, much better, than George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued his first comment on Lieberman, saying he respected
``his convictions, his strong faith, and his record on Social
Security, missile defense and reforming our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he will run a positive campaign and that the vice
president will use this opportunity to change his tone to that of
Senator Lieberman's level,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nashville rally, Gore emphasized the historic moment by
recalling that when John F. Kennedy, a Catholic, was nominated in
1960 in Los Angeles _ where Gore will be nominated next week _ the
nation ``voted with our hearts to make history by tearing down an
old wall of division.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we nominate Joe Lieberman for vice president, we will
make history again,'' Gore said. ``We will tear down an old wall of
division once again.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Gore's voice cracked with emotion as he described
how Lieberman came South during the Civil Rights movement to
register African-Americans to vote, quoting Lieberman as having
written at the time, ``I am going because there is much work to be
done. I am an American, and this is one nation or it is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally afforded voters the first opportunity to see Lieberman
and Gore together as the ticket that will challenge Bush and his
running mate, Dick Cheney. The two Democrats plan three days of
campaigning together in Connecticut, Georgia and Pennsylvania
before next week's Democratic National Conventio to pledge his
allegiance to Gore _ a man he called the most accomplished vice
president in the nation's history _ and to introduce himself to
voters as a man of deep moral convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for bringing me
to this extraordinary moment in my life,'' Lieberman said. ``And Al
Gore, I thank you for making this miracle possible for me and
breaking this barrier for the rest of America forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting Gore's latest campaign theme, Lieberman called the fall
election a choice between the new guard and the old guard. He
pledged to pursue an agenda focused on economic growth, balanced
budgets and midd. ``But it makes me feel that I have a mission to
go out and help this man get elected.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a Democratic fund-raiser last month at the
Manhattan apartment of the singer Paul Simon, Vice President Al
Gore was introduced by Connecticut's senators, Christopher Dodd and
Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   After some preliminary remarks about the strength of the economy
and the old ideas of Republicans, Gore began to bash big oil and
big insurance companies, a staple nowadays of his stump speech.
``We need to give the medical decisions back to the doctors, and
take them away from the accountants and the HMO's and the insurance
companies,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Gore uttered the words ``insurance companies,''
several of the people in Simon's living room snickered loudly.
Insurance is to Connecticut what oil is to Oklahoma, what
automobiles are to Michigan, what tobacco is to Kentucky. And
Lieberman has been a staunch ally of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   On a broad array of issues, Lieberman is perceived as a
business-friendly Democrat. On some issues, including those that
affect the insurance industry, he has been much more of a business
ally than Gore. This could help the Democratic ticket in its fund
raising and in reassuring corporate leaders who are nervous about
Gore's environmental views.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lieberman is one of a handful of Democrats who
support legislation to limit the amount of damages that can be
collected from lawsuits. Such legislation has been at the top of
corporate America's Washington wish list for more than a decade.
Insurance companies have led the battle in favor of it. Trial
lawyers, among the Democratic Party's biggest contributors, have
led the fight against the limits on damages. Lieberman has always
been on the side of the insurance business. Gore has always been
with the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider Mr. Lieberman a friend of the insurance
industry,'' said Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the American Council
of Life Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Lieberman has regularly voted for increases
in the Pentagon's budget. Two major defense contractors, General
Dynamics Corp. and the United Technologies Corp., have plants in
Connecticut that employ thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been an ally of other companies that Gore has
blasted in recent speeches, including pharmaceutical companies.
Several, including the Bayer Corp., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and
Pfizer Inc., have operations in Connecticut. In 1997, when the
Senate was considering legislation to reauthorize the Food and Drug
Administration, Lieberman was among the few Democrats who voted on
the side of the drug industry on important amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been rewarded for this support with campaign
donations. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
organization that tracks campaign money, reported on Tuesday that
Lieberman had received more money from the insurance interests for
his Senate race this year than any other senator ($197,419), and
more from pharmaceutical interests ($91,150) than any other senator
except Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Finance
Committee's subcommittee on health. Lieberman has also received
nearly $100,000 from political action committees and individuals
connected to defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Lieberman has been a standard bearer
for important industries in his state. A politician who did not do
that would not last very long in office.
</P>
<P>
   But as Democrats go, Lieberman has been quite friendly to
business generally. Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the United
States Chamber of Commerce, said that in his two terms in the
Senate, Lieberman had voted on the side of business interests more
than almost any other Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is a vigorous supporter of international trade, a
position similar to Gore's but different from many Democrats, and
he is one of the few Democrats in the Senate who favors a reduction
in the capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, Lieberman is hailed as the senator who saved
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, accounting rulemakers considered changing the
accounting procedures for stock options in a way that would have
reduced the reported profits of companies that granted options to
executives and other employees. It was one of the first
congressional issues to attract lobbying from executives in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lieberman pushed through the Senate a nonbinding
resolution that denounced the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
the arbiter of accounting procedures, for trying to change the
rules. Then he introduced legislation to restrict the authority of
the board. After that, the board backed down.
</P>
<P>
   In part for his role in the options fight, the American
Electronic Association, a trade group of technology companies,
named Lieberman to the ``high-tech legislative hall of fame.'' Gore
considers the high-tech community an important constituency and has
held many fund-raising events and meetings with its executives.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's record in support of business interests could help
Democratic fund raising for the fall campaign. ``Senator
Lieberman's record on fiscal responsibility and issues with regard
to business generally has been very strong, very moderate and ought
to be very attractive to the business community,'' said Joel
Jankowsky, who heads the lobbying arm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer
&AMP; Feld, a Washington law firm.
</P>
<P>
   There is a business constituency that remains nervous about
Lieberman: Hollywood. Entertainment executives, one of the
Democratic Party's most important cash constituencies, are
concerned about his embrace of the V-chip and his alliance with
William Bennett, the former education secretary under President
Ronald Reagan, in denouncing excessive violence and sex in movies,
television and music. But that will not stop entertainment
executives from organizing lavish parties for the Democratic ticket
next week at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.

CHILE'S HIGH COURT ENDS PINOCHET'S IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs for rewriting and additional information and quotes; story
grows by abourt 330 words)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Chilean Supreme Court issued its ruling
Tuesday to divest Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his senatorial immunity,
removing a giant legal hurdle to charging the former dictator with
involvement in the kidnapping, torture and murder of thousands of
people during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which was widely expected, was greeted here
with the uncorking of bottles of champagne by hundreds of cheering
demonstrators, who waved black-and-white photographs of their dead
or missing loved ones. It also provoked some thinly veiled sniping
between President Ricardo Lagos _ the first Socialist to govern
Chile since the Pinochet coup overthrew President Salvador Allende
in 1973 _ and the army commander, who strongly defended the former
dictator's place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is still a long way from serving time in prison, or
even being tried. Conservative lawmakers said they would introduce
legislation exempting him from facing a trial because of his
health. He has diabetes and circulatory problems and has had three
recent strokes.
</P>
<P>
   His family also takes the position that he should not stand
trial because of these illnesses. The family said Tuesday that it
would fight a legal battle to prevent Pinochet, 84, from being
examined to determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial,
which the family considers humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his status as a retired general, Pinochet has the
right to choose the location of his interrogation by prosecutors.
That privilege could allow him to specify that his questioning take
place within a military building in an attempt to pit the armed
forces against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Tuesday's decision was more than symbolic in
importance because it will likely lead to the prosecution of dozens
of other retired military and police officers for the executions
and disappearances of more than 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not only stripped Pinochet of his immunity but it
also ratified a new legal doctrine that considers anyone who
disappeared during the dictatorship and has not been found to be a
kidnapping victim. Since the kidnapping would be considered still
in progress, as the new legal interpretation goes, it could not be
covered by an amnesty decreed while Pinochet was still in power.
The amnesty granted immunity for political crimes committed during
the early years of his government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is serving as the prosecutor, has based
his case against Pinochet on the workings of a death squad led by
aides close to him in the first months after the 1973 coup. The
death squad has been held responsible for the disappearance of
scores of people, 19 of whom are still missing and therefore are
considered kidnapping victims.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision provoked a bitter polemic between Lagos and
Gen. Ricardo Izurieta. Since he replaced Pinochet as commander in
chief of the army in early 1998, Izurieta has attempted both to
coexist with two civilian presidents and to keep right-wing
elements at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Izurieta visited Pinochet at his home on the outskirts of
Santiago shortly after the decision was announced Tuesday, saying,
``The Chilean army wanted to express its support at this difficult
time.'' When asked by reporters if his visit had the government's
approval, he shot back, ``As commander in chief, I do what I have
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Izurieta by name or criticizing his visit,
Lagos went on television and clearly responded to the general's
remarks, saying, ``The command of our country rests on what I
decide.'' He added, ``Today our obligation is to respect the judges
and guard our own conduct as the world is watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days top military commanders had warned that a ruling
against Pinochet could inhibit military officials from coming
forward with information about those who had disappeared _
something the military pledged earlier this year that it would do.
But Tuesday, Izurieta said the armed forces would comply with its
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers and other supporters contended that the court
decision was totally political because, they said, everyone knew
that the people who had disappeared were dead and that many could
not ever be found because their bodies had been dumped into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absurd decision based on a falsehood,'' said Sen.
Jorge Martinez Bush, a conservative ally of the former dictator.
``This is a judicial fiction that will freeze the relationship
between the civilian leadership and the military.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14-6 Supreme Court vote upholding a lower court ruling was
more one-sided than the tally was reported to be a week ago, when
the outcome of the secret deliberations of the country's highest
court was reported in some detail in the local press.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important precedent for the entire world that human
rights is a basic foundation of democracy,'' said Juan Bustos, one
of the lawyers who argued before the court in favor of stripping
the immunity that General Pinochet was granted when he became a
senator for life in 1998, under a provision in the Constitution
written during his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman will now lead a formal criminal investigation against the
former dictator. The prosecutor has not made clear how he will
proceed, but he is expected to order that Pinochet undergo medical
tests to assess his mental fitness to face trial. Then he will
probably demand that the retired general answer a series of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 157 criminal claims filed against Pinochet in
the last several years by various human rights groups, families of
those who disappeared and torture victims. But the case against him
picked up momentum only after he was arrested in London two years
ago on a Spanish warrant. He has faced a swirl of legal troubles
ever since he was released by the British authorities for health
reasons, and allowed to return home in March.

LOW-INCOME AMERICANS HARD HIT BY RISING ENERGY COSTS

   BROOKLYN, Iowa _ Every weekday, Darrell Messersmith helps his
wife, Donna, into their 1989 Chevrolet Caprice, loads her
wheelchair and cane into the trunk and drives 22 miles to a
hospital in Grinnell. Since having a stroke in May, Donna
Messersmith, who is 54, has spent a few hours there each afternoon
learning to walk and talk again.
</P>
<P>
   Once middle class, the couple was already sliding down the
economic ladder, living on Darrell Messersmith's $1,300 monthly
disability check after he was hurt on the job a few years back. So
when gasoline prices spiked to $1.80 here this summer, the 220
miles a week of commuting to the hospital took food out of their
mouths. And with natural-gas prices projected to drive the heating
bill up by almost 50 percent this winter, the Messersmiths expect
to cut deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get all the food we want,'' said Darrell Messersmith,
55. ``We've eliminated almost all meat. We will probably cut back
more on food. That's the first place you cut back on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Messersmiths are among millions of low-income Americans, the
rural and urban poor alike, who are untouched by the flourishing
economy and, as a result, unprotected from the effects of rising
fuel and utility prices.
</P>
<P>
   The middle class and the affluent _ despite significant
increases in the cost of gasoline, heating fuels and electricity
after years of relatively low prices _ in the main have not changed
their driving habits or let their homes become uncomfortably warm.
Indeed, their seemingly insatiable demand for fuel has helped push
prices even higher.
</P>
<P>
   But for the poor, mounting fuel prices and heating bills inflict
painful choices, especially in cities without adequate public
transportation and in small towns and suburbs where distances make
driving a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, according to a new study by the state Department of
Human Rights, many low-income families who faced higher rates for
natural gas during last year's relatively mild winter cut back on
food, health care, phones and electricity to pay for heat. With
prices rising, the department says that situation could worsen this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low-income people feel the most pain, whether we're looking at
heating oil or gasoline or what we expect with natural gas in the
winter,'' said Dan Reicher, assistant energy secretary and head of
the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just economic impacts,'' Reicher said, ``but over the
last few years, we've seen real human impact. People have had to
choose between heating and eating.''
</P>
<P>
   High utility and gasoline bills have begun to erode the budgets
of the poor at a time when federal assistance programs have shrunk.
This year, Congress allocated $1.1 billion to the Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Program, which helps poor families with heating
bills and home repairs improve energy efficiency. That is about
half the financing the program received in 1985 _ only 33 percent,
if inflation is taken into account. The program has no budget for
determining how many people need aid, or how many are going
without.
</P>
<P>
   Those most vulnerable to fuel price increases are people on
fixed incomes, like retirees, and the working poor, most of whom
receive little or no state assistance.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, where electric bills have more than doubled in the
last 45 days, about 27 percent of the 900,000 families affected by
the higher prices fall into these groups.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, deregulation has freed utilities to raise electric
rates an average of 30 percent this summer. Mike Zevon has moved in
with his disabled mother in the Forest Hills, section of Queens,
New York City, for fear she could not make ends meet on her monthly
assistance payment of $490.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,400 a month that Zevon takes home from his job as a
social worker helps. But the family's electric bill more than
doubled, to $240, last month, and gasoline in the neighborhood has
risen to $1.99 a gallon, from $1.49 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the week, we scrounge for change to fill the
tank,'' Zevon, 29, said.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze will get tighter on low-income New Yorkers in
October, when annual rent increases go into effect for
rent-stabilized apartments. After authorizing increases of 2
percent to 4 percent each of the last four years, the city's Rent
Guidelines Board voted a 4 percent to 6 percent rise this year,
based primarily on the higher cost of heating oil. The decision
affects about 600,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cooler-than-normal temperatures have allowed the northern
Midwest, including Iowa, to escape high utility bills so far this
summer. But the region has weathered some of the steepest increases
in fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   In May, just as Donna Messersmith was felled by her stroke,
gasoline in Brooklyn rose to about $1.80 a gallon; Darrell
Messersmith, a former truck driver, was spending about $400 a month
to visit his wife at a hospital in Des Moines, about 75 miles east.
The price of gasoline has since declined all over the region,
falling to about $1.49 a gallon, but that is 40 cents a gallon more
than he paid a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   High gasoline prices in the Midwest prompted the federal
government to investigate accusations of price-gouging by oil
companies. But most analysts believe that gasoline prices have
risen mainly because of the demand bred by economic growth.
Salaries have grown faster than the rate of inflation, which means
consumers can afford more. So while Americans grumble about fuel
prices, the most recent survey of motorists by the American
Automobile Association indicated that few are driving less.
</P>
<P>
   And though the affluent use more energy in their homes, the poor
bear the impact of higher prices. In 1998, a middle-class family
spent 2.6 percent of its net income on heating bills, according to
the federal heating assistance program, while the typical
low-income family spent 10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, the Department of Human Rights study found that
low-income residents last winter devoted nearly 20 percent of their
income to heating costs; the Messersmiths, for example, spent 19
percent of their income on propane for their home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the country, there's an affordability crisis among
low-income people,'' said Jerry McKim, the author of the Iowa
report.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa study, released in June, more than 12 percent of the
3,661 respondents said they cut back on food this past winter in
order to pay fuel bills. More than one in five respondents said
they had gone without medical care. Nearly a third said they had
not paid other bills in order to keep up with heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming winter, McKim estimates, total energy bills in
Iowa could rise 48 percent on average, driven by high natural-gas
prices. Yet Iowa's grant under the federal aid program for the
coming year is $19.9 million, down from $36.6 million in 1985.
McKim figures the state will fall $6 million short of keeping
benefits at last year's level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice states will be forced to make is whether to
increase benefits and help fewer families, or to maintain the same
number of families but reduce the size of benefits,'' said Michael
Kharfen, a spokesman for the federal aid program in Washington.
</P>

<P>
   Poverty stays hidden amid Iowa's pin-dot towns and prim
clapboard homes of Marshall, Tama and Poweshiek counties, about 80
miles north and east of Des Moines. The lush sea of soybean and
corn broken by a few lonely trees gives no hint of the many family
farms that have closed or are about to. The three counties,
neighbors, are poorer than most in the state. The meatpacking
plants and other factories that employed residents have shut down
or cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ``These counties are dying,'' said Diane Popelka, energy
assistance coordinator for Mid-Iowa Community Action, a nonprofit
social service group. ``People don't shop in the little towns, they
don't work there. There are no high-paying jobs there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gale Gies feels lucky that she drives only 30 miles a day round
trip from her house in Garwin, in Tama County, to her job in the
town of Tama. As a counselor with the Mid-Iowa energy assistance
program, she helps low-income families apply for federal aid. But
Gies, 37, turns to the state for the same help she pursues for
clients. Her husband, Alan, has been unable to work for three years
because of degenerative arthritis, she says. Because he was denied
federal disability assistance, the Gieses and their three children
make do on Gale Gies' small salary.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet after paying rent and fuel, the Gieses go
without. ``Alan spends a lot of time in pain, because I can't
afford his medicine,'' said Gale Gies, sitting on her porch one
afternoon. ``The muscle relaxants and pain relievers for his back
would cost $60 a month, and that's $60 we just don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his injury, Alan Gies was a construction worker who
sometimes brought home $3,000 a month, giving the family a foothold
in the working class. Likewise, two years ago, when the
Messersmiths were healthy, they too earned about $3,000 a month.
But Darrell Messersmith's disability payments after his injury went
to the wrong address, and by the time he corrected the oversight, a
bank had foreclosed on the couple's house in Des Moines. They moved
to a trailer on land here in Brooklyn they bought years ago, on the
edge of a ravine choked with hickory and wild daisies, and now they
are slowly building a new home with the help of their grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the house remains little more than a shell, as
Darrell Messersmith, a round-faced man with a firecracker laugh,
takes care of his wife. Her right side is paralyzed, so she relies
on a wheelchair and speaks with normal intonation but in
unrecognizable half-words.
</P>
<P>
   The couple spends $300 on building materials every month and a
similar amount on Donna Messersmith's medicines, which clutter the
tabletops. Last winter, the Messersmiths received about $300 from
the federal assistance program, enough to cover one month's propane
bill.

   MOSCOW _ A bomb exploded in a pedestrian underpass at Pushkin
Square in the center of Moscow at the height of rush hour Tuesday
evening, killing eight people, seriously injuring eleven and
sending dozens more fleeing smoke and flames that scorched the
large underground plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov on Tuesday night described the
explosion, which occurred a year after rebel leaders in Chechnya
began their latest uprising, as a ``terrorist act'' with a
``Chechen trace.''
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov appealed to Muscovites to redouble their vigilance after
a weekend in which the city had declared a state of emergency to
guard against terrorist attacks threatened by rebel leaders in
Chechnya on the anniversary of their uprising.
</P>
<P>
   No organization claimed responsibility for setting the bomb. The
Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, firmly refuted Luzhkov's
speculations. Maskhadov, in a statement delivered to Agence
France-Presse in Ingushetia, the Russian republic west of Chechnya,
said that ``neither the regular Chechen forces, nor special
services, nor the warlords have anything to do with the explosion
on Pushkin Square.''
</P>
<P>
   But before nightfall, a banner had appeared in the crowd ringing
Pushkin Square saying, ``The only good Chechen is a dead Chechen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the unsolved car bombs and apartment building explosions in
Moscow and other cities that killed nearly 300 Russians last
September, Tuesday's act was sure to inflame political tensions
over the war in Chechnya, either galvanizing those who support
Russia's tough military campaign in the northern Caucasus, or
bolstering the conviction of those opposed to the conflict that
there is no military solution.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin reportedly met with senior ministers
and ordered a special investigation into the blast. The 47-year-old
president, a former KGB agent, spoke in a telegram of condolences
to families of victims of ``a terrible tragedy.'' ``This explosion
deeply shocks all of Russia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after the explosion, a second bomb was found
on the edge of the square near an Armenian food store. It was
destroyed by bomb squad technicians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pushkin Square is in some ways the emotional heart of Moscow,
dedicated to Russia's most beloved poet and a popular meeting place
flanked on one side by a large cinema that last month hosted
Moscow's international film festival. The square _ the site of
Russia's largest McDonald's restaurant _ is at the intersection of
two main boulevards, and three subway stops, and bustles with
pedestrian traffic. Striking there in the early evening rush hour
is akin to placing a bomb at, say, Herald Square in New York.
Dozens of kiosks line the passageway where the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Standing shirtless near one of the exits from the charred
underground complex, Alexei I. Molchanov, a 23-year-old meteorology
student from St. Petersburg, said, ``I had just walked up the
stairs when the explosion went off. If I had been walking a little
slower, I would have been down there. This is the kind of thing
that makes you believe in god.''
</P>
<P>
   Molchanov said he had used his shirt as a tourniquet on the leg
of a 50-year-old woman who had emerged from the smoke of the tunnel
with a deep gash in her leg. ``I tried to calm her down. Her name
was Nina Ivanovna and I told her to stay quiet as I used my short
to stop the blood. But she was in shock. Her face was badly burned
and she kept saying she wanted me to call her office and inform
them what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing at a kiosk at one end of the tunnel when I
heard the bang and the lights went out,'' said Olga Initskaya, 49,
who had come to the square to meet her date for the evening. ``The
shock wave knocked me down and I saw such terrible smoke coming
down the passageway along with the injured. They were all in
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunned victims, some of them streaming blood from shrapnel or
glass wounds, others limping with shredded clothing and serious
burns, stumbled up the exit stairs. Four of the exits from the
passageway were enveloped by the acrid black smoke from small fires
that erupted. For nearly an hour, Russian medics worked on the most
seriously injured, one of them a young girl whose head and arms
were covered with third degree burns and who was bleeding profusely
from her wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Short of stretchers, medics used blankets to ferry some victims
to rescue vehicles. In the shadow of the statue of Alexander
Pushkin, the paving stones were trampled with bloody footprints and
littered with bandages and torn clothing where victims were loaded
into ambulances. A woman's shoe lay abandoned in one circle of
blood where the medics had worked.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russian television said the Federal Security Service had
determined that the blast was caused by a bomb in a satchel placed
near an underground kiosk. Late Tuesday night, Russian news
agencies were quoting Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo and
Federal Security Service officials saying they had the description
of two suspects in the blast, both men in their late twenties.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Luzhkov, who twice visited the scene of
the blast, said police were working from eyewitness accounts that
two men about 6 feet tall stopped at one of the underground kiosks
to buy something. They attempted to pay with dollars, the mayor
said, but when the clerk demanded Russian currency, they hurried
away saying they were going to a currency exchange and left a
satchel behind. The explosion occurred seconds later, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony from several witnesses who were able to answer
questions in the hospital'' indicated that the bombing had a
``Chechen trace,'' the mayor said. ``It was 100 percent Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry troops in flak jackets barricaded the square
and the main thoroughfares that intersect there for much of the
evening. Several of the men who provide security for the
underground plaza sat on park benches, their clothes stained by
blast debris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the injured were taken to Sklifasovsky Hospital, where
medical officials put out an appeal for blood donors to come
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's security alert went out after Chechen rebel
commanders vowed to take their campaign beyond the borders of their
breakaway republic. Authorities reported seizing large batches of
weapons and explosives in Moscow and Ryazan in recent weeks, and
warned municipal leaders to increase security.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday evening, Luzhkov urged city
residents to step up communal watch patrols as they did in the high
state of alert last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last Aug. 31, in the first of a series of bombings, one person
was killed and 20 injured when a bomb ripped through one corridor
of the underground shopping mall just outside the Kremlin. Five
days later, a car bomb in Dagestan killed 64 people, mostly
families of Russian military officers. But on Sept. 9 and 13,
Muscovites were stunned and outraged by explosions that demolished
apartment blocks, killing 94 in the first blast and 118 in the
second. A final blast killed 17 people in Volgodonsk in southern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who had just been appointed prime minister, blamed
Chechen rebels for the bombings, and launched a military campaign
that has been notable for its destruction of civilian targets,
including much of the Chechen capital of Grozny. But he has
defended it as an ``anti-terrorist'' operation.

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In the days before Gov. George W. Bush
announced his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate, Vice
President Al Gore and his advisers sensed an unexpected
opportunity. Aboard Air Force II and in Gore's campaign
headquarters here, there was a consensus that Bush and his aides
had bungled their selection process, that the Republicans had come
across as leak-prone, rushed and uncharacteristically amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign swiftly set out to exploit this perceived
weakness by trying to turn the running mate selection process
itself into a political weapon. With lock-step discipline, Gore's
spokesmen derided Bush for conducting his search ``like a
fraternity rush.'' They presented Gore's selection process as
dignified, orderly, pander-free and, above all else, private.
</P>
<P>
   But the strict secrecy imposed by the Gore campaign shielded
from public view an intensely political, highly competitive and
sometimes frenetic selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Gore's selection process was shaped by gritty
political concerns that had little bearing on what he had
repeatedly described as his single most important criterion for a
running mate _ someone possessed of the experience and ability to
assume the presidency if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, for example,
never made it to the short list, at least in part because of his
work as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, people involved in the
selection process said. Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana faced opposition
from groups that support abortion rights and gave his assent to a
campaign aimed at countering criticism over his voting record on
abortion, but his prospects faded nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Democratic officials said, Bush's repeated
efforts to tarnish Gore with resurrected memories of President
Clinton's affair with a White House intern elevated the standing of
Gore's eventual choice, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the first Democrat
to condemn Clinton's affair from the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The enforced secrecy _ potential running mates were warned not
to divulge details about their contacts with the Gore vetting teams
_ also served to obscure lobbying efforts by a select group of
well-connected political professionals. Several of Gore's campaign
consultants had also worked for those on his list of potential vice
presidents, and these men and women fought hard for their favored
picks. One adviser, Bob Shrum, has worked with several of the
potential candidates but argued for one of them, Sen. John Edwards
of North Carolina. Another adviser, Michael Whouley, argued for his
former boss, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership
Council and an influential voice among moderate Democrats, lobbied
both Gore and his campaign chairman, William Daley, on behalf of
Lieberman, who is the chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
   As with any presidential candidate, the choice of running mate
is an important and telling decision. Gore's aides argued that the
way he went about picking Lieberman illustrated several of the vice
president's strengths, most notably his meticulous, rigorous
preparation before arriving at major decisions. Gore, they said,
has raised vetting to new levels of thoroughness and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore announced in April that former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher would lead his selection team, Gore actually
began to organize his selection process months before. His vetting
teams were led by such veteran lawyers as Charles F.C. Ruff, the
former White House counsel who defended Clinton during his
impeachment trial. The team that vetted Lieberman, led by Jamie
Gorelick, a former deputy attorney general, went so far as to
review the more than 800 legal opinions that Lieberman rendered
when he was attorney general of Connecticut from 1983 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Cohen, a former IRS commissioner, was drafted to review
tax returns. Gore also instructed Christopher to consult freely and
frequently with an informal group that consisted of Labor Secretary
Alexis M. Herman, former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, Sen. Jay
Rockefeller of West Virginia and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gore kept two others
in the loop, his wife and Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained added respect for his values and judgment,''
Christopher said when asked in an interview what he had learned
about Gore during the search process. ``I found he went about the
process seriously and conscientiously. He has an excellent sense of
humor, which lightens discussions, but nevertheless he took this
process very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans drew different lessons from Gore's method of picking
a running mate. While praising Lieberman as a man of integrity,
they said that Gore's selection process underscored what they
described as his penchant for tactical ruthlessness and a tendency
to shade the truth for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, dismissed the notion that
the Gore decision-making process was more orderly and dignified
than Bush's process. He said that much of what Gore did, including
his mention of a ``wild card'' candidate, was theater designed for
public consumption. He said that the important difference between
the two campaigns was that the Bush campaign had greeted the choice
of Lieberman graciously, while the Gore campaign had attacked
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're missing the whole big picture on where the public is
about attacking everything,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic lawyer who has guided potential running mates
through both Gore's vetting routine and Clinton's in 1992
complained that this year's process was at times ``delayed and
disorganized.'' Just five days before his self-imposed deadline,
Gore said that he had narrowed his list to six. Yet one finalist,
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, had not been
vetted _ a task that had taken lawyers weeks of painstaking work
for other finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday two senior Florida Democrats left a meeting with
Daley reassured that Sen. Bob Graham of Florida was still under
serious consideration. Yet on the same day other Gore advisers were
quietly spreading the word that Graham was off Gore's list.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the sophistication of Gore's selection stagecraft that
even leaks were orchestrated for maximum effect. Eager to win over
women, Gore had emphasized that several women were under strong
consideration. Last week, as interest was peaking over Gore's
progress, his campaign let it be known that one of his finalists
was Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, even though she had
already said she would turn down the job, and even though one
person involved in Gore's screening process said that she had not
been under serious consideration for some time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, before a single primary or caucus had been contested,
Gore had already started thinking about running mates. By October
his campaign chairman at the time, Tony Coelho, had contacted
Christopher and asked him to start thinking about how to organize a
search.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, 74, was a logical choice. A man who exudes tact and
discretion, Christopher had led Clinton's search in 1992, and
Clinton's selection of Gore was widely regarded as a turning point
in the campaign. But Christopher was well aware of the perils of
the selection process. A hasty vetting job in 1984 left Walter
Mondale's campaign bogged down for weeks with questions about the
finances of his running mate, Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who tries to do this has to read the history and see
the mistakes that were made and try to avoid them,'' Christopher
said. Those lessons, aides said, were central to one of Gore's
primary search objectives _ finding a running mate who could get
off to a fast, clean start, unlike Cheney, for example, who spent
his first week defending his conservative voting record in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in February, Christopher and Gore began to construct
what Christopher came to call his ``People to Consult List,'' a
roster of senior Democrats that ultimately would grow to 70 names.
The list included nearly a dozen women, 18 members of minority
groups and representatives of several special interest groups, from
labor to environment to abortion rights. Most were on the list
simply because Gore wanted their advice. But 25 of the names,
including Lieberman's, were considered as potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coelho, the Gore campaign made an overture to Colin
Powell, just as the Clinton campaign had done in 1992. ``He was
indirectly approached to see if he would ever consider a
vice-presidential spot on any ticket,'' he said. But the general
rebuffed the overture and the matter was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore's spokesmen insisted that there was no long list,
no short list, no list at all, Christopher embarked on a series of
interviews to help Gore pare down their list. As a first step, a
team of young Washington lawyers, acting under the supervision of
Ron Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, prepared memorandums on
the public careers of the 25 possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher visited Lieberman in his Senate office on May 1. In
an interview the next month, Lieberman described his session as
``an out-of-body experience'' for a politician who had once been
too embarrassed to openly admit his ambition to be a senator. That
day, as he faced his old friend _ he calls him Chris _ Lieberman
found himself suddenly confronting the dizzying possibility of
occupying the nation's second highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chris came here it was the first moment it had any
reality to it,'' he said. ``Somebody said to me: `This is like the
ministry. You're called to the ministry, you don't seek it.' And it
took on some reality in that conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   By early June, as word of Christopher sightings spread across
Capitol Hill, and as one politician after another coyly confirmed
that yes, they had in fact spoken with him, the speculation over
running mates was such that no fewer than 30 Democrats had been
named in various news media reports as under active consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But by that point, Gore had already settled on about a
half-dozen names. He told Christopher to go ahead with full vetting
on this group, which included Lieberman, Shaheen, Edwards,
Gephardt, Bayh and Kerry, Democratic officials said. But even
before the vetting was in full swing, there were indications that
Lieberman was the leader of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, the day Daley replaced Coelho as campaign chairman,
his first substantial conversation with Gore quickly turned to the
question of running mates. ``He said, `Joe is really close, he's
really great, what do you think?''' Daley recalled. ``Then he went
into the other candidates, but he was the first one he named.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign set about assembling five to seven vetting
teams, each led by a senior lawyer working with a more junior
lawyer. Other lawyers were added as needed to the teams, all of
which reported to James Hamilton, a lawyer with long experience
examining the lives of troubled Washington figures.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has represented Vince Foster, the deputy White House
counsel who later committed suicide; Dennis DiConcini, the former
senator from Arizona implicated in the Keating Five scandal; and
David Durenberger, the former Minnesota senator who also faced an
ethics inquiry. Hamilton also served as assistant chief counsel to
the Senate Watergate Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher gives him perhaps his highest form of praise: ``He
is very discreet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vetters, who like Christopher worked as unpaid volunteers,
gathered boxes of records from each of the finalists _ every vote
ever cast, every press release ever issued, transcripts of
speeches, videotapes of political debates, books they have written,
school transcripts, a lifetime of financial and medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis, whose 1988 campaign helped usher in the era of
investigative vetting teams, likened the experience to applying for
a mortgage, ``times about 600.'' Paul Brountas, the lawyer who
guided Dukakis' search, recalled that the vetting process turned up
information that eliminated people from their short list.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Graham, for example, was knocked off after vetters for
Dukakis read through his diaries and decided that the American
people might not understand the reasons for recording the mundane
aspects of his day. ``He writes down what he eats for breakfast,''
Brountas said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham did not make it to the vetting round with Gore, but none
of the five who did were eliminated on the basis of some shocking
revelation that emerged from the records that were handed over to
the various vetting teams. ``The vetting process produces pluses
and minuses, but there was no show stopper,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pluses and minuses mattered greatly, and the vetting
process itself, along with the rumor-mill speculation surrounding
it, produced some ugly moments of competition, rivalry and sheer
political spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One such moment came in early July when Christopher invited
Gephardt to submit to a full review. In a series of tense
conversations over the next few weeks, Gephardt and his advisers
declined to hand over materials. Simply put, Gephardt wanted to
stay focused on winning back the House this fall, he and his aides
said. But the matter would linger unresolved for much of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a popular and seasoned politician, was attractive to Gore
for many reasons, not the least of which was his impressive record
as a decorated Vietnam war veteran. But in recent weeks rumors
raced through political circles in Washington and beyond about
Kerry's dating habits when he was divorced years ago. It was a
troubling development that took on added significance given the
emphasis at the Republican National Convention on restoring ``honor
and decency'' to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign aides said the rumors had no bearing on the
selection, but on Monday, Kerry told The Boston Globe that Gore's
vetters inquired about that time of his life. ``They asked a couple
of questions from the period when I was single, and I gave them an
explanation,'' he said. ``Three-quarters of the stories that were
written when I was single were not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher's queries to special interest groups turned up a
problem for Bayh on one of the touchstone issues of the Democratic
Party _ abortion rights. In early May, Christopher left a telephone
message for Alice Germond, the acting president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, a group that
closely monitors voting records on abortion issues. When Germond
saw the message, she immediately recognized the purpose of his call
and assembled the abortion voting records of potential running
mates.
</P>
<P>
   When she came to Bayh, she expressed concern about his vote to
ban a late-term abortion procedure that opponents call ``partial
birth abortion.'' Worse yet for Bayh, she and an official from the
National Organization of Women were quoted in a Baltimore Sun story
that suggested that Bayh's ``problematic'' stance on abortion might
make it difficult to mobilize votes from women who support abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Germond said that her only intent was to
provide unbiased information about the abortion records of every
potential running mate. Even so, Bayh's supporters were furious at
NARAL and NOW. They recognized that opposition from women's groups
could hurt his chances, but they also suspected that the groups
were trying to sabotage Bayh to boost a candidate more to their
liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed they were trying to push Feinstein,'' said Ann
DeLaney, Bayh's former campaign manager and legislative director,
referring to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, one of the women
who was mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate. ``I
was outraged,'' DeLaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Sun story appeared, DeLaney expressed her
anger to Bayh as they went jogging one evening. She said she
discussed her desire to write a letter accusing NARAL and NOW of
distorting what she described as his firm record in favor of
abortion rights. He did not discourage her, she said. Sure enough,
her letter soon appeared in news stories that described how Indiana
women were rallying in defense of Bayh's record on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bayh soon found his chances being downgraded in
stories quoting Democratic officials. Meanwhile, Edwards'
background as a trial lawyer who had won millions for consumers
injured by corporate negligence made him an easy fit for Gore's
populist message about taking on major oil and drug companies. And
every time Gore and his spokesmen described Cheney as part of the
Republican ``old guard,'' Edwards' stock appeared to inch higher.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Gore's screening machinery turned up a steady
drumbeat of concern about his relative lack of political experience
as a first-term senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were questions that were asked during the process,''
Edwards readily acknowledged on Monday. ``They're perfectly
reasonable questions.'' The questions only grew louder with the
selection of Cheney, a man with decades of experience at the
highest levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   On Air Force II on July 24, the day before Bush announced his
selection of Cheney, Gore told reporters that Bush's pick probably
would not have an impact on his selection. But behind the scenes,
advisers believed that Cheney's experience had to be accounted for,
and that dynamic favored Lieberman, 58, running for his third
Senate term.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the gravitas level, he matches up,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lieberman advocates such as From were making
the argument to the highest levels of the campaign that with
Lieberman's ``seal of approval,'' it would be difficult for Bush to
continue to tar Gore with the president's personal scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the thoroughness of the Gore screening process, his
vetters never did fully explore the possible impact of the largest
question mark over Lieberman _ how voters would react to an
Orthodox Jew on a national ticket. A number of people on
Christopher's consultation list had repeatedly raised Lieberman's
religion as a possible problem. But Gore, who has been criticized
by Republicans for being excessively guided by polls, issued orders
that no steps were to be taken to gauge public reaction to
Lieberman's religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore said, 'That's not part of me. That's not part of my
thinking. I exclude that,''' Christopher recalled.
</P>
<P>
   What they did, do, though, was explore dozens of hypothetical
situations to test how Lieberman would respond to potential
conflicts between his observance of the Sabbath and the duties of a
vice president, said Gorelick, who vetted Leiberman, said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had definitely thought through them in the context of the
public life he has led to date,'' she said. ``He has had to vote on
the Sabbath, go to critical meetings on the Sabbath, has had to be
away from home on the Sabbath and he has thought through those
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   By late July, Gore had conducted one-on-one interviews with all
of his finalists except Gephardt. There were no moments akin to
1992, when Clinton interviewed Gore well into the early morning.
Lieberman's interview, conducted at Gore's residence at the Naval
Observatory, lasted about an hour, the same amount of time Gore
spent with the others.
</P>
<P>
   But it clearly went well.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, the labor secretary, spoke with Gore after the interview
with Lieberman. She described Gore's response more as one of
affirmation rather than revelation. ``You had this sense of, `Boy,
was I right about this guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's decisive meetings in the vice president's
10th floor suite at the Loews Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel in Nashville,
aides got a definite sense that Gore had just about settled on
Lieberman but wanted one more ``gut check'' before making the
decision final. His questions were more pointed than probing, as if
he were attempting to test his political and personal judgments
against the range of opinions in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before Gore told aides of his decision, he called his
oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, who was in her apartment in
New York. Schiff had been another sounding board for her father
throughout the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes on a personal instinct for this sort of thing,'' she
said. ``And I always knew he would.''

RIESLINGS, FRUITED AND PLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In legend and in fact, German wine terminology is
practically indecipherable to Americans. Driven by precision but
weighed down by bureaucracy, German wine labels nowadays convey
information that is often contradictory and gives little hint as to
what's actually in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, certain clues can at least help you distinguish
between dry and fruity wines. The terms ``halbtrocken'' and
``trocken'' indicate wines that are, respectively, dry and very
dry. These wines may also include traditional terms like
``kabinett,'' ``spaetlese'' and ``auslese,'' which indicate the
amount of sugar that was in the grapes when they were harvested.
</P>
<P>
   In dry wines, these terms don't add much to the understanding,
though in fruity wines they indicate a potential for sweetness,
with kabinetts being the least sweet, spaetleses next and then
ausleses, which are often sweet enough to be dessert wines.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, you can still be fooled. A kabinett can taste sweeter
than a spaetlese if the sweetness is not offset by sufficient
acidity. In German wines, balance is the most critical element.
</P>
<P>
   And keep in mind that some prominent producers, like Georg
Breuer, have chosen to forgo any of this nomenclature, relying on
customers' familiarity with their styles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fruity wines, I gravitate toward kabinetts. They are
light and lightly sweet, wonderful with food and low in alcohol,
especially those from the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, which can be as low as
7.5 percent. They are especially good in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Good dry German wines are harder to find but can be magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the best bet for advice on which German wine to buy
is finding a knowledgeable merchant. That, too, can be rare, but
well worth the search.

FURY OF A SCORNED VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER BECOMES A CRUSADE
</HEADLINE>
 By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They light the fireworks on the Fourth of July. They pull people
out of burning buildings. They teach children not to play with
matches. By one estimate, they save taxpayers $37 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Few people embody America's ideals like its 1.1 million
volunteer firefighters. Gritty, charitable, self-reliant, they
answer millions of calls for help each year. And each year,
thousands get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   It is then that many discover that their generosity is not
necessarily matched by the society they serve. Disabled volunteer
firefighters generally get workers' compensation, but the benefits
vary widely. Some states match what career firefighters receive.
Some pay less. Some pay nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nicholson got next to nothing after he was hit by a car
on a fire call in 1972, when he was a 17-year-old volunteer
firefighter in Bushnell Basin, outside Rochester, N.Y. Both his
legs were broken, his skull was fractured, his lungs collapsed, he
suffered a stroke, and he sank into a coma for three weeks. His
parents were told there was only a 50-50 chance he would live.
</P>
<P>
   When he regained consciousness, he required leg braces and
crutches to walk. A junior in high school, he could no longer
concentrate on his favorite subject, criminal justice. His memory
failed, and his emotions flared inexplicably. He needed speech
therapy but flew into a rage when the therapist told him to forget
his boyhood dream of becoming a state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   The state of New York agreed to compensate him with $80 a week
for his permanent disability.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Nicholson struggled along on those
meager checks, unable to move out of his parents' house. Then, in
1993, an administrative judge laughed at his request for an
increase. It was a routine bureaucratic put-down, but Nicholson
could not shrug it off.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has led a crusade to overhaul the way the
workers' compensation system treats volunteer firefighters. Against
all odds, he scored victories in New York. Now he is gearing up for
the ultimate battle: to set a federal standard for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, his accomplishments show what one determined
human being can do to fix a system that most people do not notice
is broken because its victims are invisible. ``This sounds
quixotic,'' said Stewart Schwab, a professor at Cornell Law School
and an expert on workers' compensation. ``But he seems to have a
track record for knocking down a few windmills.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy behind his crusade comes partly from his belated
understanding of how serious his injuries were. It was not until
1990 that he underwent the neurological testing that disclosed that
his memory and emotions were so erratic because of brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that was the way I was,'' said Nicholson, who
needed three years to finish his senior year of high school and
five years to complete a two-year degree in criminal justice at
Monroe Community College. His first job, as a sheriff's dispatcher,
lasted only five months.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 17 years, Nicholson was fired 27 times, from jobs
as seemingly simple as supermarket bagger. ``They'd holler at me
and tell me: `Hey! Don't you remember I told you not to do that?'''
he said. ``And I'd say, `No,' and they'd fire me.''
</P>
<P>
   New York state paid Nicholson so little in part because it, too,
had failed to understand the extent of his injuries and categorized
him as only partly disabled. But in a 1993 review of his case,
Nicholson told the judge that the new findings showed that he would
never be able to work and told the judge that $80 was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of laughed and said, `Well, if you don't like it,
change the workers' compensation law,''' Nicholson recalled. ``I'll
never forget the way he laughed. That's what made me determined to
try to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not occur to him to appeal the judge's decision, he said.
Instead, he looked up an old friend, Jim Alesi, who had become a
state senator. He asked Alesi how to go about changing the law. The
senator said he supposed he could write a personal bill that would
legally raise Nicholson's payments to the 1992 rate of $400 a week
for cases like his. But he warned the former firefighter not to get
his hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Nicholson spent four years making the rounds of every
fire hall, village board, town council and county legislature he
could find in his part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the day he walked into my office,'' said Ed
Riley, fire coordinator for Monroe County, which has 40 fire
departments. Nicholson, walking with a cane and carrying a cassette
player to record conversations _ without it, he often forgets what
people tell him _ spilled out his story, saying he could not bear
living under his parents' roof for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Riley said. ``I'd been in this job for 12
years, and my biggest thing is to make sure everybody's in good
shape. I was saying: `Where have you been? Why didn't anybody tell
me about you before?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was that because Nicholson could no longer play
baseball, march in parades or take part in other all-American
events that bring volunteer firefighters together, he had simply
been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Riley began taking Nicholson to the various meetings fire
officials attend. A groundswell began. Brigades wrote letters to
their representatives in Albany, N.Y., urging them to pass
Nicholson's bill. Fire chiefs around the state began wondering how
many other disabled volunteers might be lost in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually about 30 disabled volunteer firefighters were
discovered, some housebound and receiving payments of as little as
$65 a week.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, the legislature first enacted Nicholson's personal
bill, then a second personal bill for another disabled volunteer,
who died before the workers' compensation board released the higher
payments. A third general bill raised the benefits of all the
forgotten volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Those victories have emboldened Nicholson to research state laws
on the Internet and get in touch with national firefighting
organizations to help him reach his goal of a federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting twist,'' said Schwab, noting that most
attempts to standardize state compensation practices are the work
of insurance companies and other business interests, trying to
limit payouts. ``He's coming at it from the opposite perspective,''
he said.

MIXING UP A SALAD OF DANCE STYLES

<P>
   Dance is getting itself happily mixed up. Some choreographers
are having a ball with rock 'n' roll and all that jazz. Others are
uniting seemingly disparate music and dance styles. The results can
be artistically provocative, the best of such productions making
theatergoers gaze in wonder at both dance and the world from which
it comes.
</P>
<P>
   Take two refreshing productions at this summer's American Dance
Festival in Durham, N.C. Mark Dendy's new work was performed to a
potpourri of rock and pop music of the recent past. Although the
choreography reflected the musical moods, it seldom resembled
anything you'd see on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was easy to enjoy simply as a modern-dance energy
study. But Dendy called it ``I'm Going to My Room to Be Cool Now,
and I Don't Want to Be Disturbed.'' That title made it possible to
interpret the sometimes feverish action as the daydreams _
especially the erotic ones _ of an adolescent, confused by his
strong but inchoate urges and unsure of his sexual orientation, who
has locked himself in his bedroom to listen to favorite records.
</P>
<P>
   Trisha Brown presented the complete version of ``The Trilogy,''
excerpts from which had been seen previously in New York. In some
episodes of this full-evening jazz piece, she appeared to be
inventing her own eccentric form of jitterbugging. The choreography
certainly did swing. But most of the production, with its sudden
juxtapositions of rigorous order and wiggling, was as idiosyncratic
as its complex score by Dave Douglas. Some theatergoers even
wondered if the music was jazz at all, just as they did when they
heard Donald Knaack's score for another festival premiere, Twyla
Tharp's ``Surfer at the Styx,'' which, like Brown's creation, was
made possible through the Doris Duke Millennium Awards for Modern
Dance and Jazz Music Collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   When the question ``Is this jazz?'' was raised during a festival
symposium with Brown and Douglas, the composer replied that he
comes from a jazz background, considers his close collaboration
with Brown as an extension of his tradition and expressed an
interest in the way art forms can redefine themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Art keeps leaping over formal boundaries. So maybe the time has
now come for the Lindy Hop version of Stravinsky's ``Sacre du
Printemps.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such a thing was suggested back in 1930 in
Carl Van Vechten's ``Parties,'' an incisive satirical novel about
Prohibition-era New York. During his long life (1880-1964), Van
Vechten was not only a fiction writer with a wicked tongue but also
an erudite music and dance critic whose interests extended from the
newest ballets and modern-dance experiments to the latest Harlem
dance styles. In ``Parties,'' recently reissued by the Sun and Moon
Press of Los Angeles, Van Vechten noted that because the strenuous
social dance known as the Lindy Hop involved an ``ecstatic flinging
about of arms and legs, and contortions of the torso,'' it could
produce an effect approaching ``the sensations of religious
ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be danced, quite reasonably and without alteration of
tempo to many passages in the `Sacre du Printemps,''' Van Vechten
wrote. His suggestion, though undeniably odd, is not totally
freakish; Stravinsky's work, after all, does depict states of
spiritual possession.
</P>
<P>
   As ease of travel and speed of communication make it easy to
become acquainted with the world's cultures, inquisitive,
internationally minded choreographers are combining styles and
techniques, just as imaginative chefs blend elements of several
cuisines to create their own distinctive recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many Japanese dancers have flocked to Spanish
flamenco classes. The schedule for this year's Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival in Becket, Mass., included Compagnie Jant-Bi, a Senegalese
company, in ``Le Coq Est Mort,'' which was created for it by the
German Neo-Expressionist choreographer Susanne Linke. In her ``Pour
Antigone,'' shown last month at Lincoln Center Festival 2000, the
French choreographer Mathilde Monnier retold a Greek tragedy in
African terms with a cast of both African and European dancers. The
mixing and matching of dancers and styles can have fascinating
results.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, however they may be modified in specific productions,
traditional dance techniques should also be preserved in their
purity in honor of a culture's heritage. The dance world needs the
old as well as the new. And it is easy for new choreographic
composites to be merely messy.
</P>
<P>
   But at their best, stylistic potpourris can be entertaining and
aesthetically challenging. When Donald Byrd/The Group appeared at
the Joyce Theater last season, the company offered Byrd's ``In a
Different Light: Duke Ellington,'' a tribute affirming the
remarkable range of this great jazz composer. Some scenes were
lyrical. Yet one episode was a sexy _ indeed, raunchy _ comic romp
in what might have been a nightclub or brothel. At still other
times, Byrd's choreography was as cool and precisely patterned as
certain balletic abstractions by George Balanchine. All these
episodes were choreographically convincing responses to Ellington's
music, which, as Byrd's title suggested, can be interpreted in many
different artistic lights.
</P>
<P>
   When the Australian Ballet performed at City Center last fall,
its most unusual offering was Stephen Page's ``Rites,'' to
Stravinsky's ``Sacre du Printemps.''
</P>
<P>
   For this production, the ballet dancers were joined by members
of the Bangarra Dance Theater, an Australian aboriginal company.
Page turned Stravinsky's ballet, which originally depicted human
sacrifice in prehistoric Russia, into an aboriginal ritual honoring
earth, wind, fire and water. The concept was original and the
hybrid choreography convincing.
</P>
<P>
   So how about it? Is anyone inspired to try that Lindy Hop
``Sacre''?

TEXAS BOARD REFUSES TO HALT EXECUTION OF LOW-IQ INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has turned down a request
for clemency from Oliver Cruz, who was sentenced to death for the
rape and murder of an Air Force enlisted woman.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who defense psychologists say is mentally retarded, is
scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Wednesday in Livingston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 members of the board voted unanimously on Monday to
refuse the clemency. They gave no reason. The board has rejected
all but one of the 74 clemency requests from death row inmates
since Gov. George W. Bush took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At Cruz's trial, the state did not contest the defense's
evidence that Cruz was mentally retarded and had an IQ as low as
64. People with an IQ below 70 are generally considered to be
mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the San Antonio district attorney's office, which
prosecuted Cruz, began circulating a 1989 report that showed his IQ
as 83, said Barbara Hervey, an assistant district attorney there.
</P>
<P>
   Hervey said the district attorney, Susan D. Reed, received the
report on Tuesday based on a request to prison officials last week.
She said she did not know why the report had not been made public
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Reed declined to make a copy of the report available.
</P>
<P>
   At Cruz's trial, the prosecutor had argued that one reason to
execute Cruz was because he ``may not be smart,'' and that made him
``more dangerous'' to society.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's lawyer, Jeffrey Pokorak, was angry at the last-minute
disclosure of the IQ report by the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just demonstrates how political this is,'' Pokorak said.
``They know they should not be killing a mentally retarded person,
so now they are coming up with new evidence that says he is not
mentally retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak has asked for a full evidentiary hearing on the question
of Cruz's mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing a request for a stay of
execution filed on Friday by Pokorak, who argues that the jury was
not properly instructed to consider the evidence of mental
retardation. If the court turns down the appeal, Cruz's fate will
be in the hands of the lieutenant governor, Rick Perry, who is
sitting in for Bush, who is out of the state. Under Texas law, the
governor can grant only a one-time 30-day delay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association urged Bush late Monday not to go
forward with the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution of persons who are mentally retarded serves no
principled purpose and demeans our system of justice,'' Martha W.
Barrett, the organization's president wrote to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union on Tuesday called on Bush not execute Cruz,
saying that the execution of someone who is mentally retarded
violated international human rights norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge you to demonstrate compassion with regard to this
case,'' it said in the letter to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was sent to death row for the rape and murder of Kelly
Donovan, who was stationed at the Air Force base in Cruz's
hometown, San Antonio.

 &HT;    Hadassah keeps Lieberman grounded
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    and Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Joe Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, lived for
nearly three years in Palm Beach County while her father was rabbi
of Temple Beth Sholom.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Worth temple had fewer than 50 families when Rabbi
Samuel Freilich, who had been a slave laborer under the Nazis,
became their spiritual leader in July 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Freilich Lieberman, 52, was born in March 1948 in a
refugee camp in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her mother, Ella, survived
Auschwitz and Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   After the war her father, a native of Czechoslovakia, worked
with Jewish refugees and organized schools in Prague and Budapest,
Hungary. In 1949, Freilich became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   He was a rabbi in Gardner, Mass., before coming to Lake Worth to
take over the small congregation. Temple Beth Sholom was formed in
1953 by the Lake Worth Hebrew Benevolent Association with just 20
families. He left the temple in the summer of 1961, returning to
Massachusetts with his family. He died in 1993 at the age of 91.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Schuman went to Lake Worth Junior High School with
Hadassah and had a crush on her. When he saw her on television, he
couldn't believe his eyes. It was the same girl he kissed when he
was 12 years old, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She liked me and I paid some attention to her, but she was the
rabbi's kid and I figured you don't mess around with the rabbi's
kid,'' Schuman said.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty girl, Schuman remembers Hadassah as a ``good kisser''
who was ``always upbeat, very, very positive but self-conscious of
her father's accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Freilich graduated from Gardner High School in 1966,
and then Boston University. She was a divorced mother with a 6-year
old son in 1982 when she met Lieberman, hen a Connecticut state
senator. Lieberman also was divorced. He has two children with his
previous wife. The Liebermans married in 1983 and have a
12-year-old daughter, Hana.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply involved in her husband's political life, Hadassah also
has the role of making sure that Lieberman doesn't get too full of
himself. Once, on the way home from an event where Lieberman had
been called one of the great leaders in Connecticut history, he
turned to his wife and asked, ``How many truly great leaders are
there in the Western world today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``One less than you think,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuman, an attorney who lives in Lake Clarke Shores, still has
fond memories of Hadassah and a message for his old flame: ``Tell

 &HT;    Chipper Jones, Braves reach agreement on mega-contract
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI - Chipper Jones isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning National League MVP has reached an agreement with
the Braves on a six-year, $90-million contract. The Braves also
reportedly have options for an additional two years worth $30
million, bringing the total value to $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement is expected Friday, after the Braves
return from their road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close,'' Jones said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz declined comment, and
Jones' agent, Steve Hammond, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' annual salary of $15 million will make him the
highest-paid Brave, ahead of Greg Maddux, who will make $12.5
million in 2001. Jones' annual salary will rank at the top in
baseball, equaling that of Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown. His
overall package also will rank among baseball's largest, behind the
contracts of Ken Griffey Jr. ($116.5 million), Brown ($105 million)
and Mike Piazza ($91 million).
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, is hitting .307 this season with 24 home runs and 79
RBIs. In his MVP season, he hit 45 homers, drove in 110 runs and
batted .319.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took what was considered less than market value when he
signed his last deal in 1996, worth $8 million over four years. He
was willing to take less money for the security of a longer-term
deal after injuring a knee and missing the 1994 season. The Braves
picked up their option this year, worth $4.75 million with
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, Jones was adamant about getting his market
value and said he was prepared to test the free agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' contract agreement shrinks a star-studded potential
free-agent group. Alex Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez, Manny Ramirez,
Mike Mussina and Mike Hampton have contracts that expire at
season's end.
</P>
<P>
   While the signing is just a matter of time, Jones wasn't
prepared to start celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is there is no deal done,'' said Jones, who
said he last spoke to his agent on Monday. ``We're talking. We're
grinding it out, but there's no deal in place. There has been no
signing it from me.''

 &HT;    Confederate sub Hunley completes journey
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. - One hundred and thirty-six years after its
mysterious sinking, the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley completed
its journey home Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The slender, barnacle-encrusted vessel returned to Charleston,
its iron hull still intact and its sand-packed innards presumably
holding the remains of nine crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up in one piece, gosh, it is the best (vessel) we've
gotten out of the Civil War,'' said author and wreck diver Clive
Cussler, 69, who celebrated by jumping into the ocean, climbing
back in a boat, and offering a champagne toast.
</P>
<P>
   His team's discovery of the Hunley in 1995 spurred the estimated
$15 million-to-$20 million effort to recover and preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunley was the first sub to sink an enemy vessel. It also
went down in history as the Confederacy's last-ditch secret weapon
against the Union blockade of Charleston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's recovery went well, said officials, who had worried
that the Hunley was under great pressure under 30 feet of water and
could crack open if mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, working in a constant ocean swell and
steady breeze four miles off Sullivan's Island, divers completed
three months of work. It took eight hours to raise the sub,
transport it on a barge to a North Charleston conservation lab, and
lower it into a tank of fresh water, chilled to inhibit the sub's
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The top portion of the sub was visible along its 13-mile trip,
viewed by thousands who, despite sweltering heat, packed city
piers, rooftops and the deck of the retired USS Yorktown.
</P>
<P>
   Two hatches protrude from the sub's top, as do two wings near
the forward hatch that allowed the Hunley to dive. The 40-foot-long
vessel is sealed by a cementlike formation that scientists believe
has protected the hull from corrosive salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from aboard the Carolina Clipper, one of hundreds of
boats that ringed the recovery site, state Sen. Ernie Passailaigue
(D-Charleston) was struck by the Hunley's small size and how
cramped the sailors must have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes beyond the scope of anything I'll describe as
bravery,'' said Passailaigue, 52, a member of the state-appointed
Hunley Commission.
</P>
<P>
   With Confederate troops desperate to get supplies through
Charleston's port, the Hunley set out in the darkness Feb. 17,
1864.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the propeller from inside with a hand crank, the crew
rammed the USS Housatonic with a long spar affixed with 90 pounds
of black powder. Five Union soldiers died in the Housatonic's
sinking, as did all of the Hunley's crew when their vessel sank 30
feet to the bottom as it backed away from its target.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists are poised to delve into the Hunley, piecing
together the history and lore that families have passed down.
</P>
<P>
   The sub eventually will go on display in the Charleston Museum.
The Hunley's crew, if found inside, will be buried next year in the
city's Magnolia Cemetery, along with the remains of two previous
crews who died during test runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased ... that we have this wonderful exhibit to come,
but (I'm) also very sad about the people who died,'' said Richard
Barker, 67, of Jacksonville, great-great-grandson of James Wicks, a
Hunley crewman who left a widow with four daughters. In recent
days, divers lowered a metal frame into the water. Its open bottom
rested over the Hunley. Divers then looped synthetic straps under
the hull, attaching each end to the cage to form a sling cradling
the sub. For greater stability, workers pumped quick-hardening foam
into bags that had been placed between the straps and the hull.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of cameras poised at the surface, a big red crane
began its gradual, silent lift of the frame. The Hunley emerged
from the greenish gray water in the same position it had been
laying, at a 45 degree angle on its right side.
</P>
<P>
   On its journey through Charleston Harbor, the Hunley passed Fort
Sumter, where, in 1861, occupying Union soldiers exchanged cannon
fire with Confederate troops to start the Civil War. On the Web : A

GOVERNMENT MOVES TO PROTECT HORSESHOE CRABS IN VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Del., Va.)  By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEWES, Del. _ Federal authorities on Tuesday announced plans for
a 30-mile-wide sanctuary from Delaware Bay out into the Atlantic to
protect the rapidly dwindling stock of horseshoe crabs that are
vital to the pharmaceutical industry and to the annual migration of
a dozen species of shore birds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta ordered
Virginia to join 14 other Atlantic states that have recognized an
emergency in the horseshoe crab population and to voluntarily
reduce its catch or else find the state's industry shut down by
October by federal order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia has been strip mining horseshoe crabs,'' declared
Daniel P. Beard, vice president of the National Audubon Society, in
praising the federal action to protect a critical resource
scientists say has been decimated in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia's actions amount in our view to piracy,'' Beard said,
noting that Virginia watermen and marketeers have been gradually
monopolizing horseshoe crabs as prized bait for the booming conch
and eel export industries, while other states have cut back in the
name of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   While their state is singled out as a renegade, officials in
Virginia insist they have gone it alone because the other Atlantic
states' voluntary quotas are too severe to be justified by current
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary, in which no horseshoe crabs could be taken, would
cover a 30-by-60-mile swath of the Atlantic centering on the mouth
of Delaware Bay, the world's prime population region for the crabs.
Ten years ago, an estimated 1.24 million crabs spawned on the
beaches of Delaware Bay, laying trillions of eggs vital to the
spring hemispheric bird migration.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists who favor the sanctuary say that the horseshoe
crab population has fallen by as much as 90 percent in the last
decade because of over-fishing. The crabs' egg production has been
measured in some studies at about 10 percent of its level in 1990.
This raises concern for the crabs' preservation and, scientists
say, for the survival of the 1 million shore birds who rely on
excess crab eggs for food for the final leg of their migration from
South America to the Arctic circle. Last spring, scientists
reported birds leaving under-nourished with their long journey in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Birdwatchers account for more than $35 million in Atlantic coast
tourist spending for what they rate a spectacular birding event _
the spring stopover of starving shore birds gorging on the eggs.
The horseshoe crab, an ancient, pre-dinosaur survivor species more
closely related to spiders than crabs, underpins an even richer $50
million industry in drug and medical research.
</P>
<P>
   The crabs' blue, copper-based blood is widely used to test drugs
for bacteria and to inhibit certain kinds of cancer cells. The Food
and Drug Administration mandates use of the crab blood in testing
all new injectable medicines, crab specialists note, emphasizing
that in most cases the blood can be taken without destroying the
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said that he hoped to negotiate a settlement with
Virginia fishery officials, but that he would not hesitate to close
down the state's horseshoe crab industry, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission, from Maine to Florida, have each accepted a quota of at
least a 25 percent cut in harvests. But Virginia has resisted its
recommended quota of 152,495 crabs and has become the main marketer
in the region for the valuable bait source, surpassing 1 million
crabs sold in one recent year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no actual scientific basis for the quota,'' John Paul
Woodley, Virginia's secretary of natural resources, insisted in an
interview. Last month, he added, state officials compromised by
halving the state's own quota to 355,000 crabs, which still is more
than double the quota federal officials are demanding. Woodley said
Virginia also is mandating mesh bait bags for conch fishing that,
he said, will allow using the crabs more than once.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists have accused state officials of caving in
to the state's conch industry and its growing need for bait.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said the sanctuary, which covers federal waters beginning
three miles off shore, would guarantee that horseshoe crabs survive
``to carry on their special role in the environment, as they have
for some 350 million years.''

NOW INVESTORS WALK OUT ON VERIZON 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also VERIZON-STRIKE, NY-VERISON) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Verizon, the nation's No. 1 local phone
company, had been under pressure for weeks. They crumpled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happens when a company says that it will not be
able to meet its financial targets, as Verizon did, even when some
investors already suspected that such an announcement was coming,
as some did.
</P>
<P>
   But the magnitude of the shortfall was a surprise to most on
Tuesday, because Verizon also said it had agreed to acquire control
of NorthPoint Communications Group, a high-speed Internet provider,
in a deal that would further dilute Verizon's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So as 86,000 unionized employees entered the third day of their
strike against the company, investors also walked out on Verizon,
sending the company's shares down by almost 14 percent Tuesday,
their sharpest one-day drop since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help the labor negotiations that the NorthPoint deal
could be seen as a provocative affront to Verizon's unions, which
have been trying to organize the company's Internet operation. And
it did not help Verizon with investors that the company also
announced financial results for the second quarter that failed to
meet Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Verizon's inability to meet its financial targets
is not the result of bad execution in running its business. This
contrasts, for example, with AT&AMP;T, which has seen its shares tumble
amid criticism that it has mismanaged its units that serve business
customers. The issues at Verizon, formed in June by Bell Atlantic's
acquisition of the GTE Corp., reflect less poorly on the company's
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, financial analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial, a financial research firm, had predicted that Verizon
would earn $3.15 a share this year and the company's own guidance
had been that it would show per-share earnings growth of 13 percent
to 15 percent in 2001. After all of the adjustments, the company
said Tuesday that it would instead earn $2.90 to $2.94 a share this
year, and that figure could be expected to increase by 5 percent to
6 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that change could have been anticipated by outsiders.
Part of it could not have.
</P>
<P>
   Delays and concessions involved in winning regulatory approval
for the merger caused part of the problem. Bell Atlantic and GTE
originally anticipated completing the deal at the beginning of this
year rather than in midsummer. The delay meant they could squeeze
out only about half of the savings they had anticipated for the
year. In addition, federal and state regulators extracted various
commitments from Verizon that could cost hundreds of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts on Tuesday expressed dismay that much of the
combined company's projected growth had been expected to come from
a change in accounting for GTE's pension liabilities; Verizon said
Tuesday it would not include the effect of the pension accounting
in its future operational results.
</P>
<P>
   The slower growth anticipated for next year is also largely due
to the timing and impact of acquisitions and outside investments.
Because Bell Atlantic, as a former part of the Bell System
monopoly, is not allowed to sell long-distance communications
services in most of its traditional territory, the combined Verizon
was required by regulators to sell to the public more than 90
percent of GTE's long-distance Internet subsidiary, formerly BBN
and now known as Genuity.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, however, was counting on Genuity's rapid expansion to
help the larger company make its growth target, and now it cannot.
In addition, delays in the completion of Verizon's wireless joint
venture with Vodafone AirTouch PLC have also hampered Verizon's
ability to meet its growth targets for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest negative impact on Verizon's growth prospects
next year will be the NorthPoint deal and Verizon's agreement
announced Monday to acquire the OnePoint Communications Corp., a
small private company, for an undisclosed amount. Between them, the
NorthPoint and OnePoint deals will dilute Verizon's per-share
earnings growth by about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While OnePoint is private, NorthPoint is public, and the
peculiar structure of Tuesday's deal reflects the difficult time
NorthPoint and its brethren have had winning investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   NorthPoint, along with competitors including Covad
Communications and Rhythms NetConnections, is in the business of
building systems in telephone offices around the nation that can
deliver torrents of Internet data over standard telephone wires,
using a technology known as the digital subscriber line, or DSL.
Shares in all three companies are trading significantly below
levels at which they offered stock to the public last year, largely
because the DSL business has proved more complicated than the
companies expected.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is also in the DSL business. In Tuesday's deal, Verizon
agreed to combine its DSL unit and $800 million in cash into
NorthPoint in exchange for 55 percent of the company. What is
unusual is that $350 million of that figure is to be distributed
directly to NorthPoint's existing shareholders, as a kind of
special dividend of about $2.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In a capital-intensive, high-growth (and nonunion) industry like
the Internet, that money would almost always be expected to be
plowed back into helping the business grow. The only obvious reason
to direct that much cash directly to the shareholders would be to
compensate them for the shares' lackluster performance. In a news
release Tuesday the companies said that shareholders owning about
48 percent of NorthPoint had agreed to the deal, so it might appear
that the payoff was necessary to win their approval in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of NorthPoint fell 75 cents, to $14.25 on Tuesday in
Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting many special charges including a one-time
pension-related gain, Verizon reported earnings of $1.97 billion,
or 72 cents a share, up from $1.87 billion, or 67 cents a share, in
the quarter a year earlier. Including the pension gain, the company
earned 81 cents a share, 2 cents less than the consensus estimate
of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 16 percent, to $16.79 billion for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Verizon ended the day down $5.8125, or 13.8 percent,
at $42.0625.

REFORM PARTY SPLITS OVER BUCHANAN'S PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ With nastiness boiling over to screaming
and shoving, the Reform Party split apart on Tuesday, as a faction
opposed to Pat Buchanan's presidential candidacy stormed out of a
meeting of national party leaders and vowed to proceed on its own,
perhaps as a new party.
</P>
<P>
   After the walkout, each group declared itself the true Reform
Party, depicting the other as a bunch of rule-breaking misfits who
have either stolen the party (Buchanan's supporters) or destroyed
it (his opponents).
</P>
<P>
   With both groups still claiming to be the Reform Party as
founded by Ross Perot eight years ago, it was not immediately clear
what effect the walkout might have on the party's plans for the
2000 elections or even its selection of a nominee _ or nominees _
for president. For his part, Perot, the Texas billionaire, has had
almost nothing to do with the party since his second run for
president four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it keeps on going like this, on parallel tracks, we could
end up with two nominees,'' said Russell J. Verney, the party's
first chairman and one of those who led the walkout. ``Or it might
come back together, and then even come apart again. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Buchanan's allies, the protesters essentially
surrendered control of the party organization by leaving the
session of national committee members, held in an ornate ballroom
of the Westin Hotel. This would virtually assure Buchanan the
presidential nomination later this week at the expense of his only
rival, John Hagelin, a physicist from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform national convention is scheduled to begin on Thursday
at the Long Beach Convention Center. But the protesters _ about a
quarter of the 164-member national committee _ began discussing
their own plans for the convention, beginning with a meeting they
convened at the Renaissance Hotel immediately after their walkout.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, both meetings conducted the same business at the same
time _ the resolution of national member challenges. But no one at
either meeting faced any opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reconvened the meeting of the one we walked out of,''
said Jim Mangia, the national secretary and a vocal critic of
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Almost at the same moment that Mangia's group voted to
disqualify Buchanan from the primary over questionable ballot
signatures, the other group voted to ignore any attempts to
disqualify Buchanan. The Mangia group also voted to confirm two
executive committee members whom the other group had voted to
expel.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald M. Moan, the party's acting chairman, called for the two
groups to resolve their differences and join what he called, ``The
new and improved Reform Party.'' But strongly defending the
Buchanan faction and affirming its legitimacy, he warned the
opposing group, ``If their plan is to cause a mockery of democracy
by storming the convention, they would be guilty of the same thing
they accuse other people of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting at the Westin was called several weeks ago by
the Buchanan campaign to clear up a series of lingering issues that
could have prevented Buchanan, the former television commentator,
from winning the party nomination and $12.6 million in federal
campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them was a planned review of challenges to
national committee members, a favorable disposition of which
Buchanan was counting on to give him a majority of supporters on
the committee. This, in turn, would assure the affirmation of a
strong Buchanan ally as chairman of the convention credentials
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout took care of the uncertainties. With none of
Buchanan's most ardent opponents in the room at the Westin,
challenges proceeded smoothly. He won his majority, and Buchanan's
sister and chief campaign strategist, Bay Buchanan, emerged to tell
reporters: ``We won. Pat has the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention, ostensibly, would make it official, but no one
among the Buchanan supporters was quibbling.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, however, the meeting cemented the public image of the
Reform Party as a bickering group more occupied by procedural
matters than issues of interest to voters.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of arguments over procedures and regulations inside
the room, party members who were locked out began crowding the
locked doors and screaming at security guards. Verney, who is not a
member of the national committee, was kept out by security guards
who ignored his pleadings, ``The party is voting and I have every
right to be inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Verney and others were turned away, about a
quarter of committee members inside burst through the closed doors
and accused Buchanan supporters, including Moan, of subverting
party rules to assure that Buchanan won the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moan won't listen to us,'' said Victor Good, a national
committee member from Colorado who is supporting Hagelin. ``He is
ignoring the rules and the constitution. He's running a
dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   As Good and other Buchanan opponents tried to explain their
version of the meeting to reporters and camera crews, Buchanan
supporters drowned them out, screaming: ``Go, Pat, go. Go, Pat,
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Both meetings proceeded the same way, with Moan at the Westin
and Mangia each going state by state to consider challenges. With
no real opposition or complaints at either meeting, the members
seated whom they wanted to seat. And both groups planned to begin
the convention claiming to be the legitimate source of party power.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, no one could say how that might happen, or how
looming conflicts might be resolved, not the least being whether
the protest group would rally around Hagelin over Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind who gets the $12.6 million. ``If we stay on these
parallel tracks with two candidates, the FEC will probably just
flip a coin,'' Verney said. ``Whichever side loses will go to
court, so this will drag on and take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, who has been leading the campaign efforts to
recruit delegates and voters, accused the protest group of
undignified, divisive and sour-grapes behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost, and they're unwilling to accept it,'' she said,
vowing that the Buchanan campaign would not need them in the fall.
``Their walkout will not affect us, whatsoever.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: FLIGHT DELAYS, BY THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All summer long, weary business travelers have been grimly
playing the numbers game. Here's a question from the most recent
round: How many flights did United Airlines abruptly cancel last
Saturday, Sunday and Monday? The answer: 814, mostly out of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   United's no-fly stats have become truly impressive, even in this
worst-ever summer for airline passengers. However, the airline
industry in general is not having such a bad summer. The money is
rolling in. Most carriers are flying record numbers of customers
this summer in planes taking off at record capacities of 80 percent
and more.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summer rush got under way, United _ which has about
5,000 departures a day _ had already lopped a total of 4,800
flights off its schedule through August, and the airline recently
said it was cutting almost 2,000 flights out of its September
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   United blames the extraordinary number of delays and
cancellations largely on a job action by unionized pilots who are
refusing to work some overtime shifts, mostly in the carrier's hub
at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The union representing
about 10,000 United pilots disputes that, however, saying that the
company itself has caused the problems by not taking action to
remedy what the union says is a shortage of pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, business travelers face the next round in the numbers
game this week, when the Federal Aviation Administration says it
will release its statistics for the number of delays on all
domestic flights for July. The 50,000 delays in June, as you might
recall, smashed all previous records. And July is a busier travel
month than June.
</P>
<P>
   Will the July numbers set still another record? Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA spokesman, Bill Shuman, wasn't quoting any odds Tuesday.
``July through the middle was good, but then the last part of July
was bad, particularly in the Northeast,'' he said. ``July is going
to be up there. The weather has been bad. It really affected travel
between Chicago and other points in the Midwest and the whole
Northeast corridor, Boston to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   And while we're playing the numbers, here are some long-range
ones to contemplate as air travel grows and we try to figure out
how to safely and efficiently thread an increasing number of planes
through a finite amount of air space, without the whole system
collapsing into gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   World air travel, measured by the total number of miles flown by
airline passengers, will grow by 4.8 percent a year for the next 20
years, according to the newly released 2000 Current Market Outlook,
an annual report on the commercial aviation business published by
Boeing.

 &HT;    New York's top cop quits to be consultant
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham and Peralte C. Paul
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Alpharetta company that helps insurance companies
and law enforcement agencies ferret out information on clients and
criminals has hired New York's outgoing police commissioner as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Safir, New York's third top police official to turn in
his badge recently, said he is resigning Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   His four-year watch over the department has been praised for a
steep decline in New York crime but increasingly criticized by
Hispanic and black residents for his department's involvement in
some alleged police brutality incidents, including the death last
year of an African immigrant shot 41 times by four officers.
</P>
<P>
   ChoicePoint Inc. said the 58-year-old commissioner will be a
part-time ``special consultant'' to the company's senior executives
on the use of information technology in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he can add a lot of value,'' said Kelly McLoughlin,
ChoicePoint's vice president of investor relations. ``One of his
hot buttons ... is using DNA'' evidence to help solve crimes, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   McLoughlin said Safir brings extensive contacts from his 31-year
career in law enforcement, including several years with the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S.
Marshal's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) mainly, we think he can help us come up with
innovations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ChoicePoint, a 1997 spinoff from Atlanta credit information
company Equifax Inc., sells information to law enforcement agencies
and other government entities.
</P>
<P>
   The company assembles credit reports, court records, drivers
license data and other information, for instance, to zero in on
criminal suspects and their companies or property, missing
children, and parents who are delinquent on their child support
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ChoicePoint had 1999 revenue of $430 million, about half from
government clients and half from providing credit report and
driving record information to insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Warmington, an equity analyst with Robinson-Humphrey, said
Safir should play a useful role in helping ChoicePoint develop
efficient information search tools for law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very knowledgeable in how law enforcement operates and
how they use `credentialing,''' or the use of court and licensing
records and other data to profile a person or business, Warmington
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as a positive,'' he said. However, he added, ``I'm
not adjusting my financial model in light of this event.''
</P>
<P>
   From a marketing standpoint, ChoicePoint stands to gain a lot
from the association, local public relations executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they're looking at him as a rainmaker,'' said Jane
Shivers, a partner and director with Ketchum in Atlanta. ``There
are a lot of doors open to him that wouldn't be open to just anyone
they could have hired.''
</P>
<P>
   But other marketing experts warned that the company will still
have to deliver to those open doors.
</P>
<P>
   And others said the company will have to take care not to become
overshadowed by Safir's public image or become associated with some
of the baggage that comes with him as a result of some high-profile
brutality allegations and convictions that occurred under his
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Those included the death last year of African immigrant Amadou
Diallo, shot 41 times by four New York police officers who mistook
his wallet for a gun, and the 1997 beating and sodomizing of
Haitian immigrant Abner Louima by a white officer at a police
station.
</P>
<P>
   Safir will continue to live in New York. He announced earlier
this year that he had prostate cancer, but according to published
reports, the commissioner said that had nothing to do with his
decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Safir replaced Police Commissioner William ChoicePoint Inc. said
the 58-year-old commissioner will be a part-time ``special
consultant'' to the company's senior executives on the use of
information technology in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he can add a lot of value,'' said Kelly McLoughlin,

this year that he had prostate cancer, but according to published
reports, the commissioner said that had nothing to do with his
decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Safir replaced Police Commissioner William Bratton, taking over
the top spot in 1996. He was earning $141,100 a year, a New York
Police Department spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ChoicePoint declined to disclose Safir's compensation in the new
position.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, a consultant, now heads New York-based First Security
Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer unusual for police executives and former chiefs
to go into consulting work, said George Cooley, deputy police chief
at the Birmingham Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's a pretty good field,'' Cooley said, explaining
his department had hired Bratton's firm in 1997 to help advise the
department with an overhaul of some of its policies and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Police executives bring a lot of knowledge and experience that
companies are looking for when recruiting, Cooley said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ With nastiness boiling over to screaming
and shoving, the Reform Party split apart on Tuesday, as a faction
opposed to Pat Buchanan's presidential candidacy stormed out of a
meeting of national party leaders and vowed to proceed on its own,
perhaps as a new party.
</P>
<P>
   After the walkout, each group declared itself the true Reform
Party, depicting the other as a bunch of rule-breaking misfits who
have either stolen the party (Buchanan's supporters) or destroyed
it (his opponents).
</P>
<P>
   With both groups still claiming to be the Reform Party as
founded by Ross Perot eight years ago, it was not immediately clear
what effect the walkout might have on the party's plans for the
2000 elections or even its selection of a nominee _ or nominees _
for president. For his part, Perot, the Texas billionaire, has had
almost nothing to do with the party since his second run for
president four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it keeps on going like this, on parallel tracks, we could
end up with two nominees,'' said Russell J. Verney, the party's
first chairman and one of those who led the walkout. ``Or it might
come back together, and then even come apart again. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Buchanan's allies, the protesters essentially
surrendered control of the party organization by leaving the
session of national committee members, held in an ornate ballroom
of the Westin Hotel. This would virtually assure Buchanan the
presidential nomination later this week at the expense of his only
rival, John Hagelin, a physicist from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform national convention is scheduled to begin on Thursday
at the Long Beach Convention Center. But the protesters _ about a
quarter of the 164-member national committee _ began discussing
their own plans for the convention, beginning with a meeting they
convened at the Renaissance Hotel immediately after their walkout.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, both meetings conducted the same business at the same
time _ the resolution of national member challenges. But no one at
either meeting faced any opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reconvened the meeting of the one we walked out of,''
said Jim Mangia, the national secretary and a vocal critic of
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Almost at the same moment that Mangia's group voted to
disqualify Buchanan from the primary over questionable ballot
signatures, the other group voted to ignore any attempts to
disqualify Buchanan. The Mangia group also voted to confirm two
executive committee members whom the other group had voted to
expel.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald M. Moan, the party's acting chairman, called for the two
groups to resolve their differences and join what he called, ``The
new and improved Reform Party.'' But strongly defending the
Buchanan faction and affirming its legitimacy, he warned the
opposing group, ``If their plan is to cause a mockery of democracy
by storming the convention, they would be guilty of the same thing
they accuse other people of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting at the Westin was called several weeks ago by
the Buchanan campaign to clear up a series of lingering issues that
could have prevented Buchanan, the former television commentator,
from winning the party nomination and $12.6 million in federal
campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them was a planned review of challenges to
national committee members, a favorable disposition of which
Buchanan was counting on to give him a majority of supporters on
the committee. This, in turn, would assure the affirmation of a
strong Buchanan ally as chairman of the convention credentials
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout took care of the uncertainties. With none of
Buchanan's most ardent opponents in the room at the Westin,
challenges proceeded smoothly. He won his majority, and Buchanan's
sister and chief campaign strategist, Bay Buchanan, emerged to tell
reporters: ``We won. Pat has the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention, ostensibly, would make it official, but no one
among the Buchanan supporters was quibbling.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, however, the meeting cemented the public image of the
Reform Party as a bickering group more occupied by procedural
matters than issues of interest to voters.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of arguments over procedures and regulations inside
the room, party members who were locked out began crowding the
locked doors and screaming at security guards. Verney, who is not a
member of the national committee, was kept out by security guards
who ignored his pleadings, ``The party is voting and I have every
right to be inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Verney and others were turned away, about a
quarter of committee members inside burst through the closed doors
and accused Buchanan supporters, including Moan, of subverting
party rules to assure that Buchanan won the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moan won't listen to us,'' said Victor Good, a national
committee member from Colorado who is supporting Hagelin. ``He is
ignoring the rules and the constitution. He's running a
dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   As Good and other Buchanan opponents tried to explain their
version of the meeting to reporters and camera crews, Buchanan
supporters drowned them out, screaming: ``Go, Pat, go. Go, Pat,
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Both meetings proceeded the same way, with Moan at the Westin
and Mangia each going state by state to consider challenges. With
no real opposition or complaints at either meeting, the members
seated whom they wanted to seat. And both groups planned to begin
the convention claiming to be the legitimate source of party power.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, no one could say how that might happen, or how
looming conflicts might be resolved, not the least being whether
the protest group would rally around Hagelin over Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind who gets the $12.6 million. ``If we stay on these
parallel tracks with two candidates, the FEC will probably just
flip a coin,'' Verney said. ``Whichever side loses will go to
court, so this will drag on and take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, who has been leading the campaign efforts to
recruit delegates and voters, accused the protest group of
undignified, divisive and sour-grapes behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost, and they're unwilling to accept it,'' she said,
vowing that the Buchanan campaign would not need them in the fall.
``Their walkout will not affect us, whatsoever.''

 &HT;    U.S. DRUG CZAR SEES 'POSITIVE' TRANSITION OF POWER AMONG MEXICAN
JUSTICE OFFICIALS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Before heading to drug-plagued Colombia, U.S. drug
czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey stopped in Mexico Monday and Tuesday and
praised what appears to be an open transition of power here after
71 years of one-party presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty positive atmosphere,'' McCaffrey told U.S.
correspondents here, after meeting with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, justice officials and members of Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who frequently has visited Mexico as the White
House's director of National Drug Control Policy, said Fox's
representatives are participating in meetings between U.S. and
Mexican officials Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fox defeated Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI, and will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the PRI was shocked by its defeat, but I sensed an
enormous goodwill and respect for Mr. Fox,'' McCaffrey said.
``There is a completely open transition process going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to clean up corruption in Mexico, a country that
is the transit point for up to 60 percent of the South American
cocaine sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick politician has suggested that he will dramatically
revamp Mexican police agencies and the Attorney General's office
here. Because one party has controlled Mexico's presidency for
seven decades, speculation is rampant over how smoothly this can be
accomplished and how organized crime groups will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition team we've been exposed to is pragmatic and
looking for creative new solutions,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are determined to go down in history as Mexican
patriots,'' he added. ``I cannot believe they will do anything that
doesn't make sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will reportedly review the role of the Mexican military in
the future and whether troops should be used for police work.
Currently, the Mexican military is involved in eradication of
drugs, interdiction, and intelligence and law enforcement work.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey praised the record of Mexico's Navy, which has been
working effectively with United States officials over the last year
to detect and seize drug shipments off the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to comment on whether Mexico should continue to
use the military in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive of one thing. The United States should not have a
hand in any way in shaping how . . . foreign nations in the
hemisphere organize themselves internally to confront these
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did say, however, that Mexican and U.S. officials will
recommend that Fox and whoever wins the U.S. presidency in November
should try to preserve the agreements for cooperation on drugs that
have been established under Zedillo and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already said he would like the United States to get rid
of the current annual ``certification'' of countries, in which
Congress judges countries for their drug-fighting records. Mexico
has repeatedly come under attack for corruption and other failures.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has long agreed with Fox's proposal, but doesn't
believe Congress is willing to scrap certification.
</P>
<P>
   He said nations in this hemisphere would discuss an alternative
system for grading each other on the drug war when they meet for
the Summit of the Americas in April 2001 in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey meets in Miami Wednesday with officials from the U.S.
Army's Southern Command, before heading to Cartegena, Colombia to
talk about the U.S.'s $1.3 billion anti-drug aid package to
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will visit Colombia on Aug. 30 to show
support. Colombia is a cocaine-producing country overwhelmed by
violent traffickers and rebels that control about 40 percent of the
nation's territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is in a risky position,'' he said. ``We're committed
to standing with them. Hopefully the region will also, along with
the Europeans and the Japanese. He (President Andres Pastrana) has
to solve several problems at the same time: an economy in the
dumps; a peace process that's going nowhere; and a drug production
problem that's skyrocketing.''

U.S. FORCES TO TRAIN WEST AFRICAN TROOPS FOR DUTY IN SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a shift of policy, the Clinton administration
plans to send hundreds of U.S. soldiers to Nigeria this month to
train and equip West African battalions that will then be
dispatched to Sierra Leone to bolster beleaguered government troops
and United Nations peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the United States had
``gone through an agonizing reappraisal'' of its policy toward
Sierra Leone, where guerrillas of the Revolutionary United Front _
notorious for chopping off the limbs of civilian victims _ are
waging war against government forces and in May kidnapped hundreds
of U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   By training regional soldiers to join the U.N. force, Washington
hopes to sideline the guerrillas and restore the government of
Sierra Leone to effective power, Undersecretary of State Thomas P.
Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to return the freely elected government to full
control of the territory of Sierra Leone and to get the guerrillas
demobilized,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will train and equip five Nigerian battalions of 800
soldiers eac, one battalion from Ghana and one from a
French-speaking West African country, possibly Mali or Senegal,
said Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Special Forces will be sent from Fort Bragg,
N.C., late this month and next month, they said. About 40 trainers
are already in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, where there has been criticism of the
administration's lack of engagement in Sierra Leone, the latest
decision has been received with relative warmth by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've long held that there should be a more aggressive posture
towards the RUF,'' said the chairman of the House subcommittee on
Africa, Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif. ``This is a substantial change in
the administration's commitment to Sierra Leone. It's long
overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   This move is the latest turn in the administration's diplomacy
toward Sierra Leone, a small West African nation that has been torn
apart by the guerrilla force, which has seized valuable diamond
mines and made a speciality of amputating the limbs of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, in an effort to end the civil war, the State
Department helped engineer the accord reached in Lome, Togo, which
received guarded international approval and brought the leader of
the guerrillas, Foday Sankoh, into the government, effectively
giving an amnesty for his troops' atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the Lome accord was signed, the United
Nations slowly assembled a peacekeeping force intended to take the
place of a Nigerian-led, largely West African force that had
recaptured Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, from the rebels early
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But when the last of the Nigerian troops withdrew in early May,
the rebels swiftly overran several positions of U.N. peacekeepers,
taking nearly 500 of them hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Most hostages were released after negotiations with Charles
Taylor, the president of neighboring Liberia, and after Britain,
the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, sent troops to help
restore order.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration distanced itself from the Lome
accord, saying as other foreign governments did that Sankoh should
be removed from Sierra Leone government. He was captured in May in
Freetown, where he remains in custody.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration declined to help the U.N. peacekeepers
and raised the ire of the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, by
trying to charge expensive rates for the use of Pentagon aircraft
to ferry soldiers of other nations to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials say, the administration has switched tack after
extensive criticism in Congress and angry exchanges with the
British government, which made plain behind closed doors that it
felt left alone in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the new policy has been driven by President Clinton's
planned trip to Nigeria _ sub-Saharan Africa's most populous
country _ later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Clinton needed something
substantial to announce once he got there and that the president
was keen to bolster the new civilian leader of Nigeria, Olusegun
Obasanjo, as well as to try and turn the tide in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pickering and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Richard
C. Holbrooke, visited members of Congress last month to explain the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, a former ambassador to Nigeria, went to Nigeria and
other West African countries last month to work out plans for the
military assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering told the lawmakers that it would cost more than $50
million but less than $100 million for equipment and the initial
stage of training, expected to be completed by the middle of next
year, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment for the soldiers is expected to include Belgian FN
rifles _ a standard weapon for the Nigerian army _ as well as
mortars and communications equipment, but not heavy artillery or
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The exact duration of the training program is still under
discussion, a senior Pentagon official involved in the plan said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that for the program to be effective, it
should be extended over two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst possible thing would be to create a West African
peace enforcement force and then walk away,'' the official said.
``This has to be sustained, and to have a long-term commitment
means more money. Congress understands it, but we have a lot more
work to do'' among lawmakers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, chief foreign-policy adviser to the Republican
presidential nominee, George W. Bush, said the plan to equip and
train West African troops was acceptable as long as it was enacted
as currently described to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diplomacy was terrible in Sierra Leone,'' Rice said. ``The
United States messed it up. If the Nigerians are willing to take up
the role, we would support it. We have always said we would support
regional powers, like the Australians in East Timor, if they are
willing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rice cautioned that ``consultation with Congress'' was vital
so that it would be known why the United States was getting
involved and for how long.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Friday the U.N. Security Council strengthened the mandate of
the peacekeeping soldiers in Sierra Leone, authorizing them to go
after the guerrillas in a forceful way.
</P>
<P>
   Already early last month in Sierra Leone, U.N. troops backed by
combat helicopters freed a group of unarmed military observers and
some 200 Indian soldiers in an unusual battle that took the life of
one peacekeeper but caused much higher rebel casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. move will add about 4,000 troops from Nigeria alone to
the U.N. force, which now stands at about 13,000 and is commanded
by a general from India.
</P>
<P>
   The West Africans will be trained as light infantry, ready to
``get off the roads and into the bush,'' the Pentagon official
said.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal for Sierra Leone's government is to reclaim the
diamond mines, the official added, so the revenues from diamonds go
into the government treasury and not into the kitty of the rebels,
enriching their leaders and allowing them to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council banned trading in Sierra Leone diamonds on
July 5, and Holbrooke and other administration officials have
spoken out against the reported smuggling of rebel diamonds to
Taylor's government in Liberia, which then markets the stones.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty in training Nigerian troops is that some soldiers
in Nigerian units are thought to have committed human rights abuses
in Sierra Leone and at home. A congressional measure, sponsored by
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., forbids the U.S. military from assisting
foreign troops that have violated human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian government has been told to select the units it
wants trained by the Americans, the Pentagon official said. The
U.S. Embassy in Nigeria is now checking on the units to ``make a
reasonable effort,'' as required under the Leahy legislation, to
ensure that soldiers who had violated human rights were excluded
from the training, the official said.

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ When it's the Cowboys involved, it's
never too early for fan panic or media panic. And based on what new
defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer says he's been reading and
hearing, that time has arrived, even with the NFL regular-season
opener still a sweaty month away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, a lot of people think we're in bad shape on
defense,'' Zimmersaid yesterday as the Cowboys shook off Japan jet
lag and got down to what coach Dave Campo promised would be ``one
tough week of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But as far as any defensive Armageddons, particularly involving
those under-the-microscope rookie cornerbacks, Zimmer smiled and
replied in typical candid fashion:
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to everyone is don't panic until you see me panic,
and believe me, if that becomes necessary, I will be the first.''
</P>
<P>
   But after two weeks of practice-field work in Wichita Falls, one
wasted week in Japan and two exhibition games, both losses, the
general sampling of street-talk opinion seems to center on two
areas:
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have great potential to once again become a mighty
offensive force.
</P>
<P>
   But with this defense, they'll have to score 40 points a game
and then hope to win it in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   What we are obviously dealing with here is an overreaction in
both areas, which is logical for the Cowboys, and also when
opinions are being formed in early August. The offense isn't
``back.'' Not yet. And the defense isn't in trouble. Not yet. But
for those on the outside looking in _ fans and media _ those rookie
cornerbacks make everybody nervous. Campo said yesterday he
certainly had ``concerns'' in that area. Zimmer agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But overall, I sit here today, basically in a positive mood
about where we are and what we've done thus far,'' said Zimmer, the
secondary coach for five seasons at Valley Ranch until Campo
promoted him to take his place as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the major emphasis for us is what's going on
at cornerback,'' Zimmer added. ``People keep saying the rookies are
doing poorly, that they are constantly getting beat, and all that.
I see the game, I see the films, I see that \RAtlanta\S had only
187 yards passing, and I don't see anybody getting killed back
there. Plays are being missed. Guys will get beat, yes. But they
are rookies. Give these people some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those burn marks on Mario Edwards, the sixth-round pick
out of Florida State, Zimmer still rates him as a player-to-be in
the NFL. ``Mario's got spunk and he's got fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is definite one of the three rookie corners will have to make
a major contribution this season, and maybe start. Right now,
that's Kareem Larrimore, the fourth-rounder out of West Texas A&AMP;M.
``But a week ago, I'd have told you it was Edwards,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-rounder Dwayne Goodrich, however, seems to have lost
contact with the pack. To some, the Tennessee product is mentally
sagging at the moment, while also suffering a minor injury in Japan
that may keep him off the practice field this week. ``Of the three
rookies, \RGoodrich\S is the one who reacts the most like a
rookie,'' Zimmer said. No one, of course, is admitting Goodrich is
a mistake. Again, it's way too early for that. ``There have been a
couple of situations,'' Campo said, ``where he could have shown
improvement and didn't. That's a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also the head coach being diplomatic, but, hey, it is
early August.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, for his part, spends a lot of time these days answering
questions about his rookie corners. But once the conversation moves
elsewhere on defense, he's got more news of a positive nature to
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``At linebacker, I feel better about things than I thought I
would at this point,'' he said. ``For one, Dat Nguyen is a player
in the middle. He has already gone beyond what we had anticipated.
We were hoping to see this or that, but, man, Dat looks good in all
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, sounds like an old R.C. Slocum echo, who always
said of Nguyen, ``You don't realize how good he is until the ball
is snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   There has also been another training-camp surprise for Zimmer.
Taking a chance with a once-troubled Dimitrius Underwood is paying
off. At first, it was a question of his even making the team. But
at the moment, Underwood is a part of the four-man rotation at
defensive end with Ebenezer Ekuban, Peppi Zellner and a rapidly
healing Greg Ellis, who despite the wicked broken leg last season
appears ready to open the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dimitrius has been a bonus for us _ a big bonus,'' Zimmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, of course, would help the cornerback situation,
particularly the rookies, more than the young foursome at end
becoming a pass-rushing force.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would make us all feel better, particularly me'' Zimmer
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Panic? What panic? Not yet, anyway.

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Determined to transform a potential liability
into a defining asset, Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday formally
introduced Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his Democratic
running mate. He portrayed his selection of Lieberman, an Orthodox
Jew, as a measure of his devotion to tolerance and his willingness
to break barriers.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to thousands of supporters at Nashville's War
Memorial plaza, Gore compared his groundbreaking selection to his
party's choice of John F. Kennedy as the first Catholic
presidential nominee 40 years ago. ``When we nominate Joe Lieberman
for vice president we will make history again,'' Gore said. ``We
will tear down an old wall of division once again.''
</P>
<P>
   After word of Lieberman's selection leaked out on Monday, Gore
aides and Democratic leaders made it clear that Gore had selected
him despite his religion and any possible anti-Semitic backlash.
But Tuesday's event was remarkable for the forthrightness with
which Gore, Lieberman and their wives addressed Lieberman's
Jewishness as a topic not to avoid, but to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   From Lieberman's opening with a prayer from Chronicles to his
wife's homage to her Holocaust-surviving parents to the senator's
labored use of the word ``chutzpah,'' the Liebermans' faith
provided the strategic and oratorical underpinnings of the entire
day. Campaign aides even volunteered that the Gores and Liebermans
shared a meal on Monday night that was prepared by a kosher
caterer.
</P>
<P>
   The intended message was that Gore, who has been characterized
throughout his career as an exceedingly tentative politician, had
acted boldly in making the most important decision of his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be very clear about this,'' Lieberman said. ``It isn't
me, Joe Lieberman, who deserves credit and the congratulations for
taking a bold step. It is Al Gore who broke this barrier in
American history. And you know what it shows? It shows Al's faith
in the tolerance of this diverse nation in the basic fairness of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk of tolerance was directed partly at the suburban voters
who were the primary targets of the spotlighting of minorities at
last week's Republican convention in Philadelphia. But it also was
clearly aimed at comforting the Democratic base about the selection
of Lieberman, who is conservative by party standards.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Lieberman told of a conversation that he had on
Monday with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. ``He said something to me that
went to my heart and I hope it will to yours as well,'' Lieberman
said. ``He said to me, `You know, Joe, each time a barrier falls
for one person the doors of opportunity open wider for every other
American.''

RECORD AUTO PROFITS BOLSTER HYUNDAI, AND EMBOLDEN CREDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest
conglomerate, reported record profits in its automotive business on
Tuesday, an unexpected piece of good news from a company known
lately for its heavy debts, its drag on the national economy and
its defiance of pressure to change.
</P>
<P>
   The results at Hyundai's automaking subsidiaries, Hyundai Motor
Co. and Kia Motors Corp., reflected a rebound in demand for new
cars in South Korea and a record surge in exports, especially to
North America. But Hyundai creditors immediately seized on the news
to demand that the parent company hasten its promised restructuring
and separate the auto business from Hyundai's unhealthy
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at Hyundai Motor for the first six months of this year
surged to 310.4 billion won, or $278 million, from 110.2 billion
won a year earlier. Kia, which verged on collapse during South
Korea's economic crisis a few years ago, earned 82.6 billion won,
or $74 million, in the first half of this year, in contrast to a
loss of 33.8 billion won a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Motor said sales rose 40 percent, to 8.47 trillion won,
or $7.5 billion. Sales at Kia rose 69 percent, to 4.8 trillion won,
or about $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For Hyundai, it was clearly the best news since June, when
DaimlerChrysler AG agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in Hyundai
Motor with an option to buy 5 percent more over the next three
years. That relationship is expected to make Hyundai a top global
car brand.
</P>
<P>
   Since the DaimlerChrysler alliance, however, Hyundai Motor's
parent company has been hurt by growing concern over a severe cash
shortage at another important subsidiary, Hyundai Engineering and
Construction. This has increased pressure from creditors who are
demanding the separation of healthy affiliates from the Hyundai
Group. The creditors are also seeking a far lower profile in the
group's management affairs by Hyundai's founder, Chung Ju-yung, 85,
and his sons Chung Mong-jun and Chung Mong-koo.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai Group's main creditor, Korea Exchange Bank, sent a
letter to the conglomerate on Tuesday demanding an acceptable
restructuring plan by next Saturday. The conglomerate had proposed
a restructuring plan over the weekend, but the creditor bank
rejected it, saying the plan failed to satisfy concerns about the
family's management roles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hyundai Motor's strong results helped it to reduce some
debts, total debts at the construction unit and the group as a
whole are still high. Total debts at Hyundai Engineering and
Construction stood at 5.1 trillion won, or nearly $4.6 billion, at
the end of 1999, of which nearly half is due by the end of the
year. Total debt at the conglomerate stood at 52.6 trillion won, or
more than $47 billion, at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about Hyundai's debts has weighed on South Korea's stock
market and has made investors wary about the true extent of the
country's recovery from its 1997-98 economic crisis. Hyundai's
problems were an important reason that President Kim Dae-jung shook
up his cabinet on Monday, replacing the finance minister and other
important economic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors of Hyundai regard the founding family as a major
impediment because family members have resisted efforts to make the
company's finances more understandable.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent contradiction of vows made to shareholders two
months ago, when he announced he would relinquish his management
control of the Hyundai Group, the conglomerate's founder recently
raised his stake in Hyundai Motor.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Mong-koo, a son of the founder, still leads the carmaker.
Although analysts say that Chung Mong-koo is one of the few people
who know the full workings of the company and that he has a solid
grasp of the terrain of the domestic auto industry, critics say he
is intertwined in the group's complicated web of cross-debt
guarantees.

 &HT;    Florida gets its own label
 &HT;    By Stephanie Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ David Gardener keeps a secret list of all the products
he'd like to bear the multicolored FLA USA logo.
</P>
<P>
   Gardener, brand development director for Visit Florida, the
state's tourism agency, has so far been able to cross phone cards,
disposable cameras, saltwater taffy and now, bottled water, off
that list.
</P>
<P>
   Iced tubs laden with FLA USA-labeled Aqua Clara water sat in
exhibit halls, meeting rooms and hallways at the 33rd Governor's
Conference on Tourism at Doral Golf Resort and Spa, which ended
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 900 people who attended the three-day conference knocked
back nearly 5,400 of the 20-ounce bottles of oxygen-enriched,
purified tap water from Clearwater (''Aqua Clara'' means Clear
Water).
</P>
<P>
   This summer, bottles of Aqua Clara _ billed as containing 800
percent of the oxygen found in regular water _ hit 900 General
Nutrition Center stores in the Southeast and Puerto Rico, said E.
Douglas Cifers, who is chairman of Aqua Clara Bottling &AMP;
Distribution (OTC-BB: AQCB, 13 cents).
</P>
<P>
   Cifers, who also publishes magazines such as ``Florida Living''
and ``Florida Fishing &AMP; Boating,'' declined to disclose the royalty
arrangement with Visit Florida, but said he expects the agency will
see commissions in the low six figures this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gardener said any money the agency receives from its licensing
deals is a side benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's promotion of the brand,'' Gardener said. ``My job it to
get the brand out.'' So far, he said, 34 different products feature
the FLA USA logo.
</P>
<P>
   Slapping the FLA USA logo on taffy and bottled water isn't meant
to supplant the $9.5 million Visit Florida spends on TV and print
advertising or the $1 million it shells out for Internet
promotions. But tourism officials hope the colorful logo _ unveiled
in 1997 after $237,000 spent in development _ conjures up thoughts
of Florida vacations, just as the ``swoosh'' symbol is associated
with Nike's athletic products.
</P>
<P>
   Florida apparently leads the nation in aggressively licensing
its tourism logo, Gardener said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the first, or we're at least one of the first,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, the state's tourism motto is also an
admonition _ ``Go California'' _ but state outlets such as the gift
shop at the Capitol building in Sacramento don't have trinkets
featuring the motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't really find things like bottled water with our
slogans on it,'' said gift shop clerk Monica Bratcher.

   DARBY, Mont. _ Surrounded by swirling woodsmoke, and with forest
fires crackling on a hillside just over the horizon, Craig Bobzien
waved an arm over acres of equipment and exhausted firefighters in
the Bitterroot Valley fire camp near here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough. It's just not nearly enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With fires raging out of control in a dozen Western states,
Forest Service officials like Bobzien are scrambling to find the
manpower and resources needed to combat the worst fire season in
more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bobzien tramped through the muddy fire camp at the
Western edge of the state, row after row of military-style tents
stretched over several acres: a hospital tent, operations tent,
mess tent, even a finance tent to keep track of all the money being
spent to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more than 60 fires going just in the district that I
manage, which is around a half-million acres. At least 130,000
acres of that area is on fire right now,'' said Bobzien, a Forest
Service ranger for the Sula and Darby districts. ``Until we get
rain or snow, it will only get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sept, chief of external affairs at the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said: ``We've got something going here
that we've never seen before. We have most of the West burning all
at once, and it's really straining our resources to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, which coordinates the federal response to major fire
scenes, reported that eight people _ ``two civilians and six in the
line of duty'' _ had already been killed, though officials
cautioned that they were still gathering data.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no one explanation of why the fires are so
pervasive this year, Bobzien speculated that they were at least in
part a result of previous fire-fighting successes. That is, the
Forest Service can generally suppress most natural fires very
quickly, but as a consequence a buildup of combustible fuel occurs
over decades _ a tinderbox awaiting a season of hot, dry weather as
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, officials said that more than 4,000 people were
fighting fires across the state.
</P>
<P>
   With hot, dry weather blanketing most of the country from the
Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains _ and no rain in the forecast
_ firefighters are battling blazes in Alaska, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   In California alone, officials are combating 12 separate forest
fires, including a 72,000-acre blaze in the Sequoia National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, fire officials said that more than 4 million acres
have burned this year, despite government expenditures of $500
million to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Bobzien said that the heavily forested mountains around this
river valley were the Forest Service's No.1 priority for the
moment. ``We've got several thousand people living in a long,
narrow valley with really only one highway in or out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That highway, U.S. 93, was closed on Tuesday morning south of
Darby, and the route north was jammed with evacuees and flatbed
trailers hauling in earthmoving equipment to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Thick smoke cut visibility to less than 100 yards at the Forest
Service's forward fire camp, and buses shuttled exhausted
firefighters back and forth between the blazing hills and their
tents.
</P>
<P>
   The Interagency Fire Center said that firefighters had come from
as far away as Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. At least 1,200
military personnel are also fighting the fires, and President
Clinton met with some of them in Boise on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rex B. Mann, an area commander for the Forest Service brought in
from Kentucky to help fight the Montana fires, said that skilled
firefighters were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said that staff reductions at the federal level had
undercut the Forest Service's ability to deal with the multiple
fires in multiple locations the nation is experiencing this summer.
And, he said, the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fire season usually doesn't start until about now or
slightly later,'' Mann, a 33-year veteran with the Forest Service,
said. ``We're going to have to take a whole new strategy in the
next 10 days if we're going to beat this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That new strategy might include concentrating personnel and
equipment on certain areas. ``We'll have to make some tough
decisions about what fires we have a chance of stopping and which
ones we've got to let burn out,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly 500 families were evacuated on Tuesday from communities
around Hamilton, 10 miles north of here, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it mandatory evacuation, but we're not forcing anyone
to leave,'' said Bobby Kitchens, an information officer for the
Forest Service. ``If they won't go, the deputies get their Social
Security number and contact information for their next of kin.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Baughman was visiting his daughter on Laird Creek Sunday
when, he said, fire officials told them ``If you don't leave now,
you won't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a huge firestorm coming over the mountain on both sides
of the road as we got out. It sounded like the roar of a jet plane,
with flames 60 or 70 feet high, and the wind was howling like a
hurricane, but hot,'' he said. ``The whole mountain was on fire in
a matter of minutes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 50 homes near Darby have been destroyed in the last
two days, and officials have evacuated the communities of Springer
and Laird Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Betty and Charles Theis had just moved to Springer in June, but
on Tuesday they are living at an evacuation center in Hamilton,
wondering if they still have a home.
</P>
<P>
   They were part of a caravan of 60 cars, led by a truck with a
snowplow, that fought their way out of Springer Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd had fires all around us for a week, then suddenly we were
told to get out,'' Mrs. Theis recalled. ``As we left, there were
flames on all sides of us, roaring up the mountain, and the road
was covered with rocks and fallen trees. At one point, a flaming
log came rolling down the hill and slammed into one of the cars
ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife, too, was trying to escape, she said. ``We saw four
bears, and tons of deer running in all directions. And, when we got
to the mouth of the valley, all the wild sheep had come down from
the hills and they were just huddled there together by the road,
shuddering.''

PUTIN PROMISES ASIDE, LITTLE CHANGE FOR RUSSIAN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government's recent campaign to intimidate
some of this nation's most powerful business leaders is meant at
least in part to show them that President Vladimir Putin is firmly
in control. But beneath the surface, executives say, it is business
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The intimidation campaign has included spectacular raids by
masked federal agents on offices, surprise lawsuits charging fraud
and tax evasion, and public reprimands of the so-called oligarchs
who have amassed enormous amounts of property and political
influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Such moves were
all but unheard of under Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, business leaders, including some of the oligarchs
themselves, say little has changed in the way their companies
operate. Political connections, they say, are still the most
important ingredient for success in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business strategy under the new administration hasn't
really changed,'' said Mikhail Fridman, chairman of Alfa Group, one
of the country's most influential financial concerns. ``Russia is a
country with a fairly opaque economy and to do business here you
need sturdy political connections and relations. To deny this is
just silly.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the behavior of businesses here is rooted in a
relationship with the government that evolved in czarist Russia
centuries before the 1917 revolution. Russian businesses have long
sought the blessing of government bureaucrats to get ahead.
Personal relationships guided business dealings often more than
laws. Company owners competed for the loyalties of corrupt local
officials. The country's richest men helped Yeltsin win the
presidency in 1996, and in return, they were given government posts
and tremendous influence over policy.
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely these men that Putin promised during his
presidential campaign to push out of government.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal investigations were opened against the media magnate
Vladimir Gusinsky, and executives at Russia's biggest oil company,
carmaker and metals company. But over the last two weeks the law
enforcement authorities have dropped most of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   The government also has ignored the high-profile armed standoff
between two factions of directors vying for control of the Krystall
vodka factory in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Some tycoons, like Roman Abramovich, a friend of the Yeltsin
family who owns vast assets in Russia's oil and aluminum
industries, have gone untouched by state investigations, raising
concerns that some industry leaders are more equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   Some business executives fret that under Putin corrupt
bureaucrats will be replaced with a new set loyal to him but no
less hungry for personal advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's aides say the president has already taken decisive
action to curb Russia's regional governors, some of whom are known
to bully business, obstruct economic changes and block liquidations
of money-losing factories that should be shut to save costs. The
aides say society is stuck in old perceptions and definitions about
how Russia is run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have left the epoch with the old set of cliches, clans and
groups,'' said Vladislav Surkov, deputy head of the presidential
administration. ``Now there's a wind of new power, and it's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   But business leaders are still playing by the old rules. Fridman
of Alfa Group is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   With assets like gasoline stations, grocery stores and the
country's biggest private bank, Alfa has risen to be one of the
Russia's most influential business groups. It has extensive
contacts in Putin's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Fridman said political connections were essential, but
acknowledged that too many make a business beholden to government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential to have contacts with government on all
levels,'' he said, ``but we don't want to make it a priority.
Business sitting in the front row seats always has to take the most
criticism.''

WHEN   FOREIGN   MOVIES   MATTERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By PHILIP LOPATE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For five weeks, through Sept. 14, Film Forum is
showing some wonderful foreign classics made in the years 1945-65,
everything from ``Children of Paradise'' and ``Open City'' to ``The
Seventh Seal'' and ``Breathless.'' The series is titled ``The
Golden Age of the Foreign Film,'' a challenging claim; it sounds
almost too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a golden age in any field must be viewed with
suspicion, in part because it is so often used as an unfair
reproach to the present. I can understand the impatience of younger
film lovers as they roll their eyes at yet another paean to the
good old days of the French New Wave, or one more elegy about the
death of cinema and the irrelevance of contemporary film criticism.
</P>
<P>
   My own sense is that brilliant, powerful, formally innovative
movies _ our future classics _ continue to be made at this moment,
all over the planet. Cinema is not at all dead. What is dead, or at
least diminished, is film culture, the whole support system of art
houses, influential movie magazines, Olympian film critics,
16-millimeter series operating in church basements like
revolutionary cells, all embracing the latest cinema while filling
in the historical gaps.
</P>
<P>
   What is gone is the excitement of an international movement, and
with it, the buildup, the anticipation of new sensations from
abroad. So I think it's valid to say that 1945-65 was a golden age
for foreign films. It was a remarkable, probably unrepeatable
moment, when masters from the silent era (like Luis Bunuel, Jean
Renoir, Yasujiro Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi, Marcel Carne) were still
producing some of their greatest work, veterans entering middle age
(Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino
Visconti, Ingmar Bergman, Vittorio De Sica, Michelangelo Antonioni)
were reaching their peak and newcomers (Jean-Luc Godard, Francois
Truffaut, Satyajit Ray, Andrzej Wajda, Jacques Demy) were stunning
the world with their audacity and reinvention of film form.
</P>
<P>
   Why were these two postwar decades, specifically, such a good
time for foreign film in America?
</P>
<P>
   One answer is the high quality of the films; another is the
receptivity of American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate postwar period was one of worldwide unease: the
fresh memories of unspeakable carnage; the returning soldiers'
difficulties adjusting to civilian life; the bitterness toward
those who had prospered; the situation of women who had acquired
some independence in the wartime workforce and now were being
coerced back into domestic roles; the refugees and ``stateless''
citizens waiting in displaced persons camps; the need to rebuild
cities reduced to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Japan led the way in making movies with a tragic sense
of life. American audiences, for the moment non-complacent, were
dazzled by the stark production values of Italian neo-realism, with
its location shooting and (sometimes) non-professional actors, and
began acquiring a taste for humanistic realism, poverty,
black-and-white photography and unhappy endings. At home, American
studios took note of the newly pessimistic mood by producing film
noir _ largely a postwar genre made by European emigre directors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sex was also a major attraction of foreign films. Not
only could foreign directors get away with more, not having to
answer to the Hollywood production code; they also took for granted
such facts of life as extramarital affairs, homosexuality,
prostitution and so on. This gritty realism was all very
titillating: adult movie houses marketed art films like Bergman's
``Monika'' as if they were soft-core pornography. In those years,
America still looked to Europe for its sophistication, aesthetic
and sexual.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain the sea change that has occurred since? With the
triumph of popular culture over high culture, Americans, global
exporters of the winner, pop culture, no longer feel the same
longing for what the Old World knows.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, our movies have caught up sexually with the
rest of the world, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Another changing factor has been the role of film festivals.
There were fewer in the postwar era, and the results counted more.
A victory at Cannes or Venice created almost unbearable suspense
about the winner's American release date.
</P>
<P>
   Compare with the present: if ``Rosetta'' or L'Humanite'' or
``Beau Travail,'' all recent festival award-winners from directors
with promising track records, had been released around 1962, I am
sure these stunning films would have been more talked about and
successful at the box office. As it is, each came and went rather
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: American audiences have become more resistant to
reading subtitles, while American independents have learned from
foreign film classics to make homegrown art movies. Hollywood has
done a good job of capturing an increasing market share worldwide,
stifling the local product and discouraging the distribution of
foreign films stateside.
</P>
<P>
   It must also be admitted that European cinema has sharply
declined since its postwar heyday _ maybe not as much in France,
but certainly in Italy, Germany, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe. The
fact that Americans seem to identify more with European than Asian
or African cinema may explain why the largely Third World cinematic
titans of our own era, like Abbas Kiarostami, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Wong
Kar-wai and Ousmane Sembene, have failed to become household names
on the order of Fellini, Truffaut or Fassbinder. Or maybe it's that
the whole machinery of promoting film directors as auteurs, demigod
celebrities, seems to have slipped into lower gear: even a hot
European filmmaker like Lars von Trier can no longer command the
name recognition of Ingmar Bergman. (Leaving aside the fact that
he's not as good as Bergman.)
</P>
<P>
   The golden age of foreign film coincided, not surprisingly, with
the zenith of the art house. Hollywood studios' stranglehold on big
theater bookings had prompted small, independent theater owners to
switch to a foreign product. Art houses grew nationally from 12 in
1945 to more than 550 in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Every medium-sized city had one. New York boasted over a dozen
first-run, single-film art houses, most memorably the Little
Carnegie, the Fifth Avenue Cinema, the 68th Street Playhouse, the
Plaza, the Fine Arts. As art movies became hip, so did their
venues: with espresso machines and stools in the lobbies, they were
the forerunners of coffee bars, great places to pick up (or imagine
picking up) someone attractive. In retrospect, these art houses may
have been as important for their urbane architecture and interior
design as their promotion of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside these first-run theaters, somewhat rattier in
appearance but equally important, were the repertory houses _ the
Thalia, the New Yorker and the Bleecker Street Cinema in New York,
the Brattle in Cambridge, the Telegraph in Berkeley. These were our
film schools. You could catch up with double-bills of classics all
summer long at the Thalia, or cut classes and watch two ``forgotten
films'' at the New Yorker, shuttling the Upper West Side corridor
between 89th and 95th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a teen-ager I was attracted to film (and jazz, for
that matter) in part because there was only about 50 years of
history to keep in one's head. I could sit through some of the
duller silent classics mentioned in Arthur Knight's paperback
history of movies, ``The Liveliest Art,'' knowing that such dues
were finite. But cinema has now celebrated its 100th anniversary,
and at 100 years the narrative of the canon begins to fragment. No
longer do Pabst and Murnau seem to glide so effortlessly into
Welles and Wyler.
</P>
<P>
   Or there are newer, more truncated canons: the young men in a
college film course I teach are keenly aware of sci-fi pedigrees,
from ``2001'' through ``Blade Runner'' to ``The Matrix,'' or of
Quentin Tarantino's debt to John Woo and David Lynch, but they've
never seen a Godard, much less heard about ``Wild Strawberries'' or
``Diary of a Country Priest.''
</P>
<P>
   Video rentals spelled the demise of the repertory houses. With
everything on tape (or, it was assumed, soon to be), audiences no
longer felt the urgency to catch something old because it might not
show again. ``The Bicycle Thief'' and ``Ugetsu'' began to seem like
passe monuments, Old Master paintings in museums one might revisit
any time. A curious thing happened: the drive for novelty brought
the peripheral genres, the larky impulse rentals, to the center,
while marginalizing the classics. Visit a hip video store today and
you will find film noir, Hong Kong action pictures and ``outlaw''
directors (like Samuel Fuller, Sam Peckinpah and Ed Wood) featured
prominently, while the more unambiguously towering cinematic
masterworks are either unavailable or shunted to a back-room side
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Film Forum's redoubtable programmer, Bruce Goldstein, who
curated the current series with Michael Sayers, is on a mission to
change all that. Interestingly, Goldstein himself did his part to
nurture film noir, pre-code, sci-fi, and campy ``worst'' movies
into commercially viable genres.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly, he explains, that one had to package something
unusual to attract the press, which meant abandoning the
tried-and-true repertory. ``But because we did all these weird
series,'' he adds, ``we'd lost sight of the classics. It's time to
get back to basics.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't get any more basic than ``The Golden Age of the
Foreign Film'': besides the aforementioned titles, its lineup
includes such unassailable classics as ``Rashomon,'' ``Seven
Samurai,'' ``L'Avventura,'' ``Contempt,'' ``La Dolce Vita,''
``Tokyo Story,'' ``Rocco and his Brothers,'' ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' ``Ashes and Diamonds,'' ``The 400 Blows,'' ``Los
Olvidados,' ``The Golden Coach'' and the Apu trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   One might quibble with the omission of Rohmer, Becker, Rivette,
Resnais, the Russians and the British, but of course such a series
has to be highly selective. The list does include a number of
crossover hits of debatable quality: the over-ripe ``Black
Orpheus,'' the likable but cheesy ``Never on Sunday,'' the
over-calculating ``Wages of Fear.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Other art house favorites included in the list, like ``Woman in
the Dunes'' or ``Repulsion,'' seem now more like clever tours de
force rather than full-blown masterworks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no attempt to lure the jaded cineaste with obscure
films like those that might turn up at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, museums, which have been heroically
shouldering the bulk of the movie classics repertory, can perhaps
adopt a more scholarly stance. Film Forum (though technically also
``nonprofit'') is a self-sustaining movie theater and has to be
cannier about pulling in an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely the charm of this current series, then, is that it is
so definitely meat and potatoes, with no surprises, no revisionist
intents. Its very emphasis on foreign film's greatest hits helps to
recapture more sharply the cultural moment. Some of the pairings
are particularly deft: Truffaut's underrated ``Soft Skin'' with
Claude Chabrol's nifty ``Bonnes Femmes.'' Goldstein, ever
respectful of history, says, ``I see it almost as an homage to the
Thalia and the New Yorker, and the kind of double bills they did.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing has gotten better from the golden age of repertory:
print quality. In the 1945-65 era, film buffs took what they could
get, often scratched or washed-out dupes of pirated prints in 16
millimeter. Today's audiences are more exacting on that score, in
addition to which the copyright laws have changed, making
respectable pirating more difficult. Meanwhile, a handful of
influential programmers (most notably Goldstein) have been able to
persuade studios to strike new 35-millimeter prints. Distributors
like Kino International, Milestone Film and Video, Interama, Strand
and Rialto Pictures have done their part by rereleasing
theatrically a stream of classics, many of which are included in
this series.
</P>
<P>
   A whole new generation raised on video will thus be able to see
these magnificent films as they were intended, projected on a big,
enveloping screen in crisp visual detail. Older viewers like myself
can revisit their favorites, savoring the satisfaction of taste
confirmed or the piquancy of disappointment. Either way, we may
someday look back with gratitude at Film Forum's repertory
operation as a golden age unto itself.

U.S. SWIMMERS TO DON HIGH-TECH BODY SUITS AT OLYMPIC TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When the Olympic trials begin here on Wednesday,
American swimmers will make as much news for what they are wearing
as for what records they may set in preparation for the 2000 Summer
Games next month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A bodysuit, including a long-sleeved design that fits athletes
from neck to toe, has revolutionized the sport by reducing drag as
swimmers slice through the water. A flurry of records set by Inge
de Bruijn of the Netherlands and Ian Thorpe of Australia have put
others on notice that the suits give an edge to elite swimmers. At
least 11 world records have been set internationally since the new
suits were approved this year for international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 1,306 competitors at Indianapolis are expected to
wear some version of the suits at the Olympic trials, as are a
great majority of the medal hopefuls in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The new suits are said to increase speed by up to 3 percent,
which can make the difference between a gold medal and fourth place
in a sport in which races are decided by hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the top American swimmers have welcomed the suit as an
inevitable advance in technology that has brought the hinged-blade
to speed-skating, aerodynamic bikes to cycling, the flexibility of
fiber glass to the pole vault and graphite rackets to tennis.
</P>
<P>
   In her attempt to win five gold medals at the Summer Games, the
sprinter Marion Jones has been experimenting with a hooded,
full-length bodysuit to counter the effects of the wind and cool
temperatures expected in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely used model of the suit here is made by Speedo,
the official supplier of the U.S. national swim team. It is called
the Fastskin suit, which mimics shark skin in that it contains
tiny, v-shaped ridges that allow water to pass over the swimmer
more efficiently. The super-stretch fabric also compresses a
swimmer's muscles, reducing vibration in the tissue and therefore
reducing the buildup of lactic acid that causes fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers also say the suit lifts them higher in the water and
helps them retain speed and form when they begin to tire. There are
five versions of the body suit available. Some swimmers prefer
suits that only cover their torsos, some men prefer only trunks
that extend to their thighs or toes, and some male and female
swimmers are wearing the neck-to-toe version without sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a power suit when I put it on; I feel like a
superhero a little,'' said Tom Malchow, who set a world record in
the 200-meter butterfly in June in a body suit. ``I was hoping they
would put a Superman or Batman logo on the front.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone approves of the suit. Alexander Popov of Russia is
one of only a handful of top swimmers who do not wear a bodysuit,
yet he shattered the world record in the 50-meter freestyle in June
and said he would continue to wear the same briefs that brought him
two gold medals in the sprints at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Gary
Hall Jr., who finished second twice to Popov in Atlanta, agreed
with his rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gimmick,'' Hall said. ``It's an attempt by the swimsuit
manufacturers to make everyone believe that the suit makes the
swimmer, not that the swimmer makes the suit.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the suits comes on several fronts. First,
swimming's world governing body, known by its initials as FINA, has
approved use of the suit even though its bylaws prohibit any device
that enhances an athlete's ``speed, buoyancy or endurance'' in
competition. John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic
Committee, has accused FINA of misinterpreting its own rules in
allowing the body suits, which clearly aid in speed and lift in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not every athlete has had equal access to the suits, or
has been able to have one custom-fitted. The U.S. swimming
federation initially banned the suits from the trials, saying they
would be unfair because not every athlete could get them. The
federation quickly backed down last month when a swimsuit
manufacturer filed a grievance with the U.S. Olympic Committee.
Every swimmer at the trials who wants a body suit is supposed to
have one provided free of charge (for consumers, Speedo expects the
full-length, long-sleeve suit to retail for $250 this fall). It was
clear Tuesday, however, that some swimmers were experimenting with
the suits for the first time with the trials only a day away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people haven't worn them before coming here, it could be
dizzying trying to figure out which style to wear,'' said John
Collins, who coaches the renowned Badger Swim Club in Larchmont,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers also believe that the suits will only increase
the anonymity of the swimmers, who are already hidden in the water
when they compete, their heads covered in swim caps.
</P>
<P>
   But the cat is out of the technological bag, so to speak, and
any swimmer who does not wear one in Sydney risks being left behind
in the chase for medals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new suits are hardly the first innovation in swimwear.
Bodyhugging Lycra suits appeared in the mid-1970s, and more than 75
percent of the medalists at the 1996 Atlanta Games were a version
of the Speedo ``Aquablade'' model, sleeveless suits that covered
women from neck to knee and men from waist to knee.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 100 suits that another sportswear company,
Nike, has given away here at the trials, 95 have been a version of
the bodysuit, said Carrie Bates, a sports marketing manager for the
company and an Olympic champion swimmer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never stop the evolution of technology,'' said Bates,
who won three gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. She
disagreed with Hall's assessment that the suits were a gimmick.
``This is about helping the swimmers find what they are most
comfortable and confident with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A number of swimmers have complained that the swimming
federation's vacillation has caused confusion and interrupted
training with the suits. But most swimmers seem pleased to have a
chance to compete in the suit before the Olympic Games, where they
will be prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the decision,'' said Jenny Thompson, who has
won five Olympic gold medals in the swimming relays. ``We should be
practicing what's going to be the norm in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, who became the only American woman ever to win
four swim gold medals in one Olympics at the Atlanta Games, pointed
out that she won the 50-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly
by a combined total of four hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to turn a swimmer like my mom into an Olympic
gold medalist,'' Van Dyken said. ``But in hundredths of a second,
it could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Krayzelburg, a world-record holder in the 100- and
200-meter backstroke, said he would wear a version of the Fastskin
suit that extended from his waist to his knees because he sensed a
loss of feel for the water in the suits that covered his entire
legs, chest and arms. Some breaststrokers said they felt
constrained by the new suits when they perform their
outward-kicking stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting on panty hose but 10 times worse,'' said
Kristy Kowal, a favorite in the 100-meter and 200-meter
breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most elite swimmers will squeeze themselves into some
form of the body suit here and in Sydney. Some are already
anticipating the next advancements for the 2004 Summer Games in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of years, I don't know if they're going to have
gills built into the suits, but that would be kind of cool,'' Van
Dyken said.  &QL;

 NASHVILLE, Tenn.: other American.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite sweltering 97-degree heat that left Gore's drenched
shirt stuck to his back, the Democratic team got exactly the images
of family and rectitude that it wanted out of Tuesday's event. The
Gores and Liebermans, who have socialized together for years,
appeared buoyant and affectionate as they strode in unison down a
runway and onto the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two couples and their children, as well as the two
candidates' elderly mothers, created an attractive family tableau.
Lieberman, who Democrats hope will help separate Gore from
President Clinton's moral lapses, attested to Gore's devotion to
his wife and children and described the vice president as ``a man
of family and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore spoke warmly of Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, and the
two candidates, having removed their jackets, exchanged a mighty
bear hug after Gore introduced his running mate. Lieberman, clearly
having the time of his life, smiled giddily and pumped his fists as
the crowd chanted ``Joe, Joe, Joe'' and waved newly minted
``Gore-Lieberman'' placards.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who spoke for 20 minutes, twice as long as Gore,
described the surreality of the last 24 hours as ``a magical
mystery tour.'' In his prayer, he thanked God for ``bringing me to
this extraordinary moment in my life'' and thanked Gore ``for
making this miracle possible for me and breaking this barrier for
the rest of America forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he added, ``there are some people who might
actually call Al's selection of me an act of chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman spoke touchingly of her parents, both of whom
survived the Holocaust, and said she was moved to be speaking at a
memorial that commemorates ``the American heroes, the soldiers who
actually liberated my mother in Dachau and Auschwitz (in fact, the
War Memorial, with its limestone Doric columns, was built in 1925
to honor the 3,400 Tennesseans who died in World War I, according
to the Tennessee Historical Commission).
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you and your family immigrated from Europe, Africa,
Mexico, Latin America or Asia, I am standing here for you,'' Mrs.
Lieberman said. ``This person is our country. This land is your
land and anything is possible for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's speeches continued a pattern in the 2000 campaign, in
which Democrats and Republicans seem to be appropriating each
other's language. Gore's reference to tearing down walls echoed
President Ronald Reagan's memorable demand to Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the Soviet leader, to tear down the Berlin Wall. That phrase, in
turn, showed up in Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech at the
Republican convention last week.
</P>
<P>
   And Lieberman on Tuesday quoted Gov. George W. Bush's father,
who asked in his 1988 campaign, ``If you have to change horses in
midstream, doesn't it make sense to get on the one that's going in
the right direction?''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, the co-chair of the Democratic National Committee,
said after the speeches that the new Democratic ticket was being
received enthusiastically, even by liberals who might disagree with
Lieberman's centrist politics. ``What brings them back is the sense
that we're going to win with this ticket,'' he said. ``While the
Republicans had this illusion of inclusion convention, all about
photo ops, Al Gore is all about real opportunity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before and after Tuesday's event, Lieberman, 58, spent time
meeting campaign aides, receiving briefings on Gore's positions,
working on the speech he will deliver at next week's Democratic
convention in Los Angeles, and preparing for a multi-state campaign
swing that begins on Wednesday with a visit to Gore's hometown of
Carthage, Tenn., and to Stamford in Lieberman's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican nominee, said in a statement on Tuesday
that he respected Lieberman ``for his convictions, his strong
faith, and his record on Social Security, missile defense, and
reforming our public schools.'' Those were pointed references to
past positions taken by Lieberman _ in support of allowing workers
to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the private markets,
deploying an expensive space-based missile defense system, and
establishing pilot programs allowing parents to use federal
vouchers to pay private school tuition _ that are opposed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This selection,'' Bush continued, ``now presents the Vice
President with an interesting test of whether he will continue
attacking positions his running mate shares, or whether he will
lift up our nation by elevating the tone of his presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials on Tuesday distributed quotations and
writings by Lieberman, including an unpublished article written in
June, suggesting that he had moved away from his support for the
partial privatization of Social Security because it posed
unacceptable risks for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, sounding more like a Tennessean than a son of
Connecticut, used his speech on Tuesday to shoot down the Bush
campaign's suggestion that he had more in common with Bush than
with Gore. ``With all due respect,'' he said, ``I think that's like
saying that the veterinarian and the taxidermist are in the same
business because either way you get your dog back.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore on Tuesday took pains to emphasize the
positions on which he and Lieberman agreed. ``He believes, as I
do,'' Gore said, ``that every family has a right to clean air and
clean water. He believes, as I do, in that the earth is the Lord's
and the fullness thereof.'' Gore continued: ``He believes, as I do,
in an America that frees itself forever from the dominance of big
oil and foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, he said repeatedly, he and Lieberman had fought for
welfare reform, for fiscal discipline and balanced budgets, for
putting more police on the streets, for providing health care for
uninsured children, for campaign finance reform and for a strong
national defense. He pointed out that both men ``broke with our own
party to cast two lonely Democratic votes in support of the Persian
Gulf War.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing attention to Lieberman's religion once again, Gore said,
``Joe and I come from different regions and different religious
faiths. But we believe in a common set of ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Lieberman mentioned President Clinton in their
remarks on Tuesday, though Lieberman said the Democratic ticket
would ``help renew the moral center of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has long been considered one of the most moral voices
in the Senate, and Democratic strategists believe it is beneficial
that he was one of the first in his party to strongly and publicly
denounce Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Gore on Monday, parts of which were
broadcast on Tuesday, NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw read Gore portions
of a September 1998 speech by Lieberman in which the senator
labeled Clinton's behavior inappropriate, immoral and harmful. He
then asked Gore whether he agreed with Lieberman ``when he said
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did,'' Gore responded, ``and said so at the time and I think
most Americans agreed with that. I think that most Americans want
to talk about the future of our country and want to focus on the
choices that we have to make in this election and I think honestly,
Tom, that most people are ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he said, would play an active role in his campaign. But
he added: ``I am running this campaign on my own with my own
message and vision and I welcome his help in support of that
message and I expect I'll receive it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore has never condemned Clinton with words approaching
Lieberman's. He initially defended Clinton, saying he believed the
president's denials of improper conduct. After Clinton admitted in
August 1998 that he had been deceptive, Gore said he was proud that
the president ``has had the courage to acknowledge mistakes'' and
said he was honored ``to work with this great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days after Lieberman made his remarks on the Senate
floor, Gore said of Clinton that ``he himself has said what he did
was wrong.'' About a month later he gave his own opinion that
``what the president did was wrong.'' His strongest comments came
in a June 1999 interview: ``What he did was inexcusable and,
particularly as a father, I felt that it was terribly wrong,
obviously.''

<P>
   The Invisible Man was never like this.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Claude Rains simply disappearing as he unwraps his
bandages, (beginitalic)Hollow Man (enditalic)features fantastic
transformation sequences as bodies dissolve before our very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In a special-effects showcase, skin melts away, replaced by bone
and sinew. Muscles gradually disappear until there's only a
skeleton. Finally, the bones seem to disintegrate, and there's
nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's something, you should see it in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   And in (beginitalic)Hollow Man(enditalic), you do. The
disappearing and reappearing trick is trotted out several times,
and it never fails to impress. We've come a long way from Lon
Chaney Jr. turning into a werewolf.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those old horror movies had substance and style,
which (beginitalic)Hollow Man (enditalic)clearly lacks. While the
special effects and a wisecracking Kevin Bacon are enough to carry
the first 90 minutes, the movie unravels in the final act.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the film devolves into something akin to
(beginitalic)Alien:(enditalic) a monster on the loose with our
brave crew trying to find it and survive in the process. It's also
quite the gore fest, with gallons of blood and mangled corpses
everywhere. Not to mention explosions - lots of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Though (beginitalic)Hollow Man (enditalic)would have worked much
better as an understated thriller, director Paul Verhoeven just
couldn't resist returning to his blood-soaked
(beginitalic)RoboCop-Total Recall (enditalic)roots.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad because the movie starts out with promise as we
meet Sebastian Caine (Bacon), a cocky, egotistical researcher who
has developed an invisibility serum. Caine, who is working with the
military - invisible soldiers being a pretty formidable weapon -
first tests his serum on animals but becomes convinced it will work
on humans.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon does a nice job developing the character, who takes an
almost boyish glee in his work while being reckless at the same
time. He also lightens the tone with good comic timing.
</P>
<P>
   Like brave researchers before him, Sebastian decides to test the
invisibility serum on himself, with the help of his lovely
assistant, Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue), and granite-jawed
researcher Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin). Naturally, Linda is
Sebastian's old flame, and she's now dating Matthew behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it's the old good-news, bad-news scenario. It's
pretty easy to make Sebastian disappear. But making him reappear
proves a little tougher.
</P>
<P>
   With Sebastian invisible, the movie rolls out the inventive
special effects, adding clever touches throughout. The audience can
have fun counting the ways to spot the invisible man, at least for
a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian is not the nicest guy, so he ultimately becomes the
world's most scientifically advanced peeping Tom, and worse.
Gradually, the whole thing begins to work on his mind, with
somewhat unfortunate results.
</P>
<P>
   Being invisible has other drawbacks, especially for an audience.
Ultimately, Verhoeven must have realized that the viewers need to
see Sebastian for part of the time, so he replaced Rains' bandages
with a crude latex mask.
</P>
<P>
   When Sebastian removes his sunglasses, he's literally
empty-headed.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no better way to describe (beginitalic)Hollow
Man(enditalic).

MISTAKES HAMPERED U.S. DRUG EFFORTS IN COLOMBIA 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A State Department audit found that mistakes by
U.S. advisers in Colombia hampered anti-drug efforts there, even as
America prepares to spend $1.3 billion to beef up that nation's war
on narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-page inspector general's report obtained by the Houston
Chronicle detailed miscues between State Department officials in
Colombia and that nation's police that occurred during ongoing
helicopter missions against drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general said U.S. advisers failed to warn the
Colombian National Police that helicopters received from American
contractors lacked extra fuel tanks and minigun mounts to make them
effective drug fighting machines.
</P>
<P>
   It also noted that the Colombian police had trouble providing
basic equipment for helicopter crews because of what the report
termed as ``inventory problems.'' One result was a crash in which
air crews were injured because of a lack of helmets.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, State Department officials allowed U.S.
helicopters to be transferred to Colombia without adequate spare
parts, which led to the aircraft being frequently grounded.
</P>
<P>
   With America poised to send massive amounts of aid to Colombia
to help that nation escalate its attacks on drug traffickers, the
inspector general report worried some members of Congress. But
State Department officials said they can correct the problems
detailed in the report.
</P>
<P>
   American advisers have been helping Colombia in its war against
gangs that supply much of the cocaine and opium reaching America.
Part of that effort has been to supply Colombia with helicopters
and other equipment for finding and destroying drug crops. The
massive aid package recently approved for Colombia will be spent
mostly on helicopters and other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was completed in late July and has not been
publicly released, also confirmed earlier assessments that an
expensive U.S. effort to spray plants that produce cocaine and
heroin with herbicide had been a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite spending over $100 million on the increased
eradication efforts during FY 1997-99, the results of the spray
program are uncertain,'' the report said. It noted that, ``the
(State) Department's efforts have had little measurable impact on
the U.S. drug market, as Colombian cocaine and heroin continue to
be readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will travel to Colombia at the end
of August to ``personally underscore America's support for
Colombia's efforts to seek peace, fight illicit drugs, build its
economy and deepen democracy.'' He will be accompanied by House
Speaker Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has been locked in a decades-long struggle with leftist
guerrilla groups, as well as highly organized and well equipped
drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress passed a Clinton administration backed $1.3
billion aid package that is aimed at helping Colombia with its
anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton signed the aid bill, guerrilla groups have mounted
a series of attacks, leaving dozens of Colombian police and
civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the drugs are grown in guerrilla held areas, and
under the protection of guerrilla fighters, some in Washington are
concerned that the aid package will deepen U.S. involvement in the
war between Colombia and the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $1.3 billion is to equip Colombia with helicopters
and to train anti-drug forces in an effort to reach vast drug
growing areas in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the glitches found by the State Department report in
how Colombia is using U.S. supplied helicopters of major concern to
some lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The report said neither Washington nor Bogota-based State
Department officials ``suggested that the Colombian police consider
installing auxiliary fuel tanks or additional minigun mounts on the
UH-IIs.''
</P>
<P>
   That puzzled the inspector general because the State Department
had configured its own helicopters with the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And the inspector general review found State officials allowed
helicopters to be transferred to the Colombian police ``without a
parts support package'' which ``resulted in unnecessary downtime of
(Colombian police) aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who chairs the House International
Relations Committee, said of the inspector general's audit,
``Overall, this report reveals serious shortcomings in the
administration's approach to counter-drug programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said, ``I am worried that the administration will not be
able to effectively use the $1 billion in additional aid Congress
recently provided for Colombia's war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   One State Department official said, ``What problems that were
brought up in the report are being fixed. There is a learning
curve, and lessons have been learned from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Topping, a spokeswoman for the State inspector general's
office, said the report did not recommend a major restructuring of
the U.S. anti-drug effort in Colombia. She said the inspector
general is confident the issues the report raised will be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   A separate State Department report to Congress dated July 31
described how the administration proposes spending the $1.3 billion
in aid. Huge chunks of the money would go to funding and outfitting
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Up to $208 million would go to buying 16 Black Hawk helicopters
for Colombia. Those would be the most modern and longest range
helicopters given to Colombia. Another $60 million would go to
convert 30 old UH-1H helicopters into Huey IIs, which have greater
range and firepower capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   And $60 million would go to helping refit additional helicopters
now in storage so the Colombians could use them in ``larger scale
airmobile operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional millions of dollars would provide Colombia with fuel,
ammunition, spare parts and crew training necessary for effective
use of the helicopters. &QL;

 &HT;    Falcons ready to move into new Flowery Brance facility
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greenville, S.C. - Where once there were dirt floors, the
Atlanta Falcons on Thursday will tread gold.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   But when the team moves into its new facility in Flowery Branch,
coach Dan Reeves and his team will make a quantum leap not only
from their humble 22-year-old facility in Suwanee, but from Reeves'
first visit with the organization 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, when he was offensive coordinator with the Cowboys,
Reeves interviewed to be head coach.
</P>
<P>
   He did not like what he saw in the bowels of old Atlanta-Fulton
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest shock was the weight room was on a dirt floor,''
Reeves said. ``And when the Braves were (playing) in there, the
Falcons had to go practice in a nearby park.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Falcons won't have to go anywhere to practice, even in
lousy weather.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the team would bus from its 28,000-square foot
facility in Suwanee to the Georgia Dome _ if it was available _ for
late-season practices when weather was an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the new $18 million facility, which is still being built,
will have a covered field in a 92,000-square foot building. That's
in addition to a 75,000-square foot building that will be team
headquarters, and three outdoor fields.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terance Mathis, entering his seventh season with
the Falcons, can hardly believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Before, meeting rooms, rehabilitation stations, departments,
cafeterias, etc. were spread out over three buildings and six
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having everything under one roof is great,'' he said. ``You
never have to worry about bundling up, or walking in the rain. I'm
happy to be around to see it. It's been talked about for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Team president Taylor Smith and Reeves began talking of this
when Reeves was hired in '97.
</P>
<P>
   There was hiccup this time last year when it looked like the new
facility would end up in Stone Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
   But various financial reasons and the possibility of the
organization one day owning rather than leasing its new property
shifted the focus to the sleepy town off I-985, near Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   This facility won't be sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Where defensive staffers used to cram into coordinator Rich
Brooks' office for meetings, now, every position will have a
meeting room of its own.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of the team-wide meetings that used to be so
uncomfortable in that trailer on the hill, there will be a 128-seat
auditorium where every player, coach, video man and scout will have
a table of his own
</P>
<P>
   Don't even get strength and conditioning coach Al Miller
started.
</P>
<P>
   Half the high schools in Georgia have a bigger, better and less
cramped weight room than what he's had.
</P>
<P>
   It was great in '78, when the Falcons moved into the Suwanee
facility, but the NFL and especially and each team's support
staffs, have grown in leaps and bounds since.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the local team catches up.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there were two bench presses, there will be at least
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be about three times as big,'' Miller said. ``We
can handle everybody. You won't have five or six people waiting at
one station. It shortens their workout time, and helps the
conditioning factor because they can get through there faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be nice. It's going to be a health club.''
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Bob Whitfield, of course, offered a different
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it's all the way out in Flowery Branch,'' he said,
souring on his commute. ``Unless Taylor has that helicopter ready
for me, that's a beast.''
</P>
<P>
   The team president just happened to walk up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Bob, you're going to love it,'' Smith said. ``They got a,
`Cold plunge.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's a large, cold whirlpool for cooling down in after hot
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, well that sounds nice,'' Whitfield said, arm around Smith.
``Can you put a beer tap in there, too?''
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be a soda fountain in the media work room, and
press conferences will be just around the corner and down the hall
from the media work room.
</P>
<P>
   At Suwanee, there was no media work room, just a small, dingy,
dark room in the old Falcon Inn motel.
</P>
<P>
   Press conferences were in a trailer. The media relations office
was in another trailer, marketing in another trailer, some rehab
equipment in another trailer, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For press conferences, for example, we'll have track lighting,
which will be nice for TV,'' said Aaron Salkin, director of public
relations. ``We're going to have a research/archives room. And each
writer will have a work station.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of corporate development and former linebacker
Tommy Nobis _ who used to work out under the old stadium _ was the
point man in researching other NFL training facilities, and worked
closely with architects.

   Executive vice president administrations Jim Hay has overseen
construction.

<P>
   ClayCo, a St. Louis-based contractor that built the Rams'
facility, is pulling this off so fast heads are spinning, although
the team can not yet handle fans because of ongoing construction of
parking lots and the indoor facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those old defensive meetings, it was almost a joke. Those
guys were sitting in each other's laps,'' Nobis said. ``Now, that
cold pool will be like jumping into a lake in Wisconsin in the
winter. The Swim-X is a rehab-type pool that gives you a current.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody looking at new facilities would say the Rams' is the
nicest now. I'm prejudiced, but I think this is going to be
nicer.''
</P>

   Equipment manager Brian Boigner will have about three times more
storage space, and sliding shelves and closets.

   ``We'll be going to all digital video, and each coach will have
one installed in his office,'' he said. ``Instead of having to
scroll through it, when they want play No. 47, they can just go
straight to it. And I'll have about three times more room.'' Reeves
is convinced it will be a home capable of helping attract free
agents, even though it's about 50 miles from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving into the new facility is like moving into a new house.
It kind of lifts everybody's spirit,'' he said.

U.S. DRUG CHIEF VOICES CONFIDENCE IN MEXICO'S EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In one of his last official visits here as the
U.S. director of drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey praised the
transition team assembled by President-elect Vicente Fox and said
he shared Fox's opposition to the American drug certification
program.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey, who has long expressed misgivings about the
program, said at a news briefing that there was ``zero'' chance
Congress would end it in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   At most, he said, the program might die a natural death as the
Organization of American States drew up plans next year for a
multinational drug evaluation process that would open all member
governments' drug programs to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually believe,'' McCaffrey said, ``that the certification
process is slowly disappearing under the evidence that
multinational cooperation better serves the interests of the
American people than confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, created by Congress in the 1980s, the State
Department evaluates other countries' drug interdiction efforts and
can impose economic sanctions on countries that do receive
certification. Most Latin American governments view the program as
interventionist and lopsided because it does not allow for scrutiny
of American efforts to combat drug consumption.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who arrived here on Monday for meetings with
officials like Fox's chief security and law enforcement advisers,
praised the president-elect for seeking greater cooperation among
countries in the fight against drugs. And he said he was confident
that Mexico's efforts would not be weakened by Fox's plans to
gradually limit the role of the military.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has long praised the Mexican military as a crucial
element of the battle because of its successes in destroying
marijuana crops and in confiscating shipments of drugs traveling
through Mexico on the way to the United States. At least 60 percent
of all cocaine that enters the United States is widely thought to
pass through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``My judgment is that President-elect Fox and this team that we
are working with are pragmatists,'' McCaffrey told reporters.
``They are determined to go down in history as Mexican patriots. I
cannot believe they will do anything that doesn't make sense to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got large new visions,'' he said, ``and what we are
going to do is listen to what they say and be supportive of their
emerging strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his election on July 2, Fox announced plans to
reorganize the Mexican justice system to resemble U.S. agencies. At
the same time, he announced plans to lobby Washington to end the
drug certification program. This will be among the topics to be
discussed this month when Fox travels to the United States to meet
with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the Republican
presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Fox's transition team said that even though ending
certification seemed unlikely, Mexico was determined to stop it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In the days before Gov. George W. Bush
announced his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate, Vice
President Al Gore and his advisers sensed an unexpected
opportunity. Aboard Air Force II and in Gore's campaign
headquarters here, there was a consensus that Bush and his aides
had bungled their selection process, that the Republicans had come
across as leak-prone, rushed and uncharacteristically amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign swiftly set out to exploit this perceived
weakness by trying to turn the running mate selection process
itself into a political weapon. With lock-step discipline, Gore's
spokesmen derided Bush for conducting his search ``like a
fraternity rush.'' They presented Gore's selection process as
dignified, orderly, pander-free and, above all else, private.
</P>
<P>
   But the strict secrecy imposed by the Gore campaign shielded
from public view an intensely political, highly competitive and
sometimes frenetic selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Gore's selection process was shaped by gritty
political concerns that had little bearing on what he had
repeatedly described as his single most important criterion for a
running mate _ someone possessed of the experience and ability to
assume the presidency if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gore's aides say that the way he went about picking
Sen. Joseph Lieberman illustrates several of the vice president's
strengths, most notably his meticulous, rigorous preparation before
arriving at major decisions. Gore, they say, has raised vetting to
new levels of thoroughness and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The team that vetted Lieberman, for example, went so far as to
review the more than 800 legal opinions that Lieberman rendered
when he was attorney general of Connecticut from 1983 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, while praising Lieberman as a man of integrity,
said that Gore's selection process underscored what they described
as his penchant for tactical ruthlessness and a tendency to shade
the truth for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, dismissed the notion that
the Gore decision-making process was more orderly and dignified
than Bush's process. He said that much of what Gore did, including
his mention of a ``wild card'' candidate, was theater designed for
public consumption. He said that the important difference between
the two campaigns was that the Bush campaign had greeted the choice
of Lieberman graciously, while the Gore campaign had attacked
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're missing the whole big picture on where the public is
about attacking everything,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher, 74, the former secretary of state chosen by
Gore to lead his selection team, was well aware of the perils of
the process. A hasty vetting job in 1984 left Walter Mondale's
campaign bogged down for weeks with questions about the finances of
his running mate, Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who tries to do this has to read the history and see
the mistakes that were made and try to avoid them,'' Christopher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore's spokesmen insisted that there was no long list,
no short list, no list at all, Christopher embarked on a series of
interviews to help Gore pare down their list.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher visited Lieberman in his Senate office on May 1. In
an interview the next month, Lieberman described his session as
``an out-of-body experience'' for a politician who had once been
too embarrassed to openly admit his ambition to be a senator. That
day, as he faced his old friend _ he calls him Chris _ Lieberman
found himself suddenly confronting the dizzying possibility of
occupying the nation's second highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chris came here it was the first moment it had any
reality to it,'' he said. ``Somebody said to me: `This is like the
ministry. You're called to the ministry, you don't seek it.' And it
took on some reality in that conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   By early June, Gore had settled on about a half-dozen names and
told Christopher to go ahead with full vetting on this group. The
vetters gathered boxes of records from each of the finalists _
every vote ever cast, every press release ever issued, transcripts
of speeches, videotapes of political debates, books they have
written, school transcripts, a lifetime of financial and medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the vetting was in full swing, there were
indications that Lieberman was the leader of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, the day William Daley became campaign chairman, his
first substantial conversation with Gore quickly turned to the
question of running mates. ``He said, `Joe is really close, he's
really great, what do you think?''' Daley recalled. ``Then he went
into the other candidates, but he was the first one he named.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, the day before Bush announced his selection of
Cheney, Gore told reporters that Bush's pick probably would not
have an impact on his selection. But behind the scenes, advisers
believed that Cheney's experience had to be accounted for, and that
dynamic favored Lieberman, 58, running for his third Senate term.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the gravitas level, he matches up,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lieberman advocates were making the argument
to the highest levels of the campaign that with Lieberman's ``seal
of approval,'' it would be difficult for Bush to continue to tar
Gore with the president's affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the thoroughness of the Gore screening process, his
vetters never fully explored the possible impact of the largest
question mark over Lieberman _ how voters would react to an
Orthodox Jew on a national ticket. A number of people on
Christopher's consultation list had repeatedly raised Lieberman's
religion as a possible problem. But Gore, who has been criticized
by Republicans for being excessively guided by polls, issued orders
that no steps were to be taken to gauge public reaction to
Lieberman's religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore said, 'That's not part of me. That's not part of my
thinking. I exclude that,''' Christopher recalled.
</P>
<P>
   What they did, do, though, was explore dozens of hypothetical
situations to test how Lieberman would respond to potential
conflicts between his observance of the Sabbath and the duties of a
vice president, said Jamie Gorelick, a former deputy attorney
general who vetted Lieberman, said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had definitely thought through them in the context of the
public life he has led to date,'' she said. ``He has had to vote on
the Sabbath, go to critical meetings on the Sabbath, has had to be
away from home on the Sabbath and he has thought through those
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's interview with Gore, conducted at the vice
president's residence at the Naval Observatory, lasted about an
hour, the same amount of time Gore spent with the other finalists.
</P>
<P>
   But it clearly went well.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, a member of an informal group
that advised Gore during the selection process, described Gore's
response to the interview with Lieberman as one of affirmation
rather than revelation. ``You had this sense of, `Boy, was I right
about this guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before Gore told aides of his decision, he called his
oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, who was in her apartment in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes on a personal instinct for this sort of thing,'' she
said. ``And I always knew he would.''

LIEBERMAN SAYS DEMS WON'T CEDE MORALITY ISSUES 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an observant Orthodox
Jew, wove in references to scripture, God and faith Tuesday as he
addressed a Nashville crowd after he was introduced as Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Jew to run on a major party presidential
ticket, praised Vice President Gore for a bold historical move.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there are some people who might call Al's selection
of me an act of chutzpah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also made it clear that the Democrats will not cede
morality and character issues to the Republicans. The two will
claim their party's nomination for president and vice president at
the Democratic National convention next week in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore introduced Lieberman during a noon rally at the War
Memorial Plaza in downtown Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Lieberman drew parallels between their ticket and
that of John F. Kennedy, who in 1960 became the first and only
Roman Catholic to be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week when our party meets in Los Angeles we will recall
the last time we met there, at the convention where we nominated
John F. Kennedy,'' said Gore. ``That year, we voted with out hearts
to tear down a mighty wall of division. We made history. And when
we nominate Joe Lieberman for vice president we will do it again.
We will tear down an old wall of division once again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, hoping to blunt Republican nominee George W.
Bush's bounce in the polls after last week's successful GOP
convention, has been elated at the initial reaction to the
selection of Lieberman, a two-term Connecticut senator who grabbed
Americans' attention in 1998 by scolding President Clinton for his
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits and even some Republicans praised the centrist Democrat,
who has broken with his party on a number of issues, including his
support of private school vouchers. One overnight poll by Gallup
USA found Gore had almost erased the double-digit gap with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman never mentioned Clinton, he alluded to both the
pluses and minuses of the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the economic boom of the two Clinton terms,
Lieberman dismissed Bush's claim during his convention speech in
Philadelphia that the last eight years have been squandered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the same people who let this nation drift are trying to
convince us that the past eight years have been squandered,'' he
said. ``But if you're one of the 22 million people who got a new
job during the past eight years, they haven't been squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also disputed claims by the Bush aides that he and the
Texas governor have similar political philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, I think that's a little bit like saying
that the veterinarian and the taxidermist are in the same business,
because either way you get your dog back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman also tried to show that he and Gore would set a
different moral tone than Clinton. To make his point that the Gores
shared his ethical standards, he referred to Tipper Gore's
controversial campaign in the 1980s to put warning labels on rock
albums containing profanity and sexually suggestive lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we must work, and we will work _ Al and Tipper, Hadassah
(his wife) and I _ to help renew the moral center of this nation so
that families can be stronger, children safer and parents empowered
to pass to their children their faith and moral values,'' he said.
``As Tipper Gore said so well, when it was difficult to say, let's
stand with parents who are trying to raise PG kids in an X-rated
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also spoke of himself as the embodiment of the
American dream, the son of a baker who worked long hours to send
his three children to college.
</P>
<P>
   The senator made numerous references to his faith, at one point
citing a passage from Chronicles in the Old Testament. He appeared
to offer a brief prayer, ``Dear Lord, I thank you for bringing me
to this extraordinary moment of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined on stage by his wife, who noted that both of her
parents were World War II Holocaust survivors. Looking at the
majestic war memorial, she said that it was American soldiers who
liberated her mother from the concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I stand before you deeply, sincerely thankful that I am an
American,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The extended Lieberman family was also present, including three
of their four children, and a granddaughter who is named Tennessee
because her mother grew up in a small town in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sweltering heat that forced Lieberman at one point
to borrow a towel to wipe his brow, the candidates and their
families were clearly buoyed by the enthusiastic reaction of a
crowd estimated at 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gore skipped over various areas where he and
Lieberman have disagreed over the years and instead emphasized that
they have shared a common philosophy that focuses on fiscal
discipline, a strong defense, welfare reform, and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said both men backed campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lieberman was one of the few Democrats on a Senate
committee investigating Democratic abuses during the 1996
presidential campaign that voiced criticism of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also touched on the character issue. ``Joe Lieberman has
the experience and integrity,'' he said. ``He has the courage and
the commitment. And for all his public life, Joe Lieberman has
stood for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used a statement complimenting Lieberman to take a shot at
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Senator Lieberman for his convictions, his strong
faith, and his record on Social Security, missile defense and
reforming our public schools,'' Bush said. ``I hope he will run a
positive campaign and that the vice president will use this
opportunity to change his tone to that of Senator Lieberman's
level. This selection now presents the vice president with an
interesting test of whether he will continue attacking positions
his running mate shares, or whether he will lift up our nation by
elevating the tone of his presidential campaign.'' &QL;

CARGO CAPSULE DOCKS WITH SPACE STATION 
 
 

</HEADLINE>
 STATION-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An unmanned Russian Progress cargo capsule filled with
vital life support equipment such as a toilet, vacuum cleaner and
other supplies docked Tuesday with the soon-to-be-inhabited,
U.S.-led international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the gear is destined for installation aboard the large
new Russian crew module that arrived on July 25, furnishing the
slowly developing orbital outpost with its first living and working
quarters for future resident astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   With the smaller Progress in pursuit, the two spacecraft linked
at 3:13 p.m. CDT, as they coasted more than 220 miles over Central
Asia. Though supervised by ground teams in suburban Moscow, the
operation was closely monitored at the station's mission control
facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Launched Sunday from Kazakhstan, the 23-foot-long cargo capsule
delivered more than 1,300 pounds of equipment. They included oxygen
generation and carbon dioxide removal systems to supply and recycle
breathing air aboard the station, a Russian space toilet, laptop
computers, food, clothing and communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with last month's much-delayed addition of the large
Russian crew module called Zvezda, Tuesday's linkup sets the stage
for a steep acceleration in U.S. station construction activity,
including plans for nine NASA space shuttle assembly missions
within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic problems delayed the arrival of the
43-foot-long crew module by 27 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Progress and its cargo will remain undisturbed until the
shuttle Atlantis reaches the station in early September with a U.S.
and Russian crew. During a five-day stay, the visiting shuttle crew
plans to unload the Progress and begin the task of installing the
Russian life support equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts will prepare the slowly developing station for the
arrival of its first resident crew in early November aboard a
Russian Soyuz capsule.
</P>
<P>
   American commander Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko
and Sergei Krikalev have trained to complete the activation of the
life support equipment early in their four-month stay. Like the
others to follow, their expedition will be punctuated by the
arrival of space shuttle crews with large new station components.

   ``We are starting to embark on a set of activities that is
probably as complex as anything we've ever done in the space
business, including landing on the moon,'' Ron Dittemore, NASA
shuttle program director, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to follow its September shuttle visit to the station
with major assembly flights in October, November and January. The
October flight will add an external foundation to the station for
the American solar-power generator that will follow on the November
mission. The electricity generated by the new solar array power
module will be needed by the large U.S. laboratory module slated to
follow on another shuttle in January.
</P>
<P>
   More flights will follow next year to equip the laboratory with
research gear and to add an airlock to the station, easing the many
spacewalks that will be needed future construction.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the station's 16-nation partnership hopes to complete
the assembly by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, the orbital outpost will sprawl to the size of a
pair of football fields placed side-by-side and house seven-member
crews.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating crews will be assigned a range of physics, biology and
medical experiments aboard a half-dozen laboratory modules. Station
residents will also keep tabs on changes in the Earth's environment
and test hardware that could be used for future human expeditions
to the moon and Mars. &QL;

VERIZON TALKS WITH CWA AND IBEW SAID TO STALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VERIZON-NORTHPOINT, NY-VERIZON) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contract negotiations took a turn for the worse Tuesday, the
third day of a strike by more than 86,000 employees of the nation's
largest local telephone company, dimming hopes for a quick
resolution, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the two striking unions and the company, Verizon
Communications, stalled on several issues, including the contract
for about 50 union members at Verizon's wireless division, the
people said. And progress slowed on other issues, including
mandatory overtime and the shifting of some work to other locations
in response to the merger that created the company.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon (pronounced vah-RISE-un) was created by the merger of
Bell Atlantic and GTE. Verizon also controls a wireless venture
with Vodafone Airtouch of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On one issue, distrust took its place alongside disagreement
Tuesday, as union negotiators chafed at news that Verizon had made
a deal to buy NorthPoint Communications, a provider of high-speed
Internet access lines, for $800 million. The unions have been
trying to get the company to stop subcontracting the installation
of Internet lines to nonunion installers. The deal to buy
NorthPoint, a nonunion installer, only adds to the tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased to see Verizon's proactive in moving into
broadband Internet access or any other area that would make the
company more competitive,'' said Larry Cohen, executive vice
president of the Communications Workers of America. ``But we want
details about how our members would benefit from this _ something
beyond the gloss of a Powerpoint presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   The CWA represents 72,000 of the striking Verizon workers, with
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers representing
the other 14,000 or so, which are striking against the company in
12 Eastern states, from Maine to Virginia, and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street responded to the NorthPoint transaction by
pushing down Verizon shares nearly 14 percent because of its likely
impact on earnings, union negotiators questioned how the deal would
affect their concerns about subcontractors and the ability of union
members to get jobs in fast-growing areas of the industry like
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Although unionized employees at Verizon could eventually benefit
by working at the NorthPoint venture, so far NorthPoint's 1,500
employees are not union members. And unless the negotiators reach a
specific agreement on the matter, it could be difficult to turn the
NorthPoint jobs into union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the sticking point over whether Verizon will
continue to subcontract some work installing high-speed Internet
lines to outside companies remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman, said he was surprised by the
unions' reaction to the transaction because the company had briefed
the unions on the deal beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Although issues of wages, benefits and working conditions are
also under discussion, the future of organized labor in
fast-growing areas like high-speed lines and wireless
communications has emerged as the central issue of this strike.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the two sides are nearing an agreement on procedures
that might make it easier for the unions to organize workers at the
32,000-employee Verizon Wireless unit, a person close to the
negotiations said. But the talks have stalled over a contract for
the 50 or so union workers who are currently at Verizon Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike is pivotal because the unions are confronting
changes produced by rapid technological advances with rare
sophistication,'' said Richard Hurd, professor of labor issues at
Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   The strike _ and the pounding of Verizon's share price _ come at
a delicate time for the company as it embarks this month on a
brand-identity campaign to promote its new name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly not the association you want to build as you
launch a new brand,'' said Martin Tipping, director of naming at
Landor Associates, a corporate identity consulting company. ``At
least people are learning how to pronounce the name.''

NEW YORK CITY AREA IS FRONT LINE OF VERIZON STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also VERIZON-STRIKE, VERIZON-NORTHPOINT) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it a New York state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Three days into the strike by more than 86,000 employees of the
nation's largest local telephone company, spanning the region from
Maine to Virginia, the most strident and sometimes violent front
lines of the walkout have been in New York City and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the company, Verizon Communications, said it had
reported 455 strike-related incidents of assault, harassment and
vandalism to the police in 12 states and the District of Columbia _
with more than half of them in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The first two strike-related arrests were made in New York on
Tuesday. And Tuesday evening, New York State Supreme Court Judge
Louis York, in Manhattan, granted the company's request for a
temporary restraining order, effective through next Monday, that
bars picketers from preventing managers or replacement workers from
entering their offices or carrying out work assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-ups, ranging from egg throwing to arson, have come
amid a scorching spell of heat and humidity that descended on the
New York metropolitan area on Sunday, shortening tempers just as
the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The weather may help explain why the city, which lately has
prided itself on a steep drop in crime, was rocked on Sunday night
by a wave of violence, including 20 shootings and four murders,
that had nothing to do with strike,
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But experts say outbreaks along picket lines and evidence of
strike-related vandalism in New York point to broader,
farther-reaching factors in the nation's largest city and
communications capital, where a rapid technological, new-economy
shift into nonunionized wireless and Internet communications jobs
is running head on into a long tradition of union activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place where the unions will have their impact,''
said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban studies and
telecommunications expert at New York University. ``The density of
the city means that a small disruption can have an enormous
effect,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the company declined to estimate how many of
several thousand residential phone lines in New York City were
still out of service because of vandalism that had occurred since
the strike began early Sunday. Union leaders have denied member
involvement in any network vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said the unionized Verizon workers, many of them schooled
in strike tactics through years of employment at AT&AMP;T and Nynex
(which merged with Verizon's predecessor, Bell Atlantic, in 1997),
hold a particularly potent weapon in New York because of their
knowledge of the intricacies the city's telecommunications wiring _
and because of the wide publicity they are assured if the network
is disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the infrastructure because they built it,'' he said.
``And since this is the media capital of the world, you get more
sympathy from other union workers than you would anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   That logic was apparently not lost Tuesday on a striking Verizon
worker, who gave his name only as Jerry, and who was involved in a
confrontation outside a Verizon maintenance garage on King Street
in the Soho section of Manhattan. Accounts varied, but the incident
resulted in a maintenance truck being battered and stuck under a
electronic gate that witnesses said had been lowered by strikers,
who had access to the gate's remote control box. A nonunion Verizon
contractor, who was in the truck, was not injured. No arrests were
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, it gets tense,'' said Jerry, a member of
the Communication Workers of America. ``But we know that a large
majority of jobs in this industry will go wireless, and it is only
the union that can give us a future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides winning the court injunction, the company responded to
union violence by increasing a $10,000 reward it began offering on
Sunday for information leading to convictions for strike-related
vandalism. The new bounty is $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have evidence the our management workers have
experienced abuse from the pickets, sometimes dangerously so,''
said Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman. Similar injunctions had been
issued by state courts in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island on Monday,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Tuesday's arrests in New York, a picketing worker was
charged with disorderly conduct outside Verizon's Manhattan
headquarters at Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street, after
police said he refused to remain behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   In the other incident, police said a striking worker was charged
with petty larceny after removing lug nuts from the wheels of a
Verizon maintenance truck on West 15th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon said Tuesday that it had received reports of 143
incidents of vandalism or harassment involving its employees or
equipment within New York City since the strike began, and believed
at least 115 may have involved criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   But a CWA spokeswoman in Washington, Candice Johnson, said
Verizon might be exaggerating the disruption caused by the strike. &QL;

CHOICE OF JEWISH CANDIDATE IS NOTED IN SLURS ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut for the
Democratic ticket has prompted a barrage of anti-Semitic comments
in online chat rooms and on Internet message boards, leading at
least a few online services to start purging offensive postings.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hours after the news broke on Monday, chat rooms on
America Online and Yahoo were peppered with slurs against Jews. At
times, as many as half the comments included offensive remarks.
</P>
<P>
   On an AOL message board devoted to conversation about Lieberman,
where more than 20,000 comments had been posted by Tuesday
afternoon, many included disparaging references to Jews. AOL
monitors began removing offensive postings on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials would not say how many messages had been deleted.
But they said they were prepared to suspend or cancel the accounts
of those found to have violated the service's rules against hate
speech, vulgar language or harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Message boards are like collections of open letters, available
indefinitely to be read and responded to. Chat rooms are harder to
monitor, because they are live discussions among perhaps a dozen
computer users, and the comments vanish almost as quickly as they
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Comments on Monday ranged from direct slurs against Lieberman to
denials of the Holocaust. Some were in German. In a Yahoo chat
room, a person who went by the name Young Nazi Girl declared Jews
to be people with ``loyalty to no one but the dollar.'' In an AOL
chat room, some visitors declared that Jews controlled and
manipulated the government and the media.
</P>
<P>
   CNN.com banned 10 chat room visitors for offensive remarks
related to Lieberman, said Edna Johnson, a CNN spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   On several services, the anti-Semitic vitriol in chat rooms
appeared to have subsided on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League has been monitoring online activity
since the Lieberman announcement and has seen a ``spike'' in
anti-Semitic remarks on the Internet, said Abraham Foxman, the
league's national director. Many were sent to e-mail lists devoted
to discussion of white supremacy, he said,
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, Foxman said, those people would not have
been heard by most Americans. ``Today, this goes globally to a
million people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, online chat rooms are known as places where some
people, shielded by anonymity, let ugly remarks fly. Message
boards, where discussions are archived and therefore more
traceable, may be slightly tamer, but still attract extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Graham, a spokesman for AOL, said staff members and
volunteers would ``aggressively pursue'' those found to have posted
anti-Semitic comments. But he said the number violating AOL's rules
was not abnormal, given the volume.
</P>
<P>
   When Elian Gonzalez was seized by federal agents, Graham said,
more than 60,000 messages were posted within 20 minutes, with a
similar proportion of violations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, staff members of groups like the Anti-Defamation League
and the Simon Wiesenthal Center said the slurs against Jews in
mainstream political chat rooms _ and not just on Web sites devoted
to such causes _ showed that anti-Semites felt emboldened to reach
out to a larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are able to do is piggyback on a news event,''
Foxman said. ``And therefore they get a certain legitimacy, a
boost.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, there were some signs that the anti-Jewish message
would not travel far. Scores of people had logged on to message
boards to balance the offensive remarks with declarations of their
own disgust for anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe,'' wrote one AOL subscriber, ``that anyone in
their right mind would write anything as hateful as I have read
here.''

WELL-SUITED FOR SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INDIANAPOLIS _ If you believe what you've heard the past few
months, there will be no fast swimmers at the U.S. Olympic Trials,
just fast swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is talking about the androgynous, neck-to-ankle
bodysuit that is either revolutionary or revolting, depending on
whom y who think it's cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Me? I wondered what all the fuss was about. I mean, when was the
last time you heard somebody say Tiger Woods' equipment is what
makes him a great golfer?
</P>
<P>
   But as the tales of the bodysuit's magical powers spread far and
wide, my curiosity kicked in. A former competitive swimmer, I
decided to find out first hand what the big deal was. I called Stu
Isaac, the vice president of Speedo, and kindly asked him if I
could test one of his company's Fastsuits.
</P>
<P>
   To my immense relief, he didn't giggle. He shipped me an itsy,
bitsy bodysuit and after I finished laughing, I tried it on, then
tried it out.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same model American Tom Malchow wore when he set the
world record in the 200-meter butterfly earlier this summer. Dutch
sprinter Inga de Bruijn has broken eight world records in it since
May. Clearly, you're not going to put on a suit called a Fastskin
and expect to go slow. So it was with me. I wasn't disappointed,
but I'm also not about to quit my day job.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the expense _ with a retail price of $240, it is not
suited for the masses _ the main problem I see with the suit is
getting to the starting blocks on time.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to the swimmers who will be wearing the bodysuit for
the first time as the Olympic Trials get under way today is the sa
have for people traveling L.A.'s freeways: Allow plenty of time for
unexpected snarls.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac persuaded me to wear a size better suited for Calista
Flockhart. My torso felt like Wayne Gretzky's toes in those
two-sizes-too-small skates he always favored.
</P>
<P>
   It took me 3 minutes of aerobic activity to squeeze into the
sleeveless version of the Fastskin suit (there also are
full-sleeved and half-leg versions). When I later told this to a
women's college coach, she dryly replied that I must have had too
large a size then because her swimmers require anywhere from 10 to
15 minutes to wiggle into their bodysuits. The team record, I was
further informed, is 8 minutes, 23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it's not an article of clothing designed with fashion
runway shows in mind.
</P>
<P>
   When I walked onto the pool deck, people stopped and stared at
me as if to say, uh, lady, you missed the turn for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, it did look like I was wearing a surfer's wetsuit.
But up close you can plainly see the difference; the Fastskin suit,
a blend of polyester, lycra and polyurethane, has V-shaped ridges
that are supposed to lessen drag by directing water away from the
body.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to be the judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   Not being one to jump to conclusions, I DIVED in the pool. To my
surprise, I popped up to the surface like a cork. It was
intoxicating to flit across the pool like a skipping stone.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches I've talked to say the bodysuit is ideal for the
lean swimmer and the not-so-lean alike; it makes the swimmer with
very little bodyfat more buoyant _ thereby cutting down on the
water's resistance _ and acts as a corset that makes everyone else
more streamlined.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is I hadn't ridden that high in the water since being
weaned from my water wings at the age of 2. To paraphrase Dennis
Miller, if I had been any higher, I would have had to submit a
urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say the hydrodynamics of swimming are never going to be
the same, but I imagine the starter at Sydney, before commanding
the swimmers to take their marks, will be instructed to remind
them, ``In the event of a musculature power failure, your suit can
be used as a flotation device.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules established by the sport's international governing
body (FINA) forbid the use of ``any device that may aid (a
swimmer's) speed, buoyancy or endurance during a competition.''
</P>
<P>
   FINA recently ruled the suits do not enhance performance. To
which I say, yes, and androstenedione had absolutely nothing to do
with Mark McGwire's home-run offensive in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   My times in the suit won't have Jenny Thompson or Dara Torres
quaking in their sweats. But I did go half-a-second faster for a
25-yard sprint than what I consistently clock in my tried-and-true
lycra skinsuit. To swim in the bodysuit is to appreciate how a
golfer must feel when he swings one of Callaway's ERC forged
titanium drivers or a cyclist when he's racing down the Alps on an
aluminum feather.
</P>
<P>
   If the bodysuit violates FINA's rules, then I would argue, so do
goggles. After all, they've clearly aided endurance over the years
by enabling swimmers to log lots of mileage in chemically treated
pools without worrying about their eyes swelling shut.
</P>
<P>
   Time doesn't stand still, so why should sporting equipment? At
its best, technology is a tailwind that carries sportsmen and
sportswomen past the old, familiar horizons and into uncharted
territories.
</P>
<P>
   After a cursory check to see which way the wind is blowing, FINA
green-lighted the bodysuits for use next month at the Olympics in
Sydney, which is why a lot of swimmers will be wearing them at the
Trials.
</P>
<P>
   The hope here is FINA doesn't give in to a well-meaning minority
who are painting bodysuits with much the same brush as steroids.
Yes, they both enhance performance. But I have yet to hear of the
bodysuit giving anybody acute acne or irrevocable organ damage.
</P>
<P>
   A little chafing around the shoulders and armpits, maybe, but
that's it.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody really interested in preserving the purity of sport
ought to stop worrying about the dragless suit and do something
about designer drugs. I don't need to try those to know they make
you go faster.

COMMENTARY: A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As though this presidential campaign did not
already have enough father-son drama, now comes the mother of all
contests between Father and Son.
</P>
<P>
   The main battleground state is the state of grace. Democrats and
Republicans are seeking a geographical advantage, but it is
celestial. Both sides seem weirdly obsessed with snagging a divine
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   W. brazenly tried to lay claim to the Son, accepting Christ as
his personal savior and favorite political philosopher, and
proclaiming June 10 Jesus Day in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president chose to contest this holy ground by
revealing that he was a born-again Christian who often asked
himself ``W.W.J.D. _ What Would Jesus Do?''
</P>
<P>
   But with the two sons fighting over the Son, Gore decided to
find a running mate with direct access to the Father. The usually
cautious Gore made an inspiring and brave choice of a senator named
Lieberman, the first Jew on a major party's national ticket and a
believing and practicing Jew who regularly invokes God.
</P>
<P>
   In his Nashville debut on Tuesday, Lieberman mentioned God 13
times in 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The last pol to break a religious barrier, Jack Kennedy, always
played it coolly secular. He would never have prayed in a campaign
speech, or conceded he might be tied up with religious rites on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, JFK promised to keep religion out of politics.
Now candidates promise to drench politics with religion.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpeting values and godliness is the way these boys of summer
promise to exorcise the frisky ghosts of Bill and Monica from the
sacred Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton dominates the race he is not in. In '92 he chose
Gore as his running mate because he needed the Tennessee senator's
Dudley Do-Right image. Having a Vietnam vet and a family man beside
him allowed Clinton to seem less slippery.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight years later, Mr. Clean found himself in need of a Mr.
Clean.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has come away from the White House sex and money
scandals with a patina of grime. The vice president who was chosen
for rectitude, not geography or charisma, felt he needed to choose
a running mate for rectitude, not geography or charisma.
</P>
<P>
   After defending the beleaguered Clinton as ``one of our greatest
presidents,'' Gore had to make up for that ill-considered moment by
choosing a new partner whose piety offset his old partner's
hedonism.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton as
``immoral'' during the Monica megilla, saw the offer from Gore as
comparable to being ``called to the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is in a bitter competition with the first
lady for campaign money and attention, and yet he has ended up
picking someone who might insure that she wins in New York.
(Hillary wasted no time in trying to co-opt Lieberman to campaign
with her, noting demurely, ``but I can't be greedy.'')
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic ticket must take care not to overdo the
sanctimony as they run away from the lame-duck rogue.
</P>
<P>
   Al must sweep into Hollywood with a guy Hollywood can't stand.
Lieberman has teamed up with the conservative Bill Bennett to
castigate Hollywood for its moral ``toxicity,'' saying the town
``doesn't understand piety.''
</P>
<P>
   He has excoriated the NBC megahit ``Friends'' as too sexy for
prime time and suggested that the FCC review the content of
programs when renewing licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, the senator hailed Tipper for the puritanical
crusade that the Gores have spent years begging Hollywood to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bush team praised the selection, we must keep an
eye on them. When the going gets tough, the family and its henchmen
have a nasty way of exploiting differences and craftily implying
that anyone who is not  &UR; like us &LR;  is not ``on the American side,''
as Bush Pere put it in the Willie Horton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The McCains are still seething about Bush supporters in South
Carolina spreading word of their dark-skinned adopted daughter from
Bangladesh. And in '88 Michael Dukakis, with his Greek roots, was
treated as an exotic. On the Bush bus, Loretta Lynn complained of
Dukakis: ``Why, I can't even pronounce his name!''
</P>
<P>
   We can only dread what will happen when this crowd wraps its
tongue around Hadassah.

PBS SHOW AIDS ENTREPRENEUR IN HUNT FOR VENTURE CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER SINTON  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Move over Regis Philbin, Alex Trebek and Pat
Sajak. Public television programs also are handing out big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the PBS-syndicated show ``MoneyHunt'' announced the
winner of its ``Wow! What a Great Idea'' contest for entrepreneurs,
becoming the first TV show to award venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   CampusEngine.com, a Sacramento (Calif.) County startup that
works with college newspapers to expand their Web sites and help
businesses reach the coveted college student market online,
received $100,000. In the process, it beat out more than 2,000
companies.
</P>
<P>
   CampusEngine Chief Executive Officer Jack Crawford started the
company in Folsom, Calif., in October to help college newspapers
build their Web sites into full-fledged Internet portals where
students can communicate and businesses can pay to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, 33, decided to become an entrepreneur after studying
accounting at Arizona State University and working for Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. ``I realized I didn't want to do people's taxes for the
rest of my life and wanted to get involved in technology,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to focus on the college market because it is ``the
most well-connected and Web-savvy market.'' Crawford wanted to
partner with college newspapers rather than having to spend
millions of dollars to establish a brand name on each campus. He
figured that colleges would appreciate help in building their
online communities and that businesses would be interested in
finding a quicker, easier way to pitch their products and service
to many colleges without visiting each one.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. CampusEngine already has partnered with 71 college
newspapers with about 1.4 million students, including more than a
third of the 100 largest colleges. It expects to serve and share
advertising and promotion revenues with 150 campuses by the end of
the year. In California, customers include the University of
California at Davis, the University of San Francisco and California
State University at Chico.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we created `MoneyHunt,' our goal was to foster the
entrepreneurial spirit and highlight the best and the brightest of
the new business ideas being developed across the country,'' said
Miles Spencer, co-founder and host of the show, which is in its
third year.
</P>
<P>
   In its hunt for the worthiest company, ``MoneyHunt'' played host
to events in 14 cities. At the Golden State Venture Capital
Conference in Sacramento in March, CampusEngine beat out about 20
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW09 (63880 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Finally, in the ``MoneyHunt'' episode that premiered on the Web
site ( &LR; www.moneyhunt.com &LR; ) last Wednesday, Crawford faced off
against James Alexander of Mibrary.com, a New York startup.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said he and several other judges were looking for three
things: ``a great idea simply expressed, the opportunity to create
a break-away product and an entrepreneur the camera loves.''
</P>
<P>
   After deftly answering questions and presenting his vision for
CampusEngine.com, Crawford won $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled to win this competition and about the
confidence of people who see thousands of business plans,''
Crawford said. In addition to the investment from ``MoneyHunt,''
CampusEngine has raised $1.5 million in the Sacramento area from
Deep River Ventures, Granite Bay Ventures and Sierra Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford's money hunt is not over. He expects to land
another $10 million from VC firms and media companies in the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ON GRANTS: In response to last week's story about
government technology grants available to entrepreneurs, former
NASA Ames Research Center manager Bob La Mere wrote to recommend
two local community colleges that provide training sessions on the
Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) process.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Center for Applied Competitive Technologies at DeAnza
College in Cupertino, Calif. It provides manufacturing assistance
to small businesses and typically plays host to SBIR process
training in Sunnyvale each year.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the West Valley College California Procurement
Training &AMP; Assistance Center in Saratoga, Calif.
( &LR; www.westvalley.edu/ &LR;   &LR; wvc/calptac &LR; ). Sue Coates, director of the
center, says the center offers $20 workshops and private consulting
``at free or nearly free rates.''

comments and questions to entrepreneurs(at)sfgate.com, or to Peter
Sinton, Grow a Business column, 901 Mission St., San Francisco, CA

MRS. LIEBERMAN, CHILD OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS, NO LONGER WORKING IN
QUIET 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ The selection of her husband as Vice President
Al Gore's running mate thrust Hadassah Lieberman onto the national
stage Tuesday and into the type of highly public role she has
worked hard to avoid as a political spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman, 52, has held several part-time jobs in
Washington since her husband, Joseph Lieberman, was elected to the
United States Senate in 1988. But her friends and former colleagues
say that her first commitment has always been raising to their
daughter, Hana, who is 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman, the former Hadassah Freilich, worked for the
National Research Council promoting education programs and for
APCO, a public relations firm. She has also done freelance public
relations and health care consulting.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Mrs. Lieberman has preferred to work quietly for
charitable causes rather than to actively promote any political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally introducing Mr. Lieberman in Nashville on Tuesday,
Gore's wife, Tipper, spoke of Mrs. Lieberman as the daughter of
Nazi concentration-camp survivors, something that friends say is at
the core of how Mrs. Lieberman views herself and the world. ``I
think her background as a survivor's daughter has given her a
humanity that a lot of people don't have,'' said Mindy Weisel, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mrs. Lieberman is on the board of the Auschwitz
Jewish Center Foundation, which is building a visitors' center near
the concentration camp in Poland and has supported the American
Committee for Shaare-Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Liebermans, who were married in 1983, may seem to have a
1950s style of life, preferring quiet dinners at home to the buzz
of the political social scene, but their family is a decidedly
modern American one, extended exponentially by divorce and
re-marriage even as it has remained rooted in traditional Jewish
observance across four generations.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's first marriage to Betty Haas, a psychiatrist, ended
in divorce in 1981. They have two children, a son, Matt, 32, who
teaches English in New Haven, and a daughter, Rebecca, 31, who
lives in New York City and works for the Children's Aid Society.
Matt and his wife, April, have two daughters, Willy and Tennessee,
whose name provided fodder for Gore at Tuesday's rally in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman is also divorced, from Gordon Tucker, a rabbi in
White Plains, N.Y., who is a former dean of the Jewish Theological
Seminary in New York City. They have a son, Ethan, who is now
studying to become a rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the children, grandchildren and ex-spouses, Mr.
Lieberman's mother, Marcia, still lives in Stamford, where he grew
up, and Mrs. Lieberman's mother, Ella Freilich, a Holocaust
survivor, lives in Riverdale, the Bronx, where she watched her
daughter on television Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't slept in two days already, just answering
congratulations,'' Freilich said. ``I haven't eaten today. I am
just sitting and crying.''

SELES OUT OF TOURNEY BECAUSE OF SORE ARM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ The estyle.com Classic lost one of
its top attractions Tuesday morning when third-seeded Monica Seles
withdrew from the tournament, citing a strained left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Seles said that she injured her arm in practice last Thursday,
three days before she lost to Venus Williams in the final of the
Acura Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started last week in San Diego with blisters on my left
hand that limited my practice,'' said Seles, who is expected to
continue playing next week in Montreal. ``Due to the blisters, I
was forced to adjust my grip, which caused the strain in my
forearm.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles' place in the second round was taken by American Kristina
Brandi, who lost in the final round of qualifying on Monday. Brandi
will face Russia's Elena Dementieva in the second round.

<P>
   __ Tough times: It's been a difficult week for Nathalie Tauziat,
who was eliminated from the tournament Tuesday, one day after she
learned that her appeal to join France's Olympic team had been
denied.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, the author of a recently published book about life on
the women's tour, has become a polarized figure and the object of
much ire on the circuit. She claims that politics, not performance,
led to her being overlooked during Olympic selections.
</P>
<P>
   The French Tennis Federation denied Tauziat's appeal, and the
player now plans to take her case to the International Tennis
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really shocked,'' Tauziat said. ``France is very
political and they never change a decision when they make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, 32, is considering retiring at the end of the year and
is ranked No. 8 in the world, highest among Frenchwomen.
</P>
<P>
   __ Here comes the bride: Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain
defeated her doubles partner, Barbara Schett of Austria, 6-4, 6-1
in her first match following her marriage last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario, whose wedding made front-page news in Spanish
newspapers, had not played since Wimbledon. She lost the first
three games of the first set against Schett but won 12 of the final
14 games and looked sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's not how you start, it's how you finish,''
Sanchez-Vicario said. ``This was the first match after a long break
for me. I even got to spend a few days with my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario, who will turn 29 in December, is at a crucial
point in her career. She is capable of playing high-level tennis,
as she proved by reaching the semifinals of the French Open earlier
this year, but she has slipped from the short list of the world's
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario said her marriage will not impact her future in
tennis, but the future is clearly on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I feel strong and ready to play my best, I'll be
out there,'' Sanchez-Vicario said. ``When I don't feel motivated
anymore, then I will leave.''

SUSTAINABLE-WOOD PRODUCTS GROWING INTO BIG BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sustainable wood products _ anything made from
trees logged in a manner certified as environmentally sound _ have
been in fashion during the past few years, comparable to the
interest in heirloom tomatoes or hemp linen.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Sustainable wood is now big business, and it marks a
melding of commercial timber production and rigorous environmental
standards that could change the way forests are managed and homes
are built.
</P>
<P>
   The movement says you can have your cake and eat it too _ or at
least, have plywood, wood-frame homes and wooden furniture as well
as healthy, biologically diverse commercial forests.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the trend is Home Depot, the biggest retail purveyor of
construction materials in the country. It agreed last year to phase
out the sale of products made from trees logged in an
environmentally dubious fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The behemoth retailer was recently joined in its
sustainable-wood pledge by Kaufman and Broad, one of the country's
biggest home builders.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday, Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, another
do-it-yourself megastore chain, upped the ante. The company
instituted an immediate ban on lumber from the threatened Great
Bear Rainforest in British Columbia. It also said it will phase out
wood products from other endangered forests and give strong
preference to buying environmentally certified wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really taking off,'' said Kate Heaton, a senior forestry
specialist with the National Resources Defense Council, an
environmental lobbying and litigation group. ``A couple of years
ago, it wasn't clear whether it would take hold. Now we know it's
here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustainable wood has caught the fancy of some important players
_ most notably corporate retailers.
</P>
<P>
   After months of protests in front of its stores, Home Depot said
last year that it would phase out products from endangered forest
ecosystems by 2002 and give preference to wood products certified
by the Forest Stewardship Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had tremendous impact,'' said Heaton. ``If there was one
event that really gave the movement serious credibility, that was
it. Now, we're seeing a lot of big corporations jumping on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Woodbury, the manager of environmental programs for
Home Depot, said the company was not driven to its decision by the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Woodbury said company executives began talking with
certified-wood proponents in 1993 and joined the Certified Forest
Products Council in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sound business decision for a variety of
reasons,'' said Woodbury. ``Certification is an excellent tool
retailers can use to demonstrate corporate social commitment and
educate our customers about the importance of sustainable wood
sources. We're finding that customers may not shop specifically for
the (certified) logo, but it increases their satisfaction with the
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentally certified wood is certainly enjoying a vogue in
the Bay Area, if an exhibit at San Francisco International Airport
is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the world's largest sustainable-wood veneer wall _ a
whopping 670 by 38 feet _ was displayed at the airport's new
international terminal along with a collection of products made
from eco-friendly lumber.
</P>
<P>
   The foremost certification group is the Forest Stewardship
Council, an organization founded in 1993 and based in Oaxaca,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appoint the certifying organizations which do the actual
work of evaluating timber operations,'' said Heaton. ``So far,
there are nine certifiers worldwide, two in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ECO09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One of the U.S. certifiers is Scientific Certification Systems,
based in Oakland. The other, a Vermont group called SmartWood,
maintains a partnership with another California organization, the
Institute for Sustainable Forestry in Willits, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Certification is now occurring in both equatorial tropical
forests and temperate coastal forests such as those found in
Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, said Peter Nowack,
the director of marketing and communications for the Certified
Forest Products Council, a nonprofit group that disseminates
information on environmentally certified forestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, boreal forests (located in interior regions at
extreme northern or southern latitudes) will be included in the
process as well,'' said Nowack.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving certification is not particularly easy.
</P>
<P>
   The stewardship council applies 10 principles and 52 criteria in
its evaluations, said Nowack, ``but they all focus on three basic
areas. The first determines if forest management is environmentally
responsible; the second determines if it is socially responsible to
the people who live and work in the forest; and the third looks at
the long-term economic viability of the management plans.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 50 million acres of commercial timberland have been
certified by the council worldwide, with 6 million of that total
located in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like a lot _ but it's the merest fraction of the
world's commercial woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Timber industry giant Sierra Pacific Industries, for example,
owns 1.5 million acres of commercial forest in California alone _
fully 1 percent of the state's surface area.
</P>
<P>
   While many retailers and public-works boosters are charmed by
environmentally certified forestry, the same can't necessarily be
said of U.S. timber producers, many of whom note they are already
adhering to some of the strictest environmental standards in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California forestry practices rules are already extremely
tough,'' said Tim Feller, a district manager for Sierra Pacific
Industries. ``It's gotten to the point that it's very difficult for
us to compete with international producers who face far less in the
way of environmental restrictions, such as Russia, New Zealand,
South American countries and Canada. Last year wasn't a very
profitable one for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Feller said Sierra Pacific subscribes to the Sustainable
Forestry Initiative, a kind of timber and paper industry analogue
to the Forest Stewardship Council.
</P>
<P>
   While the initiative's requirements don't involve certification
and aren't as rigorous as those of the stewardship council, Feller
maintained it promotes healthy woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a rubber stamp,'' Feller said. ``I'm aware of six
companies that have already been booted out because they couldn't
meet the standards. Your records are reviewed, and there's
on-the-ground inspections to make sure archaeology sites,
watersheds and wildlife are protected, and there's good utilization
of all the harvested wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The stewardship council and the forestry initiative are ``two
different cars taking the same road,'' said Feller. ``Maybe one's
faster and one's slower, but they're both headed to the same
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowack, however, takes issue with that metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra Pacific is typical of the forest products industry, in
that they're resistant to the principles of the Forest Stewardship
Council,'' he said. ``The timber industry is still very powerful,
and they're certainly exerting their influence. On the other hand,
the more consumer and corporate demand there is for (certified
forestry) products, the more we get the industry's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowack said while there is no longer any danger of sustainable
forestry fading away, big questions remain about the actual
definition of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ECO09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``It comes down to whose standards will prevail,'' he said,
``those of the stewardship council or those of the timber industry.
One will ultimately become the gold standard, though we may
eventually see some kind of tiered system.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, said Woodbury, the biggest priority is getting more
certified wood into the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of progress has been made, but only about 5 percent of
the wood fiber on the market is from certified sources,'' she said.
``We have to keep our noses to the grindstone and get more tangible
certified products into the stores.''

 S.F.'S NBC INTERNET SLASHING STAFF BY 170  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ NBC Internet, the San Francisco online media
firm, said yesterday that it is cutting 170 jobs, nearly 20 percent
of its staff, in an effort to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs will affect workers in all departments, according to
Robert Silverman, a spokesman for NBC Internet, one of the Bay
Area's biggest Internet firms. A majority of the layoffs will be at
the company's San Francisco headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Internet's job reductions come amid workforce retrenchments
across the Internet industry. The company's cuts are among the
largest this year.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs follow a quarter in which NBC Internet warned that
it would report bigger-than-expected losses and suffered a dramatic
decline in its stock price, which is now nearly 90 percent off its
high at the beginning of the year. In June, the company implemented
a hiring freeze instead of continuing the rapid growth it had
forecast for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Internet's stock price was unchanged yesterday at $11. Its
shares are down nearly 90 percent from its January high of $106.13.
News of the layoffs came after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   The firings will reduce NBC Internet's workforce from 850 to 680
by the end of the year. An unknown number of other workers will be
reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC Internet is not a player yet,'' said David Card, an
analyst with Jupiter Communications, a market research firm. ``They
are not one of the big three portals and they haven't
differentiated themselves well.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, NBC Internet, which is 40 percent owned by General
Electric's NBC, was the ninth-most-popular Web property, according
to Media Metrix, the online ratings service. It trails far behind
competing Web portals such as Yahoo, Microsoft and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Card questioned NBC Internet's efforts to create a large catalog
of television programs for viewers to watch on their personal
computers. He said such programming, aimed at users who have
high-speed connections that allow better video quality, has a very
limited audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, NBC Internet has suffered an identity crisis with
its disparate Web sites, including Xoom.com, a Web page building
service, and Snap.com, an Internet portal. The company is trying to
address the confusion by combining those sites under the portal
NBCi.com. this fall.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of NBCI09 (109085 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  NBC Internet recently acquired Flyswat.com, an online links
service, GlobalBrain.net, a search service, and Allbusiness.com, a
portal for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, the NBC Internet spokesman, said the job cuts will
make the company more competitive while maintaining its health. He
said that the firm is healthy, with nearly $357 million in cash.

IN A WORD, THEY'D LOVE THIRD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Track and field athletes in this country feel
sorry for themselves because the top three finishers at the Olympic
selection meet qualify for the Summer Games and everybody else goes
home, no matter how fast they've run in the past or how far they've
thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but they're not going to get much sympathy from their
swimming brethren. The process by which the U.S. swimming team for
next month's Sydney Olympics will be chosen over the next eight
days is so cruel it makes track and field's look kind.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top two finishers in each individual event earn an
Olympic berth (swimmers lost a third Olympic entry in each event in
1984 when synchronized swimming was added to the aquatics program).
</P>
<P>
   The loneliest number? It's the number 3. Just ask former
Stanford star Jenny Thompson, who was pegged to win as many as
seven gold medals at the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the sprinter traveled to the Trials, came down
with insomnia and sleepwalked through the meet, finishing no higher
than third in any of her four individual events. She made it to
Atlanta but in a diminished role, as a member of three relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Olympic Trials, first and second are equal in my
mind,'' Thompson said earlier this week. ``If you're third, it's
just as good as last.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson put off retirement to make amends for 1996 and again
will contend for an Olympic berth in as many as four individual
events and three relays starting today at the Indiana
University-Purdue University Natatorium.
</P>
<P>
   She'll require 12 races to qualify in her four individual
events; for the first time in the history of the Trials, semifinal
heats have been added to all events shorter than 400 meters,
meaning a swimmer will need three strong swims spread out over two
days to qualify for the Olympics (before it was two races,
contested on the same day).
</P>
<P>
   Thompson will lead a women's sprint brigade _ call it the Space
Cowgirls _ that is challenging both the record books and age-old
assumptions. Thompson, Dara Torres, Amy Van Dyken and Angel Martino
have 120 years and 20 Olympic medals among them. They are at the
front line of an ongoing war waged to make swimming lucrative
enough to pursue as a career and not just a means of paying for
college.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, a graduate of the Westlake School, is swimming
faster than she ever has and so is the 27-year-old Thompson. Every
tie they race, they raise the ceiling on women's competitive
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wouldn't be swimming without a head-turning
performance by a precocious teen. In 1992 it was Anita Nall; in
1996, Irvine's Amanda Beard. This year the chlorine queen of the
teen set could be 14-year-old backstroker Diana MacManus or
16-year-old breaststroker Megan Quann.
</P>
<P>
   The leading man of these Trials is expected to be Lenny
Krayzelburg of Studio City and USC. Krayzelburg, 24, was a surprise
fifth-place finisher in the 200-meter backstroke at the 1996
Trials. Four years later he is the world-record holder in the 100
and 200 backstrokes and, hence, the overwhelming favorite in both
events.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg might not be an Olympic Trials winner yet, but he
already has his breakfast of champions picked out. Starting next
week his image will grace boxes of Kellogg's Crispix cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering in the wings is 17-year-old Aaron Peirsol of Irvine,
who would love to be a cereal killer. He might look to Tom Malchow
for some pointers; in 1996 Malchow shaved four seconds off his best
time in the 200-meter butterfly and won the Trials, displacing from
the Olympic team former world record holder Melvin Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 Kurt Krumpholz broke the world record in the 400
freestyle in the heats and then finished out of the top three in
the final and didn't make the Olympic team. So it's not just
posturing when Krayzelburg and Malchow, who broke the world record
in the 200 butterfly in June, profess to be on edge just like the
meet's other 1,307 participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meet's unpredictable,'' said Malchow, who graduated from
Michigan last year. ``That's the beauty of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also what makes this meet a beast.

 REGULATOR CALLS FOR STRICTER OVERSIGHT OF LONG-DISTANCE INDUSTRY  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's top utility regulator admitted
yesterday that her agency has done a poor job of reining in abuses
by long-distance telephone companies and vowed to beef up oversight
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need better rules because the rules we have don't work,''
said Loretta Lynch, who became president of the Public Utilities
Commission in March.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that the state agency doesn't do enough to identify
and follow up on patterns of abuse by long-distance carriers and
that current regulations have too many loopholes. She also said the
PUC doesn't do enough to resolve customer problems once they
contact the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a whole lot better because we are not doing very
well right now,'' Lynch said, responding to a Chronicle special
report on telecommunications troubles published yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that customer complaints against long-distance
telephone companies doubled from 1997 to 1999, based on an analysis
of 125,000 grievances filed with the PUC. The articles revealed how
long-distance companies take advantage of loopholes in the rules to
hide many fees.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal PUC survey, first reported by The
Chronicle yesterday, 4 out of 10 customers who filed a written
grievance with the agency said they were disappointed with how the
PUC handled the complaint. Critics say the PUC would have found
even more frustrated consumers had it also polled people who filed
complaints by telephone. Lynch said she was appalled to learn the
survey was so narrowly focused.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynch said changes in PUC enforcement are already in the
works. Fellow Commissioner Carl Wood has proposed a
telecommunications ``Bill of Rights,'' which would require
companies to clearly spell out all fees and requirements to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch added that she hopes to find a new consumer services chief
who can more aggressively enforce current rules. She said she
demoted William Schulte, the current chief, and his key deputy
partly because the agency is doing a subpar job of handling
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   PUC Commissioner Henry Duque said he is also concerned about the
complaint process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of room for improvement,'' Duque said. He said
he frequently hears from people who have filed complaints via
telephone ``and nothing has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Witteman, an attorney with the Greenlining Institute, a
San Francisco consumer watchdog group, said The Chronicle's stories
point out that the PUC isn't doing enough to crack down on
companies after spotting a pattern of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to have serious doubts about the commitment of the
PUC to consumer protection,'' Witteman said. ``Many, many
misleading advertisements and hidden charges go unchallenged.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers had mixed reaction to the stories.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Mountjoy, R-Monrovia, said he hears similar
complaints about all state agencies. Mountjoy says his staffers
spend much of their time helping constituents cut through red tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the same would hold true of any government
bureaucracy that tends to move rather slowly,'' said Mountjoy, vice
chair of the Senate committee on Energy, Utilities and
Communications. But if state lawmakers receives a flood of
complaints about the PUC, he said legislators ``will probably call
the PUC on the carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PUC09 (21106 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti, R-Rancho Cordova, vice chairman of
the state Assembly committee on Utilities and Commerce, said he
could empathize with consumers based on his own problems with
long-distance companies. One firm, Global Crossing, sent him a bill
even though he never signed up for the service.
</P>
<P>
   But Pescetti said he believes the PUC is already in the process
of adopting tougher rules through the Bill of Rights proposal. He
said he doesn't think the legislature should pass additional laws
unless the PUC asks for an ``assist.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles, chairman of the
Assembly utilities committee, also said he believes the PUC is on
the right track.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out, for instance, that the PUC and Attorney General
Bill Lockyer teamed up last month to sue WorldCom, the long
distance company that received the most complaints last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we need to change the laws, we can do so,'' Wright said.
``But it's too early right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright also noted that slamming, or switching customers' service
without permission, and cramming unauthorized charges onto
customers' bills are already illegal. The PUC, he said, is simply
trying to ``catch up'' with the surge of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, both the PUC and The Chronicle received an increase
in calls and e-mail from customers who had problems with their
telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Pearce in San Francisco said she was stunned to find a $31
charge for a three-minute collect call from Portland, Ore., though
she distinctly remembers refusing the call. ``That's $600 an
hour,'' she said. ``I have never heard of such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hector Flamenco of San Francisco said his bills soared because
of hidden fees after he signed up for service with NOS
Communications of Las Vegas. The Chronicle highlighted NOS in one
of its articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare,'' Flamenco said. ``I finally got rid of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   NOS did not return a call seeking comment. But WorldCom and AT&AMP;T
empathized they are working hard to reduce complaints.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom, which merged with MCI two years ago, said it now
requires sales representatives to sign a written code of conduct,
gives telemarketers financial incentives to avoid slamming or other
misconduct and randomly monitors calls. So far this year,
complaints to the PUC about the company are down 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story was very comprehensive in describing the current
situation,'' said WorldCom spokeswoman Leland Prince, ``but the
piece that was missing in our mind was all of the improvements we
are making.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Jane Young also pointed out that the company
recently ranked No. 1 in a recent JD Powers and Associates study on
high-volume customers, though it didn't score nearly as well among
customers who make fewer calls.
</P>

HISTORY SHOWS LIEBERMAN REALLY IS A FRIEND OF BILL'S 
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The gesture spoke volumes about Sen. Joseph
Lieberman's longtime friendship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One June afternoon in 1999, three months after the Senate voted
to acquit an impeached President Clinton, Ella Freilich,
Lieberman's mother-in-law, opened a formal-looking envelope at her
Bronx home.
</P>
<P>
   It was from the White House, an invitation to a state dinner in
honor of the president of Hungary, Arpad Goncz. To Freilich, a
Holocaust survivor from Hungary, the invitation, and the evening,
was not one she would soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that the president harbored no ill will
toward Lieberman for his sharp, public rebuke of Clinton and his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, the state dinner put it to rest,
friends, colleagues and former aides to Lieberman and Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inviting Senator Lieberman could have been a political act,''
said Michael Lewan, the Connecticut Democrat's former chief of
staff. ``Inviting the mother was a generous act.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout more than two decades, Lieberman and Clinton have
shared the kind of friendship that is unique to two people who meet
early in their careers, decide boldly to challenge the rules and
then actually succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In their case, the common goal was to corral a wayward
Democratic Party and bring it back to the political center,
something they both started working on in the 1980s as members and
then chairmen of the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   The two became particularly close when Clinton was chairman of
the council in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago there were only a few political leaders in
America who thought this transformation was possible, and Bill
Clinton, Joe Lieberman and Al Gore were in on it from the
beginning,'' said Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy adviser.
``And that forged a bond that is much larger than any issue of the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, called
Lieberman and Clinton ``political soulmates from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were partners in the reshaping of the Democratic Party,''
From said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman first met the president when he hired Clinton, a
24-year-old Yale law student, as a campaign aide during his run for
the Connecticut state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has said he plainly remembers the campaign aide.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, their paths crossed when Clinton, the governor of
Arkansas, and Lieberman, a recently elected U.S. senator, formed an
alliance with like-minded Democrats at the Democratic Leadership
Council. At times, the push to change the party was not an easy
one, but the effort helped forge long-lasting ties among the
members.
</P>
<P>
   From that period on, Lieberman and Clinton weathered their share
of turbulent moments; more often than not, Lieberman displayed the
sort of loyalty that Clinton did not forget.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Connecticut
primary, he did not blame Lieberman, and Lieberman continued to
campaign forcefully for him.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton was elected, Lieberman was sometimes invited to
munch popcorn and watch a movie at the White House. He often served
as a sounding board for the president on issues of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 1994 health care plan debacle, which cost
Democrats the House, Lieberman was one of the people Clinton
telephoned to discuss what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The speech Lieberman delivered on the Senate floor about the
president's scandal remains one of the senator's most painful
episodes, friends and aides say. But when he decided that Clinton's
behavior, while immoral, was not grounds for removal from office,
he worked behind the scenes to try to persuade Republicans to vote
for a censure proposal.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Clinton said Lieberman was right to criticize
him, and Clinton apologized for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the two talked on the telephone, and on Monday
Clinton called his old friend again, this time to congratulate him
for his place on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extraordinary, extraordinary human being as well as a
long time friend of mine,'' Clinton said after the announcement.

<P>
   MAKING UP FOR THE PAST
</P>
<P>
   In a step toward atoning for what many Democrats agree was one
of their party's biggest political blunders, the party has invited
the sons of the late Robert P. Casey to speak at next week's
convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, the former governor of Pennsylvania, had asked to speak
at the 1992 Democratic convention in New York and deliver a report
opposing the party's platform, which called ``reproductive choice''
a ``fundamental right.'' But the nominees _ Bill Clinton and Al
Gore _ wanted the convention to send a message of unity for
abortion rights, and Casey was barred from speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the approval of Gore, this year's nominee, the party
has invited two of Casey's sons _ Robert P. Casey Jr., who is
facing re-election as Pennsylvania's auditor general, and Patrick
Casey, a candidate for Congress from Scranton _ to participate in a
video tribute to their father at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   GORE WINS UAW BACKING
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers announced Tuesday that it would endorse
Vice President Al Gore for president, ending its feud with him over
trade and giving him a boost in Michigan and other industrial
Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Gore and the union president, Stephen
P. Yokich, who had flirted with Ralph Nader, the Green Party
candidate, had spoken in recent months in an effort to iron out
differences over trade and environmental issues. Among other
things, the union succeeded in adding language to the platform
saying that Gore would push for more fuel-efficient cars ``in a way
that preserves and creates jobs for American workers, and delivers
products that consumers want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore will travel to Michigan, which has 450,000 current and
retired U.A.W. members, on Friday to accept the endorsement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GOP FIRES BACK
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has begun running its first attack ad, a
30-second commercial accusing Vice President Al Gore of hypocrisy
on environmental issues. The spot claims that Gore has been
distorting Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record in Texas,
and, citing a recent biography, reports that Gore ``has allowed
mining companies to mine zinc from his property'' in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials are spending $3.7 million to run their new
spot in 17 states: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New
Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.

CLINTON VISITS WILDFIRE FRONT LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With WEST-FIRES) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURGDORF JUNCTION, Idaho _ From above, the scene resembled a war
zone: pillars of smoke, flashes of fire and vast expanses of
charred remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big plume of smoke over there,'' said President
Clinton, who surveyed the devastation of the Burgdorf Junction
fire, one of hundreds sweeping across the West, from his
helicopter, Marine One, yesterday morning. ``It looks like a bomb
going off.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited the front lines of the fire, which has raced
through 25,000 acres and become one of the largest blazes ravaging
the Western states, to rally firefighters engaged in what amounts
to a military-style operation. Their weapons are chain saws,
helicopters loaded with water buckets and pulaskis, the combination
ax and hoe used to dig containment trenches through the combustible
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get in the plane this morning and fly out
here to say thanks,'' said Clinton, who shared a bag lunch with the
firefighters in a mess hall in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the professional firefighters are 500 Army troops
from the Fourth Infantry Division at Fort Hood, who have traded in
their self-propelled howitzers for axes and are relying heavily on
their military training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as dangerous as it gets,'' said Lt. Col. Darryl A.
Williams, a former military aide to the president who now leads
soldiers here. ``No one is shooting at us, but the fire is a worthy
adversary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced the release of $150 million in emergency funds
to continue the fight. But the money will go quickly. The cost of
the firefighting effort is more than $10 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wilbanks of the United States Forest Service spent a recent
night on the front lines of the Burgdorf Junction fire, which was
started on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   After long days of digging ditches in the thin mountain air,
firefighters often camp within sight of the enemy. Wilbanks said
they rolled out their bedding on the rocky terrain and did
something that seems odd under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lit a little fire to stay warm,'' he said.

CISCO SALES RISE 61 PERCENT IN FOURTH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems Inc. on Tuesday reported a 61
percent gain in sales for its fiscal fourth quarter, as the company
continued to be the leading supplier of the necessary hardware for
the build-up of the Internet. It was the company's 10th consecutive
quarter of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding acquisition-related charges, Cisco earnings exceeded
analysts' published estimates by a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Cisco said its No. 2 executive, Donald J. Listwin,
was resigning to lead an unnamed company, in which Cisco is a
minority shareholder. Listwin, whose title was executive vice
president, is leaving after 10 years with the company, where he was
responsible for Cisco's New World business strategy and led its
service provider and consumer businesses as well as corporate
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco reported its results after the close of the market. Cisco
shares closed at $65.50, down 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended July 29, Cisco reported earnings of $796
million, or 11 cents a diluted share, up 32 percent compared with
$605 million, or 8 cents per share, for the period a year ago.
Sales rose 61 percent to $5.72 billion, compared with $3.56 billion
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco said its pro forma net income, which excludes the effects
of acquisition charges, payroll tax on stock option exercises and
net gains realized on minority investments, was $1.20 billion, or
16 cents a diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000,
compared with $710 million, or 10 cents per share, for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1999, increases of 69 percent and 60 percent,
respectively. Analysts had expected Cisco to earn 15 cents a share,
according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarter, as expected, looks very strong,'' said Greg
Geiling, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. Revenue growth of 61 percent
year over year, and 16 percent over the immediately previous
quarter, ``are tremendous numbers for a company this size,'' he
said. ``And it looks like very balanced growth across all the
business lines, which is just what you like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Cisco completed the acquisitions of
Atlantech Technologies Ltd., JetCell Inc., PentaCom Ltd., Qeyton
Systems and Seagull Semiconductor Ltd. for a combined purchase
price, including assumed liabilities, of approximately $1.39
billion, and took one-time charges of $461 million, or
approximately 6 cents per share, on an after-tax basis, as
write-offs of purchased in-process research and development.
Additionally, Cisco completed the acquisitions of ArrowPoint
Communications Inc., the InfoGear Technology Corp. and SightPath
Inc., which were accounted for as poolings of interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We predicted five years ago that we were in the midst of a
second Industrial Revolution that would determine the prosperity of
companies, countries, and individuals. Today, the Internet
continues to drive the strongest U.S. economy in history,'' John
Chambers, Cisco's president and chief executive, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no indications in the marketplace that the radical
Internet business transformation in practices like customer
service, supply-chain management, employee training, empowerment,
and e-commerce that is taking place around the world today is
slowing _ in fact, we believe it is accelerating globally,''
Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chambers also said that Cisco is experiencing some of the
problems that come with explosive growth. Particularly in new
product areas, the company has been constrained by shortages of key
components, and is taking steps to increase order volume with its
major suppliers. Lead times on its own products reached what
Chambers called ``an undesirable peak'' in June, but he added that
he expected improvements in manufacturing management to return
these times to normal by the end of the calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Cisco reported earnings of $2.67 billion or 36
cents a diluted share, compared with $2.02 billion, or 29 cents a
share for fiscal 1999. Sales rose 55 percent to $18.93 billion,
compared with $12.17 billion for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's pro forma net income was $3.91 billion, or 53 cents a
diluted share, for fiscal 2000, compared with pro forma net income
of $2.52 billion or 36 cents a share for fiscal 1999, increases of
56 percent and 47 percent, respectively.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir formally announced
his resignation Tuesday, relinquishing command of the largest
police department in the nation to work as a salaried consultant
for ChoicePoint Inc., a corporate investigations firm in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said his final day at 1 Police Plaza would be
Aug. 18, ending nearly four and a half years as one of the city's
most prominent officials.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, who has supervised the New York Police Department during
a period when crime declined markedly but relations between the
police and many minority residents seemed to sour, appeared with
his wife, Carol, in a ceremonial chamber in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that his legacy was apparent on the city's streets,
in what he described as the professionalism of police officers and
their success in rolling back crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have done for this city is not only evident in the
fact that we are not only the No. 1 tourist destination in the
United States, but also evident in every neighborhood _ whether
it's Brooklyn or Queens or Staten Island or the Bronx _ where crime
is the lowest it has been in three decades,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who leaves office in 16 months, would
not discuss whom he might select to replace Safir.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the City Hall ceremony for Safir was ending Tuesday,
other city officials and Safir's critics were calling news
conferences of their own, at which they offered a starkly different
interpretation of the commissioner's record.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone said Safir had lost his way
by focusing too much on the statistical measures of police
productivity instead of on the impact some of his policies had in
the city's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an overemphasis on statistics,'' Vallone said. ``The
next commissioner should be concerned about numbers and about
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton said Safir's legacy was one of tolerating
violent officers and encouraging aggressive tactics, a combination
that sometimes ended in tragedy, as in the station house torture of
Abner Louima and the deaths of four unarmed black men _ the most
highly publicized being Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond _ who
were fatally shot by the police during one 13-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presided over some of the worst, most graphic police
brutality cases in memory,'' Sharpton said. ``His leaving will not
cause any regret at all in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with past form, Safir seemed unfazed by his critics,
and even eager to dismiss them. As he left City Hall, where aides
of Mark Green, the public advocate, were distributing fliers
announcing a news conference at which Green later criticized him,
Safir was asked for his feelings. He said, ``Mark Green is a joke,
he has always been a joke, and he continues to be a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir, 58, announced in May that he was suffering from prostate
cancer. But he said Tuesday that his illness was treatable and that
his health had no bearing on his decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ChoicePoint, a publicly traded corporation with 4,000 employees
in 22 cities, provides various forms of intelligence to government
and corporate clients, including results of employees' drug tests
and background screening of potential vendors. It is one of the
country's largest pre-employment screeners, with gross revenues of
$430 million last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In the days before Gov. George W. Bush
announced his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate, Vice
President Al Gore and his advisers sensed an unexpected
opportunity. Aboard Air Force II and in Gore's campaign
headquarters here, there was a consensus that Bush and his aides
had bungled their selection process, that the Republicans had come
across as leak-prone, rushed and uncharacteristically amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign swiftly set out to exploit this perceived
weakness by trying to turn the running mate selection process
itself into a political weapon. With lock-step discipline, Gore's
spokesmen derided Bush for conducting his search ``like a
fraternity rush.'' They presented Gore's selection process as
dignified, orderly, pander-free and, above all else, private.
</P>
<P>
   But the strict secrecy imposed by the Gore campaign shielded
from public view an intensely political, highly competitive and
sometimes frenetic selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Gore's selection process was shaped by gritty
political concerns that had little bearing on what he had
repeatedly described as his single most important criterion for a
running mate _ someone possessed of the experience and ability to
assume the presidency if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, for example,
never made it to the short list, at least in part because of his
work as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, people involved in the
selection process said. Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana faced opposition
from groups that support abortion rights and gave his assent to a
campaign aimed at countering criticism over his voting record on
abortion, but faded nonetheless. Sen. Bob Graham of Florida was
hurt by his habit of filling diaries with mundane aspects of his
day, a practice some in the Gore campaign worried would be viewed
as eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Democratic officials said, Bush's repeated
efforts to tarnish Gore with resurrected memories of President
Clinton's affair with a White House intern elevated the standing of
Gore's eventual choice, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the first Democrat
to condemn Clinton's affair from the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The enforced secrecy _ potential running mates were warned not
to divulge details about their contacts with the Gore vetting teams
_ also served to obscure lobbying efforts by a select group of
well-connected political professionals. Several of Gore's campaign
consultants had also worked for those on his list of potential vice
presidents, and these men and women fought hard for their favored
picks. One adviser, Bob Shrum, has worked with several of the
potential candidates but argued for one of them, Sen. John Edwards
of North Carolina. Another adviser, Michael Whouley, argued for his
former boss, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership
Council and an influential voice among moderate Democrats, lobbied
both Gore and his campaign chairman, William Daley, on behalf of
Lieberman, who is the chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
   As with any presidential candidate, the choice of running mate
is an important and telling decision. Gore's aides argued that the
way he went about picking Lieberman illustrated several of the vice
president's strengths, most notably his meticulous, rigorous
preparation before arriving at major decisions. Gore, they said,
has raised vetting to new levels of thoroughness and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore announced in April that former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher would lead his selection team, Gore actually
began to organize his selection process months before. His vetting
teams were led by such veteran lawyers as Charles F.C. Ruff, the
former White House counsel who defended Clinton during his
impeachment trial. The team that vetted Lieberman, led by Jamie
Gorelick, a former deputy attorney general, went so far as to
review the more than 800 legal opinions that Lieberman rendered
when he was attorney general of Connecticut from 1983 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Cohen, a former IRS commissioner, was drafted to review
tax returns. Gore also instructed Christopher to consult freely and
frequently with an informal group that consisted of Labor Secretary
Alexis M. Herman, former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, Sen. Jay
Rockefeller of West Virginia and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained added respect for his values and judgment,''
Christopher said when asked in an interview what he had learned
about Gore during the search process. ``I found he went about the
process seriously and conscientiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans drew different lessons from Gore's method of picking
a running mate. While praising Lieberman as a man of integrity,
they said that Gore's selection process underscored what they
described as his penchant for tactical ruthlessness and a tendency
to shade the truth for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, dismissed the notion that
the Gore decision-making process was more orderly and dignified
than Bush's process. He said that much of what Gore did, including
his mention of a ``wild card'' candidate, was theater designed for
public consumption. He said that the important difference between
the two campaigns was that the Bush campaign had greeted the choice
of Lieberman graciously, while the Gore campaign had attacked
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're missing the whole big picture on where the public is
about attacking everything,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic lawyer who has guided potential running mates
through both Gore's vetting routine and Clinton's in 1992
complained that this year's process was at times ``delayed and
disorganized.'' Just five days before his self-imposed deadline,
Gore said that he had narrowed his list to six. Yet one finalist,
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, had not been
vetted _ a task that had taken lawyers weeks of painstaking work
for other finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the sophistication of Gore's selection stagecraft that
even leaks were orchestrated for maximum effect. Eager to win over
women, Gore had emphasized that several women were under strong
consideration. Last week, as interest was peaking over Gore's
progress, his campaign let it be known that one of his finalists
was Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, even though she had
already said she would turn down the job, and even though one
person involved in Gore's screening process said that she had not
been under serious consideration for some time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, before a single primary or caucus had been contested,
Gore had already started thinking about running mates. By October
his campaign chairman at the time, Tony Coelho, had contacted
Christopher and asked him to start thinking about how to organize a
search.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, 74, was a logical choice. A man who exudes tact and
discretion, Christopher had led Clinton's search in 1992, and
Clinton's selection of Gore was widely regarded as a turning point
in the campaign. But Christopher was well aware of the perils of
the selection process. A hasty vetting job in 1984 left Walter
Mondale's campaign bogged down for weeks with questions about the
finances of his running mate, Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who tries to do this has to read the history and see
the mistakes that were made and try to avoid them,'' Christopher
said. Those lessons, aides said, were central to one of Gore's
primary search objectives _ finding a running mate who could get
off to a fast, clean start, unlike Cheney, for example, who spent
his first week defending his conservative voting record in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in February, Christopher and Gore began to construct
what Christopher came to call his ``People to Consult List,'' a
roster of senior Democrats that ultimately would grow to 70 names.
The list included nearly a dozen women, 18 members of minority
groups and representatives of several special interest groups. Most
were on the list simply because Gore wanted their advice. But 25 of
the names, including Lieberman's, were considered as potential
running mates.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coelho, the Gore campaign made an overture to Colin
Powell, just as the Clinton campaign had done in 1992. ``He was
indirectly approached to see if he would ever consider a
vice-presidential spot on any ticket,'' he said. But the general
rebuffed the overture and the matter was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore's spokesmen insisted that there was no long list,
no short list, no list at all, Christopher embarked on a series of
interviews to help Gore pare down their list. As a first step, a
team of young Washington lawyers prepared memorandums on the public
careers of the 25 possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher visited Lieberman in his Senate office on May 1. In
an interview the next month, Lieberman described his session as
``an out-of-body experience'' for a politician who had once been
too embarrassed to openly admit his ambition to be a senator. That
day, as he faced his old friend _ he calls him Chris _ Lieberman
found himself suddenly confronting the dizzying possibility of
occupying the nation's second highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chris came here it was the first moment it had any
reality to it,'' he said. ``Somebody said to me: `This is like the
ministry. You're called to the ministry, you don't seek it.'''
</P>
<P>
   By early June, as word of Christopher sightings spread across
Capitol Hill, and as one politician after another coyly confirmed
that yes, they had in fact spoken with him, the speculation was
such that no fewer than 30 Democrats had been named in various news
media reports as under active consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But by that point, Gore had already settled on about a
half-dozen names. He told Christopher to go ahead with full vetting
on this group, which included Lieberman, Shaheen, Edwards,
Gephardt, Bayh and Kerry, Democratic officials said. But even
before the vetting was in full swing, there were indications that
Lieberman was the leader of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, the day Daley replaced Coelho as campaign chairman,
his first substantial conversation with Gore quickly turned to the
question of running mates. ``He said, `Joe is really close, he's
really great, what do you think?''' Daley recalled. ``Then he went
into the other candidates, but he was the first one he named.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign set about assembling five to seven vetting
teams, each led by a senior lawyer working with a more junior
lawyer. Other lawyers were added as needed to the teams, all of
which reported to James Hamilton, a lawyer with long experience
examining the lives of troubled Washington figures.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has represented Vince Foster, the deputy White House
counsel who later committed suicide; Dennis DiConcini, the former
senator from Arizona implicated in the Keating Five scandal; and
David Durenberger, the former Minnesota senator who also faced an
ethics inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher gives him perhaps his highest form of praise: ``He
is very discreet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vetters, who like Christopher worked as unpaid volunteers,
gathered boxes of records from each of the finalists _ every vote
ever cast, every press release ever issued, transcripts of
speeches, videotapes of political debates, books they have written,
school transcripts, a lifetime of financial and medical records.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five who made it to the vetting round were
eliminated on the basis of some shocking revelation that emerged
from the records that were handed over to the various vetting
teams. ``The vetting process produces pluses and minuses, but there
was no show stopper,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pluses and minuses mattered greatly, and the vetting
process itself, along with the rumor-mill speculation surrounding
it, produced some ugly moments of competition, rivalry and sheer
political spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One such instance came in recent weeks. Kerry, a popular and
seasoned politician, was attractive to Gore for many reasons, not
the least of which was that he is a decorated Vietnam war veteran.
But in recent weeks rumors raced through political circles in
Washington and beyond about Kerry's dating habits when he was
divorced years ago. It was a troubling development that took on
added significance given the emphasis at the Republican National
Convention on restoring ``honor and decency'' to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign aides said the rumors had no bearing on the
selection, but on Monday, Kerry told The Boston Globe that Gore's
vetters inquired about that time of his life. ``They asked a couple
of questions from the period when I was single, and I gave them an
explanation,'' he said. ``Three-quarters of the stories that were
written when I was single were not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher's queries to special interest groups turned up a
problem for Bayh on one of the touchstone issues of the Democratic
Party _ abortion rights. In early May, Christopher left a telephone
message for Alice Germond, the acting president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, a group that
closely monitors voting records on abortion issues. When Germond
saw the message, she immediately recognized the purpose of his call
and assembled the abortion voting records of potential running
mates.
</P>
<P>
   When she came to Bayh, she expressed concern about his vote to
ban a late-term abortion procedure that opponents call ``partial
birth abortion.'' Worse yet for Bayh, she and an official from the
National Organization of Women were quoted in a Baltimore Sun
article that suggested that Bayh's ``problematic'' stance on
abortion might make it difficult to mobilize votes from women who
support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Germond said that her only intent was to
provide unbiased information about the abortion records of every
potential running mate. Even so, Bayh's supporters were furious at
the abortion league and NOW.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed they were trying to push Feinstein,'' said Ann
DeLaney, Bayh's former campaign manager, referring to Sen. Dianne
Feinstein of California, one of the women who was mentioned as a
possible vice presidential candidate. ``I was outraged,'' DeLaney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Sun story appeared, DeLaney expressed her
anger to Bayh as they went jogging one evening. She said she
discussed her desire to write a letter accusing NARAL and NOW of
distorting what she described as his firm record in favor of
abortion rights. He did not discourage her, she said. Sure enough,
her letter soon appeared in news stories that described how Indiana
women were rallying in defense of Bayh's record on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bayh soon found his chances being downgraded in
stories quoting Democratic officials. Meanwhile, Edwards'
background as a trial lawyer who had won millions for consumers
injured by corporate negligence made him an easy fit for Gore's
populist message about taking on major oil and drug companies. And
every time Gore and his spokesmen described Cheney as part of the
Republican ``old guard,'' Edwards' stock appeared to inch higher.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Gore's screening machinery turned up a steady
drumbeat of concern about his relative lack of political experience
as a first-term senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were questions that were asked during the process,''
Edwards readily acknowledged on Monday. ``They're perfectly
reasonable questions.'' The questions only grew louder with the
selection of Cheney, a man with decades of experience at the
highest levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   On Air Force II on July 24, the day before Bush announced his
selection of Cheney, Gore told reporters that Bush's pick probably
would not have an impact on his selection. But behind the scenes,
advisers believed that Cheney's experience had to be accounted for,
and that dynamic favored Lieberman, 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the gravitas level, he matches up,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lieberman advocates such as From were making
the argument to the highest levels of the campaign that with
Lieberman's ``seal of approval,'' it would be difficult for Bush to
continue to tar Gore with the president's personal scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the thoroughness of the Gore screening process, his
vetters never did fully explore the possible impact of the largest
question mark over Lieberman _ how voters would react to an
Orthodox Jew on a national ticket. A number of people on
Christopher's consultation list had repeatedly raised Lieberman's
religion as a possible problem. But Gore, who has been criticized
by Republicans for being excessively guided by polls, issued orders
that no steps were to be taken to gauge public reaction to
Lieberman's religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore said, 'That's not part of me. That's not part of my
thinking. I exclude that,''' Christopher recalled.
</P>
<P>
   What they did, do, though, was explore dozens of hypothetical
situations to test how Lieberman would respond to potential
conflicts between his observance of the Sabbath and the duties of a
vice president, said Gorelick, who vetted Leiberman, said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had definitely thought through them in the context of the
public life he has led to date,'' she said. ``He has had to vote on
the Sabbath, go to critical meetings on the Sabbath, has had to be
away from home on the Sabbath and he has thought through those
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   By late July, Gore had conducted one-on-one interviews with all
of his finalists except Gephardt. There were no moments akin to
1992, when Clinton interviewed Gore well into the early morning.
Lieberman's interview, conducted at Gore's residence at the Naval
Observatory, lasted about an hour, the same amount of time Gore
spent with the others.
</P>
<P>
   But it clearly went well.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, the labor secretary, spoke with Gore after the interview
with Lieberman. She described Gore's response more as one of
affirmation rather than revelation. ``You had this sense of, `Boy,
was I right about this guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's decisive meetings in the vice president's
10th floor suite at the Loews Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel in Nashville,
aides got a definite sense that Gore had just about settled on
Lieberman but wanted one more ``gut check'' before making the
decision final. His questions were more pointed than probing, as if
he were attempting to test his political and personal judgments
against the range of opinions in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before Gore told aides of his decision, he called his
oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, who was in her apartment in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes on a personal instinct for this sort of thing,'' she
said. ``And I always knew he would.''

ETHEL BROWN FITZGERALD, 68, EDUCATOR AND SCHOOLS EXAMINER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethel Brown Fitzgerald, a former New York City teacher and
school administrator, lawyer and musician, died July 19 at a
hospital in Amsterdam, N.Y. She was 68 and lived in Fonda, N.Y.,
and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald spent 16 often contentious years on the city Board of
Education's semiautonomous Board of Examiners, from 1974 until the
state Legislature restructured it out of existence in 1990. She
served variously as a member, vice chairwoman and chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   The examiners tested prospective teachers and supervisors and
drew up lists from which the school board appointed job candidates.
Their critics charged the panel had become a cumbersome anachronism
and a bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
   In Fitzgerald's view, the chancellor and school board were
trying to circumvent the merit system. Indeed, she asserted, they
flirted with the very Tammany Hall-style patronage system that led
to the creation of the independent examiners in the first place, in
1898.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Fitzgerald was a 1954 music graduate of
Hunter College and taught orchestral and choral music in the public
schools until 1967. As Ethel Brown, a member of the musicians'
union, she played the cello with professional symphony orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   By 1968 she had completed her graduate work at Brooklyn College,
Columbia University and New York University. She received the
certificate of an education supervisor and administrator from
Hunter, and, in 1981, she received a doctor of laws degree from
Brooklyn Law School.
</P>
<P>
   She held a number of positions as assistant principal, principal
and teachers' trainer before being appointed to the Board of
Examiners, then practically a lifetime job. In recent years she had
been in private law practice in Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald is survived by a son, Dr. Kim Fitzgerald of
Cleveland; her mother, Effie Hargett Brown of Fonda; and six
grandchildren.

 MARY MacLEOD TRUMP, 88, PHILANTHROPIST  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary MacLeod Trump, a philanthropist who supported
charities near her home in Queens, and elsewhere, died Aug. 7 at 88
at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump was born Mary MacLeod on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland on
May 10, 1912. On a visit to New York City in the 1930s, she met
Fred C. Trump. They married in 1936 and settled in the Jamaica
Estates section of Queens, and Fred Trump went on to become one of
the city's biggest developers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Trump was the mainstay of the Women's Auxiliary of Jamaica
Hospital and of the Jamaica Day Nursery. The Trumps were also
active in the Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America and the
Lighthouse for the Blind, among others. A pavilion at Jamaica
Hospital Medical Center bears their name. They also gave buildings
to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/New Jersey and to
Community Mainstreaming Associates of Great Neck, N.Y., which
provides homes for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Fred C. Trump died last year. Mary Trump is survived by four
children: Donald, the developer and casino operator; Robert, the
president of his father's property management company; Maryanne, a
federal judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals; Elizabeth, an
executive with Chase Manhattan Bank; eight grandchildren; and four
great-grandchildren.

THE SHOT HEARD ROUND THE LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The old pro may never do anything as spectacular in
the rest of her career, but Teresa Weatherspoon will always have
The Shot.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a dunk, not a drive of brute force, but a desperate
running heave from midcourt that would bank in, yes, off the glass
to prolong the finals for another game.
</P>
<P>
   It reverberates a year later, showing up on every highlight and
advertisement for the Women's National Basketball Association:
</P>
<P>
   Flutie throwing the Hail Mary. Mr. October hitting his third of
the night. Jordan, flapping his tongue, faking somebody out of the
building. The big-game signature for an entire sport.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Weatherspoon, now 34, took another shot to her
fragile nose Tuesday night while making seven assists and six
steals as the Liberty beat Cleveland, 57-44, to capture the
home-court advantage for the first two rounds of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spoon is our most valuable player,'' reiterated the steady Sue
Wicks after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon did her best to ratchet up the energy for the
18,663 fans. The ambience in Madison Square Garden is still sweet
and spontaneous for this evolving league _ attracting female fans,
family types, new faces. There was a woman with a bandanna over her
shaven head, and a tattoo, and assorted necklaces, in Woody Allen's
seat. The league is settling in for a long run with these
enthusiastic players who sign autographs and acknowledge their
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might just be the woman way,'' Weatherspoon said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m. she was as gentle as an alto in the church choir, but
she promised she would not look that way an hour later, after her
own version of meditation. Weatherspoon's feisty game face is
hardly the female version of the grim glare Bernard King used to
screw on in the Lincoln Tunnel before arriving at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go into my own little world,'' she said. ``We're not just
basketball players, we're entertainers. The high-fives, the facial
looks, they're part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon has been around. After leaving the basketball
bastion of Louisiana Tech, she played seven years in Como and then
Busto Arsizio outside Milan, Italy, loving the intensity.
</P>
<P>
   She played for the United States in Seoul in 1988, helping to
win a gold medal, and she played in Barcelona in 1992, losing in
the semifinals to the last remnants of the Soviet Union and saying
later, ``This will leave a scar for the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Able to come home in 1997, Weatherspoon has seen the league
jump-start with unimagined average attendances of 9,669 the first
year, 10,869 the second, 10,207 the third, and down to 8,988 this
year, hurt in part by the early start because of the impending
Summer Games in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Weatherspoon knew the worst and the best of feelings.
Before the season, she learned that her 19-year-old nephew, Anthony
Weatherspoon, had died in a crash. She was very close to him,
giving him advice that children resist from their own parents.
After he was gone, whenever she did something special, she would
point a forefinger to the rafters: that one was for Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Her best moment came in Houston during the quickie
two-of-three-game finals. Having lost the opener, the Liberty was
in danger of going out with 2.4 seconds left when Weatherspoon took
a pass, made two dribbles and heaved the ball with .4 seconds
remaining. (They worked on it every day at the end of practice, she
said later.) The ball slammed off the backboard and through the net
and Weatherspoon remembered to raise her forefinger. For Anthony.
Then she swooned to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day I'd like to be sitting next to Jerry West and talk
about it,'' Weatherspoon said Tuesday night, referring to West's
classic 60-foot shot that tied the third game of the 1970 finals
against the Knicks, although the Knicks went on to win that game.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty lost the third and deciding game but The Shot
endures _ as marketable as any player the league has developed,
even the 12 stars going to the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave it a thought,'' Weatherspoon said of Australia.
``I've had my day. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a Liberty now. She broke her nose last week but will not
be hindered by a mask, or even thinking about the dangers of diving
for a loose ball. Weatherspoon is one of the very few players who
have stuck it out with the same team, four years into this
fledgling league.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, this league will long outlast her, and The Shot
will live on.

 &HT;    U.S. DRUG CZAR SEES 'POSITIVE' TRANSITION OF POWER AMONG MEXICAN
JUSTICE OFFICIALS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Before heading to drug-plagued Colombia, U.S. drug
czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey stopped in Mexico Monday and Tuesday and
praised what appears to be an open transition of power here after
71 years of one-party presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty positive atmosphere,'' McCaffrey told U.S.
correspondents here, after meeting with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, justice officials and members of Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who frequently has visited Mexico as the White
House's director of National Drug Control Policy, said Fox's
representatives participated in meetings between U.S. and Mexican
officials Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fox defeated Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI, and will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the PRI was shocked by its defeat, but I sensed an
enormous goodwill and respect for Mr. Fox,'' McCaffrey said.
``There is a completely open transition process going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to clean up corruption in Mexico, a country that
is the transit point for up to 60 percent of the South American
cocaine sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick politician has suggested that he will dramatically
revamp Mexican police agencies and the Attorney General's office
here. Because one party has controlled Mexico's presidency for
seven decades, speculation is rampant over how smoothly this can be
accomplished and how organized crime groups will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition team we've been exposed to is pragmatic and
looking for creative new solutions,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are determined to go down in history as Mexican
patriots,'' he added. ``I cannot believe they will do anything that
doesn't make sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will reportedly review the role of the Mexican military in
the future and whether troops should be used for police work.
Currently, the Mexican military is involved in eradication of
drugs, interdiction, and intelligence and law enforcement work.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey praised the record of Mexico's Navy, which has been
working effectively with United States officials over the last year
to detect and seize drug shipments off the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to comment on whether Mexico should continue to
use the military in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive of one thing. The United States should not have a
hand in any way in shaping how . . . foreign nations in the
hemisphere organize themselves internally to confront these
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did say, however, that Mexican and U.S. officials will
recommend that Fox and whoever wins the U.S. presidency in November
should try to preserve the agreements for cooperation on drugs that
have been established under Zedillo and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already said he would like the United States to get rid
of the current annual ``certification'' of countries, in which
Congress judges countries for their drug-fighting records. Mexico
has repeatedly come under attack for corruption and other failures.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has long agreed with Fox's proposal, but doesn't
believe Congress is willing to scrap certification.
</P>
<P>
   He said nations in this hemisphere would discuss an alternative
system for grading each other on the drug war when they meet for
the Summit of the Americas in April 2001 in Quebec.
</P>

 &HT;    U.S. DRUG CZAR SEES 'POSITIVE' TRANSITION OF POWER AMONG MEXICAN
JUSTICE OFFICIALS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Before heading to drug-plagued Colombia, U.S. drug
czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey stopped in Mexico Monday and Tuesday and
praised what appears to be an open transition of power here after
71 years of one-party presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty positive atmosphere,'' McCaffrey told U.S.
correspondents here, after meeting with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, justice officials and members of Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who frequently has visited Mexico as the White
House's director of National Drug Control Policy, said Fox's
representatives participated in meetings between U.S. and Mexican
officials Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fox defeated Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI, and will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the PRI was shocked by its defeat, but I sensed an
enormous goodwill and respect for Mr. Fox,'' McCaffrey said.
``There is a completely open transition process going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to clean up corruption in Mexico, a country that
is the transit point for up to 60 percent of the South American
cocaine sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick politician has suggested that he will dramatically
revamp Mexican police agencies and the Attorney General's office
here. Because one party has controlled Mexico's presidency for
seven decades, speculation is rampant over how smoothly this can be
accomplished and how organized crime groups will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition team we've been exposed to is pragmatic and
looking for creative new solutions,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are determined to go down in history as Mexican
patriots,'' he added. ``I cannot believe they will do anything that
doesn't make sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will reportedly review the role of the Mexican military in
the future and whether troops should be used for police work.
Currently, the Mexican military is involved in eradication of
drugs, interdiction, and intelligence and law enforcement work.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey praised the record of Mexico's Navy, which has been
working effectively with United States officials over the last year
to detect and seize drug shipments off the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to comment on whether Mexico should continue to
use the military in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive of one thing. The United States should not have a
hand in any way in shaping how . . . foreign nations in the
hemisphere organize themselves internally to confront these
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did say, however, that Mexican and U.S. officials will
recommend that Fox and whoever wins the U.S. presidency in November
should try to preserve the agreements for cooperation on drugs that
have been established under Zedillo and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already said he would like the United States to get rid
of the current annual ``certification'' of countries, in which
Congress judges countries for their drug-fighting records. Mexico
has repeatedly come under attack for corruption and other failures.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has long agreed with Fox's proposal, but doesn't
believe Congress is willing to scrap certification.
</P>
<P>
   He said nations in this hemisphere would discuss an alternative
system for grading each other on the drug war when they meet for
the Summit of the Americas in April 2001 in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey meets in Miami Wednesday with officials from the U.S.
Army's Southern Command, before heading to Cartegena, Colombia to
talk about the U.S.'s $1.3 billion anti-drug aid package to
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will visit Colombia on Aug. 30 to show
support. Colombia is a cocaine-producing country overwhelmed by
violent traffickers and rebels that control about 40 percent of the
nation's territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is in a risky position,'' he said. ``We're committed
to standing with them. Hopefully the region will also, along with
the Europeans and the Japanese. He (President Andres Pastrana) has
to solve several problems at the same time: an economy in the
dumps; a peace process that's going nowhere; and a drug production
problem that's skyrocketing.''

PEROT LOYALISTS VOTE TO DISQUALIFY BUCHANAN 
 

</HEADLINE>
 PARTY-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Reform Party officials loyal to party
founder Ross Perot muscled their way out of a Long Beach meeting
room, then reconvened nearby and voted to disqualify Pat Buchanan
as a candidate for the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Buchanan backers appeared to lock up control of
the Reform Party and clear the way for nominating him later this
week as their standard-bearer in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot loyalists, out-maneuvered by Buchanan-backers at a
fractious closed-door meeting of the Reform Party national
committee, forced their way past security guards who had been
ordered to block the exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is idiotic,'' said Paul Truax, a Dallas businessman and
Texas Reform Party founder who was among the dozens who shoved and
bellowed their way out of the Buchanan meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won,'' Bay Buchanan, Pat's sister and campaign manager
declared, saying the walkout signaled that efforts had failed to
block Perot supporters from taking over the party. ``It's over
now.``
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan dismissed the Perot loyalists' decision to
disqualify her brother's candidacy. ``This is basically a sad and
pathetic group of individuals who have lost and are unwilling to
give up power,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach police were summoned by several Perot loyalists who
claimed they were assaulted as they tried to leave the meeting
room.
</P>
<P>
   James Bourassa of Scottsdale, Ariz., who had red marks on his
neck, told police he was grabbed from behind during the melee.
``They were trying to lock the doors and didn't want us to leave,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The session the loyalists abandoned was chaired by Gerry Moan,
interim party chairman and Buchanan ally who controls the party's
finances. He dismissed the Perot-faction's chances of convincing
anyone their convention is legitimate. ``Yay for them,'' Moan said.
``It's not gonna be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is control of the party and the $12.6 million in
federal campaign funds the party nominee can use in the fall
presidential race. The money, which must be awarded by the Federal
Election Commission, was earmarked for the Reform Party after
Perot, the Dallas billionaire, received almost 9 percent of the
popular vote in his 1996 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Since his defeat, Perot has had little to do with the
organization. Earlier this year he turned away supporters who saw
him as their only chance to keep the Reform Party out of the hands
of Buchanan, who quit the Republican Party last year after failing
in his third try for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Buchanan would use the Reform Party to push his
social conservative agenda, party officials mounted an 11th hour
effort to block his nomination, then recruited John Hagelin as an
alternative candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin is a founder of the Natural Law Party and physics
professor at Maharishi University of Management in Iowa. Hagelin
will appear on the general election ballot in some states as the
Natural Law Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime today, Perot loyalists _ led by former Reform Party
chairman Russ Verney and Truax _ were to announce a lawsuit seeking
to block Buchanan from gaining access to the federal campaign
money.
</P>
<P>
   After Verney, Truax and their allies left the Buchanan-dominated
meeting, a vote was taken by the conservative commentator's
supporters to reject a recommendation from the party's executive
committee that he should be disqualified from the party primary.
</P>
<P>
   The primary, which is being conducted by mail-in ballots and
email, began July 5 and ends today. A two-thirds vote by the
convention would be required to overturn the primary results. &QL;

COWBOYS' ELLIS PARTICIPATES IN FIRST DRILLS SINCE BREAKING LEG LAST
SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys defensive end Greg Ellis
practiced yesterday for the first time since suffering a
career-threatening leg fracture roughly eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who broke the tibia and fibula in his left leg against
the Philadelphia Eagles on Dec. 12 and underwent surgery to have a
titanium rod inserted in his leg that night, stopped short of
promising to be in the lineup when the Cowboys open the season
against the Eagles on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the opener is his goal and yesterday's return
was the first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it doesn't mean I will be there for opening day,'' Ellis
said. ``I don't know how the leg will react to a live shot or
somebody kicking it. I think it will be fine. The trainers think
it's going to be fine. There are no guarantees. This is the first
step toward finding out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who has spent much of training camp working out with
Cowboys conditioning coaches, didn't practice as well as he would
like. However, he said he was thrilled to be practicing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to be out there,'' Ellis said. ``It felt like
more than a regular practice to me. It was tough not being out
there with my teammates. Now I'm back. That was a big step, and
it's rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Though cautious, Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer was
equally pleased. He said Ellis' presence is crucial to the
defense's success. Ellis led the team last year with 7 1/2 sacks,
despite missing the final three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot will be determined by how he feels tomorrow and the next
day,'' Zimmer said. ``But he's a heck of football player. We need
him.'' Roster moves While the Cowboys welcomed two newly signed
players, tight end Rickey Brady and safety Hurley Tarver, to
training camp yesterday, they said good bye to three others.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Chrys Chukwuma, linebacker Bernard Russ and tight
end Brian Roche were released by the team.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo said the impressive play of rookie
linebackers Orantes Grant and Corey Atkins made Russ expendable.
Roche was deemed too one-dimensional. The Cowboys have a
pass-catching tight end in Jackie Harris but need someone who can
block. Roche was not physical enough.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the Cowboys hope Brady can give them what they want.
However, they also plan on using a backup offensive lineman as a
blocking tight end. The Cowboys have three open roster spots but
are in no rush to fill them. The Cowboys will scan the waiver wire
to see who best fits their needs. Justin's job in jeopardy
Third-string quarterback Paul Justin's penchant for turnovers has
put his job on notice, Dave Campo said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Justin was already a long shot the make the roster because of
his $500,000 salary. His six turnovers in two preseason games have
put him in a deeper hole with the Cowboys, who have stopped making
excuses for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be concerned about him,'' Campo said. ``If he was
pressing before, he's got to press again. He's got to make some
plays.'' Garmon still impressing Dave Campo said that former Haltom
High School standout Kelvin Garmon has been the biggest surprise in
camp. Garmon, who has started at left guard in Larry Allen's
absence the past two games, will get a look at right guard now that
Allen has returned.
</P>
<P>
   Campo wouldn't go so far as to say that Garmon will compete with
Jorge Diaz for the starting spot. However, the Cowboys have been so
impressed with Garmon that they have switched Tony Hutson, who was
supposed to battle Diaz for the starting guard spot, to tackle.
Briefly Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith left practice yesterday
with a strained right calf. It is not believed to be serious, but
expect Smith to be miss his third consecutive preseason game Sunday
against the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith missed practice yesterday for personal
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round pick Dwayne Goodrich, off to a disappointingly slow
start, will be set back even further after suffering a strained
hamstring.

EX-BUCKEYE'S BIG HIT GETS NOTICE OF COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Michael Wiley remains humble and modest
in spite of being something of a movie star this week.
</P>
<P>
   He earned the respect of his peers and his coaches with a
knock-down block on an Atlanta Falcons linebacker Saturday night at
the Tokyo Dome, a hit heard literally 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy crumbled,'' Cowboys running back coach Clarence
Shelmon said. ``Everyone in the \Roffensive\S meeting started
hollering, `Ooh! Wow!' Believe me, players in this league ``know''
a good hit when they see one.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta linebacker Chris Draft _ two inches taller and 20 pounds
heavier than the 5-foot-11, 189-pound Wiley _ blitzed on a pass
play and tried to bull-rush the former Ohio State running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RWiley\S looked like Emmitt Smith, circa 1992 ... I mean, he
stoned the guy,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said. ``It was one of
the best licks of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley, a rookie fifth-round draft pick whose star keeps rising,
also has shown flashes of being an explosive kickoff return man,
something that he hadn't done full time since his sophomore year
with the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, hopefully, I can be the kickoff-return specialist
here,'' Wiley said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Emmitt \RSmith\S and Chris \RWarren\S here, I probably
won't see much playing time. I'm learning to be more patient as a
runner. ... The older guys tell me, `Don't race to the hole. Relax
a little bit and let everything happen for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Through two preseason games, Wiley leads all Cowboys rushers (59
yards on 15 carries) and all kickoff returners (seven for 25.0
yards per return). He also is the Cowboys' best pass protector at
his position not named Emmitt Smith, Shelmon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a small guy, Wiley is one of the toughest guys I've ever
been around,'' the assistant coach said. ``I saw it on videotapes
of Ohio State games, but you never know if it transfers until the
guy gets to this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley is in a three-way battle with two undrafted free agents,
Michael Black and Troy Hambrick, to make the team as the third
running back behind Smith, the NFL's leading active rusher, and
Warren, the incumbent third-down specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to choose between Black and Wiley right
now,'' Shelmon said. ``They both make defenders miss. They're
terrific blockers. They run pass routes real well. They both have
done extremely well on special teams. It would be really hard to
separate them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley and the 5-11, 206-pound Black, who spent the past two
seasons on Seattle's practice squad, have been joined by Hambrick,
who was moved from fullback to running back after Chrys Chukwuma
was waived yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwuma had one of the Cowboys' three fumbles Saturday night.
Turnovers and penalties are two areas for which Campo has close to
zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley also fumbled when he was stripped of the ball Saturday at
the end of a 49-yard kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned with that one ... that was a learning
experience,'' Campo said. ``Both \Rspecial teams coach\S Joe
Avezzano and I walked up to him after it happened _ not at the same
time _ and said the same thing: `They strip in this league,
Michael.'''
</P>
<P>
   They strip the ball in the Big Ten, too. Wiley can't _ and won't
_ use that as an excuse, saying instead, ``I think I just got
excited. I thought I was breaking into the clear with nobody around
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Black is the Cowboys' second-leading rusher with 32 yards on 10
carries. Warren (27 on seven carries) has scored the team's only
touchdown this preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrick, younger brother of Cowboys strongside linebacker
Darren Hambrick, has shown just enough promise at fullback to merit
a look at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been the blocker that you'd like to see at
\Rfullback\S ... and rightly so, because he hasn't played there
before,'' Shelmon said. ``But he has shown a lot of talent for a
big man \R6-1, 235\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Hambrick rushed for 1,189 yards and scored 18 touchdowns last
season at Division II Savannah (Ga.) State, and certainly would be
a strong candidate for the practice squad if he doesn't make the
53-man roster. nn

MARKET PLACE: AFTER ANDERSEN WAR, ACCOUNTANTS THINK HARD ABOUT
CONSULTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By REED ABELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the Andersens are finally splitsville, are accountants
going to forsake everything but the single life, limiting
themselves to poring over a company's books and offering tax
advice?
</P>
<P>
   Not if they can help it.
</P>
<P>
   A day after an arbitrator freed Andersen Consulting from Arthur
Andersen, the tax and auditing firm, attention shifted to some of
the other accounting and consulting marriages that are on the
rocks. Though the world's largest accounting firms are eager to
sell their existing consulting businesses for a variety of reasons,
they will probably continue to offer a wide array of services _
unless regulators place new limits on them.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, ``all the public accounting firms will be in
consulting,'' predicted Robert K. Elliott, the chairman of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and a partner
with KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting has fueled much of the firms' growth over the last
decade or so, said Jon McKenna, the executive editor of the Public
Accounting Report. ``It would be foolish to sell off a goose that
golden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The international arbitrator brought in to settle the bitter
Andersen dispute, which had dragged on for three years, essentially
gave Andersen Consulting its freedom for a paltry $1 billion,
although Arthur Andersen got the right to the Andersen name.
</P>
<P>
   But the other firms moving toward split-ups expect to get a lot
more than $1 billion given the high valuations on the consulting
businesses. Ernst &AMP; Young sold its consulting unit earlier this
year to Cap Gemini SA for some $11 billion, and KPMG plans to spin
off the bulk of its consulting operations in an initial public
offering that could raise nearly $3 billion. PricewaterhouseCoopers
is also considering divesting itself of its consulting unit by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Selling at least a part of the business to another company or
the public makes sense, according to Elliott. ``I think it's driven
by the economics,'' he said. Some firms are worried about the
retirement needs of their partners, while others simply want to put
the cash to other uses, offering stock to the partners or investing
more in the traditional accounting side of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   If money is why these firms are getting out, money may be the
reason these firms get back into consulting, even after they sell
off a large stake in their existing businesses. Arthur Andersen,
for example, started another consulting business even after it
decided to part ways with Andersen Consulting. ``There's a natural
desire to have consulting in one of these firms,'' said Kenneth A.
Merchant, the dean of accounting at the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   What might change is the type of consulting these firms do. They
may move away from management or information technology consulting
to other areas that are either in demand or somehow related to
their expertise in giving outsiders faith in the numbers and
representations that companies make. ``The challenge is what does
business assurance mean,'' said Rocco J. Maggiotto, the global
leader of markets and strategy for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some anxiety among these firms that the Securities
and Exchange Commission might eventually give them little choice in
the matter. Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC, has expressed
concern over the perception that auditor independence has been
hindered by consulting services offered by the same firm, a
perception strengthened when companies like Pinnacle Holdings and
its auditor come under investigation for questions of independence,
as happened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While accounting firms are already prohibited from offering some
of those services, the SEC is proposing to bar companies from using
the same firm to provide both internal and outside audits and using
a firm that provides information services consulting to them as
their auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Levitt does not prevail, or reaches a compromise that
allows many of the consulting services to still be offered, the
need to reassure investors and clients of their independence may
force firms to stay away from certain businesses. ``Whether Levitt
is there or not, they've opened the box up,'' said Tom Rodenhauser,
an analyst with Consulting Information Services, who expects the
relationship between accountants and consultants to fundamentally
change to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   After the firms rid themselves of their consulting units and
become smaller, there is also the possibility of further
consolidation, even as the firms once known as the Big Eight have
shrunk to the Big Five. Without the consulting unit, Arthur
Andersen has become a much smaller player, and Ernst and KPMG had
once expressed interest in combining.

MICHAEL MEYER, 79, IBSEN AND STRINDBERG TRANSLATOR AND SCHOLAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Meyer, whose translations of the plays of Ibsen and
Strindberg are performed throughout the English-speaking world and
who wrote monumental biographies of both Scandinavian playwrights,
died Aug. 3. He was 79 and lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was himself a playwright and teacher but found his primary
artistic calling as a conduit to Ibsen and Strindberg. Although in
a sense he was shadowed by them, he opened doors to their art for
generations of theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   He did not seem to feel that his work as a translator and a
biographer was a lesser occupation, but it was, in his mind, a kind
of self-annihilation. He said, ``The most difficult thing, if the
translator is a writer himself, is to keep himself out of it, to
resist leaving his thumbprint.'' He applied a similar principle to
the writing of biography. His objective was to be complete but
``never upstage the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In his pantheon, first came Ibsen, a giant of the theater who
justly deserved Meyer's ``Ibsen: A Biography,'' an 865-page tome of
great gravitas. Meyer belonged to the all-inclusive school of
biographers, writing books that would stand by themselves and would
also be sources for future biographers. In ``Ibsen'' he offered
endless facts about the playwright's life in and outside the
theater and laundry lists of his income.
</P>
<P>
   But behind those details was a portrait of a genius, a book that
since its publication in 1971 has remained an essential study of a
founding father of modern theater.
</P>
<P>
   In his book Meyer credits Ibsen with breaking down social
barriers that had previously bound theater and with eradicating
artificialities of plot.
</P>
<P>
   He concludes, ``Ibsen's enduring greatness as a dramatist is due
not to his technical innovations, but to the depth and subtlety of
his understanding of human character (especially feminine
character), and, which is rarer, of human relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Rolf Fjelde, himself
a prolific translator of Ibsen plays, said this was the ``most
complete Ibsen biography to date.'' While criticizing prolixity as
the chief defect of the book, he said that the author ``abundantly
reminds us of the contradictory, variously colorful, prosaic and at
times moving outer record of Ibsen the man.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Ibsen,'' it seemed natural that Meyer would move on to
``Strindberg,'' but for some time he avoided that biography while
concentrating on his translations. Eventually he acceded to the
wishes of publishers and devoted himself to the Swedish playwright,
just as he had to his Norwegian counterpart and rival.
</P>
<P>
   His reasons for hesitating over Strindberg were clear. Meyer was
Jewish, and he was offended by the playwright's prejudices. He said
that the characteristics he most disliked in people ``would be
headed by racism, hysteria, self-pity, malice and vengefulness, and
Strindberg possessed all these in full measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he would have preferred to write about a sympathetic
subject, he ``decided that however miserable Strindberg made
others, I would keep my antipathy to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In his biography, Meyer describes Strindberg as a pioneer in
``the depiction of men and women driven by love, hatred, jealousy
or a mixture of all three to that nightmare border country where
hysteria abuts on madness.'' He says Strindberg was someone who
``explored those dark corners of the human soul which most of us
seal off like poisoned wells; he was unbalanced, but so were most
explorers of that country _ Swift, Melville, Dostoyevsky, Kafka.''
</P>
<P>
   In his translations of Ibsen and Strindberg, Meyer held fast to
one of his cardinal rules: he stripped away archaisms, but he did
not modernize the dialogue. By keeping the language in context, he
was able to secure a longer life for his translations. They outlive
the vernacular and the topical, retaining their classical
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Because Meyer was himself a playwright, they are eminently
playable, and they have been acted by the most important English
actors, including Laurence Olivier, Peggy Ashcroft, Anthony Hopkins
and Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   For such an expert, Meyer was a latecomer to his profession. He
was born in London and studied at Oxford University. During World
War II, he was at first a conscientious objector, then served three
years as a civilian with the British Bomber Command. From 1947 to
1950 he was a lecturer in English literature at Uppsala University
in Sweden, where he learned Swedish.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden he wrote a novel and, later, several plays: ``The
Ortolan'' was staged at Oxford with Maggie Smith, then at the
beginning of her career. It was Meyer's translation of Frans G.
Bengtsson's novel ``The Long Ships'' that brought him to the
attention of the BBC, which commissioned him to translate Ibsen's
``Little Eyolf'' for radio.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he knew only rudimentary Norwegian, but he soon
learned the language and wrote television versions of ``The Lady
from the Sea'' and ``John Gabriel Borkman,'' which starred Olivier,
Irene Worth and Pamela Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He was then asked to translate all 16 of Ibsen's major plays,
and also to write a biography of the playwright. The work on Ibsen
overlapped with his translations of 18 Strindberg plays. As he
said, ``Translating plays suddenly became a way of life for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 651-page Strindberg biography was published in 1985. With
characteristic specificity, Meyer said that each biography took him
five and a quarter years to write.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of ``Strindberg'' in The New York Times, John
Gross said: ``Michael Meyer proves as admirable a guide to this
problematic genius as anyone could ask . . . as the foremost
English translator of Strindberg, he brings to bear the authority
both of a scholar and a man of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The Strindberg was dedicated to Graham Greene, whom Meyer met
during the war. ``Later we traveled together,'' he said. ``We sat
on either end of our veranda in Tahiti, I translating `The Ghost
Sonata' while he wrote `A Burnt-Out Case.''' Later in his memoir,
``Words Through a Windowpane,'' he wrote about Greene, George
Orwell, Arthur Koestler, Ralph Richardson and other literary and
theatrical friends.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is survived by a daughter, Nora.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wrote on other subjects, he seemed obsessed with the
two towering Scandinavians. He wrote a play about Ibsen in his
later years and a play about Strindberg from boyhood to death. In
1991 in ``A Meeting in Rome,'' he brought the two of them together
in a play about an imaginary encounter between the artists who had
so dominated his own life.
</P>
<P>
   As Meyer writes in ``Ibsen,'' the two almost met in Italy in the
spring of 1884, but Strindberg was held back by bad weather. If
these two extraordinary men had met, Meyer conjectures, ``they
might have got on rather well, for Strindberg, when his black mood
was not on him, was a tremendous charmer, and he was the kind of
emotional individualist . . . Ibsen found stimulating. And when
Ibsen liked someone and put his own charm forward, there were few
who could resist him.'' &QL;

EXECUTIVES RESIGN AS DIAL EARNINGS FALTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dial Corp., which makes Dial soap and Armour
canned meats, said on Tuesday that its top two executives had
resigned and it warned that it would miss earnings expectations for
the third time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Jozoff, the chairman, president and chief executive
since 1996, who ushered the company through three years of rapid
growth before it stalled this year, was succeeded by Herbert M.
Baum, 63, the president of Hasbro Inc. and a Dial board member
since 1997. Susan J. Riley, the executive vice president and chief
financial officer for the last three years, also stepped down and
was succeeded by the company controller, Jack Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul comes after a troubled first half for the company,
based in Scottsdale, Ariz. Its stock price has tumbled recently to
its lowest level since Dial spun off its travel services in 1996.
It decided at that time to focus exclusively on consumer brands
like Purex detergent, Breck shampoo and Renuzit air freshener.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before, first in March and again in June, Dial warned
investors that languishing sales, inventory backlogs and price cuts
by competitors would drive earnings down as much as 30 percent for
the year. In response, analysts, some of whom expected Dial to earn
$1.30 a share in 2000, lowered their forecasts 77 cents a share, a
34 percent drop from the profit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement made it clear that analysts will have to
revise their estimates yet again and are awaiting a conference call
with Baum in the coming weeks before setting new projections.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dial fell 87.5 cents on Tuesday, to $11.9375.
</P>
<P>
   When Jozoff took control of Dial in 1996, he introduced new
products, cast off other unprofitable ones and cut prices on core
brands to make them more competitive. The move led to a turnaround,
jump-starting the company from minimal to roughly 15 percent growth
a year.
</P>
<P>
   To sustain that pace, Dial began a series of acquisitions, from
Sarah Michaels in 1998 to Freeman Cosmetics last year. This year,
the company bought Coast soap from Procter &AMP; Gamble and joined
forces with Henkel, a German chemical company, to introduce a
premium line of its Purex brand.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of its recent acquisitions has been
lackluster, company officials acknowledge. And, after a banner year
for Amour canned meats, the company raised its prices, but
competitors did not follow suit. Over all, Dial's sales have
slumped more than 5 percent this year.

BRIDGESTONE SAID TO PLAN BIG RECALL OF TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bridgestone Corp. said Tuesday that it would hold a news
conference Wednesday in Washington, after a meeting of company
representatives and regulators who have been investigating dozens
of safety complaints and at least 21 fatal accidents involving
sport utility vehicle and pickup truck tires.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters and The Associated Press reported Tuesday that the
company's Firestone division would announce a recall of millions of
the tires used on SUVs and light trucks, which are used by several
auto companies. The tire models listed in the reports were the ATX,
ATX II and Wilderness AT.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Firestone and Ford Motor met Tuesday with
officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to
discuss its investigation of the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the complaints involved the Ford Explorer, an agency
official said. Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North
American automotive operations, said his company had ``had a team
working for 10 or 11 days around the clock'' to identify the extent
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has been the main tire supplier to Ford since the days
of both companies' founders, Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone, and
the families have been linked through marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has repeatedly said the last week that it would continue to
use Firestone tires. Discount Tire, Montgomery Ward and Sears,
Roebuck have stopped selling the tires because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Fields, a Bridgestone spokesman, said it would announce
Wednesday ``additional steps that we are going to take to address
this issue.'' The company declined to comment on the reports that
it planned a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis noted that unlike warranties on other auto parts, those
on tires are issued by tire makers, and recalls are the
responsibility of the tire maker, not the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Scott F. Merlis, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities,
said the tire defects were primarily a customer relations problem
for Firestone, which he said ``had to move fast to contain broader
damage to the company's overall brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer lawsuits have been filed since 1996 contending that the
tires contributed to fatal accidents _ especially during hot
weather in the South.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the safety agency, which is part of the
Transportation Department, said the government had not drawn any
conclusions about the safety of the tires.

 GIBSON McCABE, 89, EX-NEWSWEEK PUBLISHER  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gibson McCabe, a former publisher and president of Newsweek who
defended the editorial independence of the magazine from irate
advertisers during the Vietnam War, died Aug. 5 at Baptist Medical
Center in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., from complications after a
fall. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was flak from many advertisers about the coverage of
Vietnam,'' recalled Jay Melvin, a former Newsweek executive who is
a consultant with the Magazine Publishers of America, a trade
group. At a time when many readers did not want to hear about
failings of U.S. strategy, ``Gib always defended editors,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Graham, the former chairwoman of The Washington Post
Co., which bought Newsweek in 1961, recalled a time when some
advertisers threatened to pull their ads to protest a cover story,
``Thunder on the Right,'' about right-wing Americans. ``Whether
it's true or not, let's act like they need us more than we need
them,'' McCabe told his staff, as recounted by Graham in her
autobiography, ``Personal History.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, whose father, Robert C. McCabe, had been an editor with
The New York Herald Tribune and other newspapers, ``had a high
regard for the independence of the editorial product,'' said Osborn
Elliott, who was editor of Newsweek from 1961 to 1976 when the
magazine was reporting on racial issues, changes in sexual mores
and other emotionally charged topics.
</P>
<P>
   Graham wrote, ``As long as Oz Elliott was editor and Gib McCabe
was publisher or president, the magazine went from strength to
strength, both in editorial quality and in advertising.''
Circulation increased during his tenure to almost 3 million from
1.3 million and advertising revenue rose to $60.6 million from $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe joined Newsweek in 1942 as circulation director. After a
stint as a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy in World War II, he
rejoined the magazine in 1945 and went to Paris where he supervised
a pocket-size edition for the armed forces. As the war in Europe
ended, he scored a scoop by arranging with French printers, well
supplied with champagne, he said later, to secretly prepare an
edition with the surrender terms that went on sale in Paris minutes
after the news was released by the Allied commanders.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Princeton
University in 1931. Survivors include two daughters, Margaret
Cruger of Fort Collins, Colo.; and Judith Goodchild of Old
Greenwich, Conn.; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
His first marriage, to Elizabeth Fife, ended in divorce. In 1964,
he married Lydia Knight Bassett, who died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He was publisher of Newsweek from 1958 to 1963 and president
from 1959 until he retired in 1975. He was chairman of the Magazine
Publishers of America for several terms. The group gave him its top
honor, the Henry Johnson Fisher Award, in 1971.

 DR. MICHAEL BuRNHILL, 72; LED IN WOMEN'S CARE  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Seth Burnhill, a leader in women's health care,
family planning and reproductive health, died Aug. 4 in New
Brunswick, N.J. He was 72 and lived in Belle Mead, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He was attending to patients in his Belle Mead office earlier
that day when he suffered an aortic dissection, or tear, and
collapsed, his family said. He died at Robert Wood Johnson
Hospital, where he had worked until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Burnhill had been the vice president for medical affairs of the
national Planned Parenthood Federation of America since 1995. He
joined the organization in 1972, as medical director of Planned
Parenthood of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist, he became known in the
profession in the 1960s when he joined his father, Dr. Charles
Birnberg, in developing an early intrauterine device, or IUD. Known
as the Birnberg Bow, it was a widely used contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Burnhill, a native of Brooklyn, graduated magna cum laude from
Syracuse University in 1949 and received his medical degree at the
University of Vermont in 1953. He completed his specialized
training at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York in 1960 and received a
doctorate of medical science, obstetrics-gynecology, at State
University of New York Downstate Medical Center in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s he was affiliated with several hospitals in
Brooklyn, as well as with New York Hospital, George Washington
University Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital and School of
Medicine. He joined the staff of Robert Wood Johnson Medical School
and University Hospital as a professor of obstetrics and gynecology
and senior attending physician in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Burnhill, who was divorced, is survived by a daughter, Lauren A.
Burnhill of Miami; a son, David A., of Rockville, Md.; and a
sister, Marian Mintzer of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

JERE LEHTINEN, STARS AGREE ON FOUR-YEAR CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars avoided the first of two arbitration cases yesterday
when they agreed to terms with right winger Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, 27, agreed to a four-year deal for an undisclosed
amount, thereby canceling a scheduled arbitration hearing tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, who is spending the off-season at his home in Finland,
earned $1.5 million last season and was expected to seek a raise
through arbitration that would double his salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the premier defensive forwards in the league, and
we look forward to his future contributions,'' Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, a two-time Selke Trophy winner as the league's top
defensive forward, is a player whom coach Ken Hitchcock refers to
as a team catalyst. Lehtinen struggled through an injury-plagued
1999-2000 season, his fifth with the Stars. Stars management could
have used that to their advantage in a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that either party was uncomfortable with the
idea of going to arbitration and portraying their case in the
open,'' Gainey said. ``But, when there is a settlement made, it is
usually because there's room in there for both parties to agree.''
</P>
<P>
   A broken ankle kept Lehtinen out of all but 17 regular-season
games last season, and he missed the opening two rounds of the
playoffs. He had one goal among six points in 13 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Only forward Blake Sloan remains unsigned. Sloan's arbitration
hearing is on course for Saturday in Toronto. The Stars have not
been forced to an arbitration hearing in franchise history, but
Gainey said it appears the club could be headed that way with
Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan, who made $357,000 last season, wants a one-way contract.
In his two seasons with the Stars, he was under a two-way contract,
meaning his salary would be drastically reduced if he were sent
down to the team's minor-league affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gainey said he will restart negotiations with unrestricted
free agents next week. The Stars remain interested in signing a
defenseman, likely Dave Manson. The Stars also are interested in a
forward and have talked with Ted Donato and Claude Lemieux.

MRS. CLINTON MOVES TO MAKE LIEBERMAN WORK FOR HER, TOO

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton moved on Tuesday to turn Sen. Joseph
Lieberman's presence on the national ticket to her political
advantage, saying she wanted him to campaign by her side this fall.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted that Lieberman's presence on the New York ballot
would increase turnout among Jewish voters and lift her own Senate
candidacy, an assertion that was immediately disputed by Rep. Rick
Lazio, her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton discussed having Lieberman come to New York during a
congratulatory conversation with the Connecticut senator on the day
that Vice President Al Gore formally announced that he had chosen
Lieberman to be the first Jew to run on a major-party ticket for
national office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose aides have been worried about her relative lack
of support among Jewish voters in New York, described Gore's
decision as a welcome development for Clinton's candidacy, in terms
of increasing her support among Democrats in general and Jewish
voters in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get to meet him, they're going to come away just
impressed and really energized by this choice,'' the first lady
said in a radio interview in Albany. ``And I think here in New
York, it's going to drive up the vice president's numbers, which
will be great for the ticket and for you know, the popular vote. I
think it's going to be really a good decision across the board. So
I expect it will help in New York, but I suspect it's going to help
around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, disputed Clinton's
analysis, asserting that developments in the presidential race
would have no bearing on the high-profile contest between Lazio and
Clinton. Nonetheless, in a suggestion of some concern in Lazio's
camp, the candidate took a break from a closed fund-raising tour in
California to chastise Clinton for her remarks and note several
issues on which she disagreed with Lieberman, including his support
for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton is many things, but she's no Joe Lieberman,''
Lazio said in Thousand Oaks, Calif., according to a transcript of
his remarks provided by his press office. ``If Clinton thinks
Senator Lieberman can drag her across the finish line in New York,
she's sorely mistaken. She's desperate to make this race about
anything other than our records.''
</P>
<P>
   The cross-country exchange on Tuesday suggested the extent to
which a decision made by Gore to help his own presidential race had
captured the attention of both candidates in the race for Senate in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has had difficulty winning the level of support among
Jewish voters that Democratic candidates typically draw in New
York, so the Lieberman selection could prove fruitful for her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sen. Charles Schumer, running against Alfonse D'Amato,
drew 75 percent of the Jewish vote, according to a survey of voters
leaving the polls. Jewish voters made up 12 percent of the
electorate that year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clinton appears be drawing closer to 60 percent.
Analysts say that she probably needs 65 percent to win the
election.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign aide to Clinton predicted that the Lieberman
development could add two full percentage points to her showing on
Election Day, a margin that could make the difference in what most
polls show as an extremely close race.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Koch, the former New York City mayor and one of Clinton's
most important Jewish supporters, said Jewish support was now
``going to pour out here in the city and across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also asserted that Clinton would benefit. ``It excites
people about the ticket, both Jewish and non-Jewish,'' Schumer said
in an interview. ``And that is good for Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's selection almost certainly erases any chance that
George W. Bush will invest much time or money in New York. Some
Republicans have been worried that Lazio would be unable to swim
against the tide of a large victory by Gore in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, several factors suggest that Lieberman's selection
may not provide as much help to Clinton as she would like. For one,
Jews already vote in large numbers, particularly in a presidential
race, so the actual increase in turnout may not be as large as her
supporters suggested. And even Clinton's associates acknowledged
that animosity toward the first lady means that Jewish voters who
turn out for Gore could leave the voting booth without casting a
vote for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce J. Teitelbaum, who has extensive ties to the Orthodox
Jewish community and served as Rudolph Giuliani's campaign manager
in the Senate race, said that the Lieberman selection posed at best
an opportunity for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman's presence will attract more Jews to the polls in
November, but she needs to seize the opportunity to get Jews to
vote for her, and I don't think she will,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly moved to demonstrate how she intended to use
Lieberman to her advantage, campaigning in Orthodox communities in
Rockland County on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   She told an audience of schoolgirls in New Square that Lieberman
``has been my friend for 30 years,'' and said his selection showed
how committed Gore and the Democratic Party were to Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides sought to undercut Clinton on Tuesday by noting
areas in which the two Democrats disagreed, and added that
Lieberman had taken the floor of the Senate to denounce President
Clinton for his involvement with Monica Lewinsky. The first lady
evinced no concern about either issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider both of us to be sort of mainstream centrist New
Democrats,'' she said in her Albany radio interview. ``We don't
agree 100 percent on all the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As to what Lieberman said about her husband, she said: ``You
know, the president said he agreed with him. And I think people are
going to find a lot to like about Joe Lieberman.''  &QL;

NBC'S INTERNET UNIT TO LAY OFF 20 PERCENT OF ITS EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC Internet, the online affiliate of the NBC television
network, said Tuesday that it would lay off 170 people, some 20
percent of its total workforce of 850.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 employees were told Tuesday they had been laid off,
and the remaining positions will be eliminated by the end of the
year, either through attrition, additional layoffs, or because
certain units may be sold.
</P>
<P>
   NBCi, as the company is called, is a publicly traded company
that is 39 percent owned by NBC, a unit of General Electric. Its
shares have fallen by 85 percent this year. Tuesday, they closed
unchanged at $11.
</P>
<P>
   With ad sales slowing and the markets less forgiving, the
company decided to tighten its belt, said William J. Lansing, the
company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an easier money time, you invest in business models that
have returns down the road,'' he said. ``In the environment we are
in today, the Street wants to see results now and you have to be
very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   NBCi had expected to break even in the middle of 2002, but the
layoffs and other cost cutting will allow it to show profits
sooner, Lansing said, though he declined to say when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is not to lose money indefinitely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter ended June 30, NBCi lost $151.9 million on sales
of $30.5 million. That loss was higher than analysts had expected
because of a slow-down in ad revenue, especially from Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed last November as a result of the merger
of Snap, an Internet portal site that NBC controlled, and Xoom, a
publicly traded site that focused on direct marketing. The company
also included several other operations that had been started by NBC
as well as several acquisitions, including Allbusiness.com, a
service aimed at small companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business was formed through the merger of many
businesses, and we have to now figure out how those pieces fit
together,'' Lansing said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the company announced that it would eliminate
Snap, Xoom and its other brand names and introduce a single new
service this fall under the NBCi.com brand.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet units of other broadcast companies have also been
cutting back. CBS's relatively small in-house Internet unit laid
off several dozen people this summer. And Walt Disney Internet Co.,
which runs the GO.com portal, is scaling back its ambition to focus
on entertainment and travel.  &QL;

UNITED AIRLINES CANCELS MORE FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Air Line Pilots Association is correct) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ United Airlines canceled more than 200 flights
nationwide on Tuesday, disrupting service for thousands of
passengers for the fourth consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellations came after a disastrous weekend in which
United, the world's largest airline, was racked by delays and
canceled about 600 flights, or about 15 percent of its weekend
service, because of what the company said was inclement weather in
the East and Midwest and a continuing pilot shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of the last week come as airline delays in the
United States are on the rise and United is promoting itself as an
official sponsor of the Democratic National Convention, which
begins next week in Los Angeles. United has been hurt worse by
delays than other carriers. Its flights arrived on time 57 percent
of the time in May, the last month for which statistics are
available, and it has had a record number of cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rono Dutta, the president of the UAL Corp., the
parent of United, issued an apology to passengers, saying the
airline deeply regretted the ``pain and suffering'' the delays and
cancellations had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brathwaite, a United spokesman, said on Tuesday that the
company was continuing to negotiate with representatives of the
airline's 10,000 pilots, many of whom have refused to work overtime
since their contract expired in April.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether United's troubles could affect service to the
convention, Brathwaite said: ``I really couldn't say. We're going
to do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Since United's contract with its pilots expired, the airline has
been plagued by a shortage of pilots willing to work overtime. And
after its contract with its maintenance workers expired in July,
United executives have complained about a rise in maintenance
delays.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several weeks ago, the company announced that it
would reduce its schedule of flights by about 3 percent to try to
ensure it had enough pilots.
</P>
<P>
   United, which schedules about 2,400 flights a day, has been
reducing its flight schedule since May.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Hunter, a United pilot and a member of the Air Line Pilots
Association, which represents United, said yesterday that weather
was a chief cause of the weekend troubles. But he also said United
failed to hire enough pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we've had staffing problems coming
into the summer,'' he said. ``But I applaud the company for cutting
back some flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say the contract negotiations and weekend
cancellations have made things particularly ugly at United.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a lingering issue at United going back to
April,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, who follows United for
PaineWebber. ``And unfortunately this comes under the broad
headline of `labor negotiations.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellations and reductions in flights, Buttrick said, are
going cost somewhere between $120 million and $150 million in
pretax profits in the third quarter. Wall Street analysts are
worried that United's contract disputes could hurt UAL, which
announced in May that it would acquire US Airways for $4.3
billion. &QL;

DIAGEO SAID TO DISCUSS BID FOR SEAGRAM SPIRITS
</HEADLINE>
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Diageo PLC of Britain has held preliminary talks with
Bacardi Ltd. and several others about forming a joint venture to
make a bid valued at more than $7 billion for the spirits business
of the Seagram Co., executives close to the discussions said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary talks are part of the jockeying among several
potential buyers for position to bid for the business when it is
put up for sale as part of the acquisition of Seagram's
entertainment businesses by Vivendi, the French utility
conglomerate. Vivendi is planning to use the proceeds of a sale to
reduce its $6.6 billion in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Seagram's spirits division, which includes such premier
brands as Chivas Regal scotch and Martell cognac, is not expected
to be formally up for auction until early September, Diageo and
Bacardi have begun to explore whether a joint bid would make
practical sense, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo has also made contact with Pernod Richard S.A. about a
similar arrangement, though the executives said a joint effort by
Diageo and Bacardi seemed more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo, which just sold its Pillsbury division and plans to spin
off its Burger King fast-food restaurants to focus on its liquor
business and Guinness beer holdings, is eager to acquire at least
part of Seagram's spirits business to strengthen its stable of
liquor brands. Diageo is also motivated by the competitive threat
of Allied Domecq PLC, which is eyeing Seagram's spirits business,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo is hoping to join forces with another company, the
executives said, to avert possible antitrust concerns about owning
an unfairly large segment of the liquor business. Diageo and
Bacardi would be able to divide Seagram's brands between them in
ways that could satisfy regulatory objections.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo and Bacardi have made deals together before: Diageo sold
its Dewar's scotch brand and Bombay gin to Bacardi. Because Bacardi
is so small, it needs to join with a company like Diageo to put
together a competitive bid.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bronfman, the co-chairman of the Seagram Co., is also
considering making a bid for his company's spirits division,
according to people close to the talks. Claridge Investments Ltd.,
Bronfman's privately held investment group, has retained investment
bankers at Bear Stearns to examine a possible bid. Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter is handling the auction of Seagram's spirits business.

WALK IN THE WOODS BRINGS A DEAL NEARER ON FRIARS' PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dispute between a friary and the federal government over an
18-acre parcel of forest in Garrison, N.Y., is on its way to
resolution after the parties were brought together to discuss their
differences on a hike.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has agreed not to take legal action
forcing the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement to sell the rights
to 18 acres next to its Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, the group's
world headquarters, established in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the National Park Service bought an easement on 58
acres of the 400-acre Graymoor property for a stretch of the
Appalachian Trail. The trail runs through the property, which is
home to 45 friars, 86 nuns and various ministries, including a
homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, the Park Service, which oversees the 2,144-mile
trail, has been trying to buy another easement, on 18 acres
adjacent to the trail, for ``buffer land.'' But the friars have
refused to sell, maintaining that giving up rights to the land
would endanger the future of their ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Park Service asked the Justice Department to order
the friars to sell the 18 acres by eminent domain, a legal
procedure that allows governments to take land for the public good
at its market value.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Sue W. Kelly, both
Democrats, brought the two sides together to discuss the issue over
a hike on the wooded trail at Graymoor.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed to meet on Aug. 23 to draw up a legal
arrangement, which would protect the land against development and
make it accessible to the friars and the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Arthur M. Johnson, minister general of Graymoor, said
the friars and the Park Service would meet ``with no attorneys
present.'' He said he looked forward to working out a solution
without the fear of eminent domain proceedings.

PATAKI SIGNS BILL REQUIRING CON ED REBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Putting the blame for a February nuclear accident
squarely on Consolidated Edison, Gov. George Pataki signed a bill
Tuesday requiring the company to repay customers more than $100
million collected to pay expenses from the accident and prohibiting
it from collecting tens of millions more.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's decision to sign the bill, which could cost the
utility about $200 million, stunned nearly everyone involved in the
dispute, and came after attempts by the Pataki administration to
reach a negotiated settlement with the company had failed.
</P>
<P>
   It is by far the largest rate rollback the state has ever
imposed on a utility for its own misdeeds, more than double the
previous record of $82 million, in a case against Con Edison in the
early 1980s. The governor's office said that for the average
residential customer, it would mean a $14 credit in New York City,
and $21 in Westchester County. The administration plans to have the
company apply the credits to September electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Con Edison promised to sue the state to void the law,
although company officials would not say on what grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In passing unlawful legislation, the state sends a message to
all of its citizens and corporations that politics overrides sound
public policy,'' said Joseph P. Petta, a company spokesman. ``We
are confident that the court will recognize that this bill is
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki signed the bill on the last day he had to act on it,
after the failure of weeks of talks between Con Edison and the
state's Public Service Commission, which is appointed and
controlled by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill was the only mechanism for immediate, meaningful
rate relief, for putting money back in people's pockets,'' said
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, the Westchester County Democrat who
played a leading role in attacking Con Edison and demanding
redress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill reached the governor's desk at the height of summer
power demand, and at a time when rates have spiked because of power
shortages around the Northeast. New York and other states are
breaking up the old utility monopolies, forcing companies like Con
Edison to sell most of their power plants and buy power on the open
market, subjecting them to price fluctuations as supply and demand
vary.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, has sought repeatedly, through tax cuts,
regulatory mandates and other steps, to lower the price of
electricity in New York, which has some of the nation's highest
rates. But Democrats and some consumer advocates have attributed
the recent price increases to his administration's handling of
restructuring, and Pataki's decision to sign the bill could help
mute such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, cracked pipes in a steam generator allowed a small
amount of radioactive gas to escape from the Indian Point 2 nuclear
reactor alongside the Hudson River in Buchanan, 35 miles north of
Manhattan. The accident forced Con Edison to shut down the plant,
and it is likely to remain closed for months, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission having rejected the company's repair plans as
insufficient.

MLS NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS DEVELOPMENT PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in its fifth season, Major League Soccer, by the standards
of the other professional sports leagues in America, is still an
infant.
</P>
<P>
   Its sport is still foreign to many casual U.S. fans, and MLS
doesn't chart its progress in giant leaps and bounds, but in baby
steps.
</P>
<P>
   One of the developments that league higher-ups have been hyping
all season is the influx of young players. The league views rookies
_ including D.C. United's Bobby Convey, Chicago's DaMarcus Beasley,
Colorado's Seth Trembly _ as teen-agers today, superstars tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe in that view, MLS wants to walk before it can crawl.
</P>
<P>
   The league's system for developing such young talent _ called
Project-40 _ is, at best, confusing, at worst, inexplicable.
Launched in 1997, the program is a joint venture with the U.S.
Soccer Federation designed to develop young players and provide a
talent base for the United States' national teams.
</P>
<P>
   Each MLS team is awarded two or three of Project-40 players, who
train with their MLS squads during the week and play with their
P-40 teams on weekends. Once coaches feel the players can
contribute regularly in MLS, the players graduate from the program.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the public-relations version of the system. In
reality, what sounds like a mutually beneficial relationship offers
MLS coaches little chance to witness P-40 players in game action
and forces young players to bounce back and forth between squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I feel it's a very imperfect situation because
they don't resemble a team,'' Colorado Rapids coach Glenn ``Mooch''
Myernick said. ``They don't know from game to game who they'll be
alongside, and there is no training in it. A big part of
development in any player is knowing the nature of competition that
they are in on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say P-40 has been a complete bust. The Burn's
Sergi Daniv, the Chicago Fire's Josh Wolff and Beasley, and
United's Ben Olsen and Convey are a few examples of players who
flourished in the system and are now contributing _ and
contributing well _ to their MLS teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the system needs some fine-tuning. As more and more players
opt for MLS instead of college, the league can pat itself on the
back for attracting them, but it better be able to use that other
hand to steer the young talent into a system that will facilitate
growth of the players and the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to be careful with it,'' Myernick said. ``In
the traditional soccer nations, the 16- or 17-year-old kids come
into a pro club, and there is an awful lot of foundation work and
groundwork that has to be done before he gets to the first team.
We're missing a number of developmental stages in our current
system. We have to be careful about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With those few missing pieces _ perhaps a reserve team for each
MLS squad _ maybe the 5-year-old league will be able to put itself
against the wall, pull out the measuring stick and find that it is
finally growing taller, catching up with its big-brother leagues
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Burn should reconsider playing in Cup, Dir says The Burn has a
very serious agenda for the next month: making the Major League
Soccer playoffs, and becoming one of four MLS teams to do so all
five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it difficult for the Burn to focus on other
objectives that might take away from that goal.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly the difficulty tonight, as the Burn heads to
Naperville, Ill., for a Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal game
against the Chicago Fire at 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling presents Burn coach Dave Dir with several
concerns. This is the second consecutive Open Cup match in which
the Burn is on the road. Dir said he did not understand why the
Burn was forced to travel to Illinois because the Fire's next MLS
game is Aug. 16, when it plays the Burn at the Cotton Bowl. The
Fire played its most recent game at home during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn, on the other hand, has played four of its past give
games on the road, including a U.S. Open Cup match in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it for the good of the game, but we have to re-evaluate
what we get out of this,'' Dir said. ``Clearly, \Rorganizers\S have
political considerations, and it's almost comical when we're
playing a game here when Chicago was at home this weekend and
doesn't play for 10 days. Nothing makes sense of it.'' The Burn
also has lost two players during U.S. Open Cup games, midfielder
Paul Broome (lacerated right thigh) and midfielder Angel Rivillo
(knee sprain). Dir also pointed out that the U.S. Soccer Federation
and the Fire are both based in Chicago. Federation officials were
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dir emphasized the importance of the U.S. Open Cup for the Burn,
which won the title in 1997, but said he planned to meet with Burn
general manager Andy Swift to discuss Dallas' future involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing about the Cup is that we're real proud to have
won it, but it will take some serious thinking about whether we
want to go back,'' Dir said. ``It will be hard to leave, but we're
getting to the point now that the scheduling is becoming more of a
detriment to the team.'' \Nsubheds:Direct kicks Division heating up
The ``Division of Death'' moniker that many soccer analysts gave to
the Central Division looks like a pretty fair assessment, with
about a month left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven points separate the teams tied for first, Tampa Bay
and Chicago with 41 points, and the last-place Burn, which has 34.
Columbus is third with 35.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn could tighten the race, especially with four of its
final six games at the Cotton Bowl, where it is 8-2-2 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The heat generated between the Burn and the Fire last year in
one of the best playoff series in MLS history should ignite again
tonight. The two teams meet in a U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal match,
and have two more MLS regular-season games. \Nsubheds:Beat-up Burn
Reminiscent of its 1998 season, the Burn seem to be limping into
the final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn is missing four key players, with defender Ricardo
Iribarren and midfielder Ted Eck the newest additions to the
injured list. Eck strained a ligament in his left foot, and
Iribarren has a cracked rib. Also out are midfielders Sergi Daniv
(fractured left ankle) and Paul Broome (right-thigh contusion).
\Nsubheds:New training site During the off-season, the Burn plans
to move its training to Blue Sky Sports Center in The Colony. For
the past four seasons, the Burn has trained at Greenhill School in
North Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Sky Sports Center, 7801 Main St., is on about 90 acres and
includes a 40,000-square-foot soccer facility. The Burn plans to
move in Nov. 1, and the facility's grand opening is scheduled for
Dec. 1. \Nsubheds:Throw-ins Chicago Fire forward Ante Razov was
selected MLS Player of the Week after he scored three goals,
including the game-winners in each of the Fire's victories. Razov,
who has scored three goals with the U.S. National Team this year,
has been MLS Player of the Week three times this season. Burn
defender Jorge Rodriguez is among eight players recently fined by
the MLS disciplinary committee. Rodriguez was fined $250 for
serious foul play for the caution he received late in last week's
victory against New England.

RANGERS APPARENTLY WON'T FACE MARTINEZ, CLEMENS IN HOMESTAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Rangers seem destined to miss Pedro Martinez and
Roger Clemens on the next homestand. Both pitched last night, but,
unless their managers change their minds, neither is expected to
pitch against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' Clemens is scheduled to pitch again on his
normal four days' rest and would pitch Sunday against the Anaheim
Angels. Martinez, who normally pitches on four days' rest, is
getting an extra day because the Boston Red Sox don't play
tomorrow. So manager Jimy Williams is holding him back to pitch
Monday against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The Rangers play Friday
through Sunday against Boston and Monday through Aug. 16 against
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's next start after Monday's should be against the
Rangers a week from Saturday at Fenway Park. Clemens, if the
Yankees' rotation holds true, should pitch against the Rangers on
Aug. 23 at Yankee Stadium. \Nsubheds:Davis being skipped Manager
Johnny Oates, taking advantage of tomorrow's day off, is skipping
left-handed pitcher Doug Davis in the rotation so he can help take
some of the workload off Mike Venafro in the bullpen. Venafro has
been the Rangers' only left-hander in the bullpen, and Oates became
concerned when he was needed in four of the first five games on the
road, throwing a total of 82 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is scheduled to work out of the bullpen through Friday or
Saturday then re-enter the rotation to pitch against the New York
Yankees on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked Venafro hard,'' Oates said. ``Davis will still
get nine consecutive starts after this; the tradeoff is giving
Venafro some time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis entered the rotation when Darren Oliver went on the
disabled list with weakness and fatigue in his left shoulder.
Oliver is pitching on a medical-rehabilitation assignment for
Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   By shuffling his rotation, Oates is setting up Matt Perisho,
Davis and Ryan Glynn to start in next week's three-game series
against the Yankees at The Ballpark in Arlington. \Nsubheds:Greer
celebrates 1,000th hit Rusty Greer's double Monday night was the
1,000th hit of his career, coming in his 878th major-league game.
That's the fastest any Rangers player has reached the 1,000-hit
level. Ivan Rodriguez and Ruben Sierra both did it 914 games, and
Juan Gonzalez did it in 915.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' Greer said. ``When I first came up, they said I'd
be here a couple of weeks. I wasn't expecting to get 100 hits. It's
a little bitter-sweet, getting it and losing the game, but it's
something I can be proud of.'' \Nsubheds:No more contract talks
General manager Doug Melvin said yesterday he will wait until after
the season to reopen contract talks with outfielder Rusty Greer and
reliever Tim Crabtree. He had discussions with their agents earlier
this season but tabled them when the Rangers started struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have options on both players for next season, Greer
at $4.5 million and Crabtree at $1 million. The Rangers don't have
to make a decision on those until after the season, but, barring
major injury, both options are expected to be picked up.
\Nsubheds:Munro injury concern Right-handed pitcher Peter Munro,
who was acquired yesterday from the Blue Jays, comes with some
risk. He was 1-1 with a 5.96 earned-run average in nine games with
the Blue Jays before going on the disabled list June 16 with a
strained right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   After three medical-rehab starts, Munro was optioned to Triple-A
Syracuse and has pitched much better, going 3-2 with a 1.40 ERA. He
pitched six shutout innings in his most recent start.
\Nsubheds:Minor leagues The Rangers released Oklahoma first baseman
Shawn Gallagher, who was the Rangers' Minor League Player of the
Year in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma outfielder Rich Butler has been placed on the disabled
list with a hamstring injury. Mike Zywica has been promoted from
Double-A Tulsa to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have signed outfielder Henry Barrios to a contract
with Tulsa. He was hitting .328 with Schaumburg (Ill.) in the
independent Northern League.

 LOWE'S CHAIN TO STOP SELLING LUMBER FROM ENDANGERED FORESTS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 ByKATHY MULADY AND ISAAC BAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following an emerging trend in environmental awareness, Lowe's
home improvement retail chain announced plans Tuesday to stop
selling lumber and other wood products from endangered forests and
to begin immediately phasing out products from the Great Bear Rain
Forest in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects a social awareness by consumers and their
interest in buying sustainable and Earth-friendly products,
according to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 60 percent of Americans would like to buy and use
sustainable products but want businesses to make it easy for them,
according to one study. And businesses are beginning to take
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kauffman, Lowe's senior vice president in charge of
merchandising, said the company has been working with
environmentalists and scientists for nine months to begin forming a
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a difficult but refreshing process. This is not
a destination but a journey,'' Kauffman said in a conference call
Tuesday to discuss the company's new policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowe's chain is considering whether to ban wood products
from some forests in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast, but
would not say what areas specifically may be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope our approach as willing partners will allow Lowe's to
take a leadership role,'' Kauffman said. ``We hope customers will
appreciate our commitment and give us positive feedback with their
checkbooks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no specifics as to how the move might affect the cost
of lumber at stores.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists applauded the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very significant decision,'' said Nigel Sizer, director
of forest policy for the World Resources Institute in Washington,
D.C. ``Their size and their buying power indicates that their new
policy could have a big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizer said his group is mapping the world's endangered forests.
He said Lowe's has agreed to stop buying products from forests once
they are designated at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's, which recently bought Seattle-based Eagle Hardware and
Garden, is the second-largest home improvement retail chain in the
nation. The company is based in Wilkesboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ray, executive vice president of American Lives, a market
research firm specializing in consumer choices, said Lowe's is
taking the right steps.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who interviewed more than 2,000 people nationwide for a
study sponsored by the federal Environmental Protection Agency,
said the overwhelming majority of Americans want to be
environmentally responsible, but feel the subject is too technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge portion want to be involved, but they feel
disempowered,'' Ray said. ``They appreciate it when someone like
Lowe's comes in and says, `We are going to take care of it for you
and make it easy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ray estimates there is a ready audience of about 50 million
adults who are eager for companies to make it easy for them to buy
Earth-friendly products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a lot more of this as other businesses
catch on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's is the second national hardware retailer to limit its
sales of wood from endangered forests. Home Depot made a similar
announcement a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Home Depot, the nation's largest hardware
retailer, based in Atlanta, Ga., said company President Arthur
Blank plans to mark the one-year anniversary of their announcement
by issuing a report card on their efforts of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot encouraged the home improvement industry a year ago
to follow its lead to develop a global environmentally responsible
wood-purchasing policy. We welcome those who want to join us in
this pursuit,'' spokesman Chuck Sifuentes said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot promised to eliminate wood from endangered forests
from their stores by the end of 2002, particularly certain lauan,
redwood and cedar products, and give preference to ``certified''
wood.
</P>
<P>
   To carry the certified label, a supplier's wood must be tracked
from the forest, through manufacturing and distribution, to the
customer and must ensure a balance of social, economic and
environmental factors. The Forest Stewardship Council, an
international organization, is the most widely used for such
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's also has agreed to give preference to FSC certified wood
and lumber products.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Bernhardt Jr., a spokesman for the Western Wood
Products Association in Portland, Ore., said many questions still
remain before a uniform certification system can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who defines what is good (wood) and what is not good, what is
endangered and what is not endangered?'' he asked. ``There is no
standard definition for that, so that's part of the problem in
developing an overall plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a trend toward that (certification), but as far as
consumers, are they willing to pay the cost is still a question.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest owners of forest land _ the state of
Washington _ may consider seeking certification for some of its
wood products. Washington Lands Commissioner Jennifer Belcher has
raised that possibility as the state is in the process of gauging
logging practices on more than a million acres of state lands west
of the Cascade Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's issued an immediate ban on products from the Great Bear
Rain Forest of British Columbia, the largest intact stand of
centuries-old temperate rain forest stretching along the Pacific
Coast to Alaska. Great Bear holds one-quarter of the temperate rain
forest remaining in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's executives said the retailer already has eliminated ramin
dowels from Indonesia from its inventory and converted to a
domestic poplar species. Ramin, a light-colored hardwood, is native
to Borneo and is often used for furniture, dowels and tool handles.
</P>
<P>
   Other products made of endangered woods will be phased out
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be pulling products from our shelves; that
makes little sense,'' said Lowe's Kauffman. ``They are already
fabricated and manufactured; it would only be symbolic to remove
them from the shelves, and it would be a shame to have them end up
in a Dumpster somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's does about $4 billion in sales of lumber and wood
products each year. Kauffman said about a half-percent of the
company's total wood sales are of products from the Great Bear Rain
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Investigation Agency, based in Washington,
D.C., called Lowe's commitment ``ground-breaking wood policy aimed
at protecting the world's threatened forests by ending the sale of
wood from such forests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an undeniable trend,'' said Michael Brune of the Rain
Forest Action Network. ``Major wood buyers are responding to the
needs of their customers who are saying `no more.' What will result
is a massive shift in these logging companies. I think it will send
shock waves through the logging industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Brune applauded Lowe's policy as more specific than Home
Depot's, because it names regions where it plans take action to
protect threatened forests. Those areas include British Columbia,
Indonesia and the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's did not offer a specific time frame for completion of its
plan, however. On Tuesday, Lowe's also announced formation of a
Healthy Forests Advisory Board, which will help the company
implement its new policy and advise it on general forestry issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Determined to transform a potential liability
into a defining asset, Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday formally
introduced Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his Democratic
running mate. He portrayed his selection of Lieberman, an Orthodox
Jew, as a measure of his devotion to tolerance and his willingness
to break barriers.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to thousands of supporters at Nashville's War
Memorial plaza, Gore compared his groundbreaking selection to his
party's choice of John F. Kennedy as the first Roman Catholic
presidential nominee 40 years ago. ``When we nominate Joe Lieberman
for vice president we will make history again,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   After word of Lieberman's selection leaked out on Monday, Gore
aides and Democratic leaders made it clear that Gore had selected
him despite his religion and any possible anti-Semitic backlash.
But Tuesday's event was remarkable for the forthrightness with
which Gore, Lieberman and their wives addressed Lieberman's
Jewishness as a topic not to avoid, but to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   From Lieberman's opening with a prayer from Chronicles to his
wife's homage to her Holocaust-surviving parents to the senator's
labored use of the word ``chutzpah,'' the Liebermans' faith
provided the strategic and oratorical underpinnings of the entire
day. Campaign aides even volunteered that the Gores and Liebermans
shared a meal on Monday night that was prepared by a kosher
caterer.
</P>
<P>
   The intended message was that Gore, who has been characterized
throughout his career as an exceedingly tentative politician, had
acted boldly in making the most important decision of his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be very clear about this,'' Lieberman said. ``It isn't
me, Joe Lieberman, who deserves credit and the congratulations for
taking a bold step. It is Al Gore who broke this barrier in
American history. And you know what it shows? It shows Al's faith
in the tolerance of this diverse nation in the basic fairness of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk of tolerance was directed partly at the suburban voters
who were the primary targets of the spotlighting of minorities at
last week's Republican convention in Philadelphia. But it also was
clearly aimed at comforting the Democratic base about the selection
of Lieberman, who is conservative by party standards.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Lieberman told of a conversation that he had on
Monday with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. ``He said to me, `You know,
Joe, each time a barrier falls for one person the doors of
opportunity open wider for every other American.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite sweltering 97-degree heat that left Gore's drenched
shirt stuck to his back (Lieberman wore an undershirt), the
Democratic team got exactly the images of family and rectitude that
it wanted out of Tuesday's event.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who Democrats hope will help separate Gore from
President Clinton's moral lapses, attested to Gore's devotion to
his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore spoke warmly of Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, and the
two candidates, having removed their jackets, exchanged a mighty
bear hug after Gore introduced his running mate. Lieberman, clearly
having the time of his life, smiled giddily and pumped his fists as
the crowd chanted ``Joe, Joe, Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who spoke for 20 minutes, described the surreality of
the last 24 hours as ``a magical mystery tour.'' In his prayer, he
thanked God for ``bringing me to this extraordinary moment in my
life'' and thanked Gore ``for making this miracle possible for me
and breaking this barrier for the rest of America forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he added, ``there are some people who might
actually call Al's selection of me an act of chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman spoke touchingly of her parents, both of whom
survived the Holocaust, and said she was moved to be speaking at a
memorial that commemorates ``the American heroes, the soldiers who
actually liberated my mother in Dachau and Auschwitz (in fact, the
War Memorial, with its limestone Doric columns, was built in 1925
to honor the 3,400 Tennesseans who died in World War I, according
to the Tennessee Historical Commission).
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you and your family immigrated from Europe, Africa,
Mexico, Latin America or Asia, I am standing here for you,'' Mrs.
Lieberman said. ``This person is our country. This land is your
land and anything is possible for us.''

   Tuesday's speeches continued a pattern in the 2000 campaign, in
which Democrats and Republicans seem to be appropriating each
other's language. Gore's reference to tearing down walls echoed
President Ronald Reagan's memorable demand to Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the Soviet leader, to tear down the Berlin Wall. That phrase, in
turn, showed up in Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech at the
Republican convention last week.
</P>
<P>
   And Lieberman on Tuesday quoted Gov. George W. Bush's father,
who asked in his 1988 campaign, ``If you have to change horses in
midstream, doesn't it make sense to get on the one that's going in
the right direction?''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, the co-chair of the Democratic National Committee,
said after the speeches that the new Democratic ticket was being
received enthusiastically, even by liberals who might disagree with
Lieberman's centrist politics. ``What brings them back is the sense
that we're going to win with this ticket,'' he said. ``While the
Republicans had this illusion of inclusion convention, all about
photo ops, Al Gore is all about real opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before and after Tuesday's event, Lieberman, 58, spent time
meeting campaign aides, receiving briefings on Gore's positions,
working on the speech he will deliver at next week's Democratic
convention in Los Angeles, and preparing for a multi-state campaign
swing that begins on Wednesday with a visit to Gore's hometown,
Carthage, Tenn., and to Stamford in Lieberman's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a statement on Tuesday that he respected Lieberman
``for his convictions, his strong faith, and his record on Social
Security, missile defense, and reforming our public schools.''
Those were pointed references to past positions taken by Lieberman
_ expressing interest in allowing workers to invest part of their
payroll taxes in the markets, backing a space-based missile defense
system and supporting pilot programs allowing parents to use
federal vouchers to pay private school tuition _ that are opposed
by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This selection,'' Bush continued, ``now presents the Vice
President with an interesting test of whether he will continue
attacking positions his running mate shares, or whether he will
lift up our nation by elevating the tone of his presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials on Tuesday distributed quotations and
writings by Lieberman, including an unpublished article written in
June, suggesting that he had moved away from his support for the
partial privatization of Social Security because it posed
unacceptable risks for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman used his speech on Tuesday to shoot down the Bush
campaign's suggestion that he had more in common with Bush than
with Gore. ``With all due respect,'' he said, ``I think that's like
saying that the veterinarian and the taxidermist are in the same
business because either way you get your dog back.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday night on CNN's Larry King Live,
Lieberman said that there were issues where he did not fully agree
with Gore and that he would feel obligated to discuss those
differences privately. But he said, ``when President Gore decides,
Vice President Lieberman is with him 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore, 52, on Tuesday took pains to emphasize the
positions on which he and Lieberman agreed. ``He believes, as I
do,'' Gore said, ``that every family has a right to clean air and
clean water. He believes, as I do, in that the earth is the Lord's
and the fullness thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Together, he said repeatedly, he and Lieberman had fought for
welfare reform, for fiscal discipline and balanced budgets, for
putting more police on the streets, for providing health care for
uninsured children, for campaign finance reform and for a strong
national defense. He pointed out that both men ``broke with our own
party to cast two lonely Democratic votes in support of the Persian
Gulf War.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing attention to Lieberman's religion once again, Gore said,
``Joe and I come from different regions and different religious
faiths. But we believe in a common set of ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Lieberman mentioned President Clinton in their
remarks on Tuesday, though Lieberman said the Democratic ticket
would ``help renew the moral center of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has long been considered one of the most moral voices
in the Senate, and Democratic strategists believe it is beneficial
that he was one of the first in his party to strongly and publicly
denounce Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Gore on Monday, parts of which were
broadcast on Tuesday, NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw read portions of a
September 1998 speech by Lieberman in which the senator labeled
Clinton's behavior inappropriate, immoral and harmful. He then
asked Gore whether he agreed with Lieberman ``when he said that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did,'' Gore responded, ``and said so at the time and I think
most Americans agreed with that. I think that most Americans want
to talk about the future of our country and want to focus on the
choices that we have to make in this election and I think honestly,
Tom, that most people are ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he said, would play an active role in his campaign. But
he added: ``I am running this campaign on my own with my own
message and vision and I welcome his help in support of that
message and I expect I'll receive it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore has never condemned Clinton with words approaching
Lieberman's. He initially defended Clinton, saying he believed the
president's denials of improper conduct. After Clinton admitted in
August 1998 that he had been deceptive, Gore said he was proud that
the president ``has had the courage to acknowledge mistakes'' and
said he was honored ``to work with this great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days after Lieberman made his remarks on the Senate
floor, Gore said of Clinton that ``he himself has said what he did
was wrong. His strongest comments came in a June 1999 interview:
``What he did was inexcusable and, particularly as a father, I felt
that it was terribly wrong, obviously.''

SISTER ISOLINA FERRE, SOURCE OF CHARITY AND PEACEMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sister M. Isolina Ferre, a Catholic nun from a wealthy family in
Puerto Rico who was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President
Clinton last August for over half a century of charity and
peacemaking, died on Thursday in her native city of Ponce. She was
85.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed only with her faith, she taught gangs in New York City
to solve their differences without violence,'' President Clinton
said in a statement last week. ``In Puerto Rico, her community
service centers, the Centros Isolina Ferre, transformed ravaged
neighborhoods by operating clinics and helping residents to empower
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Isolina won the Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the
government can give a civilian, for establishing charitable centers
in New York City and Appalachia, in addition to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and fellow nun in Sister Isolina's order, the
Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, said that Sister
Isolina successfully mediated a conflict between warring Puerto
Rican youth gangs in Brooklyn in the 1950s and '60s while she was
the director of a Catholic charitable center there.
</P>
<P>
   The friend said Sister Isolina's success as a peacemaker was the
result of her interpersonal skills, her training in sociology at
Fordham University and the insights provided by her Puerto Rican
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked with Portuguese immigrants in New England and
black youths in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   She won a Rockefeller Public Service Award in 1980 for her work
in revitalizing communities and neighborhoods and organizing local
groups to serve the unemployed, underskilled, delinquent, sick and
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Isolina was born into a Puerto Rican family that owns two
leading newspapers. Her brother, Luis, was a governor of Puerto
Rico, and established the ruling New Progressive Party. She
employed her family's influence in establishing charitable
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, while on a trip to Havana, she decided to join the
Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity. She studied at St.
Joseph College for Women and at Fordham. Her work in Puerto Rico
included founding a vocational school in Ponce.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her brother.

OVERALL HOME-RUN PACE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF ABATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is supposed to be the season of the burly slugger, the
juiced baseball, the bandbox ballpark. This is supposed to be the
season where no home-run record is safe.
</P>
<P>
   But a quick check of the league leaders reveals no pulse-raising
totals, no jaw-dropping numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last night's games, Gary Sheffield and Sammy Sosa
topped the National League with 35 homers each, and are on pace to
hit 51. Barry Bonds has 34, and is on track for 50. Blue Jays
teammates Tony Batista and Carlos Delgado led] the American League
with 33 each, a pace that would yield 47 at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty homers or so is nothing to be ashamed of, to be sure. Babe
Ruth only hit 50 or more in a season four times in his 22-year
career. Hank Aaron, the all-time record holder, never hit more than
47. Before '96, there had been only 12 50-homer seasons in the AL
and only seven in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Still, considering that in the past three seasons Mark McGwire
hit 65, 70 and 58, that Sammy Sosa hit 63 and 66 the past two
seasons, and that Ken Griffey Jr. hit 56 in both '97 and '98, a
mere 50 or so seems kind of puny.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to all those guys with the big biceps swatting
rock-hard balls out of tiny stadiums?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, nothing. The leaders' totals only seem puny compared
with the exploits of McGwire and Sosa the past couple of years.
Overall, home run totals continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five now, that's a lot of home runs,'' said David
Vincent, co-editor of ``The Home Run Encyclopedia'' and the homer
guru for the Society for American Baseball Research. ``It just
doesn't seem like it. It's sort of a strange situation in that
you've got the leaders like that, but you've got the grand total
way up.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is challenging the single-season record for the first
time in three years, but for the third time in three seasons, the
overall home-run totals are headed toward record territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of what we've seen a lot of the last few years,
which is some of these guys who you wouldn't think of as home-run
hitters are hitting more,'' Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   In '98, when McGwire stunned the baseball world by hitting 70
homers, there were a record 5,064 homers hit. That record fell in
'99, when batters hit a collective 5,528. The numbers are even
greater this season. There were 4,097 homers hit in the first 1,662
games, putting hitters on pace for 5,990. Batters hit an average of
2.28 homers per game in '99. This year, the average is up to 2.47.
Batters averaged a homer for every 30.23 at-bats last year. This
season, they're doing it every 28.02 at-bats, an all-time record
pace.
</P>
<P>
   League totals aren't as compelling as individual numbers, of
course. The total number of homers hit in 2000 will not be the
answer to some future trivia question. Even though no one is likely
to approach 60 this season, it should have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been very surprised if we would have continued
that 65 pace,'' Vincent said. ``Those numbers are way out of scope.
I'm not at all surprised we've backed off of that. The three guys
that have been up at the top, McGwire's hurt, Sosa doesn't have
anybody's coattails to ride and Griffey's been in a funk all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, home runs continue to rise, even without major
contributions from the Big Three. What's the significance, other
than a confirmation of the various juiced ball-muscular
player-small ballpark theories?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it serves as a reminder that even in this era
of unprecedented home-run totals, those McGwire-Sosa home-run duels
the past couple of years truly were special.

RANGERS ADD ANOTHER YOUNG PITCHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Rangers haven't undergone a complete overhaul,
but, thanks to the Toronto Blue Jays, they have added a couple of
young pitchers. That might prove beneficial when the Rangers start
talking trades in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers completed the Dave Martinez trade yesterday by
acquiring right-hander Peter Munro from the Blue Jays. Munro, 25,
was 4-3 with a 2.48 earned-run average in 10 starts for Triple-A
Syracuse and was 1-1 with a 5.96 ERA for the Blue Jays, including
0-1 with a 4.80 ERA in three starts. He's being sent to Triple-A
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young and he has a good arm,'' Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin said. ``He just turned 25 \Ron June 14\S. He's just one
of those guys you want to give a chance to and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   That also is the reason the Rangers picked up 25-year-old
right-handed reliever Darwin Cubillan, along with minor-league
shortstop Mike Young, from the Blue Jays for pitcher Esteban Loaiza
on July 19. Cubillan pitched 13 scoreless innings for Triple-A
Oklahoma before being brought up to the majors Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him pitch,'' said Rangers manager Johnny
Oates, who plans to use Cubillan in long and middle relief. ``He's
got a pretty good arm and pretty good stuff. He was off to a good
start at Oklahoma City. We'll see what he can do. Again, we'll try
to put him in the right spot to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would like to find out about their young players
because they're in a rare position of having some depth at key
positions. They have four young starters who have major-league
experience _ Matt Perisho (25), Doug Davis (24), Ryan Glynn (25)
and Munro _ and five hard-throwing right-handed relievers _ Tim
Crabtree (30), Jeff Zimmerman (28), Francisco Cordero (22),
Jonathan Johnson (26) and Cubillan.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with an extra young outfielder _ they have Ruben
Mateo (21), Gabe Kapler (24) and Ricky Ledee (26) to go along with
veteran Rusty Greer _ plus some room with their payroll, and the
Rangers could be in position to trade young players for an impact
player in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers haven't been in that position in a while. That's why
they couldn't get Roger Clemens from the Blue Jays before the 1999
season or make a run at Mike Hampton when the Houston Astros
unloaded him last off-season.
</P>
<P>
   But now they can get involved if, for example, the Arizona
Diamondbacks decide they can't afford Curt Schilling for a full
season, if the Chicago White Sox decide they can't sign James
Baldwin (a free agent after 2001) or if the Seattle Mariners need
to trade a pitcher so they can afford to re-sign Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove to be a more economical route for the Rangers
than throwing millions at one of the top available free agents:
Hampton, Clemens, Mike Mussina and Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're just trying as many good young pitchers as we
can,'' Melvin said. ``With pitching, you never know when a guy
might find it. This just gives us some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   And some options they haven't had lately.
