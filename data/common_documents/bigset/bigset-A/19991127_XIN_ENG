<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Goat Species Need Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia, well-known for
its livestock husbandry, has to pay more attention to improve its
goat species, an expert told a seminar.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian News Agency Friday quoted livestock expert Zinash
Sileshi as saying that despite the fact that Ethiopia has a
16-million goats population, its contribution to the national
economy is minimal due to lack of proper attention.
</P>
<P>
Lack of sustainable research aimed at improving goat species
had made it impossible for the country to obtain the expected hard
currency, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zinash, there are 11 types of goat species in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia earned a total of 82 million U.S. dollars from the
export of hides and skins of goat and sheep in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also obtained five million U.S. dollars from export of live
goats and sheep including mutton in the past two years, she said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from six East African countries attended the
seminar that began on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Holland Offers Aid to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Holland has donated 2.3
million U.S. dollars through the World Food Program (WFP) to
Ethiopia, a WFP release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contribution, the second of its kind from Holland this
year, will be offered to purchase cereals for citizens displaced
by the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian assistance in the form of food aid through the
WFP was the best temporary measure while working toward the
long-term goal of food security, the release quoted Holland
ambassador to Ethiopia Pieter Marres as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to 80 percent of those affected are
women, children and elderly people who are faced with the danger
of malnutrition and ultimately starvation, the release said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Raise Scrutiny of Foreign Airlines: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. airlines' ticket-sharing partners are expected to be more
strictly scrutinized by a new set of U.S. safety guidelines, the
Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, being drafted by the Transportation Department
and the Federal Aviation Administration, are expected to be
announced early next month, the paper quoted U.S. sources
familiar with the matter as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. airlines would be required by the guidelines to routinely
review the training, maintenance and other practices of their
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
Several major airlines have already agreed to an in-depth
review of such areas as accident and incident rates, financial and
economic conditions and age of equipment, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Code-sharing deals between U.S. and foreign carriers have
grown as the American airlines seek to expand their international
reach without adding to their fleets.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the number of such pacts has more
than tripled from 53 in 1994 to 196 in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is moving to enhance the scrutiny against a backdrop
of increasing accidents involving these airlines.
</P>
<P>
The most recent was EgyptAir 990, whose Boeing 767-300 plunged
into the Atlantic off U.S southeast coast on October 31, killing
all 217 on board soon after its take-of from New York to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The other major incident took place in 1997 when Korean Air
Flight 801 crashed in Guam, killing 228 people.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rules out Supply of Nile Water to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian official on
Friday ruled out the possibility that Egypt will supply Israel
with Nile water.
</P>
<P>
"All what is being circulated about (channeling Nile water to
Israel through Al-Sallam Canal) is no more than rumors," Minister
of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid told Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will never pass out a drop of water outside its borders"
because it is bound by an agreement reached among Nile basin
countries banning the signatories to channel Nile water beyond the
basin borders, Abu Zeid stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt has no water surplus to relieve any other
country of its shortage, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel suffered a serious drought this winter that has been
encountered seldom in 100 years. There have been speculations that
Egypt may agree to send water to Israel in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sallam Canal has been designed to carry water from the Nile
to irrigate 400,000 feddans (168,000 hectares) in Sinai and
220,000 feddans (92,400 hectares) in the east of the Nile, the
Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid said Egypt and the Nile basin countries are
cooperating to magnify optimal use of the Nile water, adding that
a comprehensive plan for 22 projects has been worked out to boost
water resources in the basin states.
</P>
<P>
A number of international financial institutions have already
started funding these projects, the Egyptian official said without
elaborating.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Resumes Pumping Oil to Fill Tanks in Ceyhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said
on Friday that Iraq resumed pumping oil Wednesday to full storage
tanks at the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
U.N.spokesman Fred Eckhard said that "I am told that on
Wednesday there was a resumption of the pumping of oil through the
pipeline from northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan
</P>
<P>
"But we are told by the oil experts that the reserve tanks at
Ceyhan were close to empty after the completion of the loading
program for phase six," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The storage tanks' capacity is about 7.5 million barrels,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The pumping that is going on now is to refill these supply
tanks. We have no sign of any oil being loaded onto ships, except
for what we have already reported ... in fulfillment of contracts
issued under phase six," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided last Friday that it would not sign with the
United Nations on the two- week extension of the sixth phase of
the oil-for-food program which expired last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council Last Friday unanimously
adopted a resolution which extended the sixth phase of the oil-for-
food deal for two weeks until December 4 amid the differences
among the Council's members on the renewal of a new phase of the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, implemented since late 1996, is
aimed to ease the suffering of Iraqi civilians caused by the
stringent U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food,
medicine and other necessities for its people. Iraq must be
clarified to have destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction
before the sanctions get lifted.

ABU DHABI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Dubai, the second largest
emirate of the United Arab Emriates (UAE), announced on Friday
that starting from Sunday, all jewelries imported to the emirate
will be exempted from customs duties for a period of more than
four months.
</P>
<P>
All gold products and jewelries imported to Dubai in the
period between November 28, 1999 and April 15, 2000 will be
exempted from customs duties, currently as high as 4 percent,
announced Dubai Crown Prince and UAE Defense Minister Sheikh

</P>
<P>
Dubai, famous for its gold trade, imports 80 to 85 tons of
gold anually. Currently there are more than 400 retail outlets
for gold products and jewelries in the emirate.
</P>
<P>
The decision was part of the government's efforts to support
the coming Dubai Shopping Festival, due to be held during the
entire month of March 2000, said Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al
Maktoum, chairman of the Higher Organizing Committee of the
international promotion campaign.
</P>
<P>
As a commercial center of the Middle East, Dubai has taken many
measures to boost trade and economic activities in the emirate.
</P>
<P>
The annual Dubai Shopping Festival, launched in February 1996,
is an emirate-wide shopping, entertainment, sporting and cultural
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
Last year's event, held from March 18 to April 24, attracted a
record number of 2.4 million shoppers and achieved more than 1.12
billion U.S. dollars in incremental sales.
</P>
<P>
The shopping festival will be five years old next year.

TORONTO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China and Canada signed their
bilateral agreement here Friday on China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Signing the agreement on behalf of their respective government
were Shi Guangsheng, Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, and his Canadian counterpart Pierre
Pettigrew.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, the Chinese minister said that the
signing of the Sino-Canadian agreement signifies another step
forward to the admission of China to WTO.
</P>
<P>
The finalization of the agreement by the two sides in the
spirit of friendly consultation and accommodation is in the
interests of the two countries and will promote bilateral economic
and trade ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pettigrew hailed the deal a historical event in the development
of trade and economic ties between the two countries. He
reiterated that Canada stands for the admission of China to WTO as
early as possible.

China and the United States signed their WTO agreement on
November 15 at the end of six days of talks in Beijing, paving the
way for China's entry to the largest trade body in the world.

<HEADLINE> African Universities Urged to Upgrade Indigenous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- African universities should
respond and gear themselves to the challenge of developing and
upgrading the status of African languages, Zimbabwean Minister of
Higher Education and Technology Ignatius Chombo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The universities should engage researchers who would then
become experts and eventually form the nucleus of the development
framework of indigenous languages, Chombo said at the official
launch of the African Languages Research Institute here.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the institute, which would mainly confine its
duties to carrying out research for African languages, is a
milestone and an accomplishment by the Africans in their long
journey in search of their African cultural identity, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said inter-regional collaboration is needed and absolutely
essential as some local languages had become cross-border
languages.
</P>
<P>
It would be proper to make sure that the new language policy
would operate and create an enabling environment for the elevation
and recognition of indigenous languages, Chombo said.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of such an institute is evidence of the growth
and development in an area which many Africans had tended to
ignore during the post-independence era, he said.
</P>
<P>
This institute would inevitably shows the potential of African
languages as a tool for communication and instructional purposes,
he added.

<HEADLINE> JMC Meeting on Congolese Cease-fire Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Military Commission
(JMC) started a five-day meeting here Friday to map out modalities
of implementing the final phase of the cease-fire in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The commission responsible for the implementation of the Lusaka
cease- fire would break into four committees - disarmament,
disengagement, humanitarian and withdrawal - over the weekend,
Zimbabwean Defense spokesman Chancellor Diye said in a statement
released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up of its deliberations started in the Ugandan
capital Kampala and later in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the JMC
meeting in Harare is expected to come up with concrete modalities
of executing major components of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session will be opened by Zimbabwean Defense
Minister Moven Mahachi early next week and be closed by Zimbabwean
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
The JMC is composed of all the belligerents in the DRC civil
war which was sparked by rebels who assaulted government positions
with the help of Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
At least six African countries sent their troops to the DRC
more than a year ago with Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia defending
DRC President Laurent Kabila's government while Rwanda and Uganda
aided the rebels to dislodge the government.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire accord expected to bring the war to a halt has
since been signed in Lusaka by all the parties involved in the war
but reports of violations of the cease-fire have been abundant.
</P>
<P>
The JMC is also expected to investigate and verify all
cease-fire violations and work closely with the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), the United Nations and Zambia as the
mediators.
</P>
<P>
The JMC is chaired by Algerian General Rachid Lallali,
representing the OAU.

<HEADLINE> CBI Forecasts Robust Growth On UK's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) - Britain will enjoy robust growth
this year provided the Bank of England refrains from raising
interest rates over the next few months, the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly forecast, the CBI predicts that the UK'
s economy will grow by 1.8 percent in 1999 and by 2.9 percent in
2000.
</P>
<P>
"2000 promises to be a year of better balanced, robust growth
supported by both domestic and export demand," said Sudhir
Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic analysis.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that if interest rates go up too far it could
hit manufacturers' competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CBI warns that if the chancellor, Gordon Brown, were to
relax the tax and spending reins, the Bank of England might put up
rates to compensate.
</P>
<P>
It expects the UK's interest rates to rise to 5.75 percent by
the middle of next year before edging them down again to 5.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Banks Raise Minimum Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe said
Friday that due to changes in the money market, it has increased
its minimum lending rate by 6.5 percent to 60.5 percent with
immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on current, savings and deposit accounts would
also be increased by 6.5 percent, Barclays said, promising that a
regular review of interest rates would take place in line with
market conditions.
</P>
<P>
Money market analysts said the move was expected, given the
inflationary pressures and the upward movement of the 91-day
treasury bill rate. Inflation is standing at 70.4 percent as of
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe also said it will increase
minimum lending rates from 56.5 percent to 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that in line with the general upward trend in
money market rates, its deposit rates had also been adjusted
upwards.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not mention anything about interest rates on
current, savings and deposit accounts.
</P>
<P>
Standard Charted Bank public relations manager Audrey Mpunzwana
said the bank had increased its minimum lending rate to 61 percent
as of last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Philippine Leaders Highlight Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada and visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on Friday voiced
the common will to boost friendly relationship and cooperation
between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a state dinner hosted by Estrada in Zhu's honor here Friday
evening, the Chinese premier lauded the progress the two countries
have made in economic, trade, cultural and other fields since
their establishment of diplomatic relations 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our consensus far outweighs our differences and our need for
cooperation overbears our disputes over specific issues," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with its fixed policy of promoting goodneighborly
friendship, the Chinese government has all along committed itself
to establishing a long-term and stable friendly relationship with
the Philippines, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that next year marks the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, Zhu
expressed the hope that the two sides will be able to seize the
important opportunity to enhance mutual trust and expand
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier reaffirmed the Chinese people's
understanding of the relationship between peace and development,
saying peace is the precondition for development.
</P>
<P>
"We need a peaceful and stable international and surrounding
environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Estrada also expressed satisfaction over the
growing momentum of bilateral exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the two sides draw up a common framework
for the future direction of the bilateral ties to bring them "to
an even higher level in the midst of the difficulties besetting
our region."
</P>
<P>
The president also hailed the agreement reached earlier this
month between China and the United States on China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement will serve as a major step toward
bringing China into its eventual membership in the WTO, adding,
"The WTO will never be complete without China's participation."
</P>
<P>
The premier began his official visit to the Philippines Friday
before attending the 3rd informal summit between the Association

<HEADLINE> UN Publishes Handbook for Negotiators from Least Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has published a handbook to help
negotiators from the 48 least developed countries (LDCs) in the
new round of global trade negotiations to be launched late this
month.
</P>
<P>
Launching the handbook here Thursday, the UNCTAD expressed hope
that LDCs would play an active role in defense of their trade
interests at the Third Ministerial Conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in Seattle of the United States from November
30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
The Handbook for Trade Negotiators from Least Developed
Countries explains the features of the WTO agreements and reflects
the preoccupation of the LDCs with respect to the imbalances and
the shortcomings in the agreements.
</P>
<P>
The handbook also provides concrete proposals for addressing
them, in light of experience gained so far in their implementation.
</P>
<P>
In a foreword to the handbook, UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero underscored that the credibility of the multilateral
trading system lies in its ability to ensure the full
participation of the LDCs in particular, and of the developing
countries as a whole, both in the rule-making process and in
deriving an equitable share of the benefits from global trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"Integration into the trading system and preventing further
marginalization of the LDCs, and indeed continued faith in the
system, could mean nothing less," he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionist Leader Appeals for Party Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has been battling to win
his party's support for the deal which would bring Sinn Fein into
a devolved power-sharing government in the province.
</P>
<P>
If the party vote against him on Saturday, the establishment of
political institutions will grind to a halt and he could lose the
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 860 members of the Ulster Unionist Council will vote on
whether to accept the deal but the "no" group makes up 42 of the
112 member party executive.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the executive members said Trimble and senior
Ulster Unionist negotiator Sir Reg Empey had promised that any
proposals agreed during the 10-week Mitchell review would be
brought to the executive for approval.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph newspaper forecast that the
party will be split 50:50 about the deal on devolution and
paramilitary arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which interviewed grassroots activists close to
Trimble's 860-strong ruling council, reported that a narrow 4
percent majority of the UUP's constituency delegates - which make
up most of the delegates expected to vote - would back their
leader.
</P>
<P>
But it said delegates in other sections, including the 120-
strong Orange Order delegation, who meet Friday night to make a
final collective decision, were likely to be heavily against.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Irish Republican Army is expected to appoint a
go-between to discuss decommissioning with the international arms
body and Trimble expects an IRA weapons handover shortly
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson urged the UUP
council to vote yes, or, he said, the opportunity of a generation
would be lost.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Trimble made a last-minute appeal to members to show
courage and back a peace formula for a devolved government and
disarmament in the province. He said in Belfast that the future of
Northern Ireland was "in the hands of unionism" and that Saturday'
s meeting was "crucial".

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Midway Airlines jet
aborted a landing at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North
Carolina State of the United States to avoid another plane on the
same runaway, said reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of Flight 372 from Tampa, Florida State, circled the
airport for about 20 minutes Thursday after finding a Northwest
Airlines DC-9 on the runway, the reports quoted Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bergen called the episode "an operational error" by an air
traffic controller who mistakenly thought the Northwest jet was on
the runway parallel to the one where the Midway jet was trying to
land.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a United Airlines Boeing 757 narrowly avoided
hitting another jet while taking off at Los Angeles International
Airport. The United pilot lifted off early and missed a Aeromexico
MD-80 jet.

<P>
LUANDA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Angola Friday hailed a decision
made by the British executive of freezing the bank accounts of
Jonas Savimbi, head of Angola's UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
"It's a measure aiming to impede the continuity of the war in
Angola," said Angolan Vice Minister of Defense Armando da Cruz
during a meeting with the new military attache of the U.S. Embassy
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions
against the Angolan rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), including the freezing of the bank accounts opened
by UNITA leaders and their followers.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of Angolan diamonds without government licenses is
also forbidden by the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Da Cruz also manifested his satisfaction with the U.S. recent
gesture on the issue of the Angolan civil conflict. Washington
considers Savimbi as a threat against the U.S. interests in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA),
considering the combat against the rebels as promotion of the
peace process in the country, will continue the fighting with the
rebels without truce until the total destruction of the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Asian Nations Urge Effective Cooperation in Crime Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Asian countries Friday
called for effective regional cooperation in crime prevention and
criminal justice at the end of their four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Various forms of crime have destabilized the region
economically and undermined the well-being and security of its
peoples and nations, according to a declaration adopted by the
seventh world conference, organized by the Asia Crime Prevention
Foundation (ACPF).
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that Asian authorities have been
confronted with complex transnational and extraterritorial
dimensions in the detection, investigation and prosecution of
offenses.
</P>
<P>
Procurators, justices and crime prevention officials from 29
Asian countries agreed to improve mutual cooperation in their
fight against crimes which have been on the rise in recent years
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The delegates stressed that any strategy against transnational
organized crime would inevitably require a comprehensive
involvement and action of all agencies of the criminal justice
system in the region.
</P>
<P>
The delegates said in the declaration that effective and
efficient international action against crime requires a concerted
commitment of governments and international and non-governmental
organizations to put into practice the precepts and objectives of
the U.N. criminal policy.
</P>
<P>
The declaration urged Asian prosecutors to take steps to
improve quality and efficiency of the prosecutorial process in
order to provide an effective and meaningful response to complex
crime having transnational and extraterritorial dimensions.
</P>
<P>
ACPF, a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit
organization founded in 1982, strives to promote sustainable
development, peace and stability in Asia and the world through
mutual cooperation and more effective crime prevention, criminal
justice policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the next ACPF meeting will be held in
Beijing in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Rises 1.3 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal income rose 1.
3 percent in October, the biggest jump in more than five years,
the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
October's increase in personal income was the biggest leap
since matching a 1.3 percent gain in April 1994 and was topped
only by a 3.3 percent rise in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, was boosted by several factors, including a big jump in
federal subsidy payments to farmers and union contract signing
bonuses for some manufacturing industries, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
If excluding these factors, however, personal income would have
gone up by 0.5 percent, in line with analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
In September, income was flat reflecting uninsured property
losses from Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spending jumped 0.6 percent October, more than the 0.
3 percent increase many analysts were expecting. In September,
spending rose a strong 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that the nation's savings rate, savings
as a percentage of after-tax income, was 2.3 percent in October,
following a record monthly low of 1.5 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
It also said that wages rose a strong 0.6 percent in October,
following a 0.4 gain in September.
</P>
<P>
Farm proprietors' income soared to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 53.8 billion dollars in October from 18.9 billion dollars
the month before, reflecting the big increase in agricultural
subsidy payments to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that recently authorized federal subsidy
payments boosted overall income by an annual rate of 41.4 billion
dollars in October. It also was boosted by union signing bonuses
in the automotive and aircraft industries totaling 5.9 billion
dollars at an annual rate.
</P>
<P>
In October, spending on durable goods rose a brisk 0.6 percent,
following a 0.1 percent increase the month before.
</P>
<P>
For nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, spending grew by 0.
5 percent in October, down from 0.8 percent in September.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Is Still Coughing And Has A Fever: Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
" is still coughing and has a fever," said the Kremlin health
chief late Friday, but describing the president's condition as "
satisfactory".
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is suffering from tracheal bronchitis triggered by a
viral catarrh infection, said Sergei Mironov, head of the
Presidential Administrative Department's Medical Ccenter in an ORT
television news program.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has a low-grade fever, and coughs and speaks in a
hoarse voice. It will take between seven and ten days for Yeltsin
to recover, Mironov said  .
</P>
<P>
However, "I can say objectively that the condition of Boris
Nikolayevich is now satisfactory. Still, he is coughing and has a
fever," said Mironov, cited by the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Mironov linked Yeltsin's illness to his recent trip to Turkey's
Istanbul for OSCE summit and the temperature difference between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry
Yakushkin told the NTV television channel that "the voice (of
Yeltsin) is hoarse but he works actively."
</P>
<P>
"I think the medical treatment will continue for the next few
days. I cannot say for sure when the President will be back to his
working place. Everything will depend on the way he feels," said
the Kremlin spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that the doctors are pleased by the fact that
the President has refused from being taken to hospital and has
gone home... Naturally, the medics always take extra precautions.
But that is also the nature of the President," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin started to "feel poorly" Thursday morning after a
session of the state Security Council that lasted about two hours
in the Kremlin. He felt worse Thursday afternoon. Later doctors of
the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital diagnosed Yeltsin's condition
as a "viral infection accompanied by acute bronchitis."

<HEADLINE> UNEP Urges Linkages Between Environment and Trade Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Environment Program UNEP) on Friday called for a more coherent and
integrated approach to trade and environment policy-making.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the Third World Trade Organization ministerial meeting
to be held in Seattle from November 30 to December 3, 1999, UNEP
Executive Director Klaus Toepfer said such an approach would
maximize the environmental benefits of trade, which is a necessary
step towards achieving the goal of sustainable development
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"With ever-increasing environmental threats such as land
degradation and global warming, growing world poverty and other
challenges linked to globalization, the need to ensure that both
trade and environmental policies are mutually supportive is more
pressing today than ever before," said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
"Either trade liberalization should be viewed not as an aim in
itself, but as another tool by which we can achieve sustainable
development. Trade liberalization should be used to maximize
environmental objectives and promote the achievement of
sustainable development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is an opportunity for the international community to
promote and strengthen the linkage between trade and environment
policy," Toepfer added
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, governments are expected to launch the next round
of global trade talks, and also to decide on the scope and extent
to which environmental considerations will be incorporated in
those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
For many delegates and observers, the environmental implication
of further trade liberalization is the most critical issue to be
addressed in the current environment and development debate.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Denies Link Between Yeltsin's Illness, Union Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin Friday
categorically denied the rumors spread by the media that the
sudden ailment of Russian President Boris Yeltsin has some "
special links" with the signing of the Russian-Belarussian Union
Treaty scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some media linked the illness to Yeltsin's alleged wish to
avoid signing the union treaty.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin sharply
disagreed to such tone of Russian and Western mass media reports
regarding the president's sickness.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "is not suffering from a diplomatic illness but from a
genuine cold," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said that during their Friday morning conversation,
Yeltsin sounded "hoarse."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the NTV channel, Yakushkin denied Western
press allegations that Yeltsin wanted to remain in the shadows to
propel Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to the forefront of action.
Yeltsin "will retreat into the shadows from an active political
arena only after a new president is elected in Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "continues to highly assess" Putin's work as prime
minister, stressed the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Belarus minister said late Friday that
statements by some Russian officials suggest that Yeltsin's
reported illness was not the true reason for putting off the union
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin felt ill just when "everything was ready for signing
the treaty to create a union state," said Belarussian Deputy Prime
Minister Leonid Kozik, cited by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
"A fair question arises: if it was an ordinary cold and Yeltsin
is using usual popular remedies, why then didn't the Russian
president himself call the Belarussian president and explain the
situation, why didn't he talk to Alexander Grigoryevich (
Lukashenko) and why didn't they set a concrete date for a session
of the Union Supreme Council and the signing ceremony for the
treaty?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need objective information, primarily from official sources,
from the top officials in the Russian government. We need this to
assess the situation and make an appropriate, correct decision,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"A concrete signing date must be set, it must be made clear...
whether there are any questions about the treaty text or any other
problems that need to be dealt with immediately," Kozik stressed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urges Zambia to Cooperate on Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Mines, Environment
and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo on Friday urged Zimbabwe and
Zambia to jointly utilize wildlife resources.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern border town of Kariba at the signing
ceremony of the protocol on joint management of the fisheries of
Lake Kariba and the trans-boundary waters of the Zambezi River,
Moyo said the protocol should be extended to other wildlife
resources.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to urge our two countries that the management
arrangement we are signing today should be extended to other
wildlife resources that freely move across our common border," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As neighbors we need to put up management mechanisms which
will ensure that these common shared resources, the Zambezi River
and Lake Kariba, will continue to be conserved and offer benefits
to our citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the protocol would facilitate the establishment of a
Joint Fisheries Management Committee to enhance the conservation
and sustainable utilization of aquatic resources.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Lake Kariba produces about 23,000 tons of
Kapenta annually and about 3,000 tons of other fish species,
contributing about 650 million Zimbabwean dollars (17 million U.S.
dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was attended by officials from the Zambian
 Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Ministry, Norwegian Embassy and
wildlife management organizations from both countries.

<HEADLINE> Abul Alaa Hails Chinese-Palestinian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council Abul Alaa expressed his confidence that the
scheduled visit by Chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress Li Peng will help promote and enhance
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese newsmen at the premises of the
legislative council in Ramalla, on the eve of Li Peng's visit due
to start November 27, Abul Alaa added that relations between
Palestine and China are "age-old relations which we highly esteem
and appreciate."
</P>
<P>
Abul Alaa said China is the first country to announce its
support of the Palestine cause following the outbreak of the
Palestinian revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people are thus grateful to China and its
support of the Palestine cause," he said, asserting that "China's
stance has remained firm until the present day."
</P>
<P>
Abul Alaa said the Chinese government and people over the past
decades supported the Palestinian people's struggle for legitimate
national rights, extending to them valuable material support such
as military and administrative training and arms supplies.
</P>
<P>
Abul Alaa went on to say that China has never interfered in the
internal affairs of Palestine, not once, but has always maintained
a firm stance whether in bilateral relations or at the
international level.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his last visit to China during which he went to
Beijing and Shanghai, Abul Alaa said "the Palestinian people are
delighted with China's great achievements in the economic, social,
technological and defense fields, under the banners of reform and
openness."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that these achievements have placed China among
the first ranking countries of the world. He expressed his
pleasure with China's recent success in launching a space ship.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that the Palestinian people will happily
welcome Li Peng whom he described as a highly placed guest and
friend of the Palestinian leadership and people, adding that the
Palestinian people are looking forward to this visit with great
love and respect.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the first visit to Palestine by the head of
the Chinese legislative power will constitute an important
contribution in the development and boosting of bilateral cordial
relations, adding that he will openly discuss with Li Peng and his
accompanying delegation the basic issues of bilateral interest in
all fields as well as the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abul Alaa revealed that the Palestinian side will suggest the
formation of a friendship committee of the two parliaments as part
of the efforts to enhance bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng is the topmost Chinese personality to visit Palestinian
territories. He will meet with the Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority at the presidential seat in Ramalla and other
senior Palestinian officials. He will also address the Palestinian
National Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Cooperation Council: Background </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The 20th annual summit of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is to be held in the Saudi capital
of Riyadh on November 27-29. The following are some background
information of the regional economic and political alliance.
</P>
<P>
The GCC was formally established on May 25, 1981, when heads
of state of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates signed the Charter of the GCC in the UAE
capital Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the GCC, as stated in the Charter, are
to effect coordination, integration and interconnection between
member states in all fields in order to achieve unity between
them and to strengthen relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council, the GCC's highest authority, is composed
of the heads of member states. Its presidency is rotated
annually on the basis of the alphabetical order of names of
member states.
</P>
<P>
The Council meets annually, and in an extraordinary session if
requested by any member and seconded by another member.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council meeting, or the GCC summit, is held
in November or December every year in the capitals of member
states in a rotating order.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions are passed on the basis of unanimity for
substantive matters.
</P>
<P>
Omani Sultan Qabus bin Said is currently holding the
presidency of the Council.
</P>
<P>
The Advisory Commission for the Supreme Council, established
in 1998, is a 30-member body with seats equally distributed
among the six member states. It provides advice on any
subjects referred to it by the Supreme Council.
</P>
<P>
The GCC's Ministerial Council, composed of foreign ministers
or such other ministers of the member states, proposes policies
and prepares recommendations and studies aimed at developing
cooperation between member states.
</P>
<P>
The council meets every three months, and an extraordinary
session is held if requested by any member state.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat-General is headed by the Secretary-General, who
is appointed by the Supreme Council for a three-year term,
renewable only once.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Secretary-General is Saudi Arabia's Jameel
al-Hujailan, who took office in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the GCC, a Unified Economic
Agreement was signed in November 1981 and ratified in 1982
with the aim to achieving free trade among member states and
to implementing a common external tariff and trade policy.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Investment Corporation was set up in 1984, with
an authorized capital of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars, to
consolidate economic activities among member states in agriculture,
commerce, industry, mining, and general investment.
</P>
<P>
The GCC Commercial Arbitration Center was created in December
1993 to settle trade disputes between GCC citizens with each
other, and between them and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The six states have been trying since 1983 to unify their
customs duties, which now vary between 4 and 20 percent. They
have set March 1, 2001 as the target date for a customs union,
aimed eventually at establishing a Gulf common market with annual
imports of more than 50 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The six Gulf Arab states are in joint possession of
nearly 45 percent of the world's oil deposits and 15 percent
of its natural gas reserves.

<HEADLINE> North Ireland Unionists Vote for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionists meeting in
Belfast on Saturday backed a formula to revive Northern Ireland's
ailing peace agreement by a vote of 480 to 349, a party spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The 858 delegates to the party's ruling council assembled in
Belfast's Waterfront Hall to decide if they would back party
leader David Trimble over the deal, which was brokered by former
United States Senator George Mitchell, on devolution and
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said Northern Ireland could have confidence in the
Unionist delegates. Speaking to the BBC, the Ulster Unionist
Deputy Leader John Taylor also confirmed that he would support
Trimble.
</P>
<P>
Trimble called for the council to take "courage in their hands"
and vote in favor of the plan, which was mediated in the face of
deadlock over the Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I am content to leave these matters to the good sense and
judgment of the delegates of the Ulster Unionist council," Trimble
said before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The choice for us is simple. Do we want devolution and
decommissioning? If we do, this is the only way to get it. If we
say no there will be no decommissioning and no Stormont government;
all the gains we have secured for unionism in the agreement will
be lost and the pain that we endured will have been for nothing,"
Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
The plan involves setting up the delayed power-sharing
government, followed the same day by a statement from the Irish
Republic Army on decommissioning. If the proposal is passed,
unionists and nationalists could be sitting together in an
assembly for the first time in a generation.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly with Trimble's win, an Executive would be quickly
named. It would consist of two Sinn Fein members, three Ulster
Unionists, three from the moderate Catholic SDLP and two from Ian
Paisley's hardline Protestant Democratic Unionists. Britain would
then devolve powers from London to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Final approval for the devolution however may not be given
until February once the Irish Republican Army has started to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
If Trimble had lost the vote, political experts here predicted
that it could have split the party and ended his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said the province
faced the prospect of ending direct rule and putting "30 years of
failed politics" into the past.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Build France-Designed Agosta 90-B Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will be able to
indigenously build the Agosta 90-B submarine by 2003 as France
transfers complete technology by the next year, a navy official
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have already started the campaign to book orders for the
state-of-art submarine and expect to earn much wanted foreign
exchange for the national exchequer," the official was quoted by
the News Network International (NNI), a local private press
agency, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first such submarine Pakistan ordered, built in France, is
already on its way to Pakistan. "The first Agosta 90-B is
hopefully arriving in Karachi by the middle of December," he said.
</P>
<P>
France, under an agreement signed in 1991, was supposed to
transfer the technology of the advanced submarine to Pakistan by
1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctions imposed by Western countries following
Pakistan's nuclear tests last year resulted in a delay in the
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
"The work for the construction of the second Agosta 90-B
submarine has already been started at Karachi Dockyard and in
France as well," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan navy is the third navy in the region after India
and Iran to have the advanced submarine. However, Pakistan will be
the first country in the region to be able to manufacture the
submarine indigenously, NNI said.

<HEADLINE> Severe Cold Hits Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A fierce snowstorm and bitter
cold hit Ukraine, resulting in a serious power shortage and
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
The temperature in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, dropped Friday
night to minus 17.6 degrees celsius, following a heavy snowstorm
on November 25.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists called the severe cold in the country a
phenomenon unseen for some 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The snowstorm led to power outages to more than 3,000
residential districts nationwide. Municipal traffic was also
severely effected due to the abominable conditions, with trains
being canceled.
</P>
<P>
For two days after the storm, the Ukrainian government made
efforts to restore normal activity to the city. Most residential
districts have had their power restored.
</P>
<P>
The heavy snowstorm, which also caused enormous economic damage,
influenced by strong cold air from the south of Ukraine, according
to local newspapers, resulted in temperatures 10 degrees celsius
lower than in the past. The weather began to improve Friday, but
experts say it could be only a temporary respite.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snowfalls continue throughout Europe, causing great
inconvenience and damage to the region.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Decide on Cabinet Revamp Before New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday he may decide whether to make changes in his
cabinet a week before New Year after an audit on the performances
of cabinet members and other high ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a radio program that he expects more than 100
government officials to submit their courtesy resignations,
including Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in her concurrent
capacity as social welfare secretary.
</P>
<P>
If he decides to let go of some of these officials, the
president said, he will simultaneously announce their replacement
to ensure that there will be no disruption in the delivery of
public service.
</P>
<P>
"I'll act it most probably before December ends. Maybe one week
before New Year," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has said the yearly audit of the performance on his
cabinet will give him the opportunity to build a government team
that is responsive to the needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also made it clear that his assessment of the cabinet's
performance will be solely based on their accomplishments and not
on their popularity rating.
</P>
<P>
He also asked cabinet members to submit their performance
reports by November 30, giving him about a month to review what
their agencies have done in fleshing out his administration's
commitment to give the poor a better deal in life.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mourn Revolutionary Martyrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 27 (Xinhua)-- Some 10,000 people gathered
in Chongqing Municipality in southwest China to mourn some 300
martyrs who were massacred by the Kuomintang some 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The martyrs include Communist Party members, students and young
infants less than a year old.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that this is one of the most atrocious massacres
of the 20th century. The life of these martyrs was made into a
novel by Luo Guangbin (1924-1967) entitled "The Red Crag". In 1948
Luo was arrested by KMT forces and thrown into prison. In November
1949, Luo escaped from prison one month before the "Red Crag"
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Amidst a morning drizzle, the Chongqing Municipality government
held a solemn ceremony to pay its respect to the martyrs. Those
attending the ceremony included several hundred primary school
students and relatives of the martyrs.
</P>
<P>
The government also unveiled a set of books and VCDs as well as
an exhibition on the heroic deeds of the "Red Crag" Martyrs.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Denies Intimidating Opposition Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Namibian electoral
commission Saturday dismissed complaints that the ruling party was
intimidating opposition groups as the country's elections
scheduled for next week come near.
</P>
<P>
Electoral Commission spokesman Peter Mietzner disclosed three
letters of complaints are being investigated, but he said
accusations of foul play are totally not true.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the election will be free and fair," Mietzner said.
</P>
<P>
Rowdy supporters of the ruling South West African People's
Organization (SWAPO) broke up a rally organized by the opposition
Congress of Democracy (COD) on Thursday in the coastal city of
Swakopmund. Cars were stoned and three policemen were injured.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, COD officials arrived at their Windhoek offices to
find the party posters ripped up and smeared with blood.
</P>
<P>
The party charges that SWAPO members have prevented it from
holding rallies in northern Namibia, a stronghold of President Sam
Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
COD's spokesman Elizabeth Amukugo has publicly complained about
the intimidation.
</P>
<P>
About 850,000 Namibians have been registered to vote on Tuesday
and Wednesday next week.
</P>
<P>
SWAPO, which led the 23-year struggle for independence from
South Africa in 1989, is expected to keep its grip on Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, 70, is campaigning for a third term after the
constitution was changed to lift a two-term limitation.
</P>
<P>
SWAPO could, however, lose its two-thirds majority in
Parliament, with widespread criticism of Namibia's costly military
involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an
unemployment of 40 percent, persistent poverty and a lack of basic
services for large population groups.
</P>
<P>
COD was formed earlier this year by Ben Ulenga, Nujoma's former
 confidante and former ambassador to the United Kingdom. He quit
SWAPO over Nujoma's commitment of troops to back Congolese
President Laurent Kabila against rebel insurgents, and over the
lifting of the two-term limit for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Another six opposition parties are also contesting the poll,
but only the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance - the current official
opposition in the 72-seat Parliament - is expected to make a
significant showing.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid said here Saturday that
friendly cooperation between the two countries is conducive to the
stability and development of Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, Zhu told Wahid that China appreciates both
the president's long pursuit of a positive stand towards
developing ties with China, and his choosing of China as the first
country for his official visit since his assumption of office last
month.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Wahid, Indonesia is seeing its
situation turning normal gradually. China positively appraises his
pursuit of a national reconciliatory policy, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China is ready, to the best of its ability, to provide
assistance for Indonesia's economic recovery and development, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said Indonesia deeply respects China and wants to
establish a very friendly bilateral relationship of cooperation,
adding that his forthcoming state visit to China will surely
strengthen the ties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Indonesian Chinese should enjoy equal
rights with other ethnic groups in Indonesia, and all the peoples
there shall make joint and concerted efforts in building a
brighter future.
</P>
<P>
The president also congratulated China on the latest progress
it has made in its efforts to gain entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).

cooperation, in the economic and trade area in particular. He
expressed the hope that the gathering will be devoted to regional
unity and cooperation, instead of highlighting some points of
dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>

prison term and a cash fine of 12 million rials (about 4,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Department of Tehran province announced on
Saturday that Mashaallah Shamsolvaezin of Neshat (Joy) was
convicted on charges of forgery, use of forged document and

for publishing the two sacrilegious articles.
</P>
<P>
Shamsolvaezin was brought to an open trial by a local court on
November 8. He was the first Iranian editor who was put on trial
for press offenses.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian laws, only newspapers' managing directors
are responsible for any press offenses.
</P>
<P>
During court hearings, Shamsolvaezin rejected the competence of
the court and refused to answer any questions, saying that his
case should be investigated by the press court with the presence

Mohammad Khatami, was closed down on September 5 on "charges of
disrespect for Islamic Sanctities and the status of supreme

co-founder of the opposition Iran Liberation Movement to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to distance himself from
the conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Labor, Alliance to Form New Zealand Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, the major
opposition party in New Zealand, and its ally Alliance are able to
form a center-left coalition government, according to the results
of Saturday's general election.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the Labor Party led by Helen Clark got a 38.9
percent share of the nationwide party vote, well ahead of its
rival the National Party headed by the incumbent Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley, which had only 30.7 percent of the party vote.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance with Jim Anderton as its leader gained a 7.9
percent share of the nationwide party vote.
</P>
<P>
Since the last general election, New Zealand has adopted the
Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system, under which each
party's share of the total number of MPs is decided by its share
of the nationwide party vote. Even if a party doesn't win any
electorate seats, it will gain seats in Parliament if it wins at
least five percent of the nationwide party vote.
</P>
<P>
The votes the Labor Party and the Alliance won plus the votes
they got from the minor parties with less than five percent of the
nationwide party vote are enough for them to hold 63 seats in the
120-seat parliament. They are able to form a coalition government
even without support from other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Because of the victory the Labor Party won in the election, its
Leader Helen Clark will be the prime minister of the new New
Zealand Government.

<HEADLINE> Western Areas To Become China's New Economic Powerhouse (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The vast western areas are
expecting an influx of government funds and overseas capital in
the coming years as China takes "bolder steps" to spur the
landlocked region's development.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, says that China will take actions as bold as
those in establishing its special economic zones when it comes to
the accelerated development of those areas.
</P>
<P>
The region will gradually become China's new economic
powerhouse, economists here say. "It's only a matter of time."
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have their minds set on turning the resources-
rich areas into prosperous economic zones in the next century.
President Jiang Zemin said earlier this year "the development of
the western region must be carried out in a daring and resolute
manner."
</P>
<P>
The western region involves 10 provinces and autonomous regions
(including Chongqing Municipality), covering some 56 percent of
China's territory and accounting for 50 percent of verified
deposits of minerals.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed remarkable economic achievements since
initiating the reform and opening-up policy in 1979. However, its
western region has not enjoyed the same degree of prosperity as
her eastern counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts say that if the central and western regions
do not catch up with regions in the east, China's goal of becoming
a medium-level developed nation by mid next century will not be
fully realized.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, top Chinese leaders have paid frequent
visits to various western provinces and regions to study the
economic situation and advise on regional development.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources disclose that various departments under the
State Council have started formulating policies and plans for the
development of the western region.
</P>
<P>
With regard to capital, policies and state-funded projects, the
central government will surely give preferential treatment to the
western region, the sources say. "The government will also adopt a
series of incentives to attract both domestic and overseas
investment and talents."
</P>
<P>
The State Taxation Administration is said to be working out new
tax incentives for overseas-funded enterprises in China's western

<P>
Minister Zeng says China will speed up construction of highways,
railways, airports and water conservancy projects to facelift the
region's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
As China enters a new period of building the socialist market
economy, the western region faces fiercer market competition than
during the early stages of reform and opening up in the late 1970s
and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Officials and people there should first broaden their minds
and fully embrace the notion of economic reform," some experts
suggest.
</P>
<P>
Other experts believe that the stable social and economic
situation in China today has created favorable conditions and
provides ample opportunities for the region to boost its
development.
</P>
<P>
Local officials in the region have invited economists and other
experts to help them to work out regional development plans.
</P>
<P>
"The next ten years are crucial to the economic development of
Shaanxi. The province hopes to spearhead the drive for economic
reforms," said Li Jianguo, Party secretary of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say once the western region takes off, China's
economic strength will surely take a remarkable leap.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Abides by U.N. Resolution on Taliban: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Adbul Sattar Saturday said his country has been acting in
conformity with the U.N. Security Council resolution on sanctions
against Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview by Xinhua, the foreign minister said
that the Taliban have no capital in Pakistan, nor there is an
airline service between the two countries at present.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are one or two franchises of certain Afghan
banks, but they have only very limited activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In essence, we are abiding by the Security Council
resolution," Abdul Sattar observed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions have been imposed on Afghanistan since
November 14 according to a Security Council resolution, which
obliged all U.N. members to freeze Taliban capitals and ban Afghan
planes' access, in a bid to press the militia to hand over the
alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial.
</P>
<P>
"According to Article 25 of the U.N. Charter, Pakistan will
carry out the U.N. Security Council resolution," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul Sattar once again expressed his concern over
the possible consequences of the sanctions. He said he feared a
further influx of Afghan refugees into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions on Afghanistan may cause food shortages and more
exodus of refugees among the Afghan people, he said, adding that
Pakistan has borne the heavy burden of maintaining and supplying
two million Afghan refugees in its territory for years.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has expressed its concern over the developments in
Afghanistan after the imposition of sanctions, and hope this
concern to be taken into account by other countries, especially by
members of the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's policy towards Afghanistan, the foreign minister
said his government will continue to help achieve "reconciliation
and understanding among the leaders of Afghan groups in different
parts" of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government has long pursued the policy of
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan
and non-interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He called on "all neighbors and friends" of Afghanistan to use
their influence to help terminate the turmoil in that country and
set up a broader-based government there.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is among the three countries which have recognized the
Taliban as a legal ruler of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf, who came
to power after a successful coup on October 12, said in his policy
statement last month that Pakistan wanted to see a "truly
broad-based government" in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian contract review panel
has proposed to cancel 1,684 contracts awarded by former military
administration between January 1 and May 28 this year, a major
Nigerian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which was set up immediately after the inauguration
of President Olusegun Obasanjo and his government on May 29, is
empowered to re-examine the contracts approved by former military
regimes.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express said that the contracts on the list of
recommendation are estimated to be of 106.59 billion naira (1.12
billion U.S. dollars) in value.
</P>
<P>
The panel also recommended Obasanjo to cancel 755 of the 786
national awards given out to individuals at the tail end of the
Abdulsalami Abubakar administration, which took office last June.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo ordered in June this year the re-examination of all
the contracts, awards, and appointments given by former military
regimes, including those given during his own tenure from February
1976 to October 1979, as part of his anti-corruption campaign.

<HEADLINE> Workers Pour Record Amount of Concrete at Three Gorges Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers have now
poured 3.34 million cu m of concrete at the Three Gorges Project
being constructed at the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
This was accomplished in ten months and is being hailed as a
new world record. This work has laid a solid foundation ensuring
that the first group of hydropower generators will come on line in
2003 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the project has entered a three-year period
of intense concrete pouring, during which about four million cu m
of concrete will be poured annually.
</P>
<P>
At present, the overall dam section has been built to a height
of 85.9 meters and the power generating dam section has reached a
height of 129.5 meters, forming a rough outline of the gigantic
dam.
</P>
<P>
Concrete is needed for the permanent ship lock, the riverbed
dam, and the power plants on the left bank of the Yangtze, and the
total amount of concrete necessary for the main works of the Three
Gorges Project is well over 27 million cu m, the largest of its
kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic Three Gorges Project is being built in three
stages, and will cost well over 203.9 billion yuan. When completed,
it will be capable of generating 84.7 billion kwh of electricity a
year.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the dam began in 1993, and the second phase of
construction was inaugurated by the successful damming of the main
stream of the Yangtze in November 1997. During the second phase,
which will end in 2003, the first generating units will be made
ready and the permanent ship lock will also be readied for traffic.

<HEADLINE> Interview: National Consensus on CTBT A Necessity: Pakistan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar said Saturday that his country will seek a national
consensus on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) before
signing it.
</P>
<P>
During an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Sattar said the
Pakistani people are very sensitive to "the issues that concern
the future security of Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"The Pakistani people look upon the nuclear capability as a
guarantee of Pakistan's future security," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have been studying the treaty with great care, and we will
also try to persuade our people to study and understand it," said
Sattar.
</P>
<P>
He said it is very important that there is no misunderstanding
in Pakistan that "signing the CTBT will in any matter expose
Pakistan to insecurity."
</P>
<P>
"That is why we want to discuss and debate the treaty in great
depth in our country. Once we achieve that consensus, then we will
be ready to take the next step," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan regards the CTBT as "a good treaty" and
voted in favor of it in 1996 at the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We were then willing to sign it, but the only problem was that
we noticed India's opposition, and we suspected that India would
conduct (nuclear) tests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh is reported to have said
during his recent visit to Tokyo that India would sign the CTBT no
matter whether Pakistan will sign it or not.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this, Sattar said he did not know whether India
had made such a decision. "We will welcome if India has made such
a decision."
</P>
<P>
If so, "then there will be no reason for us to delay signing
the CTBT," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the new government's foreign policy, Sattar said that "our
foreign policy will be featured by continuity."
</P>
<P>
"The change of government took place in the context of our
internal affairs, and the main policies on foreign affairs remain
unaffected," Sattar said.
</P>
<P>
Sattar, who had been Pakistan's high commissioner to India for
two terms, was inducted into the cabinet of Pakistan after the
army dismissed the former government led by Nawaz Sharif on
October 12.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon India's response to Pakistan's offer for
meaningful bilateral dialogue, the foreign minister regretted that
India has so far failed to reciprocate Pakistan's sincerity to
promote the dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "Pakistan will follow a policy of peace and
patience."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Pakistan wants dialogue with India to solve
all outstanding issues between the two neighbors on the basis of
international principles and treaties.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Labor Party
Leader Helen Clark said Saturday she does not think "the best
values have guided New Zealand in the 1990s" when the National
Party has been the ruling party, and that she wants to "change
that."
</P>
<P>
Speaking from her home in Auckland, the largest city of New
Zealand, Clark said: "There is still a lot of votes to be counted
but it is clear there is going to be a new government in New
Zealand."
</P>
<P>
The result "clearly indicates New Zealanders want a change of
direction," said Clark, now the prime minister-elect.
</P>
<P>
"I stand before you humbled that our party has again been
chosen to lead a fresh start for New Zealand," she said.
</P>
<P>
Clark said she would start building a new government from
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said she will meet with Jim Anderton, leader of the
Alliance, a potential coalition partner, Sunday to start the
process of forming a new government.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Relics Auction Yields Ten Million Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A large number of cultural
relics and artworks were auctioned here Wednesday, bringing in ten
million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) in total transactions.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 highly-collectible cultural relics were put on
the auction block in the Tianjin Friendship Hotel by the Tianjin
International Auction Co. Fifty-eight percent of the items up for
bid were sold.
</P>
<P>
A pair of pink bowls with lids made in an official kiln from
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) sold for 80,000 yuan (more than 9,000
U.S. dollars) after heavy bidding hiked the price over the opening
bid of 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another official-kiln-made basin dating back to the Song
Dynasty (960-1127) was bought for a remarkable price of 1.15
million yuan (over 130,000 dollars) by an anonymous Chinese buyer.
</P>
<P>
A charitable auction of 802 rare silver coins from the Qing
Dynasty, discovered during a renovation project on old buildings
in the city, was also held Wednesday. The highest price paid for a
single coin was 4,000 yuan (nearly 500 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sales from the coin auction will be donated to Project Hope, a
national educational campaign which provides financial aid to
rural areas in China, according to the organizer.
</P>
<P>
The coins were unearthed in the 80-year-old courtyard of Meng
Luochuan, who is the 69th generation grandson of Mencius (372 B.C.-
289 B.C.), China's well known philosopher, politician and
academician during the Warring States Period (403 B.C.-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Chinese and overseas artworks collectors were noticeably more
active in this Tianjin Auction Fair, the last one to be held in
this century.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A dozen naval vessels and two
helicopters arrived Friday and Saturday to help the 6,000 rescue
workers in scouring rough seas and shorelines for survivors of the
"Dashun" ship that caught fire and capsized off the eastern
Chinese port of Yantai late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that another rescue ship from the Shanghai Branch
of the Ministry of Communications has been sent.
</P>
<P>
During four days of rescue work, a flotilla of vessels and more
than 600 local military police and naval personnel have been
mobilized to carry out rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people from coastal villages searched a 28-mile
(45-kilometer) stretch of coastline for survivors despite sub zero
temperatures and high waves.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 doctors and nurses from five local hospitals arrived
at the scene in less than ten minutes after being told of the
disaster. Survivors are being taken very good care of at local
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government of Shandong has organized a special
group to direct the rescue work along with assistance from the
North Sea fleet and the military forces from the nearby city of
Jinan.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's top governing body, also sent an
investigation panel led by Shi Wanpeng, deputy minister of the
State Economic and Trade Commission, to direct and supervise
rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
With 262 passengers and 40 crew members on aboard, the "Dashun"
ship of the Yantai Yanda Automobile Ferry Company caught fire on
Wednesday afternoon and sank at about midnight Wednesday. It has
been confirmed that 22 people have been rescued alive so far.

CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A powerful earthquake,
measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, struck the south Pacific
nation of Vanuatu Saturday, killing at least six people,
Australian media reports said.

A Vanuatu Disaster Management Office spokesman was quoted as

fiscal year (April-October), according to the Society of Indian
Automobile Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In October, passenger car sales grew at even more robust rate
at 66.04 percent over the same month of last year, mainly thanks

their robust sales growth at 31.62 percent and 23.90 percent,

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Cleric Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Abdollah Nouri, a famous
Iranian reformist cleric and newspaper director, was sentenced by
the Special Cleric Court to five years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a close ally of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
was managing director of the Persian-language daily Khordad before
he was indicted. He was removed from the post as interior minister
in an Majlis impeachment in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was also sentenced to five years of dismissal from his
post as the managing director of the daily, with a cash fine of 15
million rials (5,000 U.S. dollars), the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted head of the public relations office of his
newspaper, Fariba Davoodi, as saying that according to the verdict
on Nouri, Khordad would be closed.
</P>
<P>
Khordad's Editor-in-Chief Ali Kekmat said that Nouri would be
transferred to prison on Saturday, given that the bail was not
accepted in his case and the verdict is final and unappealable.
</P>
<P>
On November 11, the conservative Special Clerical Court
announced that Nouri, the former interior minister of Khatami's
cabinet, was found guilty on 15 counts of charges.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was accused of publishing anti-religious materials and
sacrilegious articles, insulting Iran's late supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and opposing his views and opinions,
disseminating false ideas aimed at disturbing public opinion and
harming others, misinformation about the country's system, and
insulting the system's officials and related organs.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Nouri was believed here to be a move by the
powerful conservatives aimed at disqualifying him from running in

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- About 40 billion shillings
(about 532 million U. S. dollars) is required for the
rehabilitation of 43 percent of Kenya's roads, Kenyan Minister for
Roads and Public Works Andrew Kiptoon has said.
</P>
<P>
Kiptoon was quoted by Saturday's East African Standard daily as
saying that over the past 10 to 15 years the government has
under-invested in roads due to lack of sufficient funds.
</P>
<P>
He said about eight billion shillings (about 106 million U.S.
dollars) is required annually to maintain the classified roads.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's road network is about 150,600 kilometers in length, out
 of which 64,000 kilometers are classified, said Kiptoon.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is responsible only for the classified roads,
while the Kenya Wildlife Service and other departments are in
charge of the unclassified ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the problems that have contributed to the poor
state of roads are poor workmanship by contractors, corruption and
ineptitude by the ministry staff.
</P>
<P>
Kiptoon also pledged that his ministry will ensure transparency
in the use of Roads Maintenance Levy Fund.

LAGOS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
imposed a dust-to-dawn curfew on Kosofe council area, outskirts of
Lagos, following the continued violence at the Mile 12 market
where a communal clash erupted Thursday with 27 people killed.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu, who returned from an overseas
trip Friday evening, said he was disturbed at the magnitude of the
violence which claimed so many lives, The Guardian newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The police has been placed on red alert throughout the state to
prevent the spread of violent clashes in other parts of the state,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tinubu also announced an emergency meeting of the market
leaders and all interest groups in the market scheduled for
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Downplays Israeli Fears on Regional Armament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has downplayed Israeli fears on the increasing armament of
some Middle East countries, including Egypt, Al-Ahram newspaper
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's fears over a possible arms race in the region do not
affect Egypt's plans to buy advanced weapons for its armed forces,
Moussa said Friday in an interview with the newspaper, which
usually reflects the thinking of the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
Egypt reached agreements with the United States in March and
July on purchase of 4.1 billion U.S. dollars worth of advanced
weapons, including jet fighters, tanks, an anti-missile battery,
radar systems and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The deals have triggered fears and criticism in Israel over
Egypt's intention against the backdrop that the Middle East peace
process is revived.
</P>
<P>
"The Jewish state is not in a position to criticize the
armament of other countries because it is stockpiling weapons of
mass destruction," Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel's failure to address the question of weapons of mass
destruction waters down its remarks on the armament of Egypt and
Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has test-fired medium-range missiles, a step which Israel
said will threaten its security and destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel neither confirms or denies that it has developed nuclear
weapons. But the Arab countries, almost certain that Israel has
gone nuclear, were outraged by Israel's refusal to join the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to allow international
inspection and verification of its nuclear schemes.

<HEADLINE> Pak Abides by UN Resolution on Taliban: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Adbul Sattar Saturday said his country has been acting in
conformity with the U.N. Security Council resolution on sanctions
against Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview by Xinhua, the foreign minister said
that the Taliban has no capital in Pakistan, nor there is airline
service between the two countries at present.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are one or two franchises of certain Afghan
banks, but they have only very limited activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In essence, we are abiding by the Security Council
resolution," Abdul Sattar observed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions have been imposed on Afghanistan since
November 14 according to a Security Council resolution, which
obliged all U.N. members to freeze Taliban capitals and ban Afghan
planes' access, in a bid to press the militia to hand over the
alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial.
</P>
<P>
"According to Article 25 of the U.N. Charter, Pakistan will
carry out the U.N. Security Council resolution," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul Sattar once again expressed his concern over
the possible consequences of the sanctions. He said he feared
further influx of Afghan refugees into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions on Afghanistan may cause food shortage and more
exodus of refugees among the Afghan people, he said, adding that
Pakistan has borne the heavy burden of maintaining and supplying
two million Afghan refugees in its territory for years.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has expressed its concern over the developments in
Afghanistan after the imposition of sanctions, and hope this
concern to be taken into account by other countries, especially by
members of the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's policy towards Afghanistan, the foreign minister
said his government will continue to help achieve "reconciliation
and understanding among the leaders of Afghan groups in different
parts" of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government has long pursued the policy of
respect for sovereignty and territory integrity of Afghanistan and
non-interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He called on "all neighbors and friends" of Afghanistan to use
their influence to help terminate the turmoil in that country and
set up an broader-based government there.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is among the three countries which have recognized the
Taliban, which controls more than 80 percent of the Afghan
territory and is the legal ruler of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf, who came
to power after a successful coup on October 12, said in his policy
statement last month that Pakistan wanted to see a "truly
broad-based government" in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Qurei: Palestinians to Push Peace Process Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (West Bank), November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East
peace process has entered into a crucial stage and Palestinian
leadership and people will firmly push it forward if there is a
little chance of realizing peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qurei, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC), said this here Saturday while addressing a special PLC
session held in honor of Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Qurei expressed his warm welcome to Li's visit to the
Palestinian territories, saying that the visit will no doubt add
more momentum to further strengthening the friendship between the
two peoples who are striving for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Peace is the strategic choice of the Palestinian people, and
the Palestinians and Israelis have at last began the final-status
talks to solve the remaining issues between the two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the final-status talks should be the end of
occupation of the Palestinian territories including Jerusalem (by
Israel) since 1967, the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, the recognition
of our people's national rights, allowance of the return of the
Palestinian refugees to their homeland and compensation (by
Israel) for their loses and the hardships the refugees suffered
during the past 50 years," Qurei reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The PLC speaker criticized Israel for its occupation policy
and called upon the international community and peace loving
countries the world over to help move the peace process ahead.
</P>
<P>
Recalling what has been achieved during the last five-year
interim period, Qurei said that all state and local governing
bodies have been set up in the territories, while legislative and
legal institutions have been formed and economic reconstruction
has been going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Qurei expressed his thanks to China for supporting the just
cause of the Palestinian people and the efforts China has made in
helping solve the Middle East problem.
</P>
<P>
As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. security
Council, China has been playing a very important role in handling
the world affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that inside all bodies of the United Nations, China
particularly made remarkable contribution to the adoption of
relevant resolutions on the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people will never forget that during the past
50 years, China, as always, maintained her principled stand,
supported our people's just cause of realizing liberation,
independence and national rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Saturday morning from Israel for a short
visit. He held talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat before
attending the special session.

PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The French film ``Humanite''
which won this year's Grand Prize of Jury at the Cannes
International Film Festival has been greatly censored in Italy
when it came out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The French film producer Bruno Dumont has lodged a protest

Dumont told local press that the film which came out in Italy
has been so badly censored that it ``is no more mine.''
</P>
<P>
The Italian film censorship authorities cut a bloody scenery
showing the body of a teenager girl raped and killed and a scene
showing the sexual depression of a policeman investigating the
case.
</P>
<P>
``Humanite'' is a crime story about the brutal assassination
of a teenager girl in a small French town.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Promoting Sino-Philippine Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said here Saturday that there is a great potential for
mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the Philippines,
thanks to their considerable economic complementarity.
</P>
<P>
Zhu unveiled a multi-point proposal on the bilateral economic
cooperation and trade at the luncheon hosted by the Philippine
business community in his honor, saying agricultural cooperation
is a new priority.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved remarkable results in agricultural
development, accumulating a lot of experience particularly in such
areas as seeds, farm machinery, water conservancy, fertilizers,
farm chemicals and agro-processing, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to bring out its best in helping the
Philippines with its agricultural development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the two countries should further tap the
potential of bilateral trade and promote a sound and balanced
development of their economic relations and trade.
</P>
<P>
Despite a steady growth of bilateral trade in the 1990s, he
said, the total Sino-Philippine trade volume is still not big,
comparing with China's trade with other Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier called for greater effort from both sides,
especially from the Philippine businessmen, to boost trade with
China.
</P>
<P>
He said that greater efforts should be made to increase the
two-way investment, adding that the scope of cooperation may cover
such fields as transportation, telecommunications, textile, energy
and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He told the Philippine businessmen that the two countries
should support and encourage friendly exchanges and cooperation
between enterprises, and the two governments should work together
in providing policy guidance in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"While encouraging our big enterprises to strengthen
cooperation, we should also bring into full play the initiative of
our private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises in
particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we will be able to effect continued,
all-round and in-depth development of our economic cooperation in
the new century," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu arrived here Friday on an official visit to the
Philippines before attending the 3rd informal summit between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan
and South Korea, and that between ASEAN and China, which are all
scheduled for Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (West Bank), November 27 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, China's
top legislator, said here Saturday that as long as all parties
concerned implement the relevant U.N. resolutions and follow the
principle of "land for peace," the peace in the Middle East can be
realized.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, made this remark while addressing the special
session of Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) held in his honor.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East issue, which is an important international
issue related to regional and world peace, is concerned by all, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the half-century-old Arab-Israeli conflict has not only
caused profound hardships to the Palestinian people, but also
hindered greatly the economic construction and development of the
whole Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, an early realization of the Middle East
peace is not only the urgent wish of all countries of the region,
but an urgent requirement of the present times.
</P>
<P>
If the parties concerned respect the history and face the
reality, a lasting peace can be achieved in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people highly appreciated the
strategic choice made by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
headed by President Yasser Arafat of solving the
Palestinian-Israeli dispute through negotiations, and do believe
that this objective can be realized if the parties concerned
conduct negotiations flexibly, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, as always, maintains an independent and peaceful foreign
policy and supports the principled stand of the Arab people,
their just cause and the peace process, and has made constant
efforts in pushing this process forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will, together with the parties concerned and the
international community, continue to make efforts to help solve
the Middle East issue with the Palestinian issue as its core and
help the Palestinian people realize their objective of achieving
lasting peace, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li also praised the achievements made by the Palestinian people
in their historical struggle for national independence, their
economic development and reconstruction in the territories, under
the leadership of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-Palestinian relations, established in 1964,
remain very friendly despite changes in the region and the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China values the friendly Sino-Palestinian relationship and is
wiling to further cooperation between the two sides in all fields
on the basis of mutual trust and mutual benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I reinterate to all of our friends present here, supporting
the just cause of the Palestinian people is the set policy jointly
adopted by the Chinese leaders of three generations, and the
Chinese people will always remain reliable friends to the
Palestinian people," Li said.
</P>
<P>
PLC Speaker Ahmet Qurei delivered his welcoming address earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, the major
opposition party in New Zealand, won the general election here
Saturday, though the final results of the general election have
not come out yet.
</P>
<P>
In the process of the vote counting, the Labor Party is well
ahead of its rival the National Party.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral
system, each party's share of the total number of MPs is decided
by its share of the nationwide party vote. Even if a party doesn't
win any electorate seats, it will gain seats in Parliament if it
wins at least five percent of the nationwide party vote.
</P>
<P>
It is sure that the votes the Labor Party is going to win plus
the votes it will get from the minor parties with less than five
percent of the nationwide party vote will still not enough for the
Labor Party to win more than half of all the parliamentary seats.
It will have to negotiate a coalition government with its allies.
</P>
<P>
Because of the victory the Labor Party won in the election, its
leader Helen Clark will be the prime minister of the new New
Zealand Government.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Calls for Political Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Justice
Shahabuddin Ahmed Saturday reiterated his call for consensus of
the political parties for removing the current "socio-political
unrest" which is hindering the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"By blaming each other our political leadership cannot increase
productivity," President shahabuddin Ahmed told a national seminar
on "Bangladesh in the 21st Century: Socio-Economic Perspectives"
organized by the Society for International Development here.
</P>
<P>
The President said the government has pursued a series of
policies to promote foreign direct investment, but the investors
"hesitate to invest in an atmosphere of socio-political unrest."

He called for ensuring discipline in all sectors through
depoliticization, saying that "economic development is the only
answer to our problems."

He urged all concerned to implement the family planning
programs with all vigor and energy along with intensified efforts
to ensure food security.

<HEADLINE> Tunisian President to Visit Egypt for Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali is expected to visit Egypt next week, Egypt's
Al-Gomhuria newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit to start on Monday, Ben Ali will
discuss with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and senior officials
ways to promote bilateral relations, especially economic and trade
cooperation, and regional issues, the Arabic-language daily said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Al Hadi Treki, first advisor of the Tunisian
president, arrived in Cairo late Friday to make arrangements for
Ben Ali's upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali's visit mirrors the keenness of the two countries'
leaders on boosting bilateral relations in all fields, the
pro-government paper quoted Tunisian Ambassador in Cairo Youssef
Al Moqadim as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A symposium will be held in January to discuss the role to be
played by Egypt's private sector in enhancing trade in the light
of a free trade zone between the two countries, Al Moqadim said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will also deal with the prospects for the
establishment of a partnership between the two North African Arab
nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Tunisian trade relations witnessed a progress over
the past few years, with the trade volume rising to 75.4 million
U.S. dollars from 3.29 million dollars in 1992. The two sides have
been making efforts to increase the trade volume to 200 million
dollars in the coming years, with the advent of the free trade
zone last year.

<HEADLINE> Japan Keen to Open up Doors to ASEAN: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government
expressed Saturday its willingness to open up its doors to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the rest of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The pronouncement was contained in a 42-page official position
paper, entitled "Report of the Mission for Revitalization of Asian
Economy," which was released here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be able to build a true partnership with Asian
countries unless we open Japan, and we must understand that
opening Japan will also produce results that are desirable and
beneficial for Japan itself," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the opening involves different levels of people,
money and information, which the Japanese government termed as
truly commensurate to the growing desire for reforms in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to seriously consider actively bringing in
human resources from abroad to supply the people who will provide
medical and nursing care and fill other needs as our society
ages," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper admitted that these people are currently lacking in
Japan and it will be next to impossible for Japan to provide
sufficient human resources for this domestically.
</P>
<P>
"Effective use of human resources in this area would be
extremely significant for the strengthening of our economic ties
with Asian countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
In order to support close interaction, Japan committed itself
to improve its existing systems to accept foreign students so that
it is able to take in large numbers of students from Asia into its
universities, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Japan will also relax its immigration policies by
allowing professionals and skilled foreign workers into its
shores.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Peace in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has called for peace in the Horn of African region, saying
persistent conflicts in the region were largely responsible for
the slow pace of integration and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moi was quoted by Saturday's East African Standard daily as
saying it is a pity that while other countries are busy forming
economic blocs, Africans are busy buying guns to destroy
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The conflicts continue to be a source of tension among members
of Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) with wider
complications in the desired cooperation," the president said
Friday in Djibouti when addressing the seventh summit of the IGAD,
which groups Djibouti, Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Eritrea and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in the region did not only rob the people of the
opportunity to concentrate on economic development but also
generated a large number of refugees and displaced persons, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He advised African leaders to stop making themselves laughing
stock by quarreling and thereafter calling upon outsiders to come
and mediate among them.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit was opened Friday in the Red Sea port city
of Djibouti to tackle the peace processes in Sudan and Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Trust Vital to Sino-Philippine Ties: Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said a constant increase of mutual understanding and trust
between his country and the Philippines is vital to the
development of the their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
No problem between the two countries can be solved through a
way other than friendly negotiations and consultations, Zhu said
in separate meetings with the Philippine Vice-President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo and Congressional leaders here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On the addressing of disputes between China and the
Philippines, the Chinese Premier said the two countries should
scrupulously abide by what was bilaterally agreed upon, keep their
words, exercise restraint, and not to take any action that will
magnify or make complicated what is going on.
</P>
<P>
The two countries don't have any reason not to further the
traditional friendship between them, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said her country is
pleased to see that both countries have made commitments to
seeking solution to the disputes, including those on territories,
through friendly consultations.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting with Zhu, Senate President Blas Ople and
Speaker of the House of Representatives Manuel Villar also agreed
that the two countries should exercise restraint and build up
mutual trust and the disputes should be solved in a proper way
which confirms to the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and the Philippine Congressional leaders also shared the
view that high level exchanges between the two countries,
parliament-to-parliament visits in particular, must be further
promoted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier is on the second day of his three-day stay
in the Philippines. He is to attend the informal summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations scheduled for Sunday. His
current Southeast Asia trip, which has brought him to Malaysia,

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan weather experts have
predicted a pessimistic picture for the coming months, saying the
current affluent rains are only temporary.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily on Saturday quoted the
Meteorological Department as saying that the country will be faced
with severe drought starting next month which will be accompanied
by power rationing and famine.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's efforts to recover from the current
economic decline will be hurt as industries will be forced to
operate below capacity due to power shortage, according to a
statement released by the weather department Friday.
</P>
<P>
The weather forecasters said the conflicts between farmers and
wildlife will increase as animals will be forced to roam the
countryside looking for water and pasture.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the east African country will continue to suffer
the drought which hit at least 18 districts last month.

FM Arms Control Official On U.S. Senate Rejection of CTBT
</P>
<P>
China is gravely disappointed with the U.S. Senate's rejection
of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), said Sha
Zukang, head of the arms control department of the Chinese Foreign
Ministry recently.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Sha said that the rejection is so
bad which will have a far-reaching negative impact.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's denial of the treaty blocks the CTBT from coming
into effect, Sha said. Without the approval of the United States,
the largest and the most advanced nuclear arsenal with the
heaviest record of nuclear testing in history among the world's 44
countries with nuclear capacities, the CTBT has no hope of ever
coming into effect, he said, branding the act as a blow to the
international will to permanently ban nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
China Reiterates Call for Ban, Destruction of Nuclear Arms
</P>
<P>
China reiterated its stance on complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and called for countries
concerned to give up the effort in developing and deploying
missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang said that Vice-Premier Qian Qichen made clear the
stance of China's on the issue of nuclear weapons at the 1994
United Nations Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Since the international community has comprehensively
prohibited biological and chemical weapons, there is simply no
reason not to do the same with nuclear weapons, which have greater
destructive force, Sha quoted Qian as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Threat to Retreat from ABM -- Heavy Blow
</P>
<P>
Against International Non-Proliferation Efforts
</P>
<P>
Sha has suggested that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM)
will continue to play a role in maintaining strategic balance and
stability prior to the possible complete destruction of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The ABM treaty is a product of the U.S. and the former Soviet
Union during the Cold War, which is based on the theory of "
mutually assured destruction," said Sha.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. submits resolutions every another year to the U.N.
General Assembly, calling for observance by all countries of the
treaties on arms control and disarmament. The U.S. also has been
telling other countries that the ABM treaty is a pillar of
strategic balance and a precondition for further nuclear
disarmament," said Sha. "But ironically, the U.S. wants to modify
and has even threatened to retreat from the treaty."
</P>
<P>
Arms Control Official on Theater Missile Defensive
</P>
<P>
Sha said that "China does not reject the whole concept of TMD".
</P>
<P>
China understands the role of TMD in protecting stationed
troops and what China opposes is the advanced TMD system which
could be employed during National Missile Defensive, Sha said,
adding that "this will undermine the strategic balance."
</P>
<P>
Sha pointed out that it is not necessary for Japan to join the
TMD of the United States. Even when faced with the bigger threat
during the cold war period than at present, Japan did not think of
TMD, and it is more unnecessary for Japan to do so now for the
international relations are relaxed, relations between big nations
are improved and the Japan-Russian relations have improved
remarkably, and peace and development have become the trend of the
time, Sha said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Nothing dramatic happened
in a grudge match between Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen as
Houston Rockets lost 91-88 to the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation which had been magnified by pre-game hype was
not materialised as both players had all-round games.

Barkley had 13 points, 11 rebounds and six assists while Pippen
had 19, nine boards and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
Smith and Rasheed Wallace scored 15 points apiece for Portland

</P>
<P>
At Utah, the Jazz, in the wake of a listless road loss to the
Lakers, lost back-to-back games for the first time this season

</P>
<P>

the increasing armament of some Middle East countries, maintaining
that such declared fears do not affect Egypt's plans or thinking.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Israel is not in a position to criticize the
armament of others because of the fact that it is stockpiling
weapons of mass destruction.

destruction waters down its remark on the armament of Egypt and
Iran, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Crime Officers to be Trained in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A batch of Tanzanian
Regional Crime Officers (RCOs) left here Friday night for the
United States for a two-week course on hostage negotiation, the
Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Tanzania's Inspector General of Police Omari
Mahita as saying that the Tanzanian Police Force should be well
drilled to contain the increasing crimes such as illegal
immigrants and importation of firearms, drugs and stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Since independence, Tanzania has been enjoying a maximum peace
and stability which needs to be safeguarded by the Police Force
and the general citizenry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going civil wars in the neighboring countries,
such as Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, might
pose a threat to the existing peace and stability in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mahita noted that the country has a number of problems of
refugees and illegal importation and smuggling of firearms as well
as rounds of ammunition which have caused increased armed robbery
offences in border areas.
</P>
<P>
"All this calls for readiness of our Police Force to contain
them," said the officer.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, there is need to train members of the
Police Force to enable them to cope with the changing society.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Tanzania has been receiving maximum
cooperation from the U.S., especially through the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, the police training course covers
such areas as Major Case Management, Collection of Evidence and
Preservation of Crime Scene, Vital Installation Security
Management and Counter Surveillance Techniques.
</P>
<P>
Other fields include Advanced Physical Security, Advanced
General Criminal Investigation, Senior Crisis Management and
Narcotics as well as Contraband Interdiction together with
Explosive, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Tops Arab World in Competitiveness: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan ranked the best in Arab
countries in factors of economic competitiveness, such as
openness, government intervention, finance and infrastructure, a
Geneva-based agency said in its latest report on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Global Competitiveness Report (GCR), gives Jordan a
score of 40, putting it ahead of Egypt and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It still ranks Singapore at the top of the world in terms of
overall competitiveness, followed by the United States, Hong Kong
and Thailand in second, third, and fourth places.
</P>
<P>
The GCR weighs countries on factors such as technological
know-how and transfer, management, labor institutions, economic
regulations, investment legislation and the effectiveness of
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The GCR, which is also the name of the agency, moved Jordan
moved from the 34th position out of 53 countries surveyed in 1998
to the current 40th out of 59 countries on 1999.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials attributed the drop in ranking to the
addition of six new countries to the list, including El Salvador,
Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Mauritius and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The change was also due to the GCR`s new criteria which put
more importance to the technological know-how as well as the
funds spent on industrial research. Most of the kingdom`s
industries are not involved in research works.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted a 3.36 percent average economic growth
for the kingdom for the years from 2000 to 2008, lower than the 5
percent projected by the government for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report also said four in every 1,000 Jordanian used the
Internet, which is an important criterion for easy accession to
information and industrial development.
</P>
<P>
One in every 100 Jordanians has a telephone, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Wins World Under-17 Soccer Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil claimed the title of
the Under-17 World Soccer Championship by beating Australia 8-7 in
a penalty shootout Saturday following a 0-0 tie after extra time.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's goalkeeper Rubinho was the linchpin of the victory as
he saved Australia's eighth kick from Iain Fyfe before Wellington
drove home the winner under Australian goalkeeper Jess Van
Stratten.
</P>
<P>
The shootout was tied at 4-4 after the first five kicks each.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians looked far dominant throughout, but they had no
effective ways to tear open the tight defense of the Australians
and had to resort to long-range shooting.
</P>
<P>
Australia's best chance of normal time came from Brazil's
Eduardo in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo gave away a free kick with a poor challenge wide on the
right and when the ball was swung in he almost sent a scorching
header into his own net.
</P>
<P>
Brazil later turned up the tempo but was still unable to break
through, although Eduardo went close with a stinging free kick.
</P>
<P>
Twice in the last 15 minutes Brazil managed to slip Souza in
behind the defense but both times Van Stratten made crucial saves
to keep the Australians alive.
</P>
<P>
Brazil kept pushing for the winner in extra time and Eduardo
came close after a free kick rebounded into his path and his drive
flew just wide of Australia's right post.
</P>
<P>
Australia launched a rare counter attack which left Joseph Di
Iorio in the box, but he dragged his shot across Rubinho and wide
of the far post.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday Ghana beat the United States 2-0 in the
playoff for third
</P>
<P>
Ghana, a two-time champion, went 1-0 up in the 35th minute when
Ishmael Addo's corner kick was flicked on to the far post for
Pimpong Razak to head home.
</P>
<P>
Ghana should have gone 2-0 up on 74 minutes when U.S. fullback
Alex Yi brought Addo down inside the box.
</P>
<P>
Addo took the spot kick but it was saved by D.J. Countess. Addo
made up for the miss by sealing the match with a goal 10 minutes
later.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Computer Solutions to Flood Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Water
Resources is seeking assistance from the world's computer giant,
the Compaq Computer Corp., to establish a water resource solution
center which helps oversee and minimize damage caused by floods,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the proposed center can provide effective system
solutions for the administration to rationally distribute water
resources and oversee the floods," Philip Yu, president of Compaq
Great China, told the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Spending of the establishment of the center is estimated at
some one million US dollars, China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
China is hit by floods almost every year, resulting in
gargantuan economic losses accounting for billions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to China Daily, Compaq's solutions for water
resources focus on how to accurately monitor and assess the water
situation in selected regions via computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Michael Adams, a director with the water resource and power
utility department of Compaq China, suggested that China should
pay more attention to forecasting and monitoring floods rather
than to rescue efforts after one has started.
</P>
<P>
"The application of computer systems can get the point of anti-
flood drive," Adams was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the computer solutions for water resources
include a geography information system, a monitoring system,
remote sensing, emergency management and a forecast system.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Trade Surplus for Consecutive 24 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia continued to
record a trade surplus in October this year for the 24th
consecutive month, according to the Statistics Department
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In October, a trade surplus of 5.6 billion ringgit (about 1.473
billion U.S. dollars) was recorded against a surplus of 6.6
billion ringgit (about 1.736 billion dollars) in the same month
last year, the statistics released here Saturday by the department
show.
</P>
<P>
The department said the surplus in the review month was
achieved despite a higher import growth of 21.6 percent against
exports which rose by 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months this year, Malaysia's trade surplus
increased 28.1 percent over that during the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The surplus for the first 10 months amounted to 58 billion
ringgit (about 15.263 billion dollars) against 45.3 billion
ringgit (about 11.921 billion dollars) recorded in the same period
of 1998, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The larger surplus in the current period was due to the
stronger growth of 9.7 percent in exports against the growth of
5.4 percent in imports, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Total exports for the first ten months of 1999 were valued at
259.2 billion ringgit (about 68.21 billion dollars) against 236.2
billion ringgit (about 62.157 billion dollars) in the same period
a year ago while total imports during the review period amounted
to 201.2 billion ringgit (about 52.947 billion dollars) against
191 billion ringgit (about 50.263 billion dollars) in the
corresponding period last year, the statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Calls for Peaceful Dialogues With Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said Friday that if the guerrillas insist on
conducting dialogues amid conflicts, the government will not
reject, but it would rather see the dialogues take place in a
peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana made the remarks at a conclusion ceremony of the
higher military studies of the Superior War School.
</P>
<P>
"Colombia, our children, our old people, our women, deserve to
go into the year 2000 in an environment of coexistence instead of
violence. We already greeted the 20th century one hundred years
ago in the middle of a war among brothers. We will not commit
that historical mistake again," Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
"While we, and the great majority of Colombians work for the
economic recovery of the country and for creating jobs, that will
make a dignified life possible," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) sat at the negotiations table on October
24 to discuss the agenda of themes after a long and difficult
dialogue process. However, the biggest guerrilla organization of
the country continued to launch attacks in the middle of
negotiations.

the Bulgarian government has called for wide-ranging autonomy in
Kosovo within Yugoslavia's existing borders and giving equal

MADRID, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Aznar said Friday that both his country and Finland hoped that
nothing but institutional restructuring will be the major topic
during the inter-governmental meeting of the European Union (EU)
next year.
</P>
<P>
Aznar made the remarks at a news conference after meeting with
visiting Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, whose country
holds the rotating presidency of the EU council.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that issues left unresolved at the last
meeting in Amsterdam, Holland, as well as the EU's eastward
expansion should be on the agenda of the next EU meeting. Topics
other than these will make the meeting complicated, which will
delay the EU's eastward expansion effort.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Finland also agreed that negotiations on accession to
the EU should be conducted with all the candidate countries. The
EU should accept any country that is ready, they added.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers expressed confidence that most of the
EU countries will agree to their proposals.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Lose Export of 50,000 Tons of Jute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will lose export of
some 50,000 tons of jute goods every year in the international
markets because of a new standard set in the use of mineral oil
for the manufacturing of jute goods, The Financial Express
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new standard will come into force in the next two to three
months, but preparations are yet to be made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The standard was set at a workshop organized in Calcutta of
India in February 1998 by the International Jute Organization
(IJO) following a complaint made by the European importers of
coffee, cocoa and hazelnuts and the Brussels-based Association of
European Chocolate Industry.
</P>
<P>
According to importers, Specially in the European countries,
jute goods contain mineral oil that carries hydrocarbon, a threat
to public health.
</P>
<P>
European chocolate industries import coffee beans, cocoa beans
and hazelnuts for processing food items and the growers use the
jute bags for exporting their products.
</P>
<P>
Coffee beans, cocoa beans and hazelnuts are produced in Africa,
Latin America and producers import jute bags mostly from
Bangladesh and India, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The IJO arranged a meeting in Dhaka in March 1997, which was
participated by experts, producers and importers of jute goods and
also importers of cocoa and coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the use of less mineral oil at the time
of manufacturing of bags should be ensured to curb health hazards.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Indian jute goods exporters said that they were
completely ready to use vegetable oil instead of mineral oil for
manufacturing jute goods.
</P>
<P>
If the standard is maintained, Bangladeshi jute industries have
to use vegetable oil instead of existing mineral oil, which will
increase the production cost of jute goods.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the already ailing jute sector of Bangladesh will
face another problem in the export markets as jute goods exports
are still facing a heavy losses due to a big gap between the
production cost and the export prices of the items.
</P>
<P>
If Bangladesh fails to ensure vegetable oil in manufacturing
jute goods, India will occupy the Bangladesh's export markets of
jute goods, specially in Africa, Latin America, Fiji and European
countries as India has adequate quantity of vegetable oil from its
own sources, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Focus on Agricultural Issues in WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will focus on
agricultural issues in the third round of World Trade Organization
(WTO) talks scheduled to start on November 30 in Seattle, the
Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Brazil strongly demands that
developed countries gradually eliminate subsidies to agricultural
exports, as subsidies lead to overproduction of agriculture and
seriously upset the balance between supply and demand on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Brazil hopes to reduce duties on its major export products,
such as sugar, meat, orange juice and some high valued-added
commodities, and to ease restrictions on market access of its
industrial products, including steel, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed on the need to build and perfect a
worldwide multilateral trade system with clear-cut rules, which
will contribute to efficient and fair solutions of trade disputes
as well as the strengthening of market diversification.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Be Hit by Indian Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- India has reportedly completed
all its arrangements for the construction of a high dam on the
Barak river, the origin of Kushiara and Surma rivers of
Bangladesh, posing a threat to ecological balance as well as
farmlands of the country.
</P>
<P>
If the dam was built, the entire northeastern and southern
parts of Bangladesh would turn into deserts, newspapers here
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the country cautioned that Surma and Kushiara rivers
would lose their flow with the construction of the dam, leaving
far-reaching adverse effects on socio-economic condition of the
one-fourth area of Bangladesh from Sylhet to Barisal.
</P>
<P>
If the dam is constructed, a power generation and a fertilizer
factory in Sylhet region will be threatened.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that production in 130 tea gardens of the
Sylhet region would come down drastically due to the adverse

<HEADLINE> China to Launch National Sports Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China will stage its first
National Sports Games (NSG) next year with an view of promoting
the development of the non-Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
The NSG, to run from May 28 to June 6 at Ningbo, east of China,
will feature a total of 14 non-Olympic disciplines such as
acrobatics, Chinese-style wrestling, golf, bowling, chess, sports
dance, body-buidling and golf.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,093 world titles Chinese athletes won from 1979 to
1997, the non-Olympic events claimed 818 world champions,
accounting for almost 74.8% of the total.
</P>
<P>
The honors, however, are not in proportion to the attention
they received in China which begun to focus resources on the
Olympic events six years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our non-Olympics have dominated the world arena for long, but
their growth have been stemmed after being ruled out of the
National Games in 1993," said Duan Shijie, vice president of China
's State Sports General Administration.
</P>
<P>
Since the seventh version, the National Games has turned into a
competition only for Olympics events with an exception to Wushu, a
non-Olympic but Chinese traditional sport.
</P>
<P>
"We need a balanced development between the Olympic and non-
Olympic events," added Duan.

<HEADLINE> Bank Promises Aid to Information Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank (CCB),
one of the country's four largest state-owned commercial banks,
will give a government media center financial support, online
banking, buyer's credit and help with its nationwide settlement
systems, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
As part of a deal signed in Beijing, the bank will loan the
Information &AMP; Network Center 300 million yuan (36 million US
dollars) in working capital, and more money is expected, said the
English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"It is a win-win partnership and will be beneficial to both of
us," Zhang Enzhao, vice president of the CCB, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
As hopes heighten for China's entry to the World Trade
Organization, the country's banking sector and information
industry are expecting development opportunities and also
preparing for challenges.
</P>
<P>
"So we should cooperate more closely and strengthen each other,
" he told China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, which
oversees the Information &AMP; Network Center, plans to establish a
company to take charge of the construction and operation of China'
s radio and cable TV transmission networks. The Information &AMP;
Network Center is expected to handle the founding work, China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
As the center expands its responsibilities, the CCB will serve
as a financial consultant for the new company, help the latter
with computerized settlement services, collect fees from clients
and help establish a cable TV user management system, Zhang told
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
He added that his bank also needs help from the radio, film and
TV administration to assist it in the computer information era.
</P>
<P>
Currently serving more than 200 million people in the country,
China's cable TV network is receiving 5 million new users each
year and has become one of the world's largest cable TV networks.

<HEADLINE> Lake People Urged to Shield Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ruffled by the illegal
slayings of rare birds, officials in east China's Jiangxi Province
are calling for quick and effective protection of the migratory
species at the Poyang Lake, a world famous waterfowl wintering
spot, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A series of incidents that killed nearly 150 migratory birds,
including swans and rare geese, have brought the call for
protection, said the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese laws, the killing and transportation of 10
or more wild animals under second-class State protection
constitute an extremely serious criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
With its clear warm water and rich bird food, the 5,000-sq-km
Poyang Lake is an ideal winter haven home for many kinds of
migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of winter through March every year, about
300,000 birds of 301 species come to the lake to escape the cold
of Siberia, Mongolia, Japan and China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, China Daily quoted Zhou Haichang, an official with the
Poyang Lake Migratory Bird Reserve, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reserve's size and apparently lax management will make bird
protection tricky, Zhou told China Daily.
</P>
<P>
While the reserve covers an area of 22,400 hectares, there are
only 30 people working in it, said Ma Qinghua, director of the
Natural Reserve Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"It is not ideal for effective protection of the birds with
such an area and so few workers," Ma noted, adding that most of
the residents and many government officials in the lake area lack
wildlife-protection consciousness.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Invite Foreign Observers for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's acting
Commissioner of Elections D. Dassanayake said that he had agreed
to allow foreign observers to monitor the presidential election on
December 21, media sources here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the commissioner told representatives of all
the 13 candidates that he had decided to invite foreign election
monitors, not only from the South Asian region, but also from
other countries, when he met them at his office on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition candidates of the presidential election had raised
fears of widespread violence and vote-rigging and demanded that
foreigners be allowed to monitor the elections to ensure they are
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sri Lankan government is against inviting
international and local observers to monitor the elections because
it said in the past such observers were not impartial in their
reports.
</P>
<P>
He also informed the representatives that no restriction is
allowed to enforce on electioneering on private election media by
political parties or independents contesting the election.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the government was prepared to provide
helicopters with security to candidates seeking to address rallies
in the north and east of the country on a payment basis.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand General Election Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand citizens or
permanent residents who are 18 or over went to the polls on
Saturday in a general election which according to the latest
opinion polls could give the main opposition Labor Party a chance
to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations, which opened at 09:00 a.m. (2000 GMT Friday),
have been set up at schools, churches and other public places.
Voters make their marks in the privacy of a ballot box.
</P>
<P>
Each voter has two votes: one for the political party of his or
her choice and the other for the candidates he or she would prefer
to represent his or her electorate.
</P>
<P>
At the current general election, voters are also asked to cast
his or her vote on referenda questions about a review of the
justice system and tougher sentencing of violent offenders and
about reducing the number of members of parliament (MP) from the
current 120 to 99.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral
system, a political party's total MPs will be almost the same as
its share of the nationwide party voting. This total is made up of
electorate MPs and MPs elected from the party lists published
before the general election. But a party qualifies for
parliamentary seats by winning either at least five percent of the
total party votes or an electorate seat.
</P>
<P>
The electorate vote decides who will be the electorate MP. The
candidate who is declared elected is the person who secures more
votes than any other candidate in the single-member electoral
districts regardless of how many or how few votes he or she wins.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two political parties in New Zealand have registered for
contesting the general election. But the National Party led by
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and the Labor Party with Helen Clark
as its leader remain the major rivals in the election.
</P>
<P>
The voting will end at seven o'clock Saturday evening. The
preliminary count of ordinary votes only (not including special
votes) will be progressively made available. Preliminary results
for the two referenda will also be provided.
</P>
<P>
Typically, these preliminary results cover about 90 percent of
all votes cast at the election. They often indicate which
electorate candidate has won in each of the 67 electorates, and
may indicate the total number of seats each party is likely to
have.
</P>
<P>
But the final count cannot be completed until all the special
votes are received and checked in the 10 days following the
election.
</P>
<P>
It is only after all successful electorate candidates have been
declared elected and the total support is known for each party,
that allocation of list seats will be final. So the make-up of the
parliament will not be official until about two weeks after the
election.
</P>
<P>
The same applies to the indicative referenda results.
</P>
<P>
If a single party wins more than half of all the parliamentary
seats, it will be able to govern without having to enter into a
coalition or an agreement with any other parties.
</P>
<P>
But the latest opinion polls showed that neither the ruling
National Party nor the main opposition Labor Party would be able
to get a majority in the 120-seat parliament.

<HEADLINE> Russians Win All but One in Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russians skaters performed
their best to dominate the women's and pairs competitions, winning
all but one medal in the Cup of Rusia Grand Prix figure skating in
St. Petersburg on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Irina Slutskaya triumphed in the singles, followed by
compatriots Julia Soldatova and Elena Sokolova, in second and
third place respectively, while Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov
were crowned in the pairs, wherein Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim
Marinin took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The Russian monopoly was only broken by China's Shen Xue and
Zhao Hongbo who finished second in the pairs.
</P>
<P>
Slutskaya, who came out first among the five main contenders,
wiped out any hope for her rivals as she cleanly landing all seven
of the jumps, including a triple-double combo.
</P>
<P>
Although Maria Butyrskaya, winner of two Grand Prix events this
season, opted not to compete in St. Petersburg, Soldatova and
Sokolova were present to ensure the Russian sweep.
</P>
<P>
Soldatova, despite a fall during a combination attempt, was
solid enough to hold on to the second-place position she had
grabbed the day before, while Sokolova kept her advantage over
American Angela Nikodinov.
</P>
<P>
The second-place finish for the Chinese pair was a
disappointment as they led led the short program. Their scores in
the free skate were partially due to Zhao's fall during a tandem
double attempt.
</P>
<P>
This was enough of an opening to allow Petrova and Tikhonov to
slip through. They thrilled the audience with the most energetic
and challenging routine of the pairs competition, including two
triples landed by Petrova from throws.
</P>
<P>
In the day's final event, the ice dancing original dance

program, with Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy

<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- As many as 38 people were
killed in fresh violence which erupted on Thursday and continued
into Friday in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Saturday, most of them died
of gunshot wounds in Friday's clash.
</P>
<P>
Another victim was killed on Thursday in a riot in Poka, some
eight kilometers southeast of Ambon.
</P>
<P>
The riot in Poka took place when unidentified people attacked
residential housing complexes, the reports said, adding that
Friday's clashes were initiated on Thursday evening after a group
of people set a Mardika residents' house on fire.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post described Fridays' violence as "very serious,"
with military troops allegedly taking part in shootings and arson
attacks on shop-houses.
</P>
<P>
Black smoke billowed from houses set on fire in the residential
area of Mardika, and sporadic grenade explosions were heard.
</P>
<P>
Groups of people were seen attacking each other with tear gas
and grenades.
</P>
<P>
The violence left Ambon paralyzed. All schools, shops and
government offices were closed.
</P>
<P>
Groups of people, armed with home-made rifles, swords, arrows
and spears, roamed many parts of the city. Almost all roads were
barricaded.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Maluku Military Command Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela has
reportedly set up a special team to control the situation.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and its surrounding area have been ravaged by a series of
communal clashes over the last few months. The worst riots

YINCHUAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ma Xintian, a 40-year-old Hui
(Moslim) businessman, negotiates deals with Arabs every day via e-
mail in a modern highrise apartment in the city of Guyuan in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Next to his
apartment there is a museum where coins from ancient Persia and
Rome are on display
</P>
<P>
In the 13th century, many Arabs and Persians came here to do
business. In many respects, Ma is a descendant of those
businessmen from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Taxation, management and supply were highly developed in
Xinjiang by the Tang Dynasty (618-907), said Luo Feng, director of
the Guyuan Museum.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-year-old city of Guyuan is one of the more than 30
cities along the ancient Silk Road such as Xi'an, Lanzhou,
Yinchuan, Xining, Urmuqi and Kashi which link central Asia with
China.
</P>
<P>
Fifity years ago, Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province, did not
even have a running-water pipe or a highway to its name. Today,
however, petroleum, machinery and metallurgical industries have
become the pillars of its economy.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,100 foreign-funded enterprises have been set up in
Lanzhou with a combined foreign investment of more than 700
million US dollars.

Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has
developed into a thriving city with a population of more than one
million. Urumqi's annual GDP has reached nearly 50 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city of Jinchang has become China's largest producer of
nickel. Jiayuguan has developed into the largest iron and steel
production base and the largest city in the western part of the
Hexi Corridor. Jiuquan is one of the three largest satellite
launching bases in China.
</P>
<P>
A modern transport network now runs along the Silk Road, with
seven railway lines and dozens of air routes. Since the 1980s,
China has invested heavily to build four fiber-optic cables,
including one from Beijing to Lanzhou via Huhhot and Yinchuan, and
one from Xining to Urumqi via Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
More economic opportunities will develop along the ancient Silk
Road as the Chinese government is launching a massive campaign to
exploit the western part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Largest Muslim Organization Elects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian largest Muslim
organization of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) has elected Hasyim Muzadi its
new general chairman to replace Abdurrahman Wahid who is now the
country's president.
</P>
<P>
The election was conducted Friday at the NU congress that has
been going on Kediri, East Java, for the past week and ended
Friday night, according to national newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hasyim, the former chairman of NU's chapter in East Java
province, took the helm of the 35 million-strong Muslim
organization for the next five years with a convincing victory
over his major rival Said Aqiel Siradj in a vote.
</P>
<P>
Hasyim was born to a rich but religious couple, Muzadi and
Rumyati, in Tuban, East Java, in 1944.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the Gontor pesantren (Muslim boarding school)
in Ponorogo, East Java, in 1963 and the Malang Islamic Teaching
Institute, also in East Java, in 1967.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hasyim called on all ulemas and Muslim people to
join forces in developing the organization.
</P>
<P>
"Let's now bury the hatchet and enter the new era with a united
stance to develop the organization and the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Around 3,000 delegates attended the NU's 30th congress which
was officially closed by Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
In her speech which brought down the curtain on the six-day
event, Megawati repeated a call for the Muslim organization to
maintain its role as a moral force which is critical of
government.

<HEADLINE> Romario Signs for Vasco Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's soccer hero
Romario rejoined Vasco da Gama on Friday, two weeks after being
sacked by Vasco's bitter rival Flamengo.
</P>
<P>
Vasco da Gama was the birthplace for his professional career,
and Romario will make his debut in the World Club Championships to
be held in Brazil in January.
</P>
<P>
The move means that Romario and Edmundo, two of Brazil's most
gifted and most temperamental players, will join forces in an
attack which could destroy opposing defences, providing coach
Antonio Lopes can keep their egos and tempers under control.
</P>
<P>
Romario, 33, said the club would be big enough for both players
and promised to set aside any differences with Edmundo.
</P>
<P>
"I have not come here to take anybody's space, particularly
Edmundo's, because I know that his space is large and has been
conquered with a lot of work," said Romario, "I have come here to
help. My heart is open."
</P>
<P>
The two players, who briefly played together for Flamengo in
1995, used to be close friends until earlier this year when
Romario had a cartoon of Edmundo painted on the toilet door of a
bar he owns in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Romario left Vasco in 1988 and has since played for PSV
Eindhoven, Barcelona and Valencia as well as Flamengo.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, he led Brazil to victory in the World Cup, scoring
five goals but four years later he was stopped from the France
World Cup due to a calf muscle injury.

<P>
BELGRADE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Friday distributed medals to outstanding members of
the Yugoslav Army, police force and civilians for their services
in the country's defense against NATO's 78-day bombing campaign,
the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The unity of the Yugoslav people, their courage and the great
sacrifices won the war against NATO's aggression, Milosevic said
during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The war we waged was the most unequal war known to date ... so
unequal that our enemy did not take into account the possibility
that we could defend ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Army Chief of General Staff Dragoljub Ojdzanic
said the NATO strike shows that wars still cannot be avoided and
that small developing countries, which are striving for
independence and freedom, would have to bear the brunt of wars.
</P>
<P>
Ojdzanic, who received the "Freedom" medal, said the Yugoslav
forces would strengthen national defense capabilities and make
greater efforts to create a peaceful and free environment for the
Yugoslav people.

<HEADLINE> EU Expresses Concerns Over Date of Croatian Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Friday expressed concerns over Croatia's possible choice on a date
soon after Christmas for its parliamentary elections, claiming it
would be difficult to have an international monitoring during the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
A statement released in Finland, which currently serves the
rotating EU presidency, said the EU is closely following the
discussions underway in Croatia over the date of the elections,
which, according to the country's law, should be held by January
27, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has noted with concern that dates very close after
Christmas seem to have emerged as possible polling days. The EU
draws attention to the fact that arrangements for international
and domestic election monitoring could face difficulties, if
elections are held too close after Christmas," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It affirmed the EU recognizes that the choice of the election
date is a sovereign decision for Croatia, but a decision to hold
elections between Christmas and New Year would give rise to doubts
as to whether they would be both free and fair.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE Mission to Croatia has said that elections in the
Christmas period are completely unknown in the European context.
The EU said it fully endorses this statement.

<HEADLINE> German State Premier Resigns Over Corruption Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Premier of Germany's Lower
Saxony State Gerhard Glogowski announced his resignation on Friday
amid scandals of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Glogowski, who took the post just 13 months ago from Gerhard
Schroeder after the latter was elected Chancellor, has been
alleged to have his wedding and holidays financed by the business.
</P>
<P>
With an important role in the ruling Social Democratic Party (
SPD), Glogowski conferred with other party leaders including
Schroeder before making the decision, a spokesman for the state
government said in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously that the verdict has been reached by many
people in this overheated atmosphere, it is making the pressure
greater. So I have to act to protect the state, my family, my
party and my friends," Glogowski said.
</P>
<P>
Insisting on his innocence at a briefing in Hanover, Glogowski
said, "the rule effective to every citizen, that someone is
innocent until the counterevidence emerges, is not applicable to
politicians."
</P>
<P>
The media revealed last week that Glogowski had received favors
from big companies in his state.
</P>
<P>
Glogowski was also alleged to have accepted free drinks and a
free honeymoon trip from three firms when he remarried in this May.
</P>
<P>
Official sources confirmed that Glogowski has refused to return
to the state treasury his salary as a supervisory board member in
automobile giant Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
Glogowski should have refunded to the state since his
supervisory membership in Volkswagen was part of his job as state
premier, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The SPD will name Glogowski's successor on Saturday, said Lower
Saxony state's Science Minister Thomas Oppermann.

<HEADLINE> Gregory Handed Touchline Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Aston Villa manager John Gregory has received a 28-day
touchline ban for a verbal attack on the fourth official during
his side's Premiership clash with Leicester in September.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association excluded him from the dugout from 13
December for reportedly telling official Andy D'urso he would "
punch his lights out" as Villa slipped to a 3-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
Gregory was also fined 5,000 pounds and asked to sign a written
undertaking regarding his future conduct.
</P>
<P>
The Villa manager did not defend himself before the three-man
misconduct hearing after consulting League Managers' Association
Chief Executive John Barnwell.
</P>
<P>
Gregory's comments have landed him in trouble once already this
season. He was fined 2,000 pounds for remarks made to referee
Uriah Rennie during his club's match a Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
His outspoked views include branding fourth officials "
jobsworths" and accusing referees of "acting like policemen".
</P>
<P>
FA media relations manager Steve Double said the weight of the
punishment reflected concern that this was the manager's second
offence.
</P>
<P>
Gregory's job is already thought to be on the line following a
string of bad results for Villa. The club has accumulated just two
points from its last seven games.
</P>
<P>
The latest controversy cannot help his position and with any
bad results in upcoming fixtures, he could be facing the sack.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Former heavyweight champion
Tommy Morrison of the United States was arrested Friday, facing
weapons and public intoxication charges after running from a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
Morrison fled into the woods when his car ran off the road and
hit some trees about four miles west of Huntsville, Arkansas, the
Madison County sheriff's department said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Bart Bumpass, 30, was driving the car. He
was arrested on weapon, drug, alcohol and driving charges. Police
found Morrison about three hours later attempting to use a phone
at a house less than a mile from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Morrison was free on $3,500 bail. He is facing
trial on December 21 on previous drug and weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
Morrison was charged with public intoxication and being a felon
in possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
At the crash scene, offices found several handguns. Many of the
weapons were equipped with laser sights and all were loaded with
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Morrison was arrested on September 16 for driving erratically.
He avoided jail time on charges of drunken driving and speeding in
Kansas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Morrison knocked out George Foreman in 1993 to take the WBO
crown. He recorded 40 knockouts during his career. His last
knockout victory came in 1996, just after testing positive for the
AIDS virus.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Secures Semifinal Berth in ATP Tour Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras struggled into the
semifinals of the ATP Tour World Championship on Friday by beating
Nicolas Lapentti on two tiebreakers 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Currently ranked fifth in the world, Sampras actually needed to
win only one set to advance, but "I didn't know that."
</P>
<P>
Thus, Sampras, after a three-month layoff because of injuries,
joins Andre Agassi, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Nicolas Liefner in the
semifinals of the 3.6 million US dollars season-ending tournament
in Hanover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Hometown hero Kiefer, who ranked sixth, hit booming winners
from all over the court in beating Kafelnikov 6-1, 4-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
However, the second-ranked Kafelnikov still advanced while
Agassi had already qualified in this round-robin event.
</P>
<P>
The semifinals pits Agassi against Kafelnikov and Sampras
playing Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
Under a complicated tie-breaking formula, Todd Martin and
Thomas Enqvist were eliminated. Lapentti and Gustavo Kuerten also
failed to advance from the eight-player field.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is making his 10th straight appearance at the ATP
Championship and has reached the semis the last nine years. Ivan
Lendl made 12 straight semifinal appearances, ending in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had a tough time with Lapentti. The Ecuadorian saved
three set points in the 12th game and Sampras lost the first point
of the tiebreaker before taking the next six.
</P>
<P>
He also played sloppily in the second tiebreaker but set up a
match point with his 11th ace.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov was undone by two straight double-faults in the
fourth game of the final set that gave Kiefer a 3-1 lead, and
finished with 45 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Martin beat Enqvist 6-4, 6-1, a result that qualified
Kafelnikov but did not help Martin.
</P>
<P>
Kiefer and Kafelnikov finished with 2-1 records in the White
Group, while Martin and Enqvist ended 1-2.
</P>
<P>
The tournament features the world's top eight players. They
were split into two groups, with the top two from each group
advancing to the semis.
</P>
<P>
Agassi completed the round-robin portion of the tournament
without dropping a set. He is assured of finishing the year at No.
1 and already has received the ATP trophy honoring the top-ranked
player.

HEFEI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China is accelerating the pace
of expressway construction by drawing funds from overseas and
domestic capital markets.

According to statistics, ten construction companies in China
have issued A-, B- and H-shares, and have raised 15.2 billion yuan

Joint-Stock Company became the first expressway enterprise to
issue H-shares in November 1996; and in early 1998, the Hainan
Expressway Joint-Stock Company became the first to issue A-shares.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to invest 15 billion US dollars in building a

Both countries announced in May of 1995 the signing of a

illegal traffic of emigrants, a business that thrives in Florida,
on the basis of the existence of the so-called Law of Cuban

Such legislation establishes that any Cuban that sets foot on

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Pushes Proposal for Car-Free Sundays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Environment Minister Edo
Ronchi is pushing ahead with a proposal to ban the use of
automobiles on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that car-free Sundays, which existed in Italy in the
1970s, would offer both economic and environmental payoffs, Ronchi
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I have commissioned a study to verify above all the
environmental impacts of the proposal because the situation of air
in cities is critical thanks mostly to gasoline," Ronchi said.
</P>
<P>
"Then we will have to verify the impacts that the reduction of
petroleum consumption would have on inflation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The environment chief said that while awaiting the results of
the studies, expected to be ready next week, he will consult with
officials from various Italian cities about the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Ronchi said that Enzo Bianco, mayor of the Italian southern
city of Catania, who heads the National Association of
Municipalities was initially favorable to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the so-called "Sundays-on-foot," according to
Ronchi, differs from the austerity program in the 1970s, in that
the government would use that day of the week to more generally
promote the use of public transportation.
</P>
<P>
"Sundays-on-foot are undoubtedly an initiative with strong
environmental interests, but they can also have positive effects
of the dependency of petroleum that in Italy today represents 52
percent of the source of primary energy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ronchi said the Italian government is already investing 1
trillion lire (about 530 million U.S. dollars) on environmentally-
conscious transportation initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The environment minister said he will propose car-free Sundays
to the European Commission's environment committee on December 12,
hoping to spread the idea around the continent to help make "more
consistent influence between Europe and oil producing nations."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Countries sharing water
of Lake Malawi have been cautioned to use the water carefully
because there are early signs of quality deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national consultative workshop on the
trans-frontier natural resources management area (TFNRMA) for Lake
Malawi here Friday, the chairman of the board of trustees of
marine parks and reserves in Tanzania, Lotta Maramali, cautioned
that the ecosystem of the lake might become fragile.
</P>
<P>
"Some damages could lead to the extinction of endemic species
in the lake, but international cooperation and well structured
management strategies could enhance the value of this beautiful
lake and ensure that through rational use it can become pillar in
the economies of Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lake Malawi, covering an area of 30,040 square kilometers, is
shared by Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. It is exceptionally
rich in more than 200 endemic species of fish and other water
creatures.
</P>
<P>
The chairman noted that it was imperative that action is taken
now in order to avoid the costly and complicated remedial measures
in the future.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday expressed the hope that the Rome talks on the
future of Afghanistan would contribute to the return of peace to
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan
said he noted the conclusion of the meeting of the organizing
committee for an emergency Loya jirga, or Grand Assembly, which
was held in Rome from November 22 to 25 at the initiative of the
former King of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zahir Shah.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and a number of interested countries sent
their representatives to observe the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General hopes that this initiative and other
initiatives taken by the people of Afghanistan will contribute to
the return of peace to that country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Rome meeting was aimed to clear the way for a meeting of
traditional Afghan leaders and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Afghanistan is controlled by the biggest
warring party in the country the Taliban, which has been under the
U.N. aviation and financial sanctions for its failure to hand over
the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who has been accused by the
United States for plotting bombing its embassies in Africa last
year.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed on the post-Thanksgiving holiday trading Friday with the Dow
Jones industrial average falling while the Nasdaq index rising.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session, the Dow index fell 19.26 at 10,988.91.
The blue chip index rose 12.54 points Wednesday.

composite index rose 27.32 at 3,447.82, the 16th new record in the
past 20 tradings.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell because of inflationary concerns after the
Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal income
surged 1.3 percent in October, the biggest jump in more than five
years. The report sparked new fears that the Federal Reserve would
raise interest rates to ward off inflation probably early next
year.
</P>

U.S. long distance phone company, the Dow component, rose after
the news report said the company plans to sell stock in its
wireless unit.

higher. Online retailers eToys and Amazon. Com rose as investors
had high hopes for big online selling in the traditional holiday
shopping season next month.

The NYSE index rose 0.32 at 639.95 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 5.25 at 830.40. The Russell 2000 index of

<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,375 down, 1,373 up and 636
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 310.2 million shares from 732.9

<HEADLINE> UN Court Stays Releasing of Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Appeals Chamber of
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has
suspended the order to release a Rwandan genocide suspect, an
official press release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kingsley Moghalu, the spokesman for the ICTR, said that the
release of Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza would be stayed for a maximum of
7 days pending the filling of the Prosecutor's request for a
review of a decision by the Appeals Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR's Appeal Chamber in The Hague, The Netherlands, on
November 3 ordered Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza's immediate release on
the grounds that procedures had not been properly followed during
his detention in Cameroon and in the U.N. detention facility in
Arusha, a northern Tanzanian town, after his transfer.
</P>
<P>
The court said Barayagwiza had been detained in Cameroon for 19
months without being informed of the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza, former Director of Political Affairs in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Rwanda at the time of the genocide,
was transferred to the Tribunal in Arusha on November 19, 1997
from Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with six counts of genocide, complicity in
genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public
incitement to genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded not guilty to these charges on February 23, 1998 and
filed a motion seeking to nullify his arrest, though such a motion
was dismissed by the Tribunal on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has announced it would suspend all cooperation with the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) after the ICTR's
Appeal Chamber ordered the immediate and unconditional release of
Barayagwiza.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals and a total of 38 indicted individuals are in custody.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Rwandans were reportedly killed during the
1994 genocide when the majority Hutus oppressed the minority
Tutsis.
