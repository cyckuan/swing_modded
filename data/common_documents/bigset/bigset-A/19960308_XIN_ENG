<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Refutes US Government Report on Human Rights (Part one) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Fast reactions were aroused in
Lebanon today by a U.S. government annual report on the
situations of human rights in Lebanon and in other countries,
which Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz described as "departing from
the reality."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul stressed that
Lebanon will never allow anyone to interfere in its internal
affairs, noting that it is Lebanon's right to give priority to
what it sees fitful.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. State Department's annual global survey
of human rights, the foreign minister said, "These reports always
contain an inaccurate writing which does not take into
consideration developments of the political, security and judicial
situations in the world countries."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "they are composed according to
standards which could be especially of some organizations only."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that since the end of Lebanon's 15-year civil
war in 1990, Lebanon has achieved "good progress" on various
levels, including the human rights.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the civil war, the foreign minister said,
"Lebanon has realized good progress generally on the levels of
security, stability, justice, law and human rights."
</P>
<P>
"And (Lebanon) has become one of the few countries which
pratice the highest level of freedom and democracy in spite of the
security requirements, no matter whether on the level of
deep-rooted judicial rights in Lebanon, or on the level of the
political performance, or on the level of the freedom of the
press," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Besides that," he stressed, "reading these reports...can not
be done without a comparison with a number of countries,
including the United States."
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon is aspiring to achieve more progress in
order to come up to "the highest standards whose practices are
allowed by the regional and international circumstances."
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the actual situation of human rights in
Lebanon does "contradict" the given "facts" quoted by the
U.S. State Department report, because they depart from the
reality.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Mayor Wounded by Gunmen in Western Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian mayor was shot by
unidentified gunmen in the left part of his chest while on a
routine visit to his city in western province of Kurdistan
Wednesday night, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>

Mustafa-Zadeh, Mayor of Saqqez City, Wednesday night escaped from
the assassination attempt and was immediately rushed to a hospital.

</P>
<P>
But the report gave no detail on the motive of the
assassination which took place just two days before the
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Iran has tightened security by banning all heavy trucks and
motorcycles from approaching the election headquarters in cities.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that there are some signs of unrest in
the capital of Tehran before the fifth parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some anti-government and anti-clergymen graffiti have
appeared prominently on some highways and streets.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, weapons and ammunition are available in
Iran's arms black market and the Iranian officials have become the
targets of attacks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Youth to Abstain From Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged the young people across the country to help end a
cycle of drug abuse and violence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowd in an auditorium at a high school in
Maryland, Clinton said, "Violence and drug use hurt everyone. They
must stop and they must stop now."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that while in the last several years drug usage
has gone some way down and it is still going down among people
aged 18 to 34, now casual drug use is going up again among people
under 18. "We have to stop that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We see the crime rate going down in America, the murder rate
going down, the violence rate going down, but casual violence
among people under 18 going up again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president convened the National Conference on Youth Drug
Use and Violence at Eleanor Roosevelt High School.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending were Vice-President Al Gore, more than
half a dozen members of Clinton's cabinet, students, teachers,
experts in drug prevention and treatment and retired Army General
Barry McCaffrey, who was sworn in as Clinton's new anti-drug chief
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The day-long conference was beamed by satellite to scores of
other youthful audiences in auditoriums across the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the nation's 15 largest pharmaceutical
companies are contributing 33 million dollars to produce and
distribute information on drugs to 400,000 doctors.
</P>
<P>
"People in the '60s got into this, not believing drugs were a
danger until they nearly destroyed my whole generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More and more young people seem to believe that drugs are not
dangerous any more; that is factually wrong," he said. "We know
that the toxic content of marijuana alone is many times more than
it was 30 years ago."

<HEADLINE> Concern for "Mandela-ism" Causes Currency Fluctuations:  Gauteng Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua)-- Fluctuations in the value of
South Africa's currency Rand on international markets were not a
reaction to rumors about President Nelson Mandela's health,
Gauteng provincial government Premier Tokyo Sexwale said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public function in Soweto, outside Johannesburg,
Sexwale said the fluctuations were a reaction to the continuity
and sustainability of Mandela's policies.
</P>
<P>
Seemingly it was an error of judgement to send the president
for the most comprehensive medical check-up, said the premier,
adding the president was not the problem, the market "is
concerned about the behaviour of all of us".
</P>
<P>
Sexwale also stressed that the international market was
"relatively satisfied" with Mandela's rule. Therefore the country
had a positive economic growth rate for the first time in 15
years, the lowest inflation rate in 23 years and "controlled
government expenditure for the first time in decades".
</P>
<P>
However, he said the fluctuations could be seen as questions
about the continuation and sustainability of "Mandela-ism", and
the collectivity of leaders behind the president.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that 'mandela-ism' will continue to prevail
in South Africa. The task is to convince the rest of the world,+
he added.
</P>
<P>
Recent rumors about Mandela's health circulating around the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange had sent the rand to the record lows
on financial markets.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mandela checked himself into Johannesburg's
park lane clinic on Tuesday for the most intensive medical
check-up to date in a bid to end speculation about his health.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was discharged from the clinic yesterday after the
results of the two-day's tests found him in an excellent
condition. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ulster Politicians to Be Invited by US President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) and other prominent Northern Ireland
politicians will be invited By US President Bill Clinton to a St
Patrick's Day (Ireland's national day) party in the White House
next week, reported Financial Times newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The report said Trimble was understood to re ready to accept
the offer and was preparing to take with him a typical Ulster
present from a factory in his constituency.
</P>
<P>
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the more radical Democratic
Unionist Party (DUP) is also being urged to attend the party.
</P>
<P>
The report held that the attendance list for March 15 party
made by the White House reflects a new mood in the US
administration after the Irish Republican Army plotted its first
bomb explosion in London on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Clinton's advisers have stepped up their already
close monitoring of Northern Ireland affairs with a series of
meetings with leaders of different political parties in Ulster in
recent weeks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, last year's star in the
White House party, has been snubbed this year.
</P>
<P>
Although Adams' US visa has been extended, the US
administration has made clear that he is not welcome at the White
House until the IRA restores its ceasefire and his fundraising in
the US has also been banned.

<HEADLINE> Drug Company Merger Triggers Record Turnover on  Swiss Stock Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The proposed merger of two Swiss
drug giants, Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG, has triggered off
frantic trading on the Swiss stock exchanges, whose total turnover
on Thursday reached an all-time high of 5 billion Swiss francs, or
nearly 4.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Normally, a high total turnover on the Swiss stock exchanges in
Zurich, Basel and Geneva is something between one to two billion
francs, sometimes it could reach three billion. But on Thursday,
total value of traded shares of Ciba and Sandoz alone reached 3
billion francs.
</P>
<P>
Brokers of the Swiss stock exchanges said they had never
experienced such a high turnover in the history.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's trading, Ciba shares soared nearly 30 percent,
and those of Sandoz nearly 20 percent, according to the Swiss news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The merger of Ciba, the world's ninth-largest drug maker in
terms of sales, and Sandoz, the 14th-largest, would form the
world's second-largest drug company, after Glaxo Wellcome of
Britain, the companies said. It would have a combined global
market share of 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The merger plan, which has been discussed in great secrecy in
the past three months, was announced on Thursday and is still to
be approved by shareholders in April.

<HEADLINE> Heath Urges Major Not to Hold Referendum on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister
Edward Heath expressed strong opposition today to a referendum to
a single European currency which is possible to be held by the
Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio, Heath argued that a referendum would go
against Tory party tradition and was unnecessary because this
issue was not constitutional.
</P>
<P>
Heath also insisted that a single European currency was vital
to a single European market.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major told the parliament on
Thursday night that a referendum on a Single European currency was
being actively considered.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials have been quoted by press as saying
that the decision would come out "within weeks rather than months"
and that a referendum was now almost certain.
</P>
<P>
In the Cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and
Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, long-standing opponents of a
referendum, now are believed to go along with the majority view.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cabinet members hoped that Kenneth Clarke, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, would be persuaded to abandon his
opposition to a referendum and the majority ministers have made
discreet efforts to prevent Clarke from being isolated on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
A referendum have been actively supported by right-wingers
within the Tory party.
</P>
<P>
Former chancellor Norman Lamont told his MP colleagues that a
referendum was both inevitable and right in principle.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, the beaten Tory leadership contender last June
and unofficial Euro-sceptic leader, also backed a commitment to a
referendum to reassure Britain that it would have a veto over a
single currency or any big constitutional changes.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 130 exhibitors from
Africa, Europe and Asia are expected to take part in the second
Addis International Trade Fair which is scheduled to take place
from March 15 to 22.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Shiferaw Bekele, Secretary
General of the Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce in a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Shiferaw said the trade fair is deemed to serve as a platform
for both local and foreign entrepreneurs to exploring the
possibilities of joint venture investments in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair would create a forum where local and
international business communities could come together and reach
agreement to properly tap the vast market potential in Ethiopia,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Shiferaw revealed that the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) are also
registered to take part in the trade fair.
</P>
<P>
"We organize the trade fair to acquaint the international
community with the level and progress of domestic technology and
how Ethiopia is shifting from war to peace and development," he
said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Public Servants Get Wage Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESNBURG, March 8 (Xinhua)-- The minimum starting wage
for South African public servants would be increased by 29.5
percent from 13,200 Rand (about 3,616 US Dollars) to 17,100 Rand
(4,685 Dollars) a year, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in the public service bargaining
council's chamber at central level in Cape Town early today,
spokesman Thanderka Gqubule said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The increase formed part of a new salary upgrading system
which was aimed at retrenching the public service and which would
be implemented over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The package consisted of four interrelated components.
</P>
<P>
There would be remuneration adjustments for the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the public service would be "right-sized" in
accordance with available resources and a voluntary servance
package would aid the service's "right-sizing".
</P>
<P>
The new grading system would be effective from july 1 this
year, said Gqubule, adding the exact method of implementing was
still to be finalised. enditem

Gen. Nasirullah Babaar arrived here today on a five-day visit to
Egypt, during which he will sign an agreement for security
cooperation between Pakistan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister will hold talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Hassan Mohamed el-Alfy and President Hosni Mubarak on
strengthening cooperation in the fields of security.
</P>
<P>
Alfy, at a joint press conference with Babaar following his

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Airlines Plans to Expand International Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Airlines (JAT) plans
to increase its flights to more than 100 lines a week under the
new summer schedule, which will be effective from March 31 to
October 26, the Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti said today.
</P>
<P>
JAT will have regular flights to 36 cities in 26 European and
Mediterranean countries and it will establish lines to Chicago,
New York, Toronto and Montreal in North America as soon as it gets
necessary permits.
</P>
<P>
JAT also plans to fly to South Africa once a week, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
JAT's international flights were sharply reduced in the past
four years due to the U.N.-imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia.
The sanctions were suspended last November 24, one day after the
Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia was initiated.
</P>
<P>
In a plan submitted to the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce, JAT
has announced new flights from Belgrade to Madrid, Barcelona,
Warsaw, Prague, Tunis, Cairo and Amman.
</P>
<P>
JAT will also fly from the town of Pristina in Serbia's
southern province of Kosovo-Metohija to Istanbul, Vienna and
Zurich and from the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica to Rome and
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
JAT also plans to have a number of charter flights, which will
be arranged with domestic and foreign travel agencies, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
To increase its capacity and competence, JAT plans to include
14 more planes -- four DC 9s, two Boeing 727s, five Boeing 737s,
one Atp-72 and two DC 10s -- in its regular traffic during the
summer.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Meet to Discuss Development Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- African ministers met here
today to discuss sustainable development and environment issues
facing Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Conference of African ministers for sustainable
development and environment was established by resolution 757
adopted at the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) conference of
ministers for social and economic development and planning on May
4, 1993.
</P>
<P>
This conference will hold its meeting every four years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the first meeting, U.N.
Under-Secretary General K.Y. Amoako said the meeting "is a forum
of the (African) ministers to review progress in achieving
sustainable growth and development."
</P>
<P>
It is also "a forum of the ministers to decide on an
appropriate policies and strategies to make development
sustainable at national and regional levels," said Amoako who
doubles as ECA Executive Secretary.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot achieve a sustainable environment without
addressing food security, and population, and human settlements,
and poverty itself," he noted, adding that "a direct attack on
poverty, with all the resources that we in Africa and our global
partners can muster, is at the heart of our strategy for
sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian Minister of Agriculture
Teketel Forssido said, "the major theme of this conference is
'facing challenges of sustainable development and environment in
africa.'"
</P>
<P>
He said, "development must meet the needs of the present and
those of future generations contributing to the fulfillment of
socio-economic aspirations and ensuring the integrity of the life
support systems afforded by the environment."
</P>
<P>
"The issue is complex and there is as yet no agreed concrete
plan of action to achieve sustainable development at regional and
global levels," Forssido pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the conference will "become the African forum
for inter-ministerial dialogue aimed at bringing together all the
key actors at the national level to deliberate cross-sectorally
on regional sustainable development program."
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary-General of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Pascal Gayama also spoke at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Calls for Distinction between Resistance, Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A Senior official of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) called here today for a
distinction between the resistance and terrorism, stressing that
the resistance against the Israeli occupation is a legal right
for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There is a resistance and there is a terrorism," said Farouk
Kaddoumi, Director of the PLO's Political Department, while
answering a question on a proposed anti-terrorism international
summit.
</P>
<P>
"It is our right to resist as long as there are Israeli
soldiers on the Palestinian land," he noted, adding that the
resistance is a legal right according to the international
law.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister
Fares Boueiz, Kaddoumi announced that the resistance will
continue until Israel pulls its troops out of the Palestinian
land.
</P>
<P>
On his position toward the international anti-terrorism summit,
 which has been called for by U.S. President Bill Clinton, he
said he was not against the summit conference, but he would
probably not agree to the results that would coming out of this
conference.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against any conference of the conferences," he said,
"but probably I will not agree to the results of this conference."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Hamas, or the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement, is part of the Palestinian national movement and has
its own style and way to struggle against the Israeli occupation,
just as the PLO has its own style.
</P>
<P>
"The Hamas movement is part of the national movement," he
said, "it has its style and its way in the work resisting
the Israeli enemy, and we in the Liberation Organization have
our style in the work."
</P>
<P>
He called for a commitment by Israel to the bases of
the peace process, including the principle of exchanging land
for peace, the withdrawal from the Palestinian land, including
Jerusalem, in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolution 242.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stipulates a return of the legal and political
rights to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after he arrived in Beirut from Damascus at noon
today, Kaddoumi held the meeting with Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources at the Foreign Ministry said that the
50-minute meeting dealt with the lastest developments in the
region, especially the impact of the recent suicide bombings
in Israel, which carried out by members of Hamas, on the
peace process and on the security situation in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
After his short visit to the Lebanese capital, Kaddoumi is
expected to return to Tunis.

<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- An international summit conference
will be held at an Egyptian resort town on March 13 to discuss
means of pushing forward the Middle East peace process and
combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman said today that it was agreed to convene
the conference after consultations since Thursday night among a
number of heads of state and governments concerned over the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, co-hosts of the conference, have extended invitations to
all parties concerned to take part in the summit, the spokesman
was quoted by the Middle East News Agency (MENA) as saying.
</P>

held at Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort on the tip of Sinai peninsula on
the Red Sea coast, the spokesman said.
</P>

The hurriedly arranged summit is apparently aimed at saving the
faltering peace process and promoting security in the wake of four
suicide bombings in Israel that killed 61 people, including the
bombers. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed
responsibility for the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iraq Sign Memorandum of Understanding for Reopening Oil Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Iraq signed here today a
memorandum of understanding related to the technical talks between
the delegations of the two countries, aiming at reopening the
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline should Baghdad agree to
U.N.-supervised limited oil sales.
</P>
<P>
Husnu Dogan, newly-appointed Turkish energy minister, said that
the oil pipeline is very important for his country and Ankara
losses 350 million U.S. dollars each year since the closure of the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Dogan said that the Turkish and Iraqi talks for the technical
issues are "positive" and 16 million tons of petroleum will flow
from northern Iraq to Turkey following the positive results of the
scheduled talks between Iraq and the U.N. on March 11.
</P>
<P>
He added that Turkey would gain 50 million dollars from the
flow of the Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid said that the
talks between Iraqi and Turkish delegations for the reopening of
the pipeline were "very positive."
</P>
<P>
He said that following an agreement between Iraq and the U.N.
to be signed for the oil sale, Iraq and Turkey would make more
cooperation in the economic fields between the two countries in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Rashid and his 10-member delegation went to Ceyhan Monday to
examine the twin pipeline that is the main outlet of Iraqi oil
from the Kirkuk fields. He also visited the port facilities in
Ceyhan, Turkey's Mediterranean port, from which Iraqi oil had
been distributed before the pipeline was closed almost six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Rashid, who arrived in Turkey Monday, will leave Ankara
Saturday for home after his 6-day visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began talks last month with the U.N. on a deal to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a six-month period, on a
renewable basis, to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the talks ended two weeks ago without any
agreement. The second round is scheduled for March 11 in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua)-- About 1000 South Africans
today gathered at Johannesburg's library gardens to show support
for International Women's Day and to demand an end to sexism in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Among their demands were shelters for abused women,
understanding rape counselors, high bail for child abusers and
stricter sentences for men who beat their wives.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, Gautengwss Provincial Government
Premier Tokyo Sexwale stressed the need for more women to be
involved in at all government levels.
</P>
<P>
"We need to make sure that they (women's rights) are not only
enshrined in the constitution, but are also enshrined in homes
and various work places," said Sexwale.
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd stood Nonia Ramphomane, 67, who started one of
the country's first women's groups in 1948, the local chapter of
the Young Women's Christian Association. The group spearheaded
women's literacy, joblessness prevention and abuse prevention.
</P>
<P>
Ramphomane said during her life, she had struggled against
sexist and racist customary laws that denied her house ownership,
and had battled against family members who tried to silence her
fight for equality.
</P>
<P>
Attention now needed to shift from fighting against apartheid
to battling sexism, she noted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not to Protect Canadian Firms in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian companies doing businesses
in Cuba should not count on U.S. President Bill Clinton to protect
them from lawsuits under the new anti-Cuba legislation, U.S.
Ambassador to Canada James Blanchard has warned.
</P>
<P>
"Just because Bill Clinton loves Canada, which he does, doesn't
mean somehow he would exercise that waiver," Blanchard was quoted
as saying by today's Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any guarantee here. That has to be
said," the ambassador stressed, much to the disappointment of
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
prepares to make his first official visit to Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy will try to convince the Clinton administration that
it is in the U.S. national interest to waive provisions of the
legislation that leaves foreign companies vulnerable to lawsuits
by U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
The legislation allows such waivers and "it's therefore up to
the president of the United States to exercise," Axworthy was
quoted as saying by the report.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was passed by Congress Wednesday and is waiting
Clinton's signature, allows exiles in the U.S. whose property was
expropriated by Cuba to sue foreign companies whose Cuban
operations involve those properties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president is allowed to protect foreign firms from
legal actions. But he must first certify to the Congress that the
waiver is both in the national interest of the U.S. and will
"expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba."

<HEADLINE> UUP to Meet Bruton on Ulster Consultations Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party which strongly defends British rule over Northern
Ireland, will meet next Monday three leaders of the Irish
coalition government, according to a report in the Irish Times.
</P>
<P>
The UUP leader accompanied by deputy leader John Taylor and his
chief whip the Rev Martin Smith to discuss with the Irish
government plans for elections in Northern Ireland which is the
main theme of the current consultations among the British and
Irish governments and political parties.
</P>
<P>
Since the consultations started on March 4, the UUP and smaller
Democratic Unionist Party have refused to have talks with the
Irish government in Northern Ireland as they consider presence of
the Irish government representatives in the consultations in
Northern Ireland an interference in the "internal affairs" of the
province.
</P>
<P>
An Irish government spokesman described the meeting between the
UUP delegation and the Irish government as "very important" and he
hoped such a meeting would be the "first of many".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the meeting would be in an atmosphere where
interests they shared were greater than the differences.
</P>
<P>
It is reported both in London and Dublin that so far political
parties in Northern Ireland have not agreed on a common election
system in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that this issue will be finally
decided by the British government at the decision at the end of
the current 10-day period for intensive consultations among the
Ulster political parties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Construction spending
rose a slight 0.3 percent in January, the Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that spending on residential,
nonresidential and public projects totaled 537.6 billion U.S.
dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 536 billion
dollars in last December.
</P>
<P>
The small increase of the construction spending was solely due
to government outlays as the severe cold winter curbed building
activities in the country. But it still surprised many analysts
who had expected a slight dip.
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight advance after a 0.8 percent decline
in November. Spending had risen 0.5 percent in December and the
January figure was 3.2 percent above that of the same month in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Government outlays increased 2.3 percent, to 149 billion
dollars, the third consecutive gain. Spending rose 4.7 percent for
schools and 8.9 percent for other public buildings. Street and
highway outlays were up 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
But residential spending dipped 0.5 percent, to 240.5 billion
dollars, nearly erasing a 0.6 percent advance in December.
</P>
<P>
Single-family home outlays were off 0.5 percent, the second
straight drop. Spending on multi-family homes, a volatile category
not as sensitive to interest rate changes, fell 1.9 percent after
jumping 7.9 percent a month earlier. Nonresidential spending,
which had shot up 2.1 percent in December, slipped 0.1 percent a
month later, to 114.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Pursuit of "Taiwan Independence" Risky for Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- An article to be published by the
editorial departments of two leading Chinese newspapers say Lee
Teng-hui is to blame for the present heightened tension in the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The article, to be published tomorrow (Saturday) by the
People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, says the situation
in the straits which was intensified, and the island plunged into
chaos after the announcement of the latest round of guided missile
tests in east China and south China seas by the Chinese armed
forces, was brought about by Lee's advocation of "Taiwan
Independence", and his vigorous attempts of creating "Two Chinas"
and "One China, One Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
"The real danger (facing Taiwan) is allowing Lee's attempts to
continue with the 'Taiwan independence' stance unchecked, so
jeopardizing the efforts to reunify the motherland", which will
bring about extreme serious disaster for the 21 million Taiwan
compatriots, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say the consequence is "what we are unwilling to
see and should never be allowed to come about".
</P>
<P>
Disregarding the strong aspiration of people on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits for reunification, and the central government's
efforts for peaceful reunification, Lee has been using every
opportunity available to him to challenge the principle of one
China, and said he is only "the most courageous" by confronting
the Chinese mainland, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lee's talking and actions favoring Taiwan independence are also
to blame for the rampant forces of "Taiwan Independence" in the
Taiwan island, it says.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the splittist activities do not stop for a single
day, our anti-splittism struggle will not stop for a single day,"
the article warns.
</P>
<P>
It points out if Lee continues along the dangerous road, there
would be no future for Taiwan to speak of, since the Taiwan
economy is characterised by a lack of raw materials, and a small
market within the island, from which the Taiwan people will suffer.
</P>
<P>
The article says as Lee has walked further and further along the
road of "Taiwan Independence", and if his attempt to split the
motherland is put into practice, "the consequence is what we are
unwilling to speak of, but obvious".
</P>
<P>
"Our persistence in the policy of peaceful reunification, but
never undertaking not to use force is not directed at
Taiwan compatriots, but at the attempts by some foreign forces
to interfere in the reunification of China, as well as 'Taiwan
Independence'", it explains.
</P>
<P>
The article ends by warning that "we mean what we say should
foreign interference or "Taiwan independence" appear some day. We
will use all possible means to safeguard the unity of our
country."

<P>
HAIKOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States defeated Cuba 88-75
Friday night to set up a final with China of the Haikou stop in the
Chinese Women's Basketball Invitational Tournament.
</P>
<P>
The host rallied from a nine-point deficit during the first half to
edge South Korea 77-73 earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It will be very interesting game between China and our team
tomorrow night," said Tara Vanoerveer, the American head coach who
led the United States to a third place in the 1994 world champoinship.
</P>
<P>
"It's a different team with the 1994 team. The team now put better
together and each of them played to extension tonight, so we won the
game."
</P>
<P>
The Americans met a tough challenge in the first half and trailed
for more than two minutes by 1-3 point before finishing a 43-39 lead
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Cuba got the margin no closer than four points before the United
States dominated midway through the second half with as many as
15-point edge with 20 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Azzi scored 19 points inlcuding four 3-pointers for the
United States, while Licet Castillo paced Cuba with 15.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Haixia scored a game-high 33 points as China rolled over
South Korea, who trounced its Chinese counterparter with
a big margin in the gold medal final of the 1994 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea built a 29-20 lead with a 19-10 run with 8:30 to
play in the first half. However, Liang Xin, 21, scored her nine of 16
points and Zheng added seven points to key China in a 22-13 run.
</P>
<P>
China, the silver medalist of the 1992 Olympics and 1994 world
championships, led the first half at 44-42.
</P>
<P>
Jung Sun-Min hit 18 points for South Korea, which leveled at 69-69
with 4:20 remaining. 2.05-meter center Zheng scored six and Liang
took a Layup to fend off the South Korea's last comeback.
</P>
<P>
Guard Kwun-Jeong contributed 15 points for South Korea, all from
the three-pointer range including four in the first half.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the excellent performance of my players today,"
said Lee Byung-Kuk, the new head coach of the South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We had the chance to win the game if we were used to match the
judge of the two Chinese refrees whose calling way on the court was
different from the way in our country."
</P>
<P>
But the coach admitted "Zheng was too hard for my players to stop".
</P>
<P>
Said the Chinese head coach Chen Daohong: "I'm just satisfied with
Zheng and Liang's performance. Our teamwork between inside and
outside was not good and our young players played too nervous."

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has denied Jordanian
allegations that it has imported spare parts for warplanes,
saying the items imported are used for agricultural purposes
under the U.N. permission.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq News Agency (INA) today quoted a Foreign Ministry
spokesman as saying that the spare parts, including engines, were
meant to be fixed in helicopters used for agricultural purposes by
the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture with the knowledge of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a Jordanian government spokesman has said
that the Jordanian Authorities have seized spare parts for
warplanes at the Queen Aliya airport on their way from Poland to
Iraq which are not classified under material Iraq was allowed to
import by U.N..
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman stressed that it is not the first time that
Iraq receives such spare parts under the U.N. permission.
</P>
<P>
He said that this type of helicopters, the Russian-built M-2,
is known for use in agricultural purposes. The helicopters belong
to the Agricultural Aviation Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The use of the spare parts for agriculture purposes is not

<HEADLINE> South African Minister On Envisaged Trade Pact With Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo said today the long-awaited bilateral trade pact with
Zimbabwe would "eventually" be signed.
</P>
<P>
Nzo told Zimbabwean journalists during a stop-over at Harare
International Airport that his government is currently working on
the agreement, but could not say when the agreement is likely to
be signed.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say anything at the moment about the agreement
because my colleague who is dealing with the issue did not brief
me before I came here," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
"But what I can say at the moment is that it will be signed in
the long-run," he added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Zimbabwe have in the past two years held
on-and-off talks to review the outdated 1964 trade pact reached
when the then Rhodesia was isolated following an international
trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is Zimbabwe's largest trading partner on the
continent. It has been dragging its feet on signing a new
agreement, saying it prefers a multilateral arrangement with
other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nzo left here for Lusaka on his first visit to Zambia since
the government of national unity took over in 1994 to discuss
ways of enhancing bilateral relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Over 2,500 Died from Meningitis Outbreak in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of cerebrospinal
meningitis which started in northern Nigeria in January have
infected nearly 18,000 people as of March 5, among them 2,550
have died, the World Health Organization (WHO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures is an update of the 8,400 cases of
infections and 1,181 deaths reported a week ago. WHO spokesman
Philippe Stroot said the sharp increase in numbers is partly due
to incomplete reporting in the former case.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference Friday that about 21 percent of the
patients are under four years old and 60 percent belong to the age
group of five to 14 years. Overall, 99 percent of the patients are
under 29 years.
</P>
<P>
Apart from cerebrospinal meningitis, the WHO was also informed
of 2,836 cases of cholera and 2,121 cases of measles in Nigeria
since early this year, 299 people have died of cholera and 104
died of measles so far.
</P>
<P>
Two other western African countries, Niger and Mali, were also
struck by Cholera since early this year.

<HEADLINE> Power Networks To Save $1.6 Billion For SADC Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- About 1.6 billion U.S. dollars
will be saved in the short to medium term through integrated
cooperation in electrical power networks in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
who was speaking at a switching ceremony of the
Matimba-Insukamini inter-connector in western Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this would enable the region of 180 million people
to maintain competitive prices and accelerate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
''Provision of competitively prices and reliable electricity
is also essential to increase electrification rate for rural and
low income groups in our communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, only about 20 percent of households has access to
electricity. An estimated 36 million people only has access to
electricity in the 12-member regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
But, Mugabe warned that although grid extension was necessary,
resources were limited and rural electrification would take
longer.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is current chairman of the World Solar Commission,
said he hoped a major solar summit scheduled for Harare in
September would map out strategies to promote use of solar
energy.

<HEADLINE> Britain Cuts Interest Rates to 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain cut its official interest
rates Friday by 0.25 percent to 6 percent to stimulate the
economy, the Bank of England said. This is the third cut in four
months.
</P>
<P>
The cut, which had been widely expected by financial markets,
followed a regular monthly meeting on Thursday between Chancellor
of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie
George.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said in a statement that producer prices had weakened
and in the last three months producerinput prices were almost four
percent lower than in the previous three months. The evidence had
confirmed that inflationary pressures had continued to ease.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth remains healthy but gross domestic product for
the fourth quarter data confirm that output is currently growing
below trend. This should exert continuing downward pressure on
inflation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage lenders responded by saying they would lower their
rates, with the Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest home
loan company, reducing its mortgage rate by 0.24 percent to 7.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that with an election due by May 1997, Clarke is
under pressure from fellow Conservatives to cut rates as much as
possible to improve the government's weak opinion-poll ratings.
</P>
<P>
But Clarke insists that he will only cut rates when it is
prudent to do so.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa To Boost Power Supplies In SADC Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's power utility,
ESKOM, is prepared to cooperate with other organisations to boost
power supplies in the Southern African Development Community
(SADC )states.
</P>
<P>
ESKOM Executive Director Piet Failing said that greater access
to electricity by people would set the stage for economic growth
and cooperation between SADC states.
</P>
<P>
At the commissioning of Matimba-Insukamini power substation in
western Zimbabwe, Failing said, ''ESKOM reiterates its commitment
to tackle urgent needs of growth and development through
providing and creating opportunities for closer cooperation
between countries in our region.''
</P>
<P>
The project enables Zimbabwe to import up to 500 megawatts of
power from South Africa through Botswana.
</P>
<P>
SADC member states, last year, signed an inter-government and
inter-utility memoranda of understanding, committing themselves
to establishing a regional power pool.
</P>
<P>
The pool involves linking as many countries as possible into a
single network of electric power lines.
</P>
<P>
" Now that the power pool is a reality, we will be able to
gradually improve supply of electricity to areas presently not
well served,'' Failing said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Bank Forced to Close on Anonymous Bomb Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's central bank, the
People's Bank, was forced to suspend business for one day after it
received an anonymous phone call yesterday warning that terrorists
had planted bombs in the bank's building.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the building immediately but found no bombs
at all.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the U.S. dollar dipped to 78 lev during the bank's
closure, one day after the dollar soared sharply from 79 to 85
against the lev during Wednesday's trading.
</P>
<P>
The incident evoked widespread speculations among bankers and
financial experts, who suspected that the close-down was
engineered by the People's Bank deliberately to upset smaller
banks.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian President Zheliu Zhelev was asked to intervene, and
the International Monetary Fund also urged Bulgaria to set up a
special commission led by the prime minister to stabilize the
financial market.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure, the People's Bank has announced two
policies to raise the depositary interest rate of the lev and
fully guarantee depositors' rights even in case of a bank
bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Rate Drops to 5.5 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in U.S.
fell to 5.5 percent in February, the U.S. Labour Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The employment saw a gain of 705,000 job last month, the
biggest monthly increase since 1983. The Labor Department said
that it is the strongest evidence to date that an extended period
of economic weakness, worsened by bad weather last month, could be
coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the unemployment rate to 5.5.percent returned it to
the level it had been in last October. It remained around 5.6
percent for the most months of last year but surged to 5.8 percent
last January.
</P>
<P>
Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, said that much of February's strength represented a
bounce-back from the severe weather in January.
</P>
<P>
"The largest increase in employment over the month was in the
services industry," she said, noting an increase of 287,000 jobs.
But she said some of the biggest gains were in private education
and amusement and recreation services, which simply reversed big
weather-related drops the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Employment in construction industries rose 121,000 in February,
the biggest monthly increase since a gain of 122,000 in February
1984.
</P>
<P>
Even manufacturing, which suffered heavy layoffs for most of
1995 as factories cut back production to work off an excess of
inventories, showed improvement in February and rose by 26,000
jobs. But it is still down by 267,000 jobs from its recent peak in
March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Employment in the health industry was up 46,000 in February
while transportation added 23,000 jobs and government employment
rose by 42,000 with this increase coming mostly in state and local
education.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call For Enhanced Enterprise Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What keeps bothering the government is that state-owned
enterprises are a major source of revenues for the central
government, and wide differences in different parts of the country
make it impossible for the government to produce a widely
applicable reform program that will not seriously affect revenues.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise yet a sensible decision, Chinese leaders
selected 18 cities, 100 enterprises and 56 enterprise groups to
conduct trial reform experiments.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, reform programs in the 100 enterprises
and 56 enterprise groups had gone into implementation. Although
carefully deliberated, their results still remain to be seen.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, projects in the 18 cities have progressed
farther. A total of 1.4 million redundant workers have been laid
off, and over 160 enterprises declared bankrupt or started legal
proceedings for bankruptcy. This no doubt serves as a warning to
others with poor management.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last year, Chinese officials have also
reached a consensus that the government should focus its endeavors
on a small number of core enterprises vital for the national
economy and people's livelihood, and give up interferences into
ordinary enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The state has designated 1,000 large state-owned enterprises
for government support.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ruifu, director of Hunan's provincial finance department,
favors the policy, saying "it is a policy aimed at taking along
the whole state-owned sector by focusing on key enterprises."
</P>
<P>
In its reform of the economic system, the Chinese government
will focus on state-owned enterprise reform while promoting
reforms in other fields, and spread the experience of successful
pilot projects to gear most large and medium-sized backbone
enterprises to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai deputy Wu Bangguo, also China's vice premier in charge
of industry, says, "State-owned enterprises face a range of
problems,...and it will take a long time to find solutions for
them."
</P>
<P>
He believes basic policies and goals for enterprise reform have
been defined, and it is possible to make a success of the reform
with concerted efforts by both the government and enterprises.

ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani government is making

women, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function in connection with the International

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Propose Legislation on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China should make more laws on
Taiwan affairs to contain the attempt of foreign forces for
splitting China and the force of "Taiwan independence" and win
supports from the Taiwan people, NPC deputies proposed today.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to create a legal basis for speeding up the
pace of reunification, according to several Taiwan deputies at a
panel discussion of the ongoing National People's Congress (NPC)
session.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ansheng proposed to formulate a law on development of
cross-Straits relations and promotion of the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Both the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese
government have done a lot to contribute to the cause of
reunification and set forth the framework of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems," Wang noted. And
President Jiang Zemin made an eight-point proposal on this issue
last year and Premier Li Peng further illustrated the country's
position earlier this year, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To win understanding and support from the people in Taiwan,
China should make the relevant conceptions and policies into law,
and build up their confidence so that the concept of "one country,
two systems" can be realized, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independent forces in Taiwan account for only a tiny
proportion of the population there, the deputy said, who just
returned from Taiwan, noting that most of them are in favor of
reunification of the motherland, but do not know what is the "one
country, two systems" and how two systems will be implemented in
one country.
</P>
<P>
"Their confidence could be beefed up by our legislation, and
their initiatives can be brought into full play for the cause of
reunification," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, such a law will help China in opposing foreign
forces's interference in its internal affairs, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the new law should include stipulation on Taiwan's
position in China, protection of Taiwan people's rights and
interests and the promotion of cross-Straits cooperation and
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
It should be made clear in the law that Taiwan is part of China
and its autonomy rights shall be ensured after reunification.
Detailed regulations on safeguarding the interests of Taiwan
people must be made. And the law may rule that the decisions made
in routine negotiations of the two sides are the basis of
people-to-people exchanges, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Lin Liyun, also a member of the NPC Standing Committee, said
that China should also formulate a basic law on the Taiwan Special
Administration at an appropriate time, so as to better protect the
interests of the Taiwan people and do away with their doubts and
misunderstanding about the perception of "one country, two
systems".

<P>
MOSCOW, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani today called for a political settlement of the conflict in
Tajikistan, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference in Dushanbe on his two-day working
visit to Tajikistan, Rabbani said the Tajik authorities and the
opposition should look for a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
He praised a new initiative of Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov, who expressed readiness to meet Tajik opposition leader
Said Abdullo Nuri at any place to sign a peace treaty
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani suggested the Tajik President and the opposition leader
meet in the Afghan capital of Kabul, where they held their first
meeting last spring.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 people have fled their home-town to
Afghanistan and other neighboring countries since the Tajik civil
war broke out in 1992. About 50,000 people have been killed in the
war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rabbani called his visit successful, saying that he
and Rakhmonov discussed all issues of mutual concern, including
the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, regional security as
well as economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> China to Recruit More MBA Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China is to recruit 1,500 MBA
students this year, and allow more colleges and universities to
grant MBA degrees.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xu Guohua, from the School of Economic Management,
Qinghua University, announced the moves today at a press
conference to launch a global management challenge contest.
</P>
<P>
The first graduates with MBA degrees had finished their studies
at the Qinghua University last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
China officially started the MBA program in 1991, when the
State Education Commission authorized trials of an MBA teaching
program at nine universities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The universities included Qinghua University, Shanghai Jiaotong
University, and Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
But similar programs in economic management tuition were
launched by overseas universities in 1981, he added.
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that the graduates then were not granted
MBA degree diplomas, he said.
</P>
<P>
China now has 26 colleges and universities that provide MBA
programs. But MBA graduates are still meeting the growing needs of
companies and enterprises in senior management personnel.
</P>
<P>
The contest - Global Management Challenge, China '96 - is being
co-sponsored by the Portugal Embassy to China, German-based
Daimler-Benz AG, and the giant Andersen Consulting company. The
winner of the contest will attend the final game to be held in
Lisbon this Summer.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese MBA degree holders have registered for the
contest, say the organization committee.
</P>
<P>
This will be an occasion for Chinese MBAs to compete with their
counterparts in Europe, Mario Ferreira, official of the Portugal
Embassy said, and this will be helpful in bilateral cultural
exchanges, strengthening the friendship between the two
countries.

means of integrated agricultural development.

the province plans to increase its grain output by 500 million

improving the low-yielding land, raising multiple cropping index,
extensive use of fine seeds and development of vast tidal zones. With
efforts in popularizing agriculture-related science and

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call for Enhanced Effort in Enterprise Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- It is no exaggeration for China's
state-owned enterprises to be described as "being plagued with
difficulties." The view is shared by most deputies attending the
on-going session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Reform of state-owned enterprises has been on top of the agenda
of the Chinese government, which called 1995 "Year of the
Enterprise Reform." A year later, however, China's state-owned
enterprises are still in the red despite endeavors by governments
at various levels.
</P>
<P>
The situation is even worse in statistics. In 1994, some 30
percent of state-owned enterprises lost money, but the figure went
as high as more than 40 percent at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
"The reform steps are too small and it's more difficult to take
any concrete steps," said Wang Dingwu, general manager of a
medium-sized state-owned enterprise in east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneur expressed his deep concern of unfair
competition between state-owned enterprises and enterprises of
other ownership.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We must give state-owned enterprises free rein so
that they can go from the same starting point with township
enterprises."
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, state-owned enterprises make
up 20 percent of China's total. These enterprises have employed
more than half of the country's workers, of whom many are living
in disguised unemployment. For social security reasons, however,
the state has to keep these surplus workers on payrolls.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's state-owned enterprises have to pay higher
taxes compared with foreign-funded and township enterprises.
Though debt-ridden, these enterprises have to donate for social
activities under pressure from their administrative bosses.
</P>
<P>
"Many state-owned enterprises participate in market economic
activities with planned economy thinking," said You Junming, a
famous township entrepreneur from Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Survival of the fittest, a law in competition, has never been
introduced into China's state-owned enterprises, said Xu Tanglin,
a noted economist from Hunan.
</P>
<P>
These issues, which have drawn great concern from the NPC
deputies, are clearly seen by government officials. Li Peng,
premier of the State Council, admitted, "State-owned
enterprises are hit by many difficulties and their management
structure and mechanism are incompatible with a
socialist market economy."

<P>
TIANJIN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan businesses eyeing the
mainland market should set their sights on boom city Tianjin, the
leader of a trade delegation said in China's third biggest city
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Pingzhao, heading more than 200 delegates from Taiwan to
Tianjin, said today "Tianjin's good investment environment has
provided ideal conditions for Taiwan companies to exist and
develop." The delegation is conducting trade and investment talks
with Tianjin counterparts, which started here today.
</P>
<P>
He added, "Tianjin's fame is now skyrocketing in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Tianjin had approved more than 1,000
Taiwan-funded projects, attracting investments worth 1.5 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuzu, director of the Tianjin Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Commission, said that most of the Taiwan-funded
enterprises in Tianjin are operating soundly with their profits
rising year after year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from his commission show that last year sales by
Taiwan-funded enterprises exceeded five billion yuan, more than
double the 1994 level. The firms generated over 500 million yuan
in profits last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang cited the instant success story of a noodle company. Just
five years ago the company only had two production
lines, but now 28 lines are producing instant noodles. The company
has seen its assets appreciate tenfold.
</P>
<P>
He Shizhong, deputy director of the Economic Bureau at the
State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said that he believed trade
cooperation and personal exchanges will continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
He again confirmed that the rights and interests of Taiwan
businesses in the mainland will be protected and well-guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Local Leaders on Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the National People's
Congress, China's parliament, have devoted much of their panel
discussions to agriculture, which Premier Li Peng described as a
weak link in the national economy in his report on national
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Li Chunding, governor of east China's Shandong Province, said
that agriculture will continue to be on top of his government work
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to enlarge effective supply of farm produce and
increase the income of farmers by a large margin," Li said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a stable increase in total output, Li said, Shandong
will take measures to maintain the acreage for grain, cotton and
oil, promote the use of good seed varieties and advanced farming
methods, and raise the multiple cropping index.
</P>
<P>
As one of the largest grain producers of China, Shandong's size
of farmland by the end of this century will be no less than 6.7
million ha and total grain output will reach 45 million tons,
which translates into 500 kg per capita, Li envisaged.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, a vast and sparsely-populated autonomous region in
the northwest, will be turned into a production base for
commercial grain in five years, said Wang Lequan, secretary of the
regional committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic development, a growing population and an
improving living standard of the Chinese have coincided with
reducing farmland and expanding demand for grain in the more
developed coastal provinces, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Xinjiang has begun drawing more attention from
the rest of the country for its farming potential, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a practical choice for Xinjiang to develop agriculture,"
Wang said, explaining that his region has a vast area, a small
population and rich water resources.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the pillar industry of Xinjiang, Wang said. He
noted that the regional cotton output, at 950 million kg last
year, is the largest in China.
</P>
<P>
The regional grain output reached 7.47 million tons in 1995, up
870,000 kg from the previous year, according to Wang.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Buddhist Believers Support New Panchen Lama (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guaga Losanglamqo, a 68-year-old CPPCC National Committee
member, had been working for the 10th Panchen Lama since the
1950s, and later engaged in managing his residence in Xigaze of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the magnificent enthronement ceremony for the
reincarnation of the 11th Panchen Lama, Guaga said that at least
50,000 believers paid homage to the new Panchen Lama that day. One
by one, they received forehead-touching from the little Panchen
Lama. Many stayed there for long awaiting to obtain a photo of the
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
All residents in Xigaze Prefecture enshrine the photo of the
11th Panchen Lama at their homes, Guaga said. He witnessed that in
Lhasa that large numbers of his photos were available along the
Bargor Street.
</P>
<P>
Yabxi Soinam Zhoima, the mother of the 10th Panchen Lama, has
been living at her home in Qinghai Province over the past years.
She loves to live a secluded life even as she is attending the
CPPCC session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen the little Panchen Lama on TV, and found that he
looks very much like the 10th Panchen Lama as a child. From the
bottom of my heart, I am contented with the confirmation of the
11th Panchen," she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her hope that the new Panchen Lama, like his
predecessor the 10th Panchen Lama, is devoted to the motherland
and Tibetan Buddhism and safeguarding ethnic unity.
</P>
<P>
Agya Lobsangtubdain Gyume Gyaco in red kasaya is also a member
of the CPPCC National Committee. The senior Living Buddha comes
from the Taer Monastery in Qinghai Province, an area inhabited by
many locals of the Tibetan nationality, and the monastery is the
largest lamaist institute in Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
He expects that the 11th Panchen Lama grow up well-educated and
the influences caused by the rumors of the Dalai clique at abroad
can be cleared.
</P>
<P>
"Dalai's announcement on a so-called `soul boy' is entirely a
political plot backed up by hostile forces in the West, and is
another criminal evidence of to his activities for splitting the
motherland and undermining the normal order of Tibetan Buddhism,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lhamon Sonan Lonzhub, who used to be a secretary of the 10th
Panchen Lama and is now a CPPCC National Committee member, said
that all Buddhist sectors in Tibet believe in the 10th Panchen
Lama's reincarnation confirmed in front of the statue of Sakyamuni
through lot-drawing from a gold urn.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's activities were aimed at undermining Tibet's
economic expansion and Tibetan people's stable life, and then
splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Dalai Lama is qualified for a religious
leader, for he has smeared his reputation as a Living Buddha,"
Lhamon said. "We will no longer recognize his religious status,
and we support the new 11th Panchen Lama located and confirmed
through valid means."

<HEADLINE> Fleet Buyers Help Fuel February Car Sales in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Britain last month
reached their highest February level for six years, but there was
little comfort for manufacturers in the figures.
</P>
<P>
New car registrations reached 159,013 in February, 4.4 percent
more than last February's 152,329 record, the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This brought registrations for the first two months of the year
to 350,774, 2.1 percent up from the same period last year when the
total was 343,515.
</P>
<P>
But car makers are concerned that the rise in sales is mainly
owed to big deals with company and fleet buyers, who bought 57
percent of the total sales, rather than individual motorists.
</P>
<P>
Although consumer spending went up in the past months, experts
say there was little sign it is extending to car buying.
Individuals created 43 percent of the sales in February, down from
44 percent in the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
"The downward trend in purchasing by the private sector is
still a cause for concern," said Chief Executive of the SMMT Ernie
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
Experts say a 4 percent rise in prices last year has
discouraged individual buyers and increasingly pushed them into
the second-hand car market for low mileage models.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A Living Buddha who is present at
the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC)
National Committee, said local Tibetans in his hometown pledged
their support for the 11th Panchen Lama whose photo has been
enshrined by Buddhist believers.
</P>
<P>
Living Buddha Gyabgon Badandoje 45, is an NPC deputy from the
Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Garze, with a population of more
than 800,000, in southwestern Sichuan Province. Like his fellow
folks, he has enthrined a photo of himself with little Panchen.
</P>
<P>
"I took part in the 11th Panchen Lama's enthronement ceremony,
and had honor to receive his blessed forehead-touching," Gyabgon
said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held in the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery of Tibet in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
"Religious figures of Tibetan Buddhism, who are here for the
on-going NPC annual session and the Chinese People's Political
Consulative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, all feel joyous
this year," Gyabgon said. "We have at last located the
reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama six years after his
passing."
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe in the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen
Lama that was determined through lot-drawing from a gold urn, and
support the 11th Panchen Lama whole-heartly," Gyabgon said. "And
we held that the so-called soul boy determined by the Dalai Lama
is illegal and invalid."
</P>
<P>
Senqin Losangjisam, an NPC deputy from Tibet, had participated
in the all the activities related to searching the 10th Panchen
Lama's soul boy, lot-drawing and enthronement.
</P>
<P>
"The activities were held in strict accordance with religious
rituals, historical conventions and the will of the 10th Panchen
Lama," Senqin said. "All monks and laymen celebrated the grand
occasion for Tibetan Buddhism, and support the 11th Panchen Lama
whole-heartedly."
</P>
<P>
Living Buddha Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Ngima comes
from the Lapuleng Monastery, the largest Tibetan Buddhist
monastery in Gansu Province, and he is a member of the Eighth
CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Like Senqin, he was also a member of the team to search for and
locate the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, and took part
in the lot-drawing and enthronement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
"All activities have been fulfiled, and I feel overjoyed," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) has decided
to grant its 1995 Human Resources Development Award to an Indian
research center.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the UNESCAP today, the award

<HEADLINE> Metro Workers Continue Strike in Bucharest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The metro workers' strike in the
Romanian capital of Bucharest has entered the fifth day, causing
much trouble to the city's public traffic.
</P>
<P>
Because of the close-down of the subways, more than 700,000
people have to change to buses or private cars for commuting, and
there was heavier than normal traffic in downtown Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The metro workers started the strike on March 4 in support of a
48 percent pay rise, but Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu
said there was no reason for them to ask for a higher pay.
</P>
<P>
Metro workers earned an average of 153 U.S. dollars in January,
1996, compared with the average monthly salary of 116 dollars for
other workers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 98 percent of the subway income went to metro workers'
salary payment, and a higher pay demand would force the government
to allocate more money from its budget to support the underground
railway industry.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Traian Chebelen said he was surprised
when he heard about the metro workers striking for wage hikes.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court may give a final judgement if the strike
continues.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Rwandan Children Still Suffer From 1994 Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan children are suffering
serious psychological trauma after being exposed to "unprecedented
traumatic events," such as killings and beatings, during the 1994
genocide, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in a report
released today.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF report, 95 percent of Rwandan children
interviewed in a nationwide survey had witnessed violence and
killings during the genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said more than one-third of the interviewees had
seen children taking part in killings or beatings, and 31 percent
had witnessed rape or sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of children lost immediate family members
during the war and more than one-third had witnessed the killing
of their family members.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF report highlights the findings of a survey carried
out in 1995 by UNICEF's Trauma Recovery Program based in Rwanda's
capital, Kigali. Over 3,000 randomly selected children, aged
between eight and 19 years, from 11 prefectures of Rwanda, were
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Other findings of the survey include:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 80 percent of children said they had to hide to
protect themselves, many for up to eight weeks or longer; 16
percent hid under dead bodies;
</P>
<P>
-- The majority of children saw their homes destroyed or looted,
</P>
<P>
-- Almost all children believed they would die during the
fighting and nearly two-thirds were threatened with death.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that many children continued to have
intrusive images, thoughts and feelings one year after the
genocide, though they had tried to forget the terrible events and
to avoid situations or things that would remind them of the events.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the children said they sometimes or often
suffered from trembling, sweating or increased heart rate when
they saw things that reminded them of the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF said serious attention must be given to these
children survivors in order to restore a sense of hopefulness
about their future and to prevent chronical depression and anxiety
disorders.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has trained over 6,000 trauma advisors in all 11
prefectures in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
These advisors, who are mostly teachers, health and social
workers and community leaders, have so far assisted about 144,000
traumatized children. Treatment includes simple methods of
expression such as story telling, talking, writing and drawing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an outpatient clinic was created in July 1995 at
the National Trauma Center in Kigali to provide intensive
therapeutic care to severely traumatized children and their
families.

city in the country, Wei Jianxing said today.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the
Communist Party of China also called on the capital's people to
play their part by setting the standards for a society built on
the best of moods, morals and justice.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, who is also member of the CPC Central Committee
Political Bureau, said Beijing should place culture and ideology
construction in a more prominent position.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that capital, as political and cultural center of the
country, should also be built into the finest place in China, in
terms of a socialist culture and ideology.
</P>

<P>
Instructions given by the central authorities to Beijing

city in China. Standards of education and science should be high,
and the city should display the best mood of society, morals and
prevailing customs, and democratic legal system.

losses to the economic construction of the capital, but also
ruined some cadres, and even worse, effected the city's

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng called on
China's biggest agricultural province to produce more grain,
raise more pigs, and develop farm produce processing.
</P>
<P>
"A big agricultural province, Sichuan should always treat
developing agriculture as the top priority," he said at a panel
discussion of the province's deputies to the National People's
Congress in session here.
</P>
<P>
"In agriculture, Sichuan should do two things: first, make sure
that it can feed its own people, and second, raise more pigs," he
told deputies of the province with a population of more than 100
million.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has rich water and gas resources; it has
skilled people and technology; and its people can bear
hardships, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sichuan has a bright future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan can further tap its agricultural potential by applying
practical and new farming techniques, improving crop varieties and
increase the rate of multiple cropping, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on Sichuan to vitalize its state enterprises
by making better use of advances in science and technology.

performance of state-owned enterprises to maintaining unity among
different ethnic groups and development of local water resources.
</P>
<P>

Shanghai and its New Pudong Area, which is still under way, should
raise their levels of opening-up so as to better serve as an
examplary role for the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
China should continue to open up new areas for drawing foreign
investment and pay closer attention to the quality of such
investment, he said, adding that it will guide the investment to
the areas and projects that are badly needed in line with its
industrial policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for developing foreign trade and exploring
international market and efforts to be made to increase
value-added export commodities to raise the competitiveness of
China's export products.
</P>
<P>
In the panel discussion, Jiang said it is of far-reaching
importance to implement the strategies of developing the country
by relying on science and education, and in achieving
modernization and realizing the two fundamental shifts.

<P>
In the panel discussion, Jiang told Shanghai officials to work

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Confers Development Program with Shanghai Panel (1)  (Eds: This is the final text of Jiang's remarks) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin joined in
the discussion with Shanghai deputies, addressing such issues as
reform of state-owned enterprises, reunification of Taiwan,
opening to the outside world, and the importance of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
In the ongoing session of the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's parliament, Jiang said the state-owned enterprises play
the backbone role in China's national economy and serve as the
force leading the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The reinvigoration of the state-owned enterprises directly
concerns the cause of reform and modernization drive. Their reform
and development must gear up to the demands of building modern
enterprise system, and to the integration of reform,
reorganization, transformation with the building of a leading
body, a contingent of workers and scientific management.
</P>
<P>
China must bear in mind market demands when adopting the policy
of selecting the bigger and superior enterprises and letting free
the smaller and inferior ones, a guideline to enliven the
country's state-owned enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
By setting free the smaller and inferior, it is not meant that
these enterprises can left alone or their assets simply sold out,
he said. Instead, he added, "we should beef up their pace for
revamping by means of re-organization, association, merger into
joint stock partnership, leasing, contractural operation or
sell-out, as their specific circumstances permit."
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee, urged localities to establish a large number of
enterprise groups and multinational corporations with the backing
of major projects. This move, he said, is aimed to attain scale
economy and scale performance and enhance their competitive edge
on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the issue of reunification of Taiwan, he said during
a recent period of time, new complexities have emerged in
relations across the Taiwan Straits and they have aroused great
concern among people of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said Taiwan is an unalienable part of China and the country will
never allow any force in any way to change Taiwan's status as a
part of it.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Taiwan authorities are refusing to abandon
their activities aimed at splitting the motherland even for a
single day, our struggle against such activities will also not
cease even for a single day," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He told the deputies that "We will continue to develop
relations across the Straits and encourage Taiwan businesspeople
to invest in the mainland and protect their legitimate rights and
interests."

<HEADLINE> First Container Ship Between Xiamen and U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A container ship between the East
China Sea and the United States left this week, heralding the
start of a new sea route.
</P>
<P>
The vessel sailed from Xiamen, heading to the US port of
Oakland. It is the first sea route linking the special economic
zone on the East China Sea coast with America.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen Port handled 309,700 containers in 1995, ranking fifth
in the country in terms of volume. Previously the port only had
limited international shipping routes, with links to Japan,
countries in southeast Asia and Hong Kong. Goods destined to, or
from, America or Europe, had to be shipped via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The new service was introduced because cargo to America and
Europe soared to 25,000 standard containers last year. Port
authorities, and the Xiamen City Government, decided to open the
Xiamen-Oakland route. Three container ships, each capable of
accommodating over 700 standard containers, plus 7,000 tons of
sundry goods are being used on the route.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Cashew Nuts Production Stagnates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Cashew nuts production in
Mozambique is still in stagnation, with only 30,200 tons of
cashew nuts produced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by Mozambique's concerned
department, the above-mentioned figure is only equal to 14
percent of the cashew nuts output, 216,000 tons, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique was once the biggest cashew nuts producer and
exporter in the world. But its cashew industry has been given a
fatal strike for years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Fishing Izidora Faztudo has
attributed the stagnation in cashew nuts production to weak
technical force and lack of initiative of farmers.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the government will increase investment in
cashew industry and take measures to bring into play the
initiative of the farmers, so as to raise this year's cashew nuts
output by 14 percent from in 1995.

<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political

the Year 2010, are continuing at the ongoing Forth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, and at the Eighth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The outline is aimed to lead the whole nation, to promote a
socialist modernization drive, and to further the policies of
reform and opening up, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that one of the keys to the realization of the

<HEADLINE> hke030848--Journalism Should be Strengthened in Pakistan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Journalism is no less important
than judiciary, executive and legislature and all the four pillars
of the state need to be strengthened in Pakistan, a senior
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 34th death anniversary function of Hameed
Nizami, founder of the daily Nawa-i-Waqt, in Lahore, Pakistan
Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad said that journalism in Pakistan
needed more strength so that it could play as an accountability
tool as the other three pillars.
</P>
<P>
Journalists should not be threatened and cowed down in the way
of writing of truth, Sajjad added.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the journalists to help palliate the prevalent
tension on the political front and advance positive and practical
suggestions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Pakistan can not progress without democracy
and journalists should keep the people informed about the threats
to the country and make efforts to mitigate the biases and
prejudices among different groups.
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about corruption, every one lifts his finger
towards the politicians whereas the people are the real force who
can hold accountability of their representatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Accountability by the government or by the judiciary can not be
that effective as compared with that held by the people
themselves, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he will support every step which is taken for the
promotion of the democracy in the country irrespective of
political affiliation and will oppose every step against the
democracy, even if it is from the government side.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Calls For Easing Farmers' Burdens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji today
called on governments at all levels to take effective measures to
relieve farmers of their heavy burdens.
</P>
<P>
"Unauthorized fund-raising and apportionment of administrative
expenses among farmers must be stopped with resolve," he said at a
panel discussion of Jiangxi deputies to the National People's
Congress in session here.
</P>
<P>
Launching new projects with funds raised in this way will not
benefit the people but, on the contrary, will hamper achievement
of a sustained and sound economic development, the vice-premier
said.
</P>
<P>
He warned against a rebound in financial burdens farmers have
to shoulder.
</P>
<P>
"In name farmers are told they are 'free' to give or not give,
but if they don't pay up, restrictions may be imposed on their
children attending school; this in fact is coerc," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"In some places, farmers's actual financial burdens far
exceed five percent of their annual net income, pushing their
burdens beyond the limit of bearability," he charged.
</P>
<P>
Alleviation of farmers' burdens and curbing unauthorized
fund-raising and their share of local administrative expenses have
been an important part of the government's rural policies in
recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Like other high ranking officials, Zhu again stressed that
agricultural development is the key to success in fulfilling the
country's development goals for the next 15 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Remains Committed to Cyprus Settlement This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has remained committed to
pursuing a settlement this year on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a letter the U.S. President Bill Clinton
sent to the U.S. House of Representatives Speaker and the Senate
foreign committee Chairman, dated on March 7, according to Cyprus
News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's letter, which accompanies the bimonthly U.S. report
on "progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus
question," pointed out that the continuing lack of a solution on
Cyprus is in marked contrast to the recent advances achieved in
Bosnia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that if the parties to the dispute are
prepared to engage seriously and with flexibility, we can move to
active negotiations and to a final settlement, which creates a
bizonal, bicommunal federation," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It added "we will need the full support of Greece and Turkey
for our efforts."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President also believes that his special emissary for
Cyprus Richard Beattie, who had further talks in Cyprus in
December with the two sides, made a modest progress which "gives
us a basis to pursue our initiative once circumstances in the
region are more favorable."
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated that the U.S. "will strive to ensure the
closest possible coordination among efforts by the U.N., the
European Union, and ourselves to address the question of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke
has said that the year 1996 will witness "a big push" on the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He canceled a scheduled visit to the region in February due to
the escalating tension between Greece and Turkey over the
sovereignty of a small island in Eastern Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. has reiterated its intention to push forward
its Cyprus initiative, at a later stage, when a government is
formed in Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization stressed here today
persistence of Palestinians in a comprehensive and just peace
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Political Department in the Palestine Liberation
Organization Farouk al Kadoumy said that the comprehensive and
just peace will ensure a restoration of rights of the Arabs, and
lead to an Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting here with Lebanese Foreign minister
Farez Boueiz, Kadoumy said that his visit to Lebanon is aimed at
consolidating the Lebanese-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit comes within a framework of his current
tour in Arab countries to consult on the establishment of a
committee supervising affairs of the Palestinian refugees in the
countries where they are living.
</P>
<P>
On a call made by the United States for an anti-terrorism
summit, Kadoumy pointed out that PLO leader Yassir Arafat's
support for the idea of holding the international summit
conference expresses "partially" on a position of the Palestinian
leadship.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that the resistance against the occupation is a
"legal right," and Hamas, or the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement, has its special style in the resistance, just like the
PLO having its own style.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Soldiers Lay Siege On Johnson's House In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peace-keeping
Force in Liberia known as ECOMOG yesterday surrounded the home of
Roosevelt Johnson, leader of Liberia's one armed faction ULIMO-J#,
to search for weapons, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Fighters loyal to Johnsom quickly positioned themselves
around the house to defend it. Just behind them, Johnson warned
that if ECOMOG soldiers tried to shoot their way in, capital
Monrovia would burn.
</P>
<P>
Last week, some commanders of Johnson's faction signed a
document declaring Johnson had been ousted as leader of ULIMO-J,
alleging that he was unable to control his fighters and was
responsible for the recent fighting at ULIMO-J headquarters in
Tubmanburg which had endangered the Liberian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Liberia has almost been stalled since
the attack on ECOMOG by ULIMO-J fighters in Tubmanburg late last
December.
</P>
<P>
On wednesday, Liberia's Council of State which has all the
main factions leaders in the collective interim government,
sacked Johnson from his cabinet post, saying he had refused
outside mediation in the internal crisis of ULIMO-J.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with newsmen yesterday, Johnson said that all the
faction leaders were equal based on the peace agreement signed
last August in Nigerian capital Abuja by all Liberian warlords.
</P>
<P>
He contended that it was illegal on the part of the other
faction leaders to issue a search warrant and the other leaders
had no right to intrude into the internal affairs of his faction,
the ULIMO-J.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, claiming he was still in control of his faction,
admitted that he had arms in his house but for the purpose of
protecting himself, as he did not enjoy the security enjoyed by
faction leaders like Charles Taylor.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Regional export fairs are playing
an increasingly important role in promoting foreign trade in China.
</P>
<P>
While for a long time there was only one national export trade
fair held twice a year in Guangzhou, now the list has been
enlarged to embody events in the coastal cities of Dalian, Tianjin
and Qingdao, and in the inland cities of Kunming, Harbin, and
Urumqi, plus an east China export fair.
</P>
<P>
These fairs each have their own features. The fairs in Harbin,
Urumqi and Kunming are aimed at markets in Russia, Vietnam and
other neighboring countries of the related regions.
</P>
<P>
The events held in the coastal cities mainly focus on the
markets of Japan and the Republic of Korea, while the east China
fair aims at promoting the products of the whole region to the
world.
</P>
<P>
Recently central foreign trade authorities have made new
demands on the regional export fairs, urging improvements in the
standards of the exhibits, improvement in the management of the
trademarks of export commodities, better promotion of Chinese
brand-name commodities and a halt to random price cutting for the
purpose of competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has vowed to eradicate all traditional cultures
that are biased against women.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye made the remarks while addressing a gathering at
Msimbazi community centre here during the on-going International
Week for Women.
</P>
<P>
He said the prevailing circumstantial forces in working
against women were the result of some traditional cultures.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister cited some families in many tribes who
forced their daughters to marry in order to acquire money or
cattle. In such cases, he said, a girl was denied the right to
pursue education and her future was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"I request all institutions, whether public or private, to
help the government to educate people to know the bad side of
their culture and do away with them. The law is there and can
effectively prevent such human violation which denies the girls a
chance to decide on their own about their future", Said Mr.
Sumaye.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve this, the prime minister challenged women
to come out and defend their interests. He assured them that the
government was ready to help them achieve their goals.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye also urged girls in schools to study hard and enroll in
science and technology subjects so that they can represent the
nation in technical fields from which girls have been shying
away.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A land official in south China's
Guangdong Province has refuted the claim that farmers there will
soon be allowed to freely sell land-use rights.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zheng, director of the Guangdong Land Department,
dismissed reports in the press that "Guangdong will allow farmers
to freely sell farmland" as "groundless."
</P>
<P>
"Supervision of the flow and transfer of collectively-owned
land-use rights in the rural areas is an important part of land
management," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such transfer must conform to legal procedures," he said,
adding that farmers are forbidden to randomly transfer or sell
collectively-owned land.
</P>
<P>
Yuan pointed out that in recent years collectively-owned land
in some rural areas has entered the market in all kinds of forms,
such as direct buying, selling or lease. Some areas have taken
land as assets when setting up joint ventures or co-operative
ventures.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, relevant departments are drawing up
regulations governing the management of land used for construction
in Guangdong's villages and towns, in order to put the flow and
transfer of collective-owned land onto a legal track.
</P>
<P>
Local land departments said that transfer of collectively-owned
land-use right in rural areas are mainly undertaken in the
following circumstances:
</P>
<P>
First, in terms of the farmland contracted by farmers, the
farmland's contract right and the cultivation right can only be
allowed to flow or be transferred within the collective
organizations. Such farmland cannot used for other purposes;
</P>
<P>
Second, when the collectively-owned farmland are to be used by
collectively-owned economic organizations for public undertakings
or to be used for building residences for farmers. Such farmland
can only be used with government approval and is not allowed to be
transfered;
</P>
<P>
Third, when town- or village-level collectively-owned
organizations are to use land for setting up industrial or
business enterprises, the land can only flow or be transfered on
the market after it has been turned into state-owned land.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Transactions during the 12
trading days in February on the Shanghai securities market closed
at 27.335 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The market was obviously tempted to reverse the plummeting
trend, following successful new listings, in which Xinjiang
Joinworld performed strongly, which breathed new life into the
sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, turnover expanded dramatically as the
all-share index climbed to 552.94 points on the last trading day,
2.9 percent higher than the last closing in the month before.
</P>
<P>
Shares valued at 4.637 billion yuan changed hands in February.
The turnover of B-shares, targeted at overseas investors, is 169
million yuan, with daily transactions dropping by nearly 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The cash bond market rose steadily, while the re-purchase bond
market fluctuated violently, which is a rare phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Bonds worth 17.722 billion yuan were traded, with the daily
transactions exceeding 300 million yuan. The re-purchase
transactions came to 10.716 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Daily re-purchase turnover record and intra-day rising record
of re-purchased bond prices were created because the unexpected
rising demand for capital pushed up earnings ratios in bond
re-purchase.
</P>
<P>
The fund market had much thinner trading, valued at 985 million
yuan, 4.967 billion less than in January. On the last trading day
all 12 funds lost ground.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan scored 53 points
Thursday night, breaking 50 mark for the 28th time in his career,
to lift the Chicago Bulls to a 102-81 route over the Detroit
Pistons in a regular season match of the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who scored 34 points in the second half, made 21 of 28
shots, nine of 10 free throws and added 11 rebounds and six steals.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else on our team could make a shot. My jump shot was
working, so quite naturally, I kept taking it." Jordan said. "I
feel more now like this is my home court than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Jordan set a single game record of most points in the United
Center, Bulls new home for this season, breaking the 50 scored by
Dallas's Jamal Mashburn on Nov. 12, 1994.
</P>
<P>
"One of my security guards was kidding me before the game,
wondering when I was going to get 50 points in this building, and
I told him, 'Don't worry, it'll come when it comes.'"
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen and Luc Longley added 13 points apiece for
Chicago, which improved to 30-0 at home this season, tying the

<HEADLINE> GCC Agrees in Principle on Holding Emergency Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries have agreed in principle to hold an emergency
meeting called by Qatar to discuss the foiled coup attempt against
its government.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Gulf News, the agreement came after Oman
made efforts to mediate among the six Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusef
Ben Alawi visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), to coordinate stands on holding such an urgent meeting of
the GCC foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The venue and date for the meeting are yet to be fixed. But the
paper quoted a Gulf source as saying that the meeting may be held
in Muscat, capital city of Oman, once an agreement is reached on
some proposals.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the Qatari government said it had foiled an
attempt to overthrow Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani. It accused the country's former ruler, Sheikh Khalifa
bin Hamad al Thani, of being involved in the coup. But the former
ruler has denied.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 60 police and army officers linked
to the former ruler have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Qatar on February 20 called for an urgent meeting of the GCC
foreign ministers to discuss the failed coup. But responses from
other GCC countries were weak. Some of the member states insisted
on holding an ordinary GCC foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh
only. Some GCC members also asked Oman, the group's current head,
to hold consultations with Qatar to investigate its claims of
"outside involvement" in the failed coup.

<HEADLINE> Property Rental Prices to Remain Flat in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The rental prices of office
buildings and business centers in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia,
are expected to remain flat in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
This estimation is based on the assumption that during the two
years, the market condition will remain stable, according to a
report published in the magazine Asia-Pacific Property '96.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the property market continued to be healthy,
supported by strong levels of demand. There won't be any drop in
both occupancy rate and price levels because the demands will also
hike, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta is one of the world's fastest growing marketplaces
where demand for professional, well-located and efficient business
centers is increasing rapidly in line with Indonesia's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
As the amount of foreign direct investment flowing into the
country steadily increases as well as the number of expatriates
working in Indonesia, the need for business centers has spiraled.
</P>
<P>
The completion of projects currently under construction would
result in new supply of 470,000 square meters for 1996, with more
than half expected to enter the market in the second quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) has urged all its branches to finance spring plowing.
</P>
<P>
In a circular requires all branches to give top priority to
arranging loans and to circulating new deposits as loans for
spring plowing.
</P>
<P>
"The loans should be mainly pumped into projects which involve
improved varieties, dry-field crops, hydroelectric and thermal
power projects, and the application of high technology," according
to the circular.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the effects of the drought which is hitting many
parts of China, the bank will provide funds to construct
small-scale irrigation and water-control projects and to dig more
wells.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to ensure that sufficient funds are
available for buying agricultural production materials, the ABC
headquarters will extend loans for the purchase of both domestic
and imported fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The notice also points out that the ABC will issue loans to
industrial enterprises which produce agricultural production
materials and to the large state fertilizer producers which open
accounts with the bank.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Criticizes US Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that the United States was in no
position to comment on the human rights situation in Malaysia as
its own track record was neither perfect nor unblemished.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his office in the Foreign Ministry
here today, Abudllah Badawi said the Americans should look in
their own backyard before pointing fingers at others on human
rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the US released its annual human rights report,
which criticized Malaysia's Internal Security Act and what it
called "limited press freedom".
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep regret over the report, Abudllah said: "The
1995 human rights report of the US is biased, inaccurate and tends
to measure Malaysia by the American yardstick of what constitutes
democracy and human rights."
</P>
<P>
"To me, it smacks of the arrogance of a super power," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said the report seemed to deem
it fit to highlight only the negative aspects without giving due
recognition to the positive side.
</P>
<P>
He also said he had conveyed his view to the new US ambassador
to Malaysia, John Malott, who called on him at his office today.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Redraft Bill Concerning Residence Right Of Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will amend the Zimbabwe
constitution amendment bill to give equal right of residence to
foreign husbands of local women as that given to foreign women
married to Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
A section of the bill is considered discriminatory in that it
allowed automatic right of residence to foreign women married to
Zimbabweans while denying the same to foreign husbands of local
women.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday, Minister of Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs Emmerson Mnangagwe said the cabinet had
reconsidered the bill and decided to adopt a gender neutral
approach to questions of citizenship and residence to foreigners
married to a Zimbabwean citizen.
</P>
<P>
The re-consideration of the bill followed mounting pressure
upon the government from civic and women's rights groups to
change the clause of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Mnangagwe said the clause of the bill would be amended to make
it clear that there was no intention to deprive anyone of rights
that may have accrued to him or her before the bill comes into
force as an act.
</P>
<P>
Every foreigner, regardless of gender or marital status, will
be subject to the same screening process before he or she is
accepted for residencee, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bill published in December last year had riled many
organisations, particularly women's groups who condemned it
outright, saying it discriminated on the grounds of gender.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Henan, a leading central Chinese
grain producer, is emerging as the country's new food processing
center.
</P>
<P>
The food industry grew at an average annual rate of 22.7
percent in the past five years, putting it first in China. The
output value of foodstuff accounts for 34 percent of the
province's total agricultural output value, a provincial official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official cites increasing government attention paid to food
processing since 1990 and the use of modern science and technology
in production as the principal reasons for the sector's rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
Three of their sausage brands, "Chundu", "Shuanghui", and
Shuangrong", now hold 80 percent of China's market, and production
of 300,000 tons of instant noodles a year provides a quarter of
China's needs.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 foreign-funded foodstuff plants have been built in the
province with a combined annual output value of 5 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> A Life Devoted to Restoring Dazhai's Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Dazhai, a village in Xiyang County
in north China's Shanxi Province that was known nationwide in the
1960s as a "pace-setter" in agriculture, was in the 1980s, mostly
ignored by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Today however, there has been a revival and visitors can find a
couple of pavilions and a long corridor scattered amongst the
green of nearby Hutou Hill, with the yellow roof reflecting the
bright sunlight. The hill is approached by a wide asphalt road
that leads to the top of the once barren hill. Along the way,
local places of interest and scenic spots give visitors a pleasant
view.
</P>
<P>
Villagers attribute this new development to the four-year
campaign of the village's female leader, Guo Fenglian, who has
single-handedly helped lead them to better days.
</P>
<P>
Guo, 49, who was head of the village from 1973-1980, became
party secretary of the village again in 1991, and decided to
rejuvenate the previously renowned village.
</P>
<P>
She herself was once known nationwide as the "Iron Girl" of
Dazhai, and later became a member of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
"In the 60s and 70s, millions of people from home and abroad
visited the village to learn from the spirit of Dazhai," Guo
recalled.
</P>
<P>
"But today it is time for Dazhai to learn from others and join
in the reform and opening up drive," she added.
</P>
<P>
So, Guo went from place to place to draw from their experience
and to learn of business opportunities. In the past several years,
her frequent travels have taken her to a number of coastal cities
and provinces such as Beijing, Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang,
Heilongjiang, and Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
And, a five-story industrial and trade center was built, where
joint ventures are producing high-quality Dazhai-Brand woolen
sweaters and shirts that are selling well.
</P>
<P>
A number of enterprises involved in coal mining, construction
materials, garments, chemicals, and transportation have been
started, and Dazhai's first joint-venture with a Hong Kong company
began in 1993 to produce quality cement.
</P>
<P>
"We even plan to run Dazhai businesses abroad in the near
future," Guo said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
Total industrial value in the village reached 30 million yuan
(about 360 million US dollars) in 1995, with a per capita income
of 1,800 yuan (about 220 US dollars), 300 yuan more than the
national average for rural residents per capita.
</P>
<P>
Villagers are proud of Dazhai once again, with the great
improvements that have taken place in their lives.
</P>
<P>
They now have an average living space of 22 sq m and there are
pensions for female villagers above the age of 55 and male
villagers above the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
The village also has a medical center and its citizens no
longer have to go to another town to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
People were conscious of their lack of talent to compete in a
market economy and have paid special attention to education and
technical training. So, primary education is free and a
scholarship is awarded to every student in the village who enters
university or college.
</P>
<P>
Because of her efforts, Guo was recognized as a model worker in
Shanxi in 1995 and was appointed vice-president of the Shanxi
Provincial Women's Federation the same year.
</P>
<P>
She was also selected by China Women's News as one of the 10
most popular women in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Oil Exports to Decline in 1996-97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian state-owned oil
firm Pertamina estimates that the country's oil exports will
decline in the next fiscal year starting April 1996, while oil
imports will soar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent hearing with the Energy Commission of the
House of Representatives, Pertamina President Faisal Abda'oe said
that Indonesia's exports of crude oil and condensate are
forecasted to decline to 286.6 million barrels, valued at 4.73
billion US dollars, in the next fiscal year from the projected
300.9 million barrels at 5.1 billion dollars in the current fiscal
year, which will end on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Abda'oe noted that the projection is based on a crude oil price
of 16.50 dollars per barrel for next year, while the average price
of crude oil for the current fiscal year is 16.96 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
The main export destinations are Japan, China, South Korea, the
United States, Singapore and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Exports of oil products in the next fiscal year are expected to
reach 66.1 million barrels worth 1.1 billion dollars, down from
the projected 77.6 million barrels worth 1.3 billion dollars for
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Imports of crude oil are estimated to reach 62.4 million
barrels valued at 1.1 billion dollars in the next fiscal year, up
from the projected 59.1 million barrels at 1.07 billion dollars in
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil imports come from the Middle East, Malaysia,
Australia, China, Brunei, Vietnam and a number of African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Imports of oil products are predicted to soar to 64.5 million
barrels, worth 1.34 billion dollars from 53.7 million barrels
worth 1.18 billion in this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Countries supplying oil products to Indonesia include
Singapore, Malaysia, Australia as well as Middle East and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Abda'oe explained that the oil industry is a
technology-intensive industry, and thus imports of both services
and goods in the oil sector are still needed.

<HEADLINE> UN Inspection Team Finds Chemical Information In Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. weapons inspection team
who has been working for two weeks in a war devastated chemical
site in Iraq said here today they have obtained documentation
concerning Iraq's chemical weapons program as well as components
of weapons there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Cees Wolterbeek, a Dutch
chemist who heads a 26-member team comprising engineers, chemical
and explosion experts said that they have found a total of 3,000
pages of documents related to Iraq's chemical weapons in
Muthanna, about 100 kilometers northwest of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
They have also obtained hundreds of computer discs and lots of
munitions as well as parts of artillery rockets and artillery
shells, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It was very clear from the beginning that the Iraqis have done
enormous effort to clean these buildings from documents and all
kinds of materials related to its program."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, we are able to find in the places where they are
really covered with concrete materials we found new and we hope
they are very valuable for our evaluation of Iraqi chemical and
biological program,' he said.
</P>
<P>
The team have spent altogether 18 months in the chemical site
which was reduced to debris in the 1991 Gulf war. Their latest
mission started on February 24.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch chemist said that they have got support of Iraqi
government which provided them with heavy trucks and cranes for
excavation of the building in the Muthanna establishment, adding
that their job was very complicated because of the possible risks
of exposure to chemical agents, unexploded munitions and collapse
of the building.
</P>
<P>
Charles Duelfer, who arrived here on Thursday for dialogue with
Iraqi officials, described the mission of the U.N.team as
successful because they have obtained information on Iraq's
chemical weapon program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team will start their assessment process for what
they have obtained when they return to New York.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 Hong Kong women in
industry and commerce circles gathered here to celebrate the
International Women's Day, which falls on today.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech, Cecilia S.L.Chen, the leading organizer
of the gathering, called on Hong Kong women to get more involved
in social work, in addition to their consistent devotion to career
and family.
</P>
<P>
She also urged Hong Kong women to make further efforts to
strive for women's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that by the end of September last year, more
than 1.13 million Hong Kong women went out to work, accounting for
one third of the total employed in the territory.
</P>
<P>
But sex discrimination remains an obstacle to women in looking
for jobs. On average, they earn 77 percent as much as their male
colleagues for the same work.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Hong Kong women should make their contributions
to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Other activities were also held to mark the International
Women's Day in the territory today.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Enters China's Electronic Measurement Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hewlett-Packard (HP) Company,
the third-largest computer maker in the US, is now active in
China's fledgling electronic testing and measurement industry.
</P>
<P>
It launched a marketing, research and development center here
today specializing in the technology of electronic testing and
measurement.
</P>
<P>
Edward Barnholt, HP's senior vice-president and general manager
of its Testing and Measurement Organization, said that in its
initial stage the center will focus on VXI measurement
instruments, which can be widely used in the sectors of aerospace,
automobile manufacturing, telecommunications and personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
HP plans to invest three million US dollars in the center this
year, and will hire 30 engineers and technical professionals from
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the testing and measurement instruments
developed by the center will be put into production at HP's joint
ventures in China. Most of the products will be sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
As a reinforcement for its dominant position in the global
market, a production base for electronic testing and measurement
instruments will go into formal operation in the second half of
this year, according to Barnholt.
</P>
<P>
Taking the lead in Sino-US co-operation in the hi-tech field,
HP has invested more than 100 million US dollars in China since
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Terry Cheng, president of China HP Co., Ltd, noted that HP's
business has been soaring over the past few years, with its growth
rate hitting 57 percent in 1995. Sales of the first quarter of
this year are expected to increase by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far, the company is in the leading position in China's
computer printer market, with a manufacturing capacity of 80,000
machines per month in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The monthly capacity will exceed 250,000 printers within three
years, Cheng said.

<HEADLINE> King of Swaziland Sets Up Forum For Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua)-- King Mswati III of Swaziland
has begun setting up a national constitutional forum as part of
his promise to introduce political reforms, a local daily "the
Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's Education Minister Solomon Dlamini said yesterday
in Mbabane, capital of the kingdom, that the King had ordered
cabinet ministers to write to all formations falling under their
ministries to submit the names of five people, one of whom would
be chosen to sit on the forum.
</P>
<P>
No date has yet been set for the first meeting of the proposed
forum, which will negotiate changes to the constitution suspended
by late King Sobhuza in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The monarch executive currently rules the kingdom by royal
decree and all party political activities are still banned in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed forum will exclude now-banned political
parties.
</P>
<P>
In January, a nationwide strike called by the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions and banned political parties had
brought the land-locked kingdom to a complete halt.
</P>
<P>
Last month, King Mswati III promised US envoy George Moose
that he planned to "embark on an exercise to improve the
political structure of the country".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the political upheavals in the kingdom
was also among the discussions between Mswati III and South
African President Nelson Mandela during his one-day secret visit
to Swaziland on March 1.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australian PM-elect Gets Strong Cabinet Line-up (by Lin Zhenxi, Liu Dongkai) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister-elect
John Howard today announced a streamlined coalition government
featuring a strong commitment to environment, industrial relations
and gender equality.
</P>
<P>
Though there are six new faces in the line-up of the Howard
government, it can be expected that the coalition will deliver
impressive performances in areas it emphasized during the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
One of the surprises to local media expectations is the
appointment of John Fahey, former premier of New South Wales, as
minister for finance.  He entered the federal parliament for the
first time and went all the way directly to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new finance minister will face a major challenge
immediately after he is sworn in next Monday. He has the tough
job to honor the coalition's lavish spending promises in face of a
possible blowout of budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, Fahey expressed confidence in his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge in finance is one I will relish much more than
any other portfolio," he said.
</P>
<P>
His former colleagues in the state government said that Fahey
is "very suited" to the job because of his extensive experience as
a premier.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Downer retained his portfolio under the shadow
cabinet as minister for foreign affairs. Though some local
analysts said he is not a better replacement of former Labor
foreign minister Gareth Evans, his past experience speaks for
itself.
</P>
<P>
As a veteran diplomat and former leader of the Liberal Party,
Downer is a suitable candidate to represent the Liberal-National
coalition government overseas.
</P>
<P>
In an active gesture to push forward Australia's foreign policy
as a regional power, Downer said today that his priority would be
to reassure East Asian nations of the coalition government's
genuine commitment to the region.
</P>
<P>
Peter Reith is the person sure to make imprints on Australia's
industrial relations reform. He successfully forced the Labor
government to concede weakness in its unfair dismissal law during
the election campaign. He was appointed minister for industrial
relations.
</P>
<P>
Industrial relations will be the arena in which the coalition
can stage a glorious drama. It is going to wage radical reforms
in the labor market and set to clash with the influential trade
union movement.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government is gaining momentum in implementing
its environmental policy as new Environment Minister and member of
the cabinet Robert Hill has won wide acclaim from conservationist
groups.
</P>
<P>
Women have made a big splash in the coalition line-up. Four
female members of the House have entered the Howard government,
with two of them assuming crucial portfolios in the cabinet. This
alone made history in the country's near-one-century-old federal
governing.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that Howard had an embarrassment of riches as
he had so many members in the Parliament to choose from for his
government. There are 131 coalition members in both houses of the
Parliament. However, Howard chose for a smaller government with
28 members, rather than 30 members in the previous government.
The cabinet is also reduced in size -- from 17 members to 15
members.
</P>
<P>
"A more streamlined government will also enhance the quality
and timeliness of decision-making," Howard said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Aims to Eliminate Illiteracy among Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province
launched a literacy campaign with the aim of basically eliminating
illiteracy among women under 45 years old by 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are 41,622 illiterate people under
45 years old in Hainan, and 74 percent of them are female.
</P>
<P>
Yucai, a Yi-nationality county near Sanya City, has a
population of 8,700, and 95 percent of the 3,030 women there were
illiterate three years ago.
</P>
<P>
To date, 2,450 such women, accounting for 80 percent of the
total, are now able to read and write after attending 12 literacy
training programs run by the local women's federation.
</P>
<P>
Women's federations at all levels in the province have exerted
great efforts since 1988 to help 870,000 rural women become
literate and learn one or two skills of agricultural technology.

HAIKOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Zheng Haixia scored a game-high 33
points and Liang Xin Keyed a first half run as China rolled over South
Korea 77-73 in the opener of Chinese Women's Basketball Invitational
Tournament Friday in Haikou, Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The win, the Chinese team's first international game this year, has
sent the host to meet with the winner of the United States and Cuba
for first place of the Haikou stop on Saturday in the four-team
three-stop tourney.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea squad, who trounced its Chinese counterparter with
a big margin in the gold medal final of the 1994 Asian Games, built a
29-20 lead with a 19-10 run with 8:30 to play in the first half.
</P>
<P>
However, Liang Xi, 21, scored her nine of 16 points and Zheng added
seven points to pace China to overcome a 9-point deficit in a 22-13
run.
</P>
<P>
China, the silver medalist of the 1992 Olympics and 1994 world
championships, led the first half at 44-42 with Miao Bo's jump at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, paced by Jung Sun-Min with 18 points, kept cutting its
trailing margin and leveled the score, 69-69, with 4:20 remaining. But
2.05-meter center Zheng Haixia scored six and Liang hit a Layup to
fend off the South Korea's last charge to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
Guard Kwun-Jeong contributed 15 points for South Korea, all from
the three-pointer range including four in the first half, and Chun
Eun-Sook added 12.
</P>
<P>
The United States will play later tonight against Cuba, who arrived
here just this afternoon, about three hours before the China-South
Korea fight.

KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda Coffee Development
Authority (UCDA) announced here today that Uganda shipped a
record of 555,532 bags of coffee in January this year worth 50.2
million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest coffee shipment in a month since 1980.
The UCDA attributed the big shipment to high sales registered in
December 1995 which amounted to over one million bags of
60-kilogram each.
</P>
<P>
Last December, 285,818 bags were shipped worth 30.5 million

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Cooperatives Want to Control Fertilizer Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Village cooperatives suggested
that the Indonesian government would allow them to obtain
fertilizer directly from producers, so as to control fertilizer
distribution.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion voiced by the Association of Village
Cooperatives Units here today in a statement was based on the
consideration that the current system of fertilizer distribution,
which allows cooperatives to get fertilizer from warehouses at the
regency level, cannot guarantee smooth distribution of fertilizer
to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, if put into practice, would cut distribution
lines, and village cooperatives units' direct contacts with
farmers would guarantee a smooth distribution of fertilizer to end
users. Such a distribution system would help prevent the possible
recurrence of supply shortages, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia currently has six fertilizer producers and the
government has assigned one as distributor for urea fertilizer and
another one for other types of fertilizers. The two are
responsible for the transportation of fertilizers from producers
to warehouses at regencies throughout the country, where village
units can procure fertilizer for distribution to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer shortages happened recently in some areas. And the
forthcoming April will be another planting season.
</P>
<P>
The association assured that with its 10,000 village
cooperatives units in the country's 27 provinces, it will be able
to improve their role in fertilizer distribution.

running as independent candidates" because she believed in their
honesty and expertise.
</P>
<P>
"I want to vote for someone who will not forget us when he or
she goes to the parliament," she said.
</P>
<P>
At a polling station at a posh mosque in upper Tehran, a
government employee told Xinhua that he, his wife and his son were
there to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Mousavi Shalmani, a manager at National Iranian Oil
Company (NIOC), told Xinhua that he wanted "someone who will care
for the people, parliament members who will resolve the economic
problems such as inflation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said his votes and that of his son were not identical. "My
son, Ehsan, has just turned 16, which makes him eligible to
vote. I cannot, and do not want to, influence his choice," he said.
</P>
<P>
An economist by profession, Shalmani told that he did not care
much about factional politics and that he cared mostly "about
personal honesty" of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
An old man told Xinhua that only two of his 10-member family
will go to the ballot boxes and take part in the elections because
most of his family members have no interest in politics.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinion poll conducted by the official daily
Iran, 42 percent of the voters will vote for the individuals and
their programs, rather than the factions.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 percent said they would vote for the factions.
Some 17 percent said that they would choose from all factions.
Some 6 percent said that they had not decided yet. Some 11
percent said that they were totally unaware of the platforms
of the factions.

<HEADLINE> Molecular Discovery May Lead To Heart Disease Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of the cause of
reclogging of blood vessels by an Australian researcher may lead
to a more reliable way to cure heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The researcher found the reason why injury to the blood vessel
lining could trigger dangerous narrowing of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
Levon Khachigian of the University of New South Wales
discovered that injury to the lining of blood vessels in rats
provoked cells in the lining to produce a protein named Egr-1, or
early growth response factor-1.
</P>
<P>
Egr-1 triggers normally inactive genes within these cells to
produce other proteins which may stimulate muscle cells beneath
the lining to malfunction and expand into the lining, narrowing
the artery, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
That is why the balloon angioplasty operation -- using special
balloons to unblock clogged blood vessels -- saw blood vessels in
30 percent of the patient reclogged in six months. The balloon
injured the lining of blood vessels in patients.
</P>
<P>
Balloon angioplasty is less risky than heart bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
Khachigian said that the discovery was important because it put
"a molecular face on a very serious problem."
</P>
<P>
He is now conducting further research into the discovery at the
university's Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research.
</P>
<P>
Heart disease is the top killer in many countries in the world,
including Australia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iranians Go to Polls to Choose New Parliament  (Part I) (By Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranians turned out today at the
ballot boxes for the fifth parliamentary elections which promise
to extend the conservative reign over the parliament for the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was among the early morning
voters, casting his vote at one of the mobile ballot boxes. There
are over 100 mobile ballot boxes stationed on the city buses that
drive around the city.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the two major conservative
factions backed by Ali Khamenei are expected to win the majority
of the 270 seats in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The two groups, Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) and
Association for the Defense of the Values of the Islamic
Revolution (ADVIR), are competing against the liberal modernist
faction known as the Group-6 supported by Iran's moderate
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani cast his vote at Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran
few minutes after the ballot polls opened at 8:00 o'clock this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that this is the most important
parliamentary elections since the death of the architect of the
Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentary elections are important because whatever
group wins in these elections, it will have a better chance in the
presidential elections of 1997," a political science professor at
Tehran University told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, President Rafsanjani cannot run for a
third consecutive term in 1997. His rival, Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, is said to be SCC's candidate for the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted the present domestic policy and
foreign policy would remain unchanged no matter what kind of
results the elections come out.
</P>
<P>
The voter's turnout today is not extensive because of two major
factors: economic hardship with runway inflation and low
popularity of religious rulers.
</P>
<P>
Iranian leaders have called on its citizens to take an active
part in the election as their religious and national duty.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote, Ali Khamenei said that the ballot
boxes were "trusted to the officials by the Iranian nation."
</P>
<P>
He asked the officials to take extreme care in counting the
votes and "present the votes as they are."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also said that Iran's previous elections were free
from any fraud and claimed that the elections in Iran have been
among the fairest ones in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials have admitted that there are
candidates that are trying to buy people's votes by providing
food items to the voting public.
</P>
<P>
Even Khamenei himself had to warn that candidates who want
to get votes by providing financial incentives had to be
eliminated from the race.
</P>
<P>
The election headquarters at the Interior Ministry announced
that a total of 2,946 contenders will be running in today's
nation-wide elections.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks Japanese Bank Help Woo Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
sought the help of Japan's Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) in wooing
investments to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Melito Salazar said today
that the Eximbank could help the Philippines' local government
units attract investments by organizing investment missions and
meetings between Japanese and local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who is attending a symposium in Tokyo sponsored by the
Eximbank, said that the Philippines' regional growth centers,
numbering nearly a dozen, could offer a wealth of opportunities to
Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).
</P>
<P>
Financial and technical assistance from Tokyo is also crucial
in improving basic infrastructure, privatizing state-owned assets
and implementing job retraining programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank is helping Manila's investment promotion drive by
providing long-term loans to Japanese firms that locate in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, there are some six million SMEs in Japan. Of these,
800,000 are manufacturing firms.
</P>
<P>
However, due to increasing labor costs, many Japanese
labor-intensive industries have decided to farm out most of their
operations to overseas facilities.

<HEADLINE> Peres Urges EU States to Stop Dialogue With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres last night urged European Union (EU) states to stop
"flirting" with Iran, saying Iran is the center of terrorism,
fundamentalism, and subversion.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with France 2 television, Peres said that
there is no doubt that Iran had armed, trained, financed, and
given orders to Hezbollah in Lebanon and financed Islamic Jihad
and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Peres repeated his call when he held respective meetings last
night with visiting French Foreign Minister Herve De Charette and
German Foreign Ministers Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Peres, De Charette said France has
canceled a planned visit by an Iranian deputy foreign minister,
and protested to Tehran because Iran's official news agency
praised the suicide bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that France had proposed stepping up cooperation in
fighting against terror, adding that he discussed with Peres on
technical matters and strengthening intelligence cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, De Charette expressed his belief that EU's dialogue
with Iran would actually be a means to pressure that country to
stop supporting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kinkel also rejected the call by Peres to stop
Germany's dialogue with Iran, saying there was no evidence so far
that Iran was involved in the Hamas suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
But, Kinkel told reporters after the meeting that he assured
Peres that "such evidence would force us to reconsider our
relations with Iran -- there is a red line."
</P>
<P>
He said that Germany and the EU would consider all means
available to stress to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat that he must
take actions against terrorists, first and for most, against those
operating in the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers' visits were both arranged after a
series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel, which killed more
than 50 people and wounded over 150 others, aimed at expressing
their countries' solidarity with Israel at this difficult
time.

BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Forein Minister Farez
Boueiz has disclosed that Lebanon has not received an invitation
to attend the anti-terrorism international summit to be held in
Egypt next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Today's Lebanese daily Al Nahar quoted Foreign Minister Boueiz
as saying that "we have read about it in the press, but have not
been informed about anything."
</P>
<P>
According to a ministerial source, Lebanon will consider the
invitation in case it receives it. But the chairman of the foreign
relations committee of the Lebanese House of Representatives is
reported by the Lebanese Sawt al Shaab radio to have said that
Lebanon will not participate in a summit where Israel takes part.
</P>

Washington has called for the convocation of a Middle Eastern
summit conference for the combat of terrorism following the acts

Egypt and the United States have agreed on holding the summit
next Wednesday in Sharm al Sheikh, south of Egypt, with the

Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres considers
Iran to be "more dangerous as it guides the activities of the

Jihad (Islamic holy war) and the Hamas movement were being
financed by Iran."

<HEADLINE> Senior Tibetan Official on Dalai's Splittist Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Tibet
Autonomous Region today cited Dalai Lama's confirmation of a "soul
boy" of the deceased 10th Panchen Lama as a scheme to split the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet
Autonomous Regional People's Congress, is present at the annual
session of the National People's Congress, made the remark at a
news conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"On May 14 last year, the Dalai Lama made an arbitrary
announcement abroad to decide a fake reincarnation of the 10th
Panchen Lama. That betrayed the political attempts of Dalai Lama
and his followers to engage in activities aimed at 'Tibetan
independence'," Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts show that Dalai Lama, chieftain of the splittist clique
aimed at 'Tibetan independence', is working as a docile tool of
international anti-China forces," he added.
</P>
<P>
Raidi noted that Dalai Lama is the root cause for social
turmoil in Tibet, and the biggest obstacle to the establishment of
the normal order for Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
After the 10th Panchen Lama passed away on January 28, 1989,
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State
Council made prompt decisions on protection of his holy figure,
build a stupa for him and search for his reincarnation, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years and more, some senior monks from the
Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery conducted a series of scrupulous locations
and searches in strict accordance with historical conventions and
religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
Through lot-drawing in front of the statue of Sakyamuni in the
Johkang Monastery, the 11th Panchen Lama was decided out of three
candidates.
</P>
<P>
With Approval of the State Council, a ceremonious enthronement
ceremony was held in the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery in Xigaze, which
was presided over by the representative of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"All believers from religious circles in Tibet are convinced
that the entire process of location, lot-drawing, certification
and enthronement conforms to historical precedences, religious
rituals as well as the wish of both monks and laymen," Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
"In our country, any men, any organizations or any religious
organizations are not allowed to violate state laws, to bring
harms to the interests of the people, or to go in for activities
that lead to the separation of different nationalities in the
country, or to ruin the unity of the motherland," Raidi said.

<HEADLINE> New Calculation Method Makes Way Into Dictionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A new rapid calculation method
invented by a Chinese scholar is to gain a higher status.
</P>
<P>
Shi Fengshou, inventor of the new method, told Xinhua that his
"Shi Fengshou Rapid Calculation Method" has been officially
included in Mathematics Dictionary, the world's most complete
mathematics dictionary, to be published soon in China.
</P>
<P>
Shi's method does not apply rules for traditional arithmetic
operations by which calculation starts from the end of a number.
With his new method, calculation starts from the highest digit of
a number using no calculating tools, according to Shi, who is here
attending an ongoing session of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, the country's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The new method is also capable of rapid calculations involving
involution, evolution, trigonometric function and logarithm, the
inventor said.
</P>
<P>
Participants of a UN-sponsored demonstration by Shi in Paris in
1987 suggested that Shi's method, believed to be of great use to
the development of children's intelligence, be promoted worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Bustling "Bund" Appears in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A charming and bustling "Bund"
is taking shape along a bank of the Yangtze River in this, the
largest industrial city in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Only a few years ago this area was marked by ramshackle houses,
flies on piles of garbage, sewage and rank grass.
</P>
<P>
But since late 1980s, along with the reconstruction of old
towns, the city has invested three billion yuan (about 361 million
US dollars) in improving transportation conditions, developing
real estate and controlling landslides on the north bank of the
river.
</P>
<P>
Shabby and dangerous houses have been removed, and the Binjiang
and Shanhu parks, and a green belt have appeared.
</P>
<P>
The local people call it the "Chongqing Bund", after the
prosperous area beside the Huangpu River in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This Spring Festival Chongqing's largest civic project,
Binjiang Road, was completed and basically opened to traffic. The
road, together with two new automatic elevators, bring the
Chaotianmen Harbor closer to the Caiyuanba Railway Station, the
"Bund" and the city's downtown area.
</P>
<P>
The "Bund" is not only a new landscape, but also a booming
economic belt, including a dozen auto, medicine, metals, leather,
cigarette and vehicle parts markets. The annual business turnover
of the markets exceeds six billion yuan (about 723 million yuan),
accounting for more than one third of the business volume of the
surrounding Yuzhong District, the most booming area in the city.
</P>
<P>
The "Bund" has also become a hot investment spot. Businessmen
both in the city and from the outside are setting eyes on the
area. Some stores or enterprises in the area even have "Bund" in
their names
</P>
<P>
In 1994 a dozen construction, industrial and commercial
enterprises set up the "Council for the Promotion of the
Construction of the `Chongqing Bund'" to get enterprises of all
sorts from different parts of the country to invest in it.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to invest over 10 billion yuan (about 1.2
billion US dollars) in the "Chongqing Bund" by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Social Stability Is Key To Continued Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Party official
today stressed the importance of maintaining sustained social
stability to guarantee the achievement of the country's
development plan for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin told deputies from north China's Shanxi Province to
the National People's Congress in session here that political and
social stability is the key to achieving success for China's
reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Ren is a member of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and secretary of its Political Science and
Law Committee
</P>
<P>
He warned that destabilizing factors remain, as evidenced by
occurrances of infiltration, subversion and sabotage attempts by
certain countries trying to westernize and separate China,
increase of crimes, and a rise in illicit religious and separatist
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said deterioration of public security conditions with an
increase of grave crimes in some places calls for more efforts to
combat crimes.
</P>
<P>
Armed crimes, drug trafficking and criminal gangs are among
those to be cracked down with extra force and speed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting crimes should be the concern of the whole society, Ren
pointed out, and a crime-combating mechanism that draws in every
social quarter should be formed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on improvement of law enforcement, he said an
internal supervision and restriction mechanism must be developed
to expose and remove corrupt law enforcers in accordance with
relevant laws.

<HEADLINE> Dalai's "Reincarnated Soul Boy" Lives Happily at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The six-year-old Gedhun Choekyi
Nyima, who was chosen by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnated soul
boy of Panchen Lama, is living happily with his parents at home, a
senior Tibetan official told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"On the young boy's life and health, I can assure you that
Choekyi Nyima is with his family, happy and contented," said
Raidi, chairman of the Standing Committee of Tibetan Autonomous
Regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, the government will send him to school and he
will grow up like other Tibetan kids," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked by a Western reporter's question if the boy has been
put into a jail, Raidi said, "this is a sheer groundless
fabrication. How can a little boy as young as Choekyi Nyima commit
any crime and be imprisoned?"
</P>
<P>
Gyantsen Norpo, another six-year-old boy, who has been located
and confirmed as the Tenth Panchen Erdenis's reincarnation, has
started practicing Buddhism by learning to recite Tibetan Buddhism
scriptures with the help of two Buddhist tutors in a Tibetan
lamasery, according to Tibetan Buddhists who are attending the
on-going session of the National People's Congress here this week.

NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The British Government now
requires Kenyans wishing to visit Britain to obtain a visa.
</P>
<P>
The new requirement comes in the wake of an increasing
number of "bogus asylum' seekers from Kenya, a statement from
the British High commission to Kenya says.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued on Thursday said 400 Kenyans in the first
10 months of 1995 went to Britain seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Kenyans were not required to show whether they
were qualified for admission to the UK until they arrived at the
British port of entry.
</P>
<P>
Now they have to demonstrate this by getting a visa before
they travel to Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Six speakers addressing this
afternoon's plenary meeting of China's top advisory body focused
on one single topic concerning development of culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
The situation on neglection of developing culture and socialist
ethics can no longer tolerate. China must never seek temporary
economic development at the cost of cultural and ideological
progress, the members said.
</P>
<P>
In the third plenary meeting of the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a member called on the entire
nation to enter the 21st century by building the country with
simultaneous economic, cultural and ideological development.
</P>
<P>

Society and Law, Qian Zhenying, said, "We shouldn't sacrifice
cultural and ideological progress in economic development as it
concerns the country's long-term stability."
</P>
<P>
"Leading officials at various levels can contribute to
accelerating the development of culture and ideology if they
attend fewer luxurious dinners, buying less de luxe cars, build
fewer hotels," she said.
</P>
<P>
Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
said it would rather difficult for the country to attain its
long-range objectives if due attention is not attached to its
cultural and ideological development.
</P>
<P>
All the members addressing this afternoon's plenary meeting
warned of the situation in which ethnical and social mood is
deteriorating and superstitious activities have become widespread
while they are offering proposals to highlighting cultural and
ideological development in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996--2000).
</P>
<P>
Other members suggested that governments at various levels make
full use of the cultural facilities such as libraries, science
museums and other museums, and memorial halls and other cultural
facilities to the service of teenagers.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Bent On Vitalizing State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province aims at revitalizing its state-owned enterprises in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the province voiced their confidence at the
ongoing session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
A traditional industrial base, Liaoning's large and
medium-sized enterprises account for ten percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
The government has incorporated the revamping of traditional
industrial bases into the nation's Ninth Five-Year Plan, said
Governor Wen Shizhen, and the provincial authorities have worked
out a detailed plan that focuses on setting up manufacturing bases
for new types of raw materials, large industrial equipment and
high and new technology products.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, Liaoning will strengthen four
industrial "pillars" -- petrochemical, metallurgical, electronics
and machinery industries, build up 30 large enterprise groups, and
complete 200 major technical renovation projects, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to add a total of 256.6 billion yuan in industrial
revenues by 2000, more than half of which will come from the four
pillar industries."
</P>
<P>
Quan Shuren, chairman of the provincial people's congress, said
Liaoning's revitalization relies more on the revamping of existing
facilities rather than the launching of new projects.
</P>
<P>
Said Wu Tingbao, manager of a well-run state-owned
pharmaceutical factory, "With state policies giving preferential
treatment to large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, such
enterprises can give full play to their great potential in
technology, quality of staff, and management experience."

<HEADLINE> Israel Arrests 170 Hamas Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 170 Hamas and Islamic
Jihad activists have been arrested by Israel in a campaign to
crack down on fundamentalist groups since Sunday, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Security forces also sealed six Islamic colleges and eight
homes in the campaign..
</P>
<P>
Col. Moshe Elad, chief liaison officer with the Palestinians,
said Thursday that there had been a turning point in Palestinian
cooperation with Israeli security forces in the actions.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian forces are starting to act against Hamas
terrorists, but they have yet to apprehend the main activists," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Israeli army undercover units said that
his men had captured five "wanted" Palestinians in the West Bank
in recent days. The five are tied to recent suicide bombing
attacks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio, the unidentified commander
said his units are operating along the Green Line between Israel
and Palestinian territories, with assistance of helicopters in
addition to activities within the territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in order to further seal off the territories, army
bulldozers began to dump large boulders and quantities of sand
along back roads and paths near Kalkilya and Tulkarm to prevent
Arab laborers from sneaking in.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Administration said all work permits held by Gazans
are now invalid, and that new ones will be issued soon.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Karif, a spokesman for the coordinator of activities in
the territories, said the closure is keeping some 20,000 Gazans
from their jobs in Israel. It is not likely they will be allowed
to start returning until next week at the earliest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The army lifted the closure on 465 villages in the West
Bank for 12 hours Thursday to allow Palestinians travel to
other villages to stock up on food and other supplies. But
by 7 p.m., all Palestinians were confined to their towns and
villages.

<HEADLINE> Rabies Cases On Rise In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- the number of rabies cases in
Uganda rose from 2,614 in 1994 to 3,000 in 1995, according to
official figures released here today.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that 1,518 people got rabies from bites in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Rabies is a fatal disease caused by a virus that attacks the
victim's nervous system and is transmitted from the saliva of a
rabid animal to humans through an opening or wound on the
victim's skin.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of every 10 rabies cases are reportedly transmitted
by rabid dogs.
</P>
<P>
The infection is 100 percent fatal. It takes between nine days
and a few years for the symptoms of rabies to occor in man,
though most people who get infected with rabies develop the
disease within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the second world war, rabies is on the rise
in the world. About 25 years ago, Uganda was able to control
rabies through mass vaccination of dogs and cats and elimination
of stray dogs through strict enforcement of the rabies control
act.
</P>
<P>
by 1970, the disease was virtually eliminated in all areas of
Uganda except in West Nile and Kigezi in southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
But from the 1980s the disease made a come back and between
1979 to 1980, several major hospitals recorded a total of 265
cases, of whom 21 percent died.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government currently spends about 135,000 US
dollars every year on vaccines to try and contain the disease.

<HEADLINE> China-Taiwan-Qian 1st add Taiwan People not to Panic over Military Exercises: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
said here today "Taiwan compatriots don't have to panic over
military exercises by the People's Liberation Army."
</P>
<P>
"What they should really worry about is that the 'independence'
seekers, with support from some international forces bent on
splitting China, continue on their wrong path," he said, warning
"that will be a real disaster."
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks at a panel discussion of Taiwan deputies
to the National People's Congress now in session here.
</P>
<P>
China will not change its stand on the Taiwan issue of
"peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the central government does not undertake to
renounce the use of force, he said, is directed against foreign
forces intent on separating Taiwan from China and the
"independence" seekers in Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan issue is "rather complicated," but the main
obstacles to its resolution have been foreign forces unwilling to
see a reunified China and the separatists inside Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Only by taking resolute and uncompromising measures against
them can we prevent the separatist forces from developing and
clear the obstacles for reunification," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the allegation that differences in economic
development and perception of things between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits can be an obstacle for reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland is a strong base for Taiwan's economic
development and provides immense market opportunities for Taiwan
businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual 20 billion US dollars worth of cross-Straits trade,
with Taiwan enjoying a surplus of 10 billion US dollars, is the
best proof, according to the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the central government will not demand one cent from
Taiwan after the reunification, and Taiwan will continue its foreign
trade as practiced today, with no interference from the central
government, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people on the two sides of the Straits have some
difficulties in understanding each other because of several
decades of separation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, with the same cultural origin and more frequent
economic and cultural exchanges between them, the perception gap
is being narrowed," he said.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin on Reunification with Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- "Our struggle will not stop so
long as Taiwan authorities do not cease its activities to split
the motherland for a single day," Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Joining Shanghai deputies to the ongoing session of the
National People's Congress, the country's parliament, Jiang said
that China's latest missile-launching exercises in the sea areas
off northeast and southwest Taiwan are normal military exercises
aimed at improving China's military capability of safeguarding
national security and unity.
</P>
<P>
"During a recent period of time, new complexities have emerged
in relations across the Taiwan Straits and they have aroused great
concern among people of the whole nation," said Jiang, who is also
chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an unalienable part of China and the country will
never allow any force in any way to change Taiwan's status as a
part of it, Jiang reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He told the deputies that "We will continue to develop
relations across the Straits.... and encourage Taiwan
businesspeople to invest in the mainland and protect their
legitimate rights and interests."

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A grand ceremony at which
people from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda will witness the launching
of the East African Treaty of Cooperation, has been planned to
take place in Northern Tanzanian city Arusha next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a press conference here on Thursday, Tanzanian
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,
Jakaya Kikwete, said it had been planned to make the East African
Cooperation a body that belongs to the people of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The defunct East African Community was launched in the
presence of Heads of State of the three countries, but the new
body must be launched in the presence of the ordinary citizens at
a public function", he said.
</P>
<P>
The highlights will be the signing of the agreement by the
Heads of state of the three East African nations to start the
Secretariat of the East African Cooperation to be housed in the
Arusha International Conference Center (AICC).
</P>
<P>
Starting of the Secretariat comes after the body's Secretary
General, Francis Mathaura, a Kenyan, was appointed by President
Daniel arap Moi recently.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, to take place at the Arusha Stadium, would also
be attended by the Secretary General of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The retired Tanzanian Government presidents, Mwalimu Nyerere
and Ali Hassan Mwinyi who with Presidents Moi and Museveni signed
the agreement for the new cooperation replacing the defunct EAC,
would also be present.
</P>
<P>
He further said, "we are now confident the cooperation will
take off".
</P>
<P>
However, the ceremony would be preceded by a meeting for
Principal Secretaries on March 11 and followed on the next day
by a meeting for ministers and heads of state who would meet on
the inauguration day, March 14, Minister Kikwete noted.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian, Kenyan Wheat Production Increased By 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The latest outlook from the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that the Ethiopian
and Kenyan wheat production has increased by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
FAO said the harvesting is completed in the countries and the
latest forecast of the sub-region 1995 aggregate output is 2.5
million tons, 19 percent above the good volume of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the harvest to favorable weather during the
season, saying that "an improved distribution of fertilizers and
an absence of migratory pests have resulted in the main season
coarse grain crop, which accounts for over 90 percent of annual
production, being estimated to be at a record level".
</P>
<P>
FAO said that Uganda, Tanzania and the Sudan all recorded
increases in harvest yields.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, FAO said, coarse grains in Somalia and Eritrea
were sharply reduced due to severe pest infestation and erratic
rains.
</P>
<P>
It added that the continuing unstable situation in Rwanda and
Burundi is expected to affect 1996 first season coarse grain
crops.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The struggle against Taiwan
independence waged by the Chinese people will not stop so long as
the activities of Taiwan authorities to split China do not cease
for a day, a senior non-communist party official said here today.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairperson of the Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, made the remark
at the 2nd plenary session of the 8th national committee of the
advisory Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), of which she is a member.
</P>
<P>
"The reunification of the motherland is currently at a very
critical moment," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin early last year
made an "eight-point" proposal on the country's peaceful
reunification, which have been well received and supported by the
Chinese in and outside China.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, however, has not made any sincere response to
Jiang's proposal, she said. Instead, Lee has intensified his
activities to split the motherland and openly advertise "two
Chinas" in the world.
</P>
<P>
What Lee has done has made the relations across the Taiwan
Straits suffer serious setbacks and retrogression, she told the
meeting, noting that the political countercurrent of "Taiwan
independence" has evolved into a "practical danger" because of
Lee's direct involvement and open manipulation.
</P>
<P>
"The resolute countermove the Chinese government has taken are
completely justified and in the fundamental interest of our
country and nation," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people's struggle against breakup (of the country)
and Taiwan independence will not stop so long as the activities to
split the motherland by the Taiwan authorities do not cease for a
day," the member told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the focal point of the battle of splitting
and anti-splitting (China) is adhered to or violate the principle
of one China.
</P>
<P>
"Under the principle of one China, all issues can be discussed
between the two sides," she said. "Departing from the principle,
nothing can be talked."
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Lee Teng-hui is attempting to making use of the
change in how the leadership in Taiwan is produced to alter the
nature of the Taiwan issue and done the "Taiwan independence" in a
cloak of "justice", she said, adding that Lee's perverse acts have
harmed the fundamental interest of the nation and led to grave
consequence in the Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
"We notice that the Taiwan media has been calling for
development of pragmatic relations across the Taiwan Straits under
the principle of one China," she said. "This reflects the common
aspiration of the Taiwan compatriots and Lee's acts are becoming
increasingly unpopular."
</P>
<P>
The historical tide is irresistable and the wish of the people
can not be violated, she said, warning that the final ending will
be self-evident if Lee Teng-hui is bent on having his own way and
keeps going down the dangerous track (of splitting China).

<HEADLINE> No "China Threat" Say Foreign Military Leaders (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chief of staff from a European country said that during his
China visit he did not see China as having expansionist intentions
or of threating its neighboring countries. China is for stability,
seeks neighborly relations, and is trying to create an environment
of long-term international peace for domestic economic development.
</P>
<P>
He also told Chinese army leaders that it seems that quite a
few people from the West have a misunderstanding of the Chinese
army and that the mass media in the West have distorted the news
about China in their reports. After the visit, he said, he saw big
differences between what he had seen and what he had previously
read about China.
</P>
<P>
Some visitors from neighboring countries strongly attacked the
assertion of a "China Threat" as biased, saying that China is and
will be a major force in maintaining regional peace and
stability. One said he believes China has not been involved in a
regional arms race and other countries should not exacerbate the
arms race by using China's economic growth as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
China's military expenditures have been low in spite of rapid
economic growth in the past 16 years, after the introduction of
reform and opening up policies. Defense spending has been kept at
a level that meets the country's basic security needs.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1994, total military expenditures were 416.49
billion yuan, and accounted for 71.65 percent of actual needs. The
annual rate of increase of defense spending stood at 6.23 percent,
compared with the averaged annual inflation rate of 7.7 percent
during those years.
</P>
<P>
China's military expenditures have been lower than those of all
other countries in the world. Its expenditures of 6.39 billion
U.S. dollars' worth in 1994 were only 2.3 percent of the U.S.'s
expenditures, 18.3 percent of Britain's, 18.6 percent of France's
and 13.9 percent of Japan's. In the 16 year-period, China's
spending on defense decreased from 5.6 percent to 1.3 percent in
terms of proportion of GDP, which is much lower not only than
those of developed countries but also of many developing
countries.

A senior American army officer told Chinese counterparts that
some people had asked him whether China posed a threat to the
region and the world when he had visited some Asian-Pacific
nations.
</P>
<P>
The notion of threat embraces two aspects, he said, one is
capability and the other is intention. In terms of capability,
China might have the power to be a threat, compared with the
strength of its neighboring countries. However, as he sees it,
China does not have the intention of threatening anyone.

He also pointed out that China does not have any aircraft
carriers at the moment. In the future, even if it wants to obtain
one, this should not be considered posing threats to others, and
fundamentally, if China is not a threat at the moment, it will not
become one in the future when its economy continues to develop, he
said.
</P>
<P>
If the United States and China, which are both major countries
in the Asia-Pacific region, cooperate in military affairs and in
other fields it might lead to "miracles" in regional security and
contribute to stability and peace in the region, he noted. It
follows from this that there is no need for the Asia-Pacific
region to have any military blocs such as NATO in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
An African senior army officer told Chinese army leaders that,
as he sees it, the PLA has a very clear goal, and that is to
defend the country, and no other purpose.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has begun to dig a
channel on the bank of the Moei river in Mae Sot in Tak province
as part of its solution to the border dispute with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The digging work was ordered to start Thursday by Deputy
Interior Ministry Suchart Tancharoen immediately after the
agreements were reached during bilateral talks between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The one kilometer-long channel, with eight meters in width and
one meter in depth, is being dug in curve beyond the rive bank and
it is expected to be completed on Saturday or Sunday when a small
island is created in the river.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the project is aimed at restoring
the area to the way it was before the Thai-Myanmar friendship
bridge was built there.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar previously claimed that Thailand had encroached by
using soil deposits to fill a channel between the Thai side, which
once served as the border.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese and Malaysian prime
ministers have agreed to strengthen friendship and cooperation
between the two countries after a meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the talks today, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet told
visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that Vietnam
wishes to further broaden cooperation with Malaysia, according to
Vietnamese press today.
</P>
<P>
Kiet expressed gratitude for Malaysia's help in Vietnam's
accession to ASEAN (Association of Southeastern Asian Nations) and
its sharing of experience in the fields of infrastructural
construction, tourism, capital mobilization and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mahathir reaffirmed his country's policy to
strengthen the multi-faceted cooperation with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived in Hanoi Thursday on a three-day official
visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also hailed the success of the first
Asia-Europe meeting held in Bangkok last week and vowed to work on
concrete projects, particularly the development of the Mekong
river region and the Asia trans-railway system.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to continue cooperation within the ASEAN
especially in the context that Vietnam will host the sixth ASEAN
summit.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Communist Party chief Do Muoi and state President Le
Duc Anh also met separately on Thursday with the Malaysian Prime
Minister.

describing it as a new step in the development of friendship,
cooperation and mutual trust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which has 44 investment projects in Vietnam with a
capital totaling 860 million U.S. dollars, is the seventh largest
foreign investor in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> No "China Threat" Say Foreign Military Leaders (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign military leaders who
visited China last year have denied the existence of a so-called
"China Threat".
</P>
<P>
They point out that China is and will always be an important
factor in maintaining regional and global security and that the
"China Threat" simply doesn't exist. China's economic growth is an
important contribution to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the People's Liberation Army hosted 125 military
delegations from 55 countries, 47 of which were led by either
defense ministers, chiefs of staff, or commanders of various
branches of their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During their visit to China, the delegations exchanged views
with Chinese military leaders on bilateral military exchanges and
cooperation, and on regional and international security and other
issues. Insights were gained after they visited Chinese military
academies, PLA units, and military research departments.
</P>
<P>
The visitors said they appreciated China's move to cut one
million members of the armed forces over the past decade and were
impressed by the PLA's strict discipline, the comradeship of
officers and men, and their good training. They also spoke highly
of the PLA's role in the country's economic development, and
emphatically denied the existence of a "China Threat".
</P>
<P>
Their talks with PLA officers and visits around the country
helped them get a better understanding of China's defense strategy
and of the PLA's modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Mainland's Development To Add Vitality To Hong Kong Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Implementation of the Chinese
mainland's development program for the next 15 years will instill
vitality into Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and a
deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remark
today at a group meeting of Guangdong deputies.
</P>
<P>
With the economies of the mainland and Hong Kong closely related
to each other, Zhou said, the two sides have kept increasing
their mutual cooperation, to the benefit of both.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong remains the biggest investor in the mainland and
gets high returns from doing business with the mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, Hong Kong's robustly growing trade is a primary
force elevating it among one of the four most developed economies
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Zhou explained that a considerable part of Hong Kong's trade
growth, which is much higher than its overall economic growth
rate, is achieved by its entrepot trade with the mainland, which
is expected to keep rising in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"This will no doubt be a huge boost for Hong Kong's
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Zhou stressed that Hong Kong and the mainland will, after 1997,
be able to conduct cooperation to mutual benefit on a higher
plane, such as teaming up to achieve a change in Hong Kong's
economic growth mode from labor-intensive to technology-intensive.
</P>
<P>
With its labor-intensive industries shifting to the mainland in
recent years, Hong Kong people are worried that its future
economic expansion, which depends on a smooth change of growth
modes, can be hampered by the lack of a long-term plan for the
development of high and new technologies, which already lags
behind the other three major economies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the issue, Zhou Nan suggests that Hong Kong combine
its advantages in capital, information and international business
expertise, with the mailand's advantages in scientific research,
talent in science and technology, and market size to help adjust
Hong Kong's industrial structure and consolidate its status as a
world financial, trade and shipping center.
</P>
<P>
"It is our common wish to maintain Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity." said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He talked appreciatively about Hong Kong people not wishing to
turn the city into a political struggle center. "Turning itself
into a political struggle center will inevitably hurt Hong Kong's
stability; and lack of stability will undermine its prosperity,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Wants to Start Non-Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition leader Sheikh
Hasina has urged the people to start non-cooperation with the
government for an indefinite period from March 9 to force fresh
polls for the sixth parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally attended by her supporters here Thursday,
Sheikh Hasina, president of the biggest opposition Awami
(People's) League (AL), said that "To intensify the movement and
go ahead, the Khaleda Zia government will be compelled to accept
the people's demand."
</P>
<P>
Reiterating her five-point proposal offered Wednesday, the AL
chief asked Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to quit clearing way for
the president to form a neutral non-party government by March 10
to supervise elections in May.
</P>
<P>
She also demanded the release of all opposition leaders and
workers from jail by March 9, cancellation of the February 15
elections and resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
"Step down or face movement...these vote thieves and corrupts
have no right to be in power," Hasina said at the rally marred by
bomb blasts, gunshots and teargasing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joint Secretary General of the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Mannan Bhuiyan said that his party was yet
to formally decide on the opposition's demands, especially the
cancellation of the February 15 polls, which boycotted by
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Mannan Bhuiyan, however, said the BNP government would decide
on the opposition's proposal that the president initiates a
dialogue on the proposed non-party government after they got
Hasina's reply to Khaleda Zia's letter.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia, who is also president of BNP, Tuesday sent a
letter to Hasina inviting her to a dialogue for resolving the
country's nearly two-year-old political crisis.

BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Personalities from China's
non-Communist parties and organizations said Premier Li Peng's
report on the country's goals in the coming 15 years will exert
profound impact on its future development.
</P>
<P>
These members of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), present at the
on-going CPPCC annual session, have been discussing the report
delivered by Li Peng on the country's Ninth Five-year Plan

<HEADLINE> Commentary: U.S. Sanctions Against Cuba Unpopular (By Yuan Bingzhong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has gained
little support from the international community and even its
allies for a bill aiming to ruin the Cuban economy and punish
foreign companies who do business with the Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
Many countries and organizations have said they will not accept
the vengeful measures passed by the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, and
will continue to develop trade and economic relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), which accounts for 45 percent of
Cuba's foreign trade, and the 14-member Caribbean Community have
said the bill violates international law. The EU said it may
challenge the measure through the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Russian parliament said it was "alarming" that Washington
would impose U.S. law on other countries, while Spain's foreign
ministry said the measure would have negative consequences for the
welfare of the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Mexico, partners with the United States in the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), said the bill violates
NAFTA's free-trade principles. Canada has drawn up a law which
punishes Canada-based U.S. companies which refuse to trade with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations passed a resolution last November urging the
U.S. to suspend its 34-year-old economic embargo. Several Western
countries have been increasing their trade and economic relations
with Cuba in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Cuba attracted more than 2 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign investment. Trade between Cuba and the Caribbean Community
totaled 30 million dollars last year, while Cuban trade with
Canada stood at 515 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. maintained its hostile attitude toward Cuba and
refused to lift its blockade against the island-state imposed
since 1961 when Fidel Castro launched Cuba's socialist revolution.
</P>
<P>
The bill, named after its sponsors, Republican Senator Jesse
Helms and Indiana Republican Representative Dan Burton, is another
vengeful measure against Cuba in retaliation for the shooting down
last month of two U.S.-registered aircraft by Cuban jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Bill codifies all existing embargo orders
issued against Cuba by the White House, effectively preventing
Clinton or any future president from rescinding those orders
without an act of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Cuban commodities are forbidden to enter the
U.S. market through other countries. The bill would deny
U.S. visas to foreigners who profit from property that was
confiscated by the Castro administration. It also would allow
U.S. nationals whose property was confiscated by Cuba to seek
compensation in U.S. courts from any foreign national who bought
that property from Cuba's government.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill, which was approved easily by the Senate
on Tuesday, 74-22, is to be sent to President Bill Clinton, who is
likely to sign it.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said it will not gain the support of the
international community and will harm the U.S. itself.
</P>
<P>
In the international political and economic arena, hegemony,
brute force and interference in other countries' internal affairs
under the pretext of human rights have lost their efficacy, said
observers.

<HEADLINE> Britons vs Rest of World in World 9-Ball Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- English snooker aces Steve Davis
and Jimmy White are confident they can lead Team Europe to
victory over the United States and Asia in the two-day World
Nine-Ball Challenge starting here today.
</P>
<P>
The Britons suffered a 17-11 humiliation in the hands of
Americans Dallas West and Mark Wilson here last October, but this
time the European team is reinforced by German nine-ball experts
Oliver Ortmann and Ralph Souguet.
</P>
<P>
Ortmann is the world nine-ball champion while Souguet is ranked
third in the world. All the four Europeans were members of the
squad that won the Mosconi Cup, an American-European challenge
early this year.
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy and myself are keen to win this event and with Oliver
and Ralph, we've got a much stronger team than the last time we
played here," said Davis, a six-time world snooker champion.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very exciting game, perhaps the best," Davis said on
his arrival. "Although I am not the top player of the 9-ball
game, I'm learning and I'm playing better with every match. I
enjoyed it."
</P>
<P>
The Americans are looking for revenge for the Mosconi Cup
defeat and eager to prove they are still the best, but the modest
Wilson is not making any predictions.
</P>
<P>
Only Wilson and West played in the Mosconi Cup and this time
they are joined by Earl Strickland and Carlson "C.J." Wiley.
</P>
<P>
"It's any body's game with Europe having the current world
champion in their team while Asia and ourselves have two of the
finest pool players ever.
</P>
<P>
"Earl and Efren Reyes (of the Asian team) are widely recognized
as the two premier nine-ball players on earth," said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Team Asia is represented by four experienced Filipinos - Reyes,
Rodolfo Luat, Leonardo Andam and Francisco Bustamante, who won
the 1993 world billiards team championships.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) is considering staging an international
seven-a-side soccer tournament, according to local press reports
here today.
</P>
<P>
HKFA chief executive Vincent Yuen Man-chuen said yesterday that
a sevens proposal was being considered.
</P>
<P>
"It is an interesting concept and we will not rule out the
possibility of staging it like the rugby sevens," Yuen said.
</P>
<P>
The only football seven-a-side tournament in Hong Kong is the
President Cup.
</P>
<P>
Although a report prepared by ISL, the marketing firm for the
HKFA, showed an increase in attendance this season, no significant
rise in gate-receipts was shown, Yuen said.
</P>
<P>
Yuen added this was mainly caused by concessionary tickets for
the elderly and students.
</P>
<P>
The report said the HKFA selection committee has named a 12-man
squad for this month's Five-A-Side World Cup qualifiers in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Also set to play in the March 27-28 tournament are teams from
China, South Korea and Japan, the report added.

CPPCC Plenary Meeting Held on Proposal Handling (Eds: with
details and speech by members)
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Session of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, held its second
plenary meeting this morning on the results of handling proposals
submitted by members since the annual session last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Tongshan, vice-chairman of the Subcommittee for Handling
Proposals of the CPPCC National Committee, told members present at
today's plenary meeting that the subcommittee had received 2,377
proposals, in which 2,177 were accepted for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
By February 10 of this year, he said, 2,144 or 98.5 percent of
these proposals have been handled, among which issues in 1,766
proposals have been or are being settled.
</P>
<P>
This morning's plenary meeting was attended by Li Ruihuan,
chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and executive chairmen of
the session. Zou Jiahua, vice-premier of the State Council, and
leading officials from government ministries of the State Council
were also present.
</P>
<P>
Handling proposals by members is an important part of work for
the CPPCC, Zhou said, adding that these proposals involve
agriculture, the reform and development of state-owned
enterprises, inflation control, readjustment of industrial
structure. Others concern bridging regional disparity, science,
technology, culture, public heath, physical culture and medicine
as well as political, legal and social welfare issues.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these proposals have been adopted by government
departments and proved valuable for government decision-making,"
Zhou said, adding that explanations have also been made for those
proposals that cannot be handled for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Following the speech by Zhou Tongshan, seven CPPCC members
addressed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yang Rudai, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, put
forward ten proposals on bridging regional disparity such as to
correctly handling the relationships between the interests of the
central authorities and local governments and coping with the
relationship between economic returns and comprehensive efficiency
and short and long-term efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Yang also suggested that the central government grant special
investment to western areas and support agriculture, animal
husbandry production in the central and western areas
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuzhao, vice-chairman of the Subcommittee of Economy,
emphasized on implementing two fundamental shifts in economic
structure and economic growth mode by taking effective measures
such as transformation of government function and readjustment of
economic development plans.
</P>
<P>
Jin Jian, vice-chairman of the Subcommittee of Nationalities
and Religion, called for attention to some problems in the
economic development in the ethnic minority areas. He proposed
perfecting and implementing the preferential policies towards the
ethnic minority areas.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairperson of the Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang condemned Lee
Teng-hui for his plot to undermine the fundamental interests of
the Chinese nation by resorting to perverse acts.
</P>
<P>
The cause of China's peaceful reunification is in a critical
moment, said Madame He who expressed her hope that people in
Taiwan will oppose the Taiwan independence so as to contribute to
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Donors Urge Prompt Political Dialogue in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen donor agencies have urged
political leaders in Bangladesh to engage immediately in frank and
constructive dialogue to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release published here today, the donor
agencies led by the World Bank mission made the appeal after they
met on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, they expressed mounting concern at the grave
impact the worsening political and law and order situation was
having on the welfare of Bangladeshis and the country's
development.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government and the opposition have reached a
political impasse over the issue of the establishment of a neutral
caretaker government to supervise the February 15 elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party went ahead with the
election together with some small parties and independent
candidates and won, while all opposition parties boycotted the
polls, as their demand for the establishment of a caretaker
government was turned down by the government.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the opposition demanded cancellation of the polls
and resignation of the present government to pave the way for a
fresh election under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The donor agencies said political stability is a prerequisite
for development and that only through determined efforts for
reconciliation would it be possible for Bangladesh to establish a
firm basis for tapping its huge potential, the donors stressed.
</P>
<P>
The press release noted that "there is already mounting
evidence of substantial harm done to the economy by the unrest of
recent months. The disruption of the main ports, railways and
other transport is resulting in hostages everywhere, causing
serious output losses and higher prices."
</P>
<P>
A quick return to normalcy is essential if Bangladesh was to
avoid a further devastating loss of export markets, foreign
investment and consequently jobs, not to mention damage to
property, the donor agencies said. They called for a swift
resolution of the ongoing conflict through peaceful dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urges Developed Countries to Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today urged industrialized countries to
open up their markets to East Asian exports to promote free trade
in the global trading system instead of trying to throttle the
growth momentum of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day symposium on East Asian Economies here,
Anwar said the fears of various groups in developed countries that
unfettered free trade would destroy their economies were very
alarmist.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also Malaysia's finance minister, said that "Much
earlier, it was the developing countries who had feared that free
trade would be bad for them. Now the champions of the
protectionism seem to be residing in the industrialized world."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a continuously growing East Asia would
provide the entire world with larger markets and more business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) proposed by
Malaysia, Anwar said as countries in other parts of the world
stepped up their regional cooperation, it would only be natural
for East Asia to do the same.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium on the theme "Sustaining Growth and
Stability" is attended by scholars, economists, government
officials and representatives of private sectors from 13
countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the
Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Japan,
Laos, Myanmar and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Dole Wins Landslide Victory in New York Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole today won another landslide victory in his way to get the
Republican presidential nomination by sweeping the primary in New
York, according to latest television reports.
</P>
<P>
Dole, who won overwhelming victories in ten primaries in less
than a week, beat multimillionaire magazine publisher Steve Forbes
and TV commentator Pat Buchanan in the primary of New York.
</P>
<P>
Forbes and Buchanan are the only remanent obstacles of the
72-year-old Senate majority leader to win the GOP nomination at
the party's National Convention in San Diego in August.
</P>
<P>
Dole's three other rivals in the party have quit the race for
the White House and voiced their backing to Dole.
</P>
<P>
But both Buchanan and Forbes have vowed to continue their fight
until the San Diego convention.
</P>
<P>
The TV reports showed that Dole won nearly all of the 93
delegates at stake in the New York race, bringing his national
total to 380. Forbes had 72. Buchanan was the third with 62.
</P>
<P>
New York's 93 delegates to the GOP National Convention are so
far the biggest prize in the primary season. At least 996
delegates are required for a candidate to win the nomination at
the August convention.
</P>
<P>
Dole said he viewed today's strong victory as a sign that
voters were looking ahead to the general elections in November.
</P>
<P>
"People are beginning to focus on party unity," he told
reporters. "Our contest is going to be with President Clinton, and
most republicans out there are beginning to understand that there
is one candidate who can beat (President) Bill Clinton."
</P>
<P>
Dole held out the possibility of a rapprochement with Buchanan
and Forbes. Buchanan, who has been advocating extreme
conservative platforms such as protectionist trade, recently
suffered repeated defeats after winning first Republican primaries
in February.
</P>
<P>
Forbes, who has been campaigning on his own money, now stands
second in the race with little likelihood of winning the
nomination.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China produced 271.8 billion
yuan-worth of industrial output in the first two months of this
year, up 14.4 percent over the same period of last year, according
to a report issued today by the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises and enterprises in which the state
holds a controlling stake realized 159.3 billion yuan-worth of
industrial output, 8.3 percent more than in the corresponding
period last year, with the former witnessing an eight-percent
growth in output.
</P>
<P>
The report said that during the January-February period,
China's heavy industry realized an output value of 157.2 billion
yuan, a rise of 14.6 percent on an annual basis, while light
industry realized a new output value of 114.6 billion yuan, an
increase of 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy industry accelerated its development at almost the same
speed as that of light industry," said the report, "ending the
leading position of light industry."
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the same period China produced primary
energy equivalent to 173 million tons of standard coal, nine
percent more than in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Both coal production and power generation saw increases of ten
percent, while crude oil production rose 5.9 percent during the
first two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Production of rolled steel and pig iron grew 5.6 percent and
7.8 percent, respectively, during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China's production of commodities which
support agricultural production also witnessed a rapid rise.
</P>
<P>
China produced 4.29 million tons of fertilizer during the two
months, an increase of 14.4 percent on a yearly basis.

<HEADLINE> New Sources of Funds for Yangtze Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China should set up a fund-raising
system to accumulate capital to support growth in the Yangtze
River Valley, reports Shanghai's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Developing the Yangtze River Valley, China's economic
powerhouse, needs a huge amount of capital," Lu Baifu, deputy
director of the Research Center for Economic, Technological and
Social Development under the State Council was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The third longest river in the world, the Yangtze flows through
ten provinces and autonomous regions and its valley holds a large
part of China's population and economic output.
</P>
<P>
"An effective fund-raising system is of great importance as it
will enable us to tap huge domestic and overseas capital sources,"
Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China establish a regional development bank,
which could be "co-sponsored by state policy and commercial banks
and the 26 six cities in the valley and the coastal areas."
</P>
<P>
The bank could provide loans to supplement state investment and
loans for key projects in the Yangtze River Valley that follow
regional and state development guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"It could offer commercial loans and raise short-term funds for
local projects that follow commercial rules," he added.
</P>
<P>
"To pool domestic and overseas capital, China should set up a
"Yangtze River Development Fund", a "Yangtze River Development
Trust", and an "investment institution for managing overseas
loans," the research center director suggested.

<HEADLINE> Moscow, Tehran Discuss International Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin met
with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati here
Thursday, focusing on fighting international terrorism, the
presidential press service reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin attracted attention to the activization of the Chechen
extremists' terrorist activity, saying that they are getting
support from abroad, first of all from certain circles in Islamic
countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran's influence can promote the creation of
conditions for preventing terrorism, referring to the acts of the
Chechen rebels loyal to separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev. The
15-month-long Chechen war has been the top headache for Yeltsin
who had begun his campaign running for a second term of office in
June.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also met with his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov
Thursday. "I am inspired by Velayati's call for stepping up the
struggle against international terrorism and his conviction that
any terrorist attacks against civilians are unlawful and must be
excluded from international affairs," Primakov noted.
</P>
<P>
At his meetings with both Yeltsin and Primakov, Velayati
rejected U.S. and Israel's accusations of Iran's involvement in
acts of terror and strongly dismissed the charges that Tehran
allegedly supported extremist Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is not involved in any of the incidents in the
Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories," Velayati stated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Government Spending Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House has approved
today with an edge of only three votes a spending bill financing
some federal agencies through the 1996 fiscal year to avoid a new
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has been partially shut down twice in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The House measure would provide an extra 3.3 billion U.S.
dollars for several government agencies whose fiscal 1996 budget
remains mired in partisan battles.
</P>
<P>
But the plan is still billions of dollars short of what
President Bill Clinton wants for domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has demanded 8 billion dollars more for
education, environment protection and other programs and
threatened to veto any bill that lacks sufficient funds for job
training, environment and technological research.
</P>
<P>
White House budget chief Alice Rivlin has said earlier that the
White House and Congress would "act together to resolve our
differences."
</P>
<P>
The House-approved bill is expected to go to the Senate next
week.
</P>
<P>
Five months into fiscal 1996, which began from October 1, 1995,
the departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban
Development and other agencies are still operating on temporary
spending measures as the White House and Congress could not agree
on a balanced budget plan.
</P>
<P>
The temporary spending authority expires on March 15.
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. Congress moved to head off an
unprecedented and politically explosive federal default by voting
to temporarily give the government extra borrowing authority. The
House approved earlier today by 362-51 to extend through March 29
the debt ceiling for the U.S. government which will breach also on
March 15. The Senate followed with a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is expected to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
But even with that issue solved for now, a wide gap remains
between the White House and Congress over how to keep the
government running.

COLOMBO, March 8 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka has released several
Indian trawlers which were poaching in Sri Lankan eastern waters
and were captured by the navy Thursday, official sources here said

<HEADLINE> Social Workers Urge End to Child Labor in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Social workers participating in
a South Asian forum on child labor here called for an end to child
labor in the region, according to a 10-point declaration available
today.
</P>
<P>
The document issued at the end of the forum Thursday urged
South Asian governments to fulfill their commitments to the issue,
initiate related development programs, and ensure children's
rights to education.
</P>
<P>
The one-day forum was a follow-up program of a South Asia
children freedom march which set off from Calcutta, India on March
1 and reached the Nepali capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The march is aimed at raising public awareness of the child
labor issue.
</P>
<P>
The march was joined by some 60 people including child laborers
and child labor activists from South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Kailash Satyarthy, president of the South Asian Coalition on
Child Servitude and leader of the march, said that lack of
political will and social conscience was the main reason for the
worsening situation of child labor in the region.
</P>
<P>
Satyarthy added that the number of child workers was growing by
over 300 percent every year in the region.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about 80 million children are involved in
various forms of child labor in South Asia mainly due to family
poverty, and many of them worke as bonded laborers.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- French dietary habits have changed
gradually in the last 30 years with the intake of frozen foods,
sour milk and cheese increasing and the consumption of bread and
potatoes declining.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey published by the newspaper Le Figaro
today, the French have shortened the time they spend on meals from
two and a half hours per day in 1965 to one hour and twenty
minutes per day in 1995. More and more French pay more attention
to breakfast and have a simple luncheon instead.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that currently, the French consume fewer
calories -- from 2,500 calories per day 30 years ago to 2,000 for
men and 1,800 for women today.
</P>
<P>
Another change in their dietary habits is the drop in wine
drinking. They drink less wine and beer but more soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, their expenditure on food has dropped from 35
percent to 18 percent of their total household expenditure in the
past 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Advances in Endemic Diseases Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The three provinces and two
autonomous regions in northwest China have made great achievements
in curbing endemic diseases in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Endemic diseases like brucellosis, fluorine deficiency, arsenic
poisoning and iodine deficiency used to afflict Shaanxi, Gansu,
and Qinghai provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
During China's Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), the
area put a total of over 68 million yuan (about eight million US
dollars) into the prevention and cure of these diseases.
</P>
<P>
Nearly seven million people in the area have benefited from
water-improvement projects such as reducing the fluorine and
arsenic content in water.
</P>
<P>
So far, around 75 percent of the population in the disease-hit
places, which are usually economically backward and have harsh
natural environments and hard living conditions, have been
protected by the water-improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all the people there had the access to iodized
salt by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Related departments in the northwest have carried out
activities aimed at destroying plague hosts such as rats, marmots
and fleas. After observations and studies, they also eliminated
serious diseases among animals.
</P>
<P>
To protect livestock from brucellosis and echinococcosis, which
constitute threats to animal husbandry, a pillar industry in the
northwest, immunization of domestic animals has been emphasized,
as well as examinations and prompt killing of infected livestock.
</P>
<P>
The northwest area has also expanded production of quality
iodized salt and strengthened crackdowns on illegal salt
dealers. Meanwhile, the application of seleniferous salt has
helped reduce the incidence of Kaschin-Beck disease.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years the northwest area has run hundreds of
courses to train people in endemic disease prevention and cure.

<HEADLINE> Proposals On "Change of Growth Mode" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Changing people's perception is of
primary importance for effecting a fundamental change in the
economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
This is the first of four proposals for economic development
put forward by Wang Yuzhao, a member of the Standing Committee of
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, which is currently in session here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second plenary meeting of the session, Wang, who
is also the deputy director of the economic subcommittee of the
advisory body, said a change of the economic system and the
economic growth mode is crucial for the fulfilment of China's
development goals for the next 15 years set forth by the central
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that effective measures should be taken to carry
out the policy, and his four proposals are:
</P>
<P>
First of all, officials must realize the harms of launching too
many capital construction projects. The launching of too many new
projects does not necessarily boost revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, a change of government functions, separation of
government and enterprise, and establishment of a unified open
market.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the present regional economic layout and industrial
structure is highly irrational with large amounts of repetitive
construction with each province wanting to have everything. New
project launches must be strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, a change of standards evaluating the work performance
of officials, many of whom, he said, like to brag and do
superficial things for the sake of personal advancement.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Moves to Step Up Fight Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a decree today to block arms supplies to terrorists in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The decree came in the wake of a surprise offensive by Chechen
rebels against the positions of the Russian troops in Grozny,
capital of the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In the decree, Yeltsin ordered the establishment of an organ to
coordinate efforts between various institutions in the fight
against terrorism, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As large amounts of weapons went to the rebel forces in Russia,
Yeltsin ordered the country's intelligence agencies to find out
and destroy overseas weapons supply channels to the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered an investigation of the production and
inventories of Russia's weapons factories and demanded that
government ministries and departments formulate an anti-terrorism
bill within two months and submit it to the State Duma, or lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting continued Thursday between the rebels and
Russian troops and pro-Moscow Chechen policemen in almost all
parts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
At least 70 Russian servicemen were killed, more than 130
wounded and 40 missing, reports from Grozny said. More than 130
Chechen militants were killed and 200 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Russian tanks have reportedly been moved into Grozny's downtown
area, and reinforcements were rushed to besieged Russian positions.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have reportedly taken 84 civilian workers hostage
and kidnapped a number of Russians working in the city.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Salman Raduyev, who led
hostage-taking in Kizlyar and Pervomaiskoye in January, died of
head and chest wounds in a hospital Wednesday. Raduyev, son-in-law
of Chechen rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, was wounded in internal
rifts, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Ten Proposals Put Forward to Bridge Regional Disparity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The concept of overemphasis on new
construction projects to the neglect of economic efficiency should
be put to an end in Central and western parts of China and
attention should be geared up to market demands in production,
said a senior official here today.
</P>
<P>
On bridging the gap between the coastal areas and the central
and western regions, Yang Rudai, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) warned that the average income gap between the
east and the midwestern regions had widened by three times from
the 214 yuan in 1978 to 724 yuan in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, a farmer could earn 3,480 yuan in Shanghai while
the average annual for a farmer's income was 724 yuan in northwest
China's Gansu Province in 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's regional disparity is widening while the number of
total poverty-stricken population is decreasing. The issue must
draw our attention," Yang said in the second plenary meeting of
the Fourth Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Other nine proposals Yang set forth include:
</P>
<P>
-- correctly handling the relationships between the interests
of the central authorities and local governments in which the
state government should treat the key investment projects similar
to poverty-relief ones;
</P>
<P>
-- correctly coping with the relationship between economic
returns and comprehensive efficiency and short and long-term
efficiency;
</P>
<P>
-- granting more preferential treatment to domestic and
overseas investment that is being poured into the central and
western regions;
</P>
<P>
-- supporting agriculture, animal husbandry production in the
central and western areas and helping build a number of large
projects with overall significance that involve water conservancy,
water and soil preservation in the western provinces;
</P>
<P>
-- designating an inter-provincial cooperation zone by the five
southwestern provinces and autonomous regions as the country's
pilot zone in regional economic cooperation;
</P>
<P>
-- establishing a special leading body by the central
government to coordinate and concentrate on the construction
project in the western regions and;
</P>
<P>
-- going ahead with the effort by the relevant government
departments to map out relevant policies and measures and take
prompt actions to bridge the gap in regional economic development.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Two small planes collided in a
fireball just off the coast in southern U.S., killing at least one
person.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Flagler Beach, Florida, said the planes exploded
in the collision and plunged into the choppy seas about a mile
offshore.
</P>
<P>
The body of one man was found and four or five others were
reportedly missing in the collision.
</P>
<P>
"Both planes sunk," said Coast Guard Lt. George Eldredge.
"There was some debris in the water, but there's nothing there
now."
</P>
<P>
Five helicopters, a Navy airplane and several boats scoured the
area for hours in the afternoon. But the search was suspended due
to the high waves and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were expected to resume their search for possible
survivors at daybreak, said Flagler County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
One of the planes involved in the collision was a single-engine
Piper Cherokee carrying four people. The other plane was believed
to be carrying one or two people.

<HEADLINE> Advisor on Mainland-Hong Kong Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland and Hong
Kong can cooperate in developing the country's underdeveloped
regions as well as in a wide range of other fileds, a member of
China's top advisory body from Hong Kong said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu  -kuang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's political Consultative Conference, told a plenary meeting
of the advisory body that foreign investors do not know much about
the central and western parts of China and therefore hesitate
about investing there.
</P>
<P>
"Businesses and businesspeople from Hong Kong can play as
intermediaries for foreign investors," Hu said, suggesting that
the Chinese government provide more attractive policies for
investment there.
</P>
<P>
Hu also said mainland businesses can raise funds at the Hong
Kong financial market at a fairly low cost and within a relatively
short time and China's financial sector can borrow experience from
its Hong Kong counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong entrepreneurs and trade officials can help promote
the mainland's foreign trade by providing consultancy for mainland
businesses and financial institutions, Hu said, adding that a boom
in the construction of transportation facilities in Hong Kong has
consolidated its role as a gateway for goods to and from China.
</P>
<P>
"Mainland businesses, especially those in the southern
provinces, should take the advantage of Hong Kong in expanding
foreign trade," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's experience in developing the property
industry is also useful for the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Professionals in Hong Kong, a center for cultural
exchanges between the east and west, can be a "catalyst" for
cooperation between China and the rest of the world, Hu noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Settle Country Music Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Canada
have settled a longstanding disputes over country music broadcasts
as the broadcasting services from the two nations have agreed to
create a joint venture in Canada, U.S. officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S.-owned Country Music Television
(CMT) and Canada's New Country Network will become a single
network named Country Music Television-Canada.
</P>
<P>
The deal gives U.S. Group W Satellite Communications unit and
Gaylord Entertainment, owner of the CMT, 20 percent of the
Canadian country broadcast network with an option to buy 13
percent more when Canadian law allows it, a spokesman for the
Group W Satellite Communications said.
</P>
<P>
The accord defused a potential trade war between Washington
and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade Representative Mickey Kantor had been preparing to
impose trade sanctions to retaliate for a Canadian government
decision to stop CMT's broadcast services in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government took the decision after the similar
Canadian service, New Country Network, was launched at the end of
1994.
</P>
<P>
Canadian law restricts wholly-owned foreign companies from
competing with Canadian companies in cultural industries.
</P>
<P>
But the Group W Satellite Communication complained to the U.S.
Trade representative's Office, describing the Canadian government's
decision as a trade protection.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after months of tough negotiations
between the U.S. and Canadian companies, according to local news
reports.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Cracks Down on Black Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government has
decided to crack down hard on the black economy and economic
crime, Prime Minister Horn Gyula told the National Assembly today.
</P>
<P>
Horn said that measures to be taken against the black economy
include banning government officials from doing business; setting
up a central investigation agency and a court to deal with major
economic cases, and strengthening supervision in government
ministries.
</P>
<P>
The black economy has grown more and more serious in recent
years and accounted for 30 percent of Hungary's GNP in 1995. A
survey showed that one fourth of the annual expenditures of
Hungarian households go to the black economy, which means a loss
of 100 billion forints (about 700 million U.S. dollars) in tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Economic crime has also increased dramatically with the growth
of the black economy, which is gradually being taken over by
organized crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The Horn administration has taken a series of measures to crack
down on the black economy since 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong member of China's top
advisory body today proposed the establishment of a special office
to take charge of development in the country's central and western
regions.
</P>
<P>
Gao Jingde, a Hong Kong entrepreneur and a senior advisor to
the State Bureau of Land Administration, said the government's
development program for the country in the next 15 years attaches
more importance to development in the central and western regions,
and sets forth a series of policies and measures.
</P>
<P>
"We need to have a special office that will study issues
relating to development in those regions, execute these polices
and measures, and coordinate the resolution of problems that come
up in the process of development there," he said.
</P>
<P>
The policies and measures in the government plan include
increased prospecting in the regions, preferential treatment in
the arrangement of projects for resources development, and
improvement of economic ties and cooperation between the east and
the central/western parts.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that some special zones be set up in the
regions for eligibility to enjoy favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
He cited Shaanxi Province. "With its considerable strength in
science and technology, a special zone can be established there to
develop new and high-tech industries," he said.

PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette left here today for a visit to Israel and the Palestinian

peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, De Charette is expected to meet Israeli Prime

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Warned of Terrorist Attacks Against Jewish Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay is taking precautions
to prevent possible terrorist attacks against Jewish targets in
the country, a source close to the Uruguayan Interior Ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
Police patrols of buildings owned by the Jewish community have
been stepped up and border controls are being tightened, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The preventive measures were taken on February 22 after Israel
warned that extremist groups were planning attacks against Jewish
targets in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The National Information and Intelligence Directorate has
reinforced security at 52 Jewish sites, especially the Israeli
Embassy and the Jewish cemetery of La Paz.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has ordered more stringent border controls
in coordination with the Customs and Migration authorities.
</P>
<P>
A bomb blast killed 100 people at the headquarters of the
Israelite Mutualist Union in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 18,
1994.
</P>
<P>
The recent wave of terrorist attacks in Israel has been
denounced by the Jewish community and Islamic organizations in
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic organization Musulmanes del Uruguay condemned on
Thursday the terrorist attacks, saying in a communique that "the
death of innocent people cannot be justified in any way".
</P>
<P>
The Israelite Central Committee of Uruguay has called for a
demonstration to protest the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Bomb attacks by the extremist Palestinian Hamas group in Israel
since February 25 have left at least 57 people dead and 100
injured.

BUENOS AIRES, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Argentina today advised its
fishermen to refuse to pay the toll imposed by Britain in waters
near the Georgia Islands in the south Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Carlos Corach told Thursday's cabinet meeting
that the government would not prohibit Argentinian fishermen from
fishing in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The decision will be taken by private enterprises," said
Corach.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Foreign Minister Guido di Tella as saying that every
possible step was being taken to resolve the dispute, which arose
out of Britain's unilateral decision to charge a toll in the south
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
But the minister dismissed the possibility that the dispute
would cause a rupture in diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain fought a war in 1982 over the sovereignty
of the Malvinas Islands (known as the Falkland Islands in Britain).

<HEADLINE> Brazil, U.S. to Discuss Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is soon to host another
round of negotiations to discuss its growing trade deficit with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia is due to
meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on March 19 when the
talks start here.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia is expected to reiterate Brazil's hope that the
United States lowers trade barriers to Brazilian products.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has been in the red in its trade with the United States
for the past decade. It registered a 1.6-billion-U.S.-dollar
trade deficit in 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, Brazilian exports to the United States
have grown only 17 percent whereas imports from the U.S. have
increased 117 percent.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian officials said the most competitive Brazilian
products, such as steel sheets, orange juice and footwear, are
those which encounter the highest tariffs in the United states.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian gasoline is barred from entering the United States
for alleged environmental protection reasons.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia and Kantor reported on the status of bilateral trade
to the Brazilian and U.S. presidents last November and the issue
was discussed on February 29 when U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher visited Brazil.
</P>
<P>
But Christopher said that Brazil imposes a customs tariff of
between 16 and 25 percent on U.S. products which also a
constitutes a trade barrier. He said that only a 3-percent tariff
is levied on Brazilian products entering the United States.

SANTIAGO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chile achieved some success this
summer in its fight against drugs when it confiscated 119.353 tons
of marihuana, a 28 percent increase over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Major Samuel Cabezas, chief of operations of the OS-7 of the
Carabineros (uniformed police) of Chile, said today during a

Cabezas said that 300 people were involved in the operation

January, and February. two helicopters, 40 land vehicles
and 24 drug-sniffing dogs were used in the anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said that until now this year, the confiscation of cocaine
chlorhyde had amounted to 49 kilograms, a 49 percent increase over
the same period of last year, while 167 kilograms of cocaine base
paste had been confiscated, which means a 29 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Rich Sylvite Resources Found in Lop Nur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of millions of tons
of a rich salt-like mineral in a Chinese wilderness could pave the
way for the development of new industry.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists have found rich sylvite resources in Lop
Nur, a huge stretch of wildness in the eastern part of the Tarim
Basin, in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yanliang, a senior engineer with the Xinjiang Bureau of
Geology and Mineral Resources, said their investigations have led
to the discovery of 60 million tons of sylvite in an area of 1,400
square km in the northern part of Lop Nur.
</P>
<P>
Considering that the prospected area accounts for only one
seventh of the whole wildness, the actual reserve might be much
more than the amount already discovered, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang says that until the late 1950s there was a water area of
3,000 square km in Lop Nur. The water area started to shrink after
that, as the flow of the Tarim River emptying into the Lop Nur
decreased. By 1974, the water had completely dried up and the area
became a piece of lifeless wildness, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of rich sylvite resources in Lop Nur provides
bright prospects for the development of fertilizer and other
chemical industries in Xinjiang, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> China To Lead World Air Travel Growth: Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China will have the world's
fastest rate of air travel growth, an average of 11.5 percent a
year over the next two decades, according to the 1996 Current
Market Outlook published by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The Revenue Passenger Miles (RPMs)-- a measurement of air
traffic market -- were recorded 32.821 billions in China last
year, says the Outlook. The figure will have doubled by the year
2000 to 71.657 billions; and it is expected to hit 291.925
billions in 2015.
</P>
<P>
In its 20-year forecast for the airlines and commercial
airplane industry around the world, Boeing says that China's
domestic market will be among the world's largest for single-aisle
aircraft, such as the Boeing 757 and 737 or smaller.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region as a whole will receive some 35 percent
of the world's aircraft deliveries, valued at about 385 billion US
dollars. Air passenger traffic in the region is expected to grow
at 7.1 percent annually, two percentage points higher than the
average throughout the world, the Outlook predicts.
</P>
<P>
The global airlines are expected to add 15,900 planes to their
fleets over the next 20 years to meet the fast growth and replace
aging ones. The recruits will be worth more than 1.2 trillion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane manufacturer,
captured almost 70 percent of the new orders for commercial jet
planes in 1995 in terms of value.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Anti-Cuba Law Can Not Defeat Cuba, Says Cuban Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The passing of the Helms-Burton act
that enhances the United States economic embargo against Cuba in
no way will bend the island into submission, nor will destroy the
revolution, or diminish the forecastings of development of the
Cuban economy, a Cuban Foreign Ministry department official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Marianela Ferriol, director of the Cuban Foreign Ministry
Department of Information, told a press conference thursday at the
International Press Center that the passing of the Helms-Burton
law is an absurd, because it violates international law.
</P>
<P>
She said despite the blockade and its intensification, the
process of economic transformation continues, and that Cuban
guarantees stability and profits to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, she said, that law does not scare Cubans, who have
lived all their lives or grew up under the threats and aggressions
of the United States, and the enemies of Cuba will not achieve
their purposes.
</P>
<P>
The United States has adopted new economic sanctions against
Cuba following an incident occurred on February 24, in which two
light planes carrying Cuban exiles taking off from U.S. territory
were shut downed by Cuban Air Force. Havana said the two planes
had violated the air space of the island country.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures being considered by Cuba to prevent the
incident is to bar U.S. aircraft from using air corridors that go
through Cuban territory, she added.
</P>
<P>
Ferriol said Washington was left isolated in the United Nations
Organization General Assembly and in the meeting of the Civil
Aviation International Organization (OACI) and also failed in its
attempt to condemn Cuba, thanks to the ample support of the
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Gangs up with Gas Attack Plotter: Signed Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1957, a group known as the "four rivers and six mountains"
raised substantial funding to commission a golden throne for
Dalai. Numerous people cautioned the Dalai that the group was
reactionary and their seemingly good deed was nothing more than a
political plot.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai responded by calling it an important religious
activity which should not be refused. A grand ceremony was held in
the accept Palace so he could accept the gift from the "four
rivers and six mountains," a group composed of people from other
Tibetan-inhabited areas. Shortly thereafter, the reactionary group
incited an armed revolt and referred to themselves as "forces
defending religion."
</P>
<P>
In March 1959, the reactionary group comprising members of the
higher echelon in Tibet staged an armed rebellion in Lhasa, with
the "four rivers and six mountains" serving as the vanguard. The
Dalai blessed the rebels by touching their foreheads and proceeded
to order the three major monasteries in Tibet to form what he
termed "a yellow army." He presented amulets to the rebel force
and sent them into a brutal battle.
</P>
<P>
The armed rebellion was quelled, and the Dalai Lama fled abroad
to continue his political activities under the banner of Tibetan
Buddhism. The Dalai has consistently trumpeted "Tibetan history"
in Buddhist lectures, consistently refuting history and the fact
that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Enen though the work regarding locating the reincarnated soul
boy of the 10th Panchen Lama was proceeding smoothly, the Dalai
Lama, who was himself installed at the approval of the Central
Government, announced that a Tibetan boy was the reincarnated soul
boy of the Panchen Lama. The actual goal of the announcement,
which came from the Dalai's headquarters in India, was to
undermine the ongoing effort in total disregard of historical
precedence and religious rites.
</P>
<P>
Asahara said in his book Supreme Guidance that the Dalai wanted
him to "conduct Buddhist reform in Japan."
</P>
<P>
The large contingent of Buddhist monks in Japan should have the
final say in whether or not to conduct Buddhist reform in their
country. The Dalai thus undermined traditional ties between
Chinese and Japanese Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Mahayana Buddhism spread to Japan from China in
the seventh century is well established, and Buddhist sects in the
two countries have since established an excellent relationship.
Buddhist circles in the two countries have worked diligently to
expand ties since the founding of new China in 1949. Therefore, it
will be impossible for the Dalai to turn the tide by making use of
Shoko Asahara and his criminal sect, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Gangs up with Gas Attack Plotter: Signed Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Shoko Asahara, the "venerated
master" of the Aum Shinrikyo Sect, admitted responsibility for the
shocking poison gas attack in Tokyo's subways in last March 1995.
Nonetheless, the Dalai Lama considers him a friend, a signed
article in the latest issue of "China Tibet" magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"Exposure of the crimes of Shoko Asahara and his sect has not
in any way changed Dalai's attitude towards Asahara," the article
in the bi-monthly magazine quoted Dalai's private secretary as
saying.
</P>
<P>
With reference to some facts carried in the September 18 issue
of the German weekly Focus, the article noted that the Dalai Lama
has met Shoko Asahara on five occasions since their first meeting
in India in 1987. The former signed two letters of recommendation
and endorsement for the latter.
</P>
<P>
On May 26, 1989, the Dalai Lama, a man who ironically claims to
be a "human rights" fighter, released a document claiming that Aum
Sect, under the leadership of Shoko Asahara, propagates Mahayana
Buddhism with a goal of using religious and social activities to
gain public attention.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai's Religious and Cultural Affairs Commission spoke
highly of Shoko Asahara's religious and social activities, saying
that he is "a very capable religious teacher" and "an experienced
worker... who attempts to encourage the public to pursue good."
</P>
<P>
The Dalai felt the Aum Shinrikyo Sect had established "goals
which should be highly valued" and, therefore, requested that the
organization receive a tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
The request was granted, thereby making it possible for Shoko
Asahara to achieve his goals in only nine months, which he failed
to achieve the same for years. The exemption also provided the
sect with enough funding to produce deadly gas, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of recommendation dated May 26, 1989, the Dalai
expressed his sincere gratitude for Shoko Asahara's generous
donation to what he termed "our Buddhist collective in exile,
especially student monks who recently arrived from Tibet."
</P>
<P>
In his Supreme Guidance, Shoko Asahara revealed that "the Dalai
guided me to the tradition of Mahayana, and entrusted me to carry
out Buddhist reform in Japan."
</P>
<P>
Based on these facts, Focus reached the conclusion that without
the support of the Dalai Lama it would have been impossible for
Shoko Asahara to gain status as a cult leader within a short
period of several years, especially when considering his previous
background as a quack.
</P>
<P>
Dalai Lama is widely recognized as a political exile who works
to split the motherland under the cloak of religion.

PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Chess Federation
(FIDE), governing body of world chess, announced in Paris on
Thursday that the next world chess championship would be held in
Baghdad, Iraq, in June.
</P>
<P>
Kirsan Ilumjinov, FIDE's Russian president, told a news
conference the championship between Anatoly Karpov of Russia and
Russian-born American Gata Kamsky would begin on June 1 with prize
money of two million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ilumjunov added that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would
preside over the opening.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the sanctions (by U.N.) are economic, while culture
and sport are not involved." Ilumjinov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the venue had been changed from Montreal because
Canada had failed to give concrete commitments.
</P>
<P>
Ilumjinov said Karpov and Kamsky had agreed to donate jointly
500,000 U.S. dollars of their winnings to UNICEF to benefit Iraqi
children and other humanitarian causes.

<HEADLINE> UN Spokeswoman Says Most Serbs Flee Serb Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel
said today that the majority of the Serb population in the
Sarajevo suburb of Hadzici had left and that several hundred
Croats and Muslims had returned to the suburb.
</P>
<P>
Manuel told a press conference that Muslim-Croat Federation
police would enter the Sarajevo Serb suburb of Ilidza on March 12
and Novo Sarajevo and Grbavica suburbs on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord, five Serb-held suburbs will be handed
over to the Muslim-Croat federation control by March 19 to make
the city a united and multi-ethnic capital. The first suburb was
officially taken control by the Muslim-Croat federation police on
February 23.
</P>
<P>
Fearing possible reprisals, tens of thousands of Serbs have
fled the affected Sarajevo districts. The Bosnian Serb news agency
SRNA said more than 90 percent of the Serbs have left the three
Suburbs already under federal police control. Many of them have
even dug up the coffins of their relatives and burned their houses
before leaving.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims and Croats in Bosnia formed the federation in March
1994 at the U.S. initiative after one-year fighting against each
other.
</P>
<P>
The federal police entering Hadzici Wednesday comprise 50
Muslims, 15 Serbs and five Croats, Manuel said, adding that Croats
were dissatisfied with its composition although it reflects the
pre-war ratio of the three peoples living in the suburb.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen unauthorized Croat policemen entered Hadzici Tuesday
evening but were forced to withdraw the next morning after the
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) troops were called to intervene.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has also deployed its forces in Hadzici to monitor the
activity of the federal police in the suburb, she said.
</P>
<P>
Manuel expressed the hope that cooperation between the IFOR and
the U.N. would be better in the future as the NATO council decided
Wednesday to expand the prerogatives of its troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
If IFOR troops have the time and opportunity, they can help
search for mass graves, detain war criminals and repatriate
refugees, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR mission was originally restricted to the military
aspect of the peace accord, such as separating the warring parties
and patrolling in the separation zones to stop the fighting in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Britain Likely to Hold Referendum on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has given his firmest indication that the British government would
hold a national referendum on whether to join the single European
currency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the question time of parliament earlier today,
Major said, "I have made it clear on previous occasions that a
referendum on joining a single currency could be a necessary
step."
</P>
<P>
"I still believe that it might be the right course and the
government is considering the circumstances in which a referendum
might or might not be appropriate," he said. "We will tell the
House of Commons of our conclusions as soon as we have reached
them."
</P>
<P>
The above statement is a clear indication that Major is quickly
drifting away from his previous position.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has repeatedly said that a decision on a
possible referendum need not be taken until the cabinet reached
agreement on the crucial issue.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two prominent figures of the cabinet,
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, are striving to block such a referendum.
</P>
<P>
British officials said that Heseltine and Clarke earlier this
week jointly rejected an attempt by Conservative Party Chairman
Brian Mawhinney to forge a consensus among senior government
ministers that the government should commit itself to a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts predict that the ruling Conservative Party is
heading for another crisis of internal upheaval as Major has
clearly indicated a decision would be made in "weeks not months."

<HEADLINE> Youth Murderers in U.S. Triple in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (xinhua) -- The number of juvenile
murderers in the United States tripled between 1984 and 1994, and
arrests of juveniles for violent crimes increased 50 percent, said
a Justice Department report released today.
</P>
<P>
Juvenile murderers using guns quadrupled, while juveniles using
other weapons to kill remained largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno announced the report just prior to
the White House Leadership Conference on Youth Drug Use and
Violence in Greenbelt, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that there were more than 150,000
arrests of juveniles for violent crimes in 1994, a record. Violent
crimes include murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated
assault.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one in five arrests for violent crime in 1994 was of a
juvenile.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, those arrested for violent crime
still constituted less than 5 percent of all juveniles.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide sample of 6th through 12th graders shows 35
percent reported gangs in their schools, while more than 40
percent reported weapons in their schools, according to the
report.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
considering attending an anti-terrorism summit meeting next week
in Cairo, Egypt, a U.S. government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is giving serious thought to attending the gathering,
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the summit today when meeting with Jordan's King
Hussein, Clinton told reporters, "We haven't ruled anything out.
We're working on the things that we ought to do. We'll have some
decisions in the next couple of days about where we go from here."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher also is expected to
attend the summit which will be held Wednesday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Also asked about the summit, State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told today's news briefing, "There are many options
available to us that of course we would consider serious options."
</P>
<P>
"In addition to providing Israel with specific equipment to
combat terrorism as we have done over the last two days, we want
to launch an international effort to support Israel in the fight
against terrorism," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We will consider options that make sense towards that
objective," the spokesman stressed.

<HEADLINE> US House Approves Federal Borrowing Authority Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S House extended today
the federal borrowing authority to temporarily avoid a federal
default and was debating another bill financing agencies through
the year.
</P>
<P>
The House voted with 362-51 to approve the boost of the debt
ceiling for the U.S. government. Without the extension, the
government's debt ceiling could be breached on March 15 and
another partly government shutdown would probably occur.
</P>
<P>
The measure now moves to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
For months, Republicans in the U.S. Congress followed a
strategy in which the threat of a shutdown of the Federal
government put pressure on President Clinton to accept their
balanced budget plan. The strategy has resulted in two government
shutdowns totaling 27 days.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are at present seeking the two-week extension to
decide what pieces of their budget-cutting agenda -- perhaps
changes in Medicaid and welfare -- to put on a longer-term
debt-ceiling extension that President Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
The House was also debating a bill to finance the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development and dozens of other agencies whose fiscal
1996 budgets remain mired in partisan battles.
</P>
<P>
With the temporary spending authority for these agencies
expiring on March 15, White House budget chief Alice Rivlin said
Clinton would veto the legislation which lacks sufficient funds
for education, job training, the environment and technological
research.
</P>
<P>
But she said in a letter to congressional leaders earlier, "We
have a responsibility to the citizens of this country to act
together to resolve our differences."
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 13 appropriations bills for fiscal 1996, which
began on October 1, 1995, have been signed by Clinton and became
law. But the departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and
Urban Development and other huge programs are still operating on
emergency spending legislation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Refutes US Government Report on Human Rights (Part two) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Dalloul warned the United States
"not to indulge itself in the subjects which it has nothing to do
with, as if it wants to interfere in the Lebanese affairs and to
instigate the Lebanese citizens to stand against their
government."
</P>
<P>
On the presence of Syrian forces in Lebanon, which was slashed
by the U.S. State Department report, Dalloul said that the Syrian
military presence in Lebanon is "at the decision and request by
the Lebaneseh the American
government. We asked the Syrian forces to help the Lebanese
authority and the Lebanese military institution for a
redeployment of the Lebanese army and to help in all the security
affairs. This is of our rights and this is upon us and Syria, and
absolutely nobody is allowed to interfere in it."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Washington administration to examine why it had
not taken a crucial stand on the implementation of U.N. Security
Council resolution 425, which calls for Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"From here we become knowing why the negotiating process
stumbled, because the United States does not take a neutral
stand, and it is totally biased to Israel, to encourage it to
carry out agressions, to continue the occupation in south Lebanon
and western Bekaa."
</P>
<P>
"We stress that no one has the right to interfere in an
interior affair, and it is our right to give the priority to what
we see fitful," the Lebanese defense minister stated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department report accused the Lebanese
government of "failing" to make a significant effort to improve
the human rights situations in its country, and accused it of
"abusing the human rights" by detaining or imprisoning political
opponents at random.
</P>
<P>
It noted that there are non-Lebanese forces controlling most
of the Lebanese territories, including 30,000 Syrian troops,
regular Israeli forces and a Israeli-supported militia in south
Lebanon, as well as a number of armed Palestinian factions, all
of which impose a law in the areas they control.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese security forces, it added, include the Lebanese
army which can detain and put in prison those charged with an
accusation based on the "national security," and the internal
security forces which enforce the laws, carry out searches and
arrests and then refer the cases to the justice.
</P>
<P>
The report also said, "The government still bans the
demonstrations and impose a partial limit on the freedom of the
press," adding that there are credible reports that members of the
security forces use excessive power and torture some prisoners.

<HEADLINE> US GM Brake Plant Strike Affects 4 Assembly Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Four assembly plants of the
General Motors were forced to halt production as a strike at two
GM brake-making plants entered the third day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Four assembly plants of the U.S. number one car-making giant
employ more than 15,600 workers combined. Union officials said at
least one more plant could run out of parts today.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 members of United Auto Workers of the brake-making
plants in Dayton went on strike Tuesday over safety and job
security issues, including the production of parts by outside
plants or companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton plants supply brake parts and brake systems to
nearly all of the automaker's 29 assembly factories. A three-day
strike at the plants two years ago idled five GM assembly plants
in Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Jim Hagedon, GM spokesman in Dayton, said negotiators took
several hours Thursday to settle the disputed issues. Talks were
scheduled to resume today. But he declined to say whether there
had been any progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon today received an

participation in the anti-terrorism summit.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeepers Leaving Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. flag was lowered at the
U.N. headquarters in Kigali today to mark the end of the U.N.
peacekeeping mandate in Rwanda, a report from the Rwandan capital
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, U.N. special envoy to Rwanda
Shaharyar Khan said the U.N. forces of 1,230 peacekeepers and 146
military observers are leaving as their mandate ends at midnight
today.
</P>
<P>
They are leaving with a sense of success and dignity because
stability has returned to rwanda, said the envoy.
</P>
<P>
"As we lower the u.n. flag for the last time, i look back with
a sense of pride and fulfillment at the honorable end of the U.N.
mission in Rwanda," He said.
</P>
<P>
"The long road toward ethnic tolerance and national
reconciliation has begun and must be encouraged," Khan noted.
</P>
<P>
The last of the troops will be pulled out in six weeks, and
the U.N. assistance mission in Rwanda (unamir) would be replaced
by a political U.N. team of up to 12 officers, according to Khan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. troops failed to stop the genocide in 1994 of up to one
million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
As Khan spoke, several hundred Tutsi women, men and children
demonstrated outside the U.N. headquarters with banners accusing
U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali of doing nothing to save the
victims of the slaughters.
</P>
<P>
Claude Dusaidi, political adviser to Rwandan vice-president
and defense minister Paul Kagame, accused the U.N. presence in
Rwanda of being "very disappointing -- one of the most inglorious
peacekeeping operations," saying, "We're happy they're going."
</P>
<P>
But the withdrawal of the U.N. force will present Rwanda's
Tutsi-led 15,000-strong army with one of its greatest challenges:
how to win over the hearts and minds of majority Hutus who see
the U.N., and not the national army, as their defenders.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of the population in Rwanda are Hutus.
</P>
<P>
A total of 67,000 Hutus accused of genocide were put into
Rwanda's jails, where 2,300 have died so far in overcrowding, and
scores of others have died in revenge attacks by Tutsi
militiamen.

on," Meles said.

He further expressed hope that Israeli people would not be
deterred by the challenges to peace from pursuing the noble
objectives. enditem
